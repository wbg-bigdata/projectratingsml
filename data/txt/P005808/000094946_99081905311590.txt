PREFACE
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Taiz Flood Disaster
Prevention and Municipal Development Project in the Republic of Yemen, for which Credit
2160-YEM in the amount of SDR 11.70 million, or US$15.00 million equivalent, was approved
on June 14, 1990 and declared effective on May 14, 1991.
2.    The Credit was closed on December 31, 1998, the original closing date. As of April 29,
1999, an amount of SDRI 1.65 million, or US 16.4 million equivalent, had been fully disbursed.
3.    The ICR was prepared by Mr. Uruj Kirmani, Senior Implementation Specialist, Mrs.
Josephine Masanque, Financial Management Specialist (MNSID); and Mr. Srinivasa Rangachar,
Economist (Consultant). The ICR was reviewed by Mr. Jean-Claude Villiard, Sector Director,
Mr. Amir Al-Khafaji, Lead Operations Specialist; Ms. Sonia Hammam, Sector Leader, (MNSID);
Mr. Somin Mukherji, Operations Officer, and Mr. Ali Khamis, Project Officer (MNCYE); and
Ms. Tufan Kolan, Portfolio Manager (MNCMS). The mission is grateful to the officials of
Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning (MCHUP) and the Taiz Flood Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) for their assistance.
4.    Preparation of this ICR began during IDA's final supervision/completion mission in
December 1998. The report is based on material in the project file, discussions with the
Borrower, and project data provided by the PIU. Comments from the Government on the ICR are
contained in Annex C. Also attached is a Completion Report prepared by the Borrower (Annex
B).



IM1PLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TAIZ FLOOD DISASTER PREVENTION AND MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT
PROJECT
(Credit 2160-YEM)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Rapid urbanization of the city of Taiz began in the early 1970s as result of growing
inflow of workers' remittances, stagnation of agriculture, and growth of Government services.
Personal income and the urban population increased during the 1970s and 1980s, as did the
uncontrolled sprawl of informal (but fairly well built) housing in the urban areas. The demand
for municipal infrastructure grew as well. However, the provision of urban services lagged
despite the Government's efforts, particularly in Taiz, and the provision of municipal
infrastructure was hampered by recurrent floods in many parts of old Taiz. Addressing this
problem had become a major priority for the city by the late 1980s. Thus, the Government
requested the support of the International Development Association (IDA) in this effort.
Project Objectives
2.    The main objectives of the project were: (a) to provide flood control structures to protect
private and public buildings and infrastructure, and to minimize disruptions to the local economy
and reduce the risks to human life of flooding; (b) to implement a project cost recovery
mechanism at the municipal level and to promote implementation of a national municipal
resource mobilization policy; (c) to strengthen the urban management capabilities at the main
branch offices; and (d) to strengthen the Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning's
[(MCHUP) formerly the Ministry of Municipalities and Housing (MMH)] institutional capacity
to address urban problems more effectively.
3.    The total project costs were estimated at US$22.25 million, of which IDA was to finance
the foreign exchange component (US$15.00 million) and the Government all local costs
(US$7.25 million). No cofinancing was envisaged. The economic rate of return (ERR) was
estimated at 12 percent. At the time of appraisal, financial constraints at the country and local
level restricted the scope of the project to the most essential investments. Other possible works
were deferred until additional resources became available.
Implementation Experience and Results
4.    When the Credit closed, the principal objectives had been achieved. All major flood
control structures had been built. Some inner city roads were improved, and upstream slopes were
stabilized. Equipment to maintain the flood control structures and roads has been procured and is
being used effectively in the project area. The institutional effectiveness of MCHUP and its local
branch in Taiz has been strengthened through staff training in Yemen and abroad. The Project as



Implementation Completion Report                                                      ii
completed has provided a least-cost solution in terms of yielding maximum benefits and providing
adequate safeguards for the protection of both human life and property, improving environment,
diminishing health hazards, particularly in the rainy/flood seasons, and providing economic benefits
to the citizens of Taiz. The credit agreement was amended and the clauses relating to the cost
recovery and a national policy for resource mobilization were deleted, as this subject was being
addressed through macro-economic and fiscal reforms under the Economic Recovery Credit (Cr.
2840-YEM).
5.     A follow-on urban project is being prepared, as well as the feasibility study, designs, cost
estimates and tender documents that have been completed. GOY is seeking IDA's assistance for
the second project extending the recently completed Taiz Flood Prevention Phase I Project.
Although the formal action by the Government of Yemen (GOY) for implementing these reforms
is awaited, realizing the importance of cost recovery, the Governor of Taiz has taken the initiative
by imposing a surcharge on all household electricity bills. In September 1998, the GOY
established a "Cleaning Fund" to pay for the services of private contractors to be utilized for
maintaining flood channels.
6.     The actual costs of the project are US$26.3 million equivalent, exceeding appraisal
estimates by 17 percent. It is attributed to higher construction costs and changes in the scope of
work. The IDA credit is expected to be fully disbursed. Because of a more favorable SDRIIJS$
rate the Credit financed the equivalent of US$16.5 million, covering most of the foreign exchange
component of the project costs. The Government paid for most of the remaining costs. Japan and
Netherlands financed some technical assistance.
7.     About 21,000 households and 820 small businesses are benefiting from the project, three
to four times the number estimated at appraisal. In addition, environmental health, social and
economic benefits, not foreseen at appraisal are being derived by Taiz citizens after completion of
this project. The project already demonstrated its usefulness in late 1996 and 1997 when major
flood waters from heavy rains were safely channeled to an irrigation dam built under the Southern
Region Agriculture Project (Cr. 1772-YEM) and utilized for irrigation purpose.
Economic Rate of Return
8.     The most important benefit streams arise from: (i) a reduction in damage to private
property (94 percent of incremental benefits); (ii) a reduction in interruptions to road traffic,
electricity, telephone services and associated repair costs (4 percent of benefits); and (iii) an
increase in commercial activities due to improved flood protection in the project areas (2 percent
of the benefits).
9.     The re-estimated net present value of the project is US$ 31.4 million, and the economic
rate of return of the project is 26 percent, or over twice the return of 12 percent estimated in the
SAR. Principal reasons for the increased ERR are thought to result from two factors: (i) an
increase in the number of houses in the project area over that used in the SAR; and (ii) an
increase in the cost of houses used in the SAR.'/
10.     Principal assumptions used in the re-estimation of the ERR are: (i) that without the
project about 80 percent of the houses in the project area are affected by floods, and that the
' Very little information about the SAR ERR analysis was available for the preparation of the ICR. For
example, the number of houses in the project area used for purposes of the appraisal ERR estimate is not
known. Similarly, no details were available on what assumptions were used for housing costs in the SAR.



Implementation Completion Report                                                 iii
average annual damage is 15 percent of the house value; (ii) with the project, about 10 percent of
the houses are affected, and the average damage is estimated at 10 percent of the house value; (iii)
without the project a "severe flood" would take place once every five years destroying five small
bridges and 6 km of asphalt roads; (iv) actual investment costs were 20 percent higher than
estimated in the SAR; (v) maintenance costs for the removal of boulder and sediments from the
"traps" are estimated at 2 percent of investment costs per annum; and (vi) a 10 percent discount
rate is used in the NPV calculation.
11.   Avoided property damage, as a result of the project, accounts for the vast majority of the
benefit streams in the ERR analysis. Thus, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken to analyze the
impact of different housing damage estimates assumptions. It showed that, if the average damage
incurred without the project was only 10 percent of the house value (instead of 15 percent
assumed above), the ERR would still be 19 percent. However, below 6 percent, the rate of return
falls below 10 percent. On the other hand, if the damage was raised to 20 percent of the value, the
rate of return would increase to32 percent.
12.   Project implementation was at times delayed by factors beyond the control of MCHUP,
such as the unification of North and South Yemen in May 1990, the Gulf Crisis in 1990-1991,
and the Civil War in 1994. Overvalued exchange rates and high domestic inflation caused serious
shortages of local currency funds. Despite earlier delays in implementation, with the cooperation
of the Government in restructuring the project and the provision of adequate counterpart funds,
and close interaction with the Implementation Team of the Resident Mission the project was
completed within the agreed timeframe, and the original closing date was not extended. The
achievement of project objectives was facilitated by strong support from the Government, the
Governor of Taiz, and local residents, adequate institutional arrangements, and an effective
implementation unit, as well as close supervision and guidance from IDA staff. During
implementation the project was restructured without changing its basic concept. The Credit
Agreement was amended twice to adjust the disbursement schedule and to modify the cost
recovery covenant, which was being handled by the Government under a macroeconomic reform
program.
13.   The overall performances of IDA and the Borrower are rated satisfactory. Most Credit
covenants have been complied with. The cost recovery program needs to be followed up with the
Government and the Governor of Taiz, who is fully supportive of such programs. Audit reports
were submitted to IDA and were found to be of acceptable quality.
Summary of Findings and Key Lessons Learned
14.   Findings. The project achieved its principal objective of providing essential flood
protection to the city of Taiz, improving urban roads, and strengthening the institutional capacity
of MCHUP. Residents have participated and benefited from the project, which greatly improved
their neighborhoods and quality of life, reduced health hazards, and enabled them to pursue
economic activities that were earlier entirely disrupted during the flood season. The overall
benefits of the project are expected to be higher than estimated at appraisal.  Adequate
maintenance and a viable cost recovery program would ensure the long-term sustainability of
project benefits. The ERR has been re-estimated to be 26 percent, which exceeds the SAR
estimate of 12 percent.
15.   Future Operations: Under the reform program, the local branch of MCHUP is now
directly working under the Governor of Taiz. It will be given full responsibility for operation and
maintenance of the existing infrastructure, for staff training and community participation, and the



Implementation Completion Report                                                   iv
preparation of future development plans. To raise funds for current operations, a surcharge on
electricity bills will be imposed. A special "Cleaning Fund" established in September 1998 will
pay for the maintenance of floodwater channels. The Government has prepared Phase II Project
and has requested IDA's support to ensure sustainability of the benefits emerging from the
completed project.
16.   Key Lessons Learned. The following lessons can be drawn from the experience of this
project:
(a)    Good project preparation and design, as well as strong political and local support
for the project objectives are essential for the successful outcome of an operation.
(b)    Adequate provisions for maintenance, institutional strengthening, and a viable
cost recovery program help to ensure the long-term sustainability of project
benefits.
(c)    Overvalued exchange rates in an inflationary environment can cause serious
shortages of local currency funds, resulting in protracted implementation
problems.
(d)    IDA made a deliberate decision to continue to support this project despite
prolonged implementation delays in civil works. It was done in the large interest
of the country, which was passing through difficult phases after unification and
Civil War in 1994. This decision was later justified with the successful outcome.
(e)    The strengthening of the implementation team  in the Resident Mission
effectively contributed in the satisfactory completion of this project.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TAIZ FLOOD DISASTER PREVENTION
AND MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Credit 2160-YEM)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Introduction
1.    Rapid population growth in urban areas during the 1970s and 1980s stimulated private
housing development and created a strong demand for municipal infrastructure. In Taiz, one of
the country's major cities, the provision of municipal infrastructure was hampered by recurrent
floods. Addressing that problem therefore had become a major priority for the city by the late
1980s.
2.    IDA lending for urban development in Yemen started in 1974 with a water supply and
sewerage project in Sana'a (Credit 670-YAR). This was followed by an urban sector review,
which formed the basis for the Sana'a Urban Development Project (Credit 1202-YAR) approved
in January 1982. A Second Urban Development Project (Credit 1441-YAR) was approved in
February 1984. All three projects were completed and their stated objectives were largely
achieved (see Part II, Table 2).
B. Project Objectives and Design
3.    The project evaluated in this ICR was prepared by the Urban Development Project Unit
(UDPU) established under Credit 1202-YAR. Supporting consultants were financed from
resources of the Second Urban Development Project (Credit 1441-YAR). The principal
objectives of the project were to: (a) provide urgently needed flood control structures to
minimize physical damage and reduce the risks to human life of flooding; (b) strengthen the
institutional capacity of central and local administrations responsible for urban development; and
(c) initiate cost recovery mechanisms and promote a national municipal resource mobilization
policy.
4.    To achieve these objectives, the project included the following components:
(a)    construction of flood control structures protecting about 5,100 households and of
280 small businesses;
(b)   restoration of street pavement, terracing of unstable slopes, construction of
surface drainage and footpaths, and land acquisition;
(c)    purchase of maintenance equipment for roads and flood control structures;
(d)   institutional strengthening and staff training of the Ministry of Construction,
Housing and Urban Planning (MCHUP) and its main branch offices;



Implementation Completion Report                                                  2
(e)    preparation of a follow-on urban development project; and
(f)    promotion of project cost recovery and municipal resource mobilization policy.
5.    The total project costs were estimated to reach US$22.25 million (Table 8A), of which
IDA would finance the foreign exchange component (US$15.0 million) and the Government all
local costs (US$7.25 million). No cofinancing was envisaged. The main benefits envisaged from
the project would be: (a) protection of public and private properties against economic losses due
to flood damages; (b) reduce the risk of human life (several persons lost their life during flood
storms occurring 5 to 10 times annually lasting for several hours); (c) improve environment by
elimination of pollution caused by sediments and municipal refuse deposited by flood waters on
major street intersections; (d) strengthen the capacity and skills of the staff of Ministry of
Construction, Housing and Urban Planning (MCHUP) formerly Ministry of Municipal Housing
(MMH). The costs of such were estimated to average about US$2.7 million per annum. Other
important benefits, e.g., removal of traffic disruption during flood season, improved access roads
under this project, ensured uninterrupted access to houses, schools, mosques, and health centers,
etc., uninterrupted and enhanced commercial activities, expansion of business (over 1,100 street
vendors in the areas which was previously inaccessible due to the floods) were not quantified.
The ERR based on a project life of 45 years was estimated at 12 percent, which does not truly
reflect the economic benefits provided for the citizens of Taiz.
6.    At the time of appraisal, the project design represented the least-cost solution while
providing adequate safeguards for the protection of both human life and property. Financial
constraints at the country and local level restricted the scope of the project to the most essential
investments. Other possible works were deferred until additional resources became available.
Project structures were to be built in public rights-of-way. Only seven private homes located in
the project area were to be expropriated through purchase at market prices. In June 1990, when
the Board approved the project, final designs of the flood control works had been completed, and
drafts of the tender documents had been prepared.
7.    During implementation, the project was restructured, making modifications to the
original design and adding some components that had earlier been deferred to the next stage
(para. 20). These changes further strengthened the effectiveness of the project in diverting flash
floods and protecting property and people.
C. Achievement of Objectives
8.    In spite of several implementation delays, the project was completed within the original
closing date (December 31, 1998) of this Credit. All flood control structures had been completed.
Road's ]1ave been paved, easing traffic flows and access to health centers, schools and mosques.
Improvements were also made in the sewage system by provision of new sewerage lines along
the wadis. The issue of solid waste management, which was not addressed in the SAR, was taken
up. Improvements have been made in the solid waste management activities of Taiz office of
MCHUP. The improvements made in the roads network (e.g., new 5.4 Km asphalt roads, 3.2
stone pavements, new North-South asphalt road beside Wadi Seena to provide efficient route
through Taiz City), and easy road access to the households, provision of waste collectors at
appropriate places, have significantly contributed towards improving environment and reducing
health hazards. About 21,000 households and 820 small businesses benefit from the project,
three to four times the number estimated at the appraisal stage. The project demonstrated its



Implementation Completion Report                                                3
usefulness during seasonal rains in late 1996, 1997, and 1998, when major flood waters were
safely channeled to an irrigation dam built under the Southern Region Agriculture Development
Project (Cr. 1772-YAR) and there was no loss of life and properly and no disruption to the
activities of Taiz citizen in the area covered by this project. The equipment procured through
international bidding is being used effectively in the project area by the local office of MCHUP to
maintain the project structures.
9.    The institutional capacity of MCHUP staff has been strengthened through improvement
of skills and training in Yemen and abroad. The staff of MCHUP have prepared a follow-on
development project, as well as related feasibility study, designs, cost estimates. The bidding
documents for Phase II have been prepared. Local consultants are undertaking a supporting
socio-economic survey. The project is under consideration for future IDA supports.
10.   Environmental.
(a) Health Impact. This project has significantly improved the environment, first, by
eliminating the problems caused by sediments and municipal refuse deposited by
floodwaters on major street intersections. Prior to the project, the sewerage flowed with
the floodwaters and stagnated causing environmental and health hazards. The project has
also provided 100 percent protection against erosion, which was a major cause of damage
to the houses.
(b) Social Impact. The project has provided direct benefits to over 21,000 households as
compared with 5,134 households estimated at appraisal providing mitigation from the
flood damaged. In addition, the annual loss to the property (amounting to about US$3.0
million) have been mitigated. The regular loss of life to the people and the cattle has
been prevented. Significant reduction in the maintenance cost of public and private
property has resulted after completion of this project. The economic activity has spurred
with easier flow of traffic through the access roads built in this project (1,100 street
vendors and over 900 shops are doing business in the project area). The development of
vehicle parking area in the city center (over a box culvert built under this project) has
provided a great facility to the citizens. It can be concluded that the project has
significantly contributed in improving economic, environmental, health and social
benefits to the citizens of Taiz.
11.   Cost Recovery. As regards cost recovery, notwithstanding the fact that it was deleted
from the legal covenants, the IDA Resident Mission continued to pursue the dialogue with the
GOY and Governor of Taiz on the need of establishing a cost recovery plan for the infrastructure
investments. Both the Govermnent and the Governor appreciated its importance. The GOY
initiated a study "Social and Economic Study for the Identification of the Best Method of Cost
Recovery in Taiz." Separately, the Governor of Taiz has taken the initiative towards cost
recovery by imposing a "surcharge" on the electricity bills of all households in Taiz. However,
the institutional and legal arrangements for cost recovery in Taiz Governorate are awaiting formal
instructions by the GOY. In addition, GOY set up a "Cleaning Fund" in September 1998. The
proceeds from this fund would be utilized for maintaining the flood channels and other solid
waste management activities in Taiz. On a longer-term basis, GOY has plans to involve the
private sector in this area.
12.    Project Costs and Financing. The actual costs of the project have reached the equivalent
of US$26.3 million (Table 8A), about 17 percent higher than the appraisal estimate (US$22.5
million). Most of the project costs were paid for in local currency. The increased costs are



Implementation Completion Report                                                    4
attributed to the implementation delays (e.g., four major ICB contracts were completed 66 months
behind original SAR schedule), modifications in the scope of civil works, and higher cost of
construction material due to inflation, and severe decline in $/YR parity (e.g. $1 = YR 12 prior to
1994 Civil War and $1 = YR 160 after the war).
13.    The IDA Credit will be fully disbursed. Because of a more favorable SDR/IUS$ rate, the
Credit financed the equivalent of US$16.4 million (Table 8B). The Government paid for most of
the remaining costs. The municipality of Taiz and local residents also contributed to the project.
Japan and Netherlands financed some technical assistance.
14.   Economic Rate of Return. The SAR contained few details about how benefits were
calculated. Therefore, for the ICR the borrower provided supplemental data on the population
and the number of shops in the inner city. These data were complemented by a survey conducted
in 1998 (Social and Economic Study for the Identification of the Best Means for Cost Recovery
for Taiz Flood Disaster Prevention and Municipal Development Project Phase II), and by current
house construction cost estimates provided by IDA's Public Works Project Implementation Unit
in Sana'a.
15.   The economic analysis for the ICR uses a with and without project methodology. The
most important benefit streams arise from: (i) a reduction in damage to private property (94
percent of incremental benefits); (ii) a reduction in interruptions to road traffic, electricity,
telephone services and associated repair costs (4 percent of benefits); and (iii) an increase in
commercial activities due to improved flood protection in the project areas (2 percent of the
benefits). As in the SAR, additional benefits due to the saving of lives were not calculated,
thereby understating the project's overall benefits.
16.   The re-estimated net present value of the project is US$ 31.4 million, and the economic
rate of return of the project is 26 percent, or over twice the return of 12 percent estimated in the
SAR. Principal reasons for the increased ERR are thought to result from two factors: (i) an
increase in the number of houses in the project area over that used in the SAR; and (ii) an
increase in the cost of houses used in the SAR.2/ The population in the inner city of Taiz has
quadrupled from 5,000 to 21,000 since early 1990, which is a much faster rate of growth than
what was predicted at the time of appraisal. This increased is, in large part, a result of the
massive return of Yemeni migrant workers from the Gulf countries which could not have been
predicted when the project was prepared. The result is a substantial increase in the number of
houses in the project area versus what was likely to have been the estimate at appraisal. In
addition, the value of an average house in 1998 is estimated at about US$ 11,000, which is almost
certainly higher than the cost that would have been used in the SAR.3/
17.    Principal assumptions used in the re-estimation of the ERR are: (i) that without the
project about 80 percent of the houses in the project area are affected by floods, and that the
average annual damage is 15 percent of the house value; (ii) with the project, about 10 percent of
the houses are affected, and the average damage is estimated at 10 percent of the house value; (iii)
without the project a "severe flood" would take place once every five years destroying five small
bridges and 6 km of asphalt roads; (iv) actual investment costs were 20 percent higher than
2 Very little information about the SAR ERR analysis was available for the preparation of the ICR. For
example, the number of houses in the project area used for purposes of the appraisal ERR estimate is not
known. Similarly, no details were available on what assumptions were used for housing costs in the SAR.
3 Higher house costs are assumed because of: (i) larger houses to accommodate more population; and (ii)
the sharp devaluation of the RY from the mid- 1 990s to date.



Implementation Completion Report                                                5
estimated in the SAR; (v) maintenance costs for the removal of boulder and sediments from the
"traps" are estimated at 2 percent of investment costs per annum; and (vi) a 10 percent discount
rate is used in the NPV calculation.
18.   Avoided property damage, as a result of the project, accounts for the vast majority of the
benefit streatns in the ERR analysis. Thus, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken to analyze the
impact of different housing damage estimates assumptions. It showed that, if the average damage
incurred without the project was only 10 percent of the house value (instead of 15 percent
assumed above), the ERR would still be 19 percent. However, below 6 percent, the rate of return
falls below 10 percent. On the other hand, if the damage was raised to 20 percent of the value, the
rate of return would increase to32 percent.
D.    Project Implementation
19.   The project had a slow start. Although well prepared, it took almost one year from Board
approval to Credit effectiveness (Table 3). Two factors contributed to the delay: The unification
of North and South Yemen in May 1990, and the Gulf Crisis in late 1990 and early 1991. By
October 1991, however, the Borrower had awarded contracts for the major elements of flood
control, and bids for the maintenance equipment had been received. A few months later, the main
contractor had started work; a supplier for the equipment had been selected; a construction
advisor and financial analyst had been appointed; the Borrower had drafted legislation to improve
cost recovery; and consultants had been selected to prepare the follow-on project.
20.   But in the following year, new problems arose. Opposition to the relocation of people
envisaged under the project led to riots during which all records of MCHUP's local office in Taiz
were burned. To restore calm, the project design was modified so as to minimize any relocation.
More importantly, high domestic inflation made it increasingly difficult for the Borrower to
provide local counterpart funds, slowing down work at the construction site. Growing political
tensions between the northern and southern parts of the country caused administrative delays and
eventually led to the Civil War (May/June 1994) that brought implementation to a complete halt.
By that time the original contract period had expired with only about half of the civil works
completed. All maintenance equipment, on the other hand, had been delivered and was safely
stored in the project area.
21.   To overcome these bottlenecks and facilitate project completion, IDA and the Borrower
agreed to restructure the project. The changes included:
(a) Modifications in the design of major civil works, resulting in cost saving that were
utilized to finance part of the remaining works as well as some elements that had been
deferred to the follow-on project.
(b) The city government rehabilitated and resurfaced roads draining into the main flood
diversion channel.
(c) Local residents support in stabilizing upstream slopes.
(d) Japan and Netherlands financed some technical assistance (the latter paid for an advisor
for urban development and housing policies).
22.   The principal contractor (a public sector company based in Aden), who had lost much of
his equipment during the hostilities resumed work in late 1994. But progress was slow mainly



Implementation Completion Report                                                  6
due to a continuous shortage of local counterpart funds, as the Government could not release
these funds due to severe economic difficulties faced in the period following the Civil War. The
severe decline in $/YR, parity and consequent cost escalation further exacerbated issues relating
to the timely availability of adequate counterpart funds. Moreover, project management was
weakened as new staff unfamiliar with the project became involved in the implementation
process. Notwithstanding, these difficulties some project work was continued. In this respect,
the support by the citizens of flood affected area to the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was
commendable. For example, they assisted PIU in the tasks related to the stabilization of the
upstream slopes; and in spite of disruption in their daily activities fully cooperated with the PIU
staff.
23.   Amendments to the Credit Agreement. The credit agreement was amended to reflect
changes in the project scope. Further, the covenants relating to the introduction of a national
municipal resource mobilization policy and implementation of the project cost recovery were
deleted.
24.   The rational for deletion of the above covenants was the unstable economic situation in
the country, particularly after the Civil War in 1994, when physical itnplementation of all IDA-
financed projects had come to a grinding halt, due to various institutional and economic reasons.
(In that period, all contractors with contracts in YR refused to honor these contracts, and later,
IDA's intervention through Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) in June 1995 led to
the resolution of these issues.) It was agreed between IDA and GOY that such issues would be
addressed under the ongoing macroeconomic reform program being discussed with IDA.
25.   The pace of project implementation accelerated in 1996 after active follow-up by the
Resident staff and the support provided by the Minister in releasing additional counterpart funds.
By October 31, 1996 all major floor protection works had been completed, safely diverting
floodwaters in the rainy season. Thereafter, the implementation proceeded efficiently. The PIU
team worked very diligently to complete complex tasks as scheduled.
E. Project Sustainability
26.    The project is generating larger benefits than originally expected at appraisal. These
benefits are likely to be sustained over the longer term, provided that the flood control structures
are maintained by MCHUP and its local branch using equipment procured under the project.
(a) The cost recovery program is formally in effect to generate the financial means required
for both maintenance and capital expenditures.
(b) Phase II of the project is taken in hand as soon as possible. The existing project was
appraised in 1990, and the project was divided in two phases due to financial constraints.
Phase I of this project as completed, addressed the most critical aspects of the flood
prevention and mitigation in the city area of Taiz. However, in order to ensure
sustainability of Phase I component, it is essential that Phase II of this project, which
deals with upper section of the wadis to control flood hazards, and extension work in the
wadis (not completed in Phase I) is completed. In the absence of Phase II, the boulders
and sediments during floods will effectively diminish the efficiency of the flood channels
completed in Phase I, and over a period of time, adversely affect the sustainability of the
investments already made.



Implementation Completion Report                                                  7
(c) Based on the actions being taken by GOY for the maintenance of the flood channels and
other facilities built under this Project, and the expectation of IDA financing Phase II of
this Project, the sustainability is ranked "likely'?.
F. Future Operations
27.   Under the reform program, the local branch of MCHUP is now directly working under
the Governor of Taiz. It will be given full responsibility for operation and maintenance of the
existing infrastructure, for staff training and community participation, and the preparation of
future development plans. To raise funds for current operations, a surcharge on electricity bills
will be imposed. A special "Cleaning Fund" established in September 1998 will pay for the
maintenance of floodwater channels. The Government has prepared Phase II Project and has
requested IDA's support to ensure sustainability of the benefits emerging from the completed
project.
G. IDA Performance
28.   IDA assisted the Government in preparing this project. However, it is not clear as to why
IDA team included the issue of "national resource mobilization policy" in the SAR, without
focussing on it in the project scope, and only provided for some technical assistance to the MMH.
Secondly, the inclusion of "municipal development" in the project's title without a distinct
component in the project could be questionable.
29.   During implementation, IDA supervised this project closely during the period March
1991 to November 1993. There was no supervision between November 1993 and May 1995
(Table 13), when implementation suffered adversely. After the GOY and IDA agreements during
Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) in June 1995, IDA strengthened its supervision
efforts by locating implementation staff at the Resident Mission, at Sana'a. Thereafter, IDA's
close cooperation with the government agencies, Governor of Taiz and the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) contributed in the timely resolution of major problems, e.g.,
counterpart funds availability and in spite of the earlier delays, resulted in successful completion
of this Project within the original closing date of the Credit.
H. Borrower Performance
30.   The project was strongly supported by both central and city governments, as well as the
people of Taiz. The responsible technical ministry (MCHUP) and its local branch were highly
motivated and cooperative. Much of the implementation delay was caused by political factors
beyond their control. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) performed well despite occasional
staff constraints. The staff of MCHP has developed its skills in the project management during
the execution of this project.
31.   Most Credit covenants have been complied with (Table 10). The PIU maintained
accurate records of project accounts that were audited by private auditors. The audit reports were
submitted to IDA, and were found to be of acceptable quality. The overall performance of the
Borrower was satisfactory (Table 1).

I. Assessment of Outcome
32.    The project achieved its principal objective of providing essential flood protection to the
city of Taiz. The physical structures built under the project proved their effectiveness in 1996
and 1997, when these structures saved human life, public infrastructure, and private property
from heavy floodwaters. Other benefits are road improvements that ease the flow of traffic and
facilitate access for waste collection units as well as benefit local traders. The institutional
effectiveness of MCHUP and its local branch in Taiz has been strengthened. Residents have
welcomed the project, which greatly improved their neighborhoods and mitigated health hazards,
as well as facilitated access from their homes to the main city areas.
33.   Benefits. Some of the significant benefits resulting from this project are illustrated as
under:
(a)  Environmental.  Disposal of floodwater and provision of waste storage and
removal facilities have minimized pollution and health hazards.
(b)  Urban. Constructions of stone pavements and side roads have provided access to
remote dwellings, and have contributed to the quality of life.
(c)  Economic.  By provision of additional roads along the wadis, the in city
communication has been improved and has contributed to increased economic
activities.
(d) Agriculture. The floodwater flows into an earth filled dam which channels the
water into the irrigation canals for increased water supply.
J. Key Lessons Learned
34.   The following lessons can be drawn from the experience of this project:
(a)  Good project preparation and design, as well as strong political and local support
for the project objectives are essential for the successful outcome of an operation.
(b)  Adequate provisions for maintenance, institutional strengthening, and a viable cost
recovery program help to ensure the long-term sustainability of project benefits.
(c)  Overvalued exchange rates in an inflationary environment can cause serious
shortages of local currency funds, resulting in protracted implementation problems.
(d)  IDA made a deliberate decision to continue to support this project despite
prolonged implementation delays in civil works. It was done in the larger interest
of the country, which was passing through difficult phases after unification and
Civil War in 1994. This decision was later justified with the satisfactory economic
progress being achieved in Yemen.
(e)  The strengthening of the implementation team in the Resident Mission effectively
contributed in the satisfactory completion of this project.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
TAIZ FLOOD DISASTER PREVENTION AND MUNICIPAL
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Credit 2160-YEM)
MISSION's MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING



Republic of Yemen
Taiz Flood Disaster Prevention and Municipal Development Project (Cr. 2160-YEM)
Aide-Memoire
November 29 to December 20, 1998
A. Introduction:
1.    An IDA mission comprising Messrs. Somin Mukherji , Uruj Kirmani, Ali Khamis, and Sergio
Calegari carried out the completion supervision of the above project during the period November 29 to
December 20, 1998. Messrs. Kirmani and Rangachar carried out the necessary preparatory work for the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR). The mission went for field visits to Taiz during this period
and reviewed the status of physical implementation of project works.
2.    The mission would like to thank the officials and staff of the Ministry of Planning and
Development (MOPD), the Ministry of Construction, Housing & Urban Planning (MCHUP) and the
project authorities for all the courtesies and assistance extended to the mnission. This aide-memoire
summarizes the mission's findings and the agreements reached with the MCHUP regarding the above
project and is subject to IDA management's review and concurrence.
B. Backeround:
3.    A Credit of SDR  11.7 million (US$ 15.0 million equivalent) was approved by the IDA on
November 16, 1990 and became effective on May 14, 1991. This project was designed to provide the
city of Taiz with essential flood control works, to implement a cost recovery mechanism at the municipal
level, to promote implementation of a national municipal resource mobilization policy, to strengthen the
urban management capabilities, and to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Municipality and
Housing ( now MCHUP) to address effectively the urban problems. The Credit is scheduled to close as
planned on December 31, 1998.
C. Summary of Proiect Objectives:
4.a.   To provide urgently needed flood control works to protect property and minimize disruptions to
local economy and reduce risks to human life.
4.b.   To provide institutional strengthening to the MCHUP
D. Status of Proiect Implementation:
5.     Overall, implementation of the physical works has been satisfactory and the mission wishes
compliment the implementing agency (MCHUP) and the project management unit (PMU) for the
efficient implementation of the project works in a timely manner. Because of favorable SDRIUS$
exchange rate. additional funds were available. This was utilized in carrying out additional work by
increasing the scope of contracts. Some of the major highlights related to project implementation are
discussed below.



2
6.     Physical components: (Flood control works):  The construction/rehabilitation of flood control
structures in four wadis; Seena, Al Nassar, Madam and Al Kamet is complete. The control structures
covered under the project include the construction of open channels, box culverts at street crossing
drop structures and sediment traps, footpath and street pavement, and surface drainage.
Equipments: All maintenance equipments required under the project were procured in strict accordance
with approved Guidelines.
7.    While the responsibility for the maintenance of wadis I and 4 is with the local office of the
MCHUP; the responsibility for the maintenance of wadis 2 and 3 is still entrusted with to the contractor
(as part of his contractual obligations) until mid- 1999; upon completion of this period, this responsibility
will be assumed by the local office of the MCHUP. As the PIU has sufficient leverage on the contractor
(5% retention money), it was agreed that the PIU would ensure adequate maintenance of wadis 2 and 3
throuah the contractor until mid-1999. Meanwhile, the local office of the MCHUP would mobilize
necessary resources to ensure that all four wadis are maintained appropriately once the hand-over is
complete
8.    The mission visited the project site and brought to the attention of the PIU that more emphasis is
needed to clean up the sedimentation, boulders and solid waste (dumped by the people) that have
accumulated in the open channels. MCHUP assured the mission that corrective actions would be taken
soon in co-ordination with H.E. the Governor of Taiz who is ultimately responsible for the MCHUP's
branch at Taiz. IDA would be informed by MCHUP of actions taken by end Januar 1999. To ensure
sustainability of the project, 1DA will continue to monitor the operational plan (Annex - 7) prepared and
agreed between MCHUP and the mission.
9.    On this issue of maintaining the infrastructure, the mission was informed that within the
decentralization policy of the Govemment of Yemen (GOY), each and every department of the
Government falls under the overall control of the Governor. In this case, the Governor of Taiz has the
responsibility to ensure maintenance and sustainability of the project through the Municipal office of
Taiz. The Governor is also responsible to recover a reasonable cost from the users according to the
"New Cleaning Law" which was approved by the Cabinet in September 1998. In this context a proposal
(including the formation of a "Maintenance Unit") for ensuring the sustainability of project works has
been approved by H.E. the Governor of Taiz and necessary budgetary provisions are being made to
ensure sustainability of the project. The mission reguested more details including budgetary provisions
made: MCHUP agreed to provide to IDA all necessary details by the end of January 1999.
10.   Follow-on Project: In order to ensure sustainability of the project, the MCHUP urged IDA to
consider a follow-on project (Phase-2) that is aimed at extending the channels upstream and build
boulder traps along the way in accordance with the feasibility study. Final construction design and
bidding documents for all five contracts of the follow-on project were handed over to the mission. The
mission noted with satisfaction that all these documents were prepared by the PIU engineers and
technicians, without any outside assistance. The mission indicated that a follow-on project of this nature
was not currently envisaged in IDA's lending program and that the MOPD will have to take it up
separately. The followv-on project is crucial for the sustainability of the current project works. The
mission howxever wishes to remind that the lack of maintenance of project works will rapidly make the
current project unsustainable and the follow-on project unjustifiable.

E. Technical Assistance:
II.   Implementation of the technical assistance component provided under the project has not been
completed satisfactorily. The TA components were mainly related to the strengthening of staff
capabilities within the MCHUP through the provision of advisors (as needed) in the following four areas:
(a)    to minimnize harm caused by natural disasters through appropriate planning and
development policies, including provision of early warning systems for major urban
population - not done,
(b)    to provide municipal engineering services, procurement, construction
management. urban development and housing services for the Borrower's growing
urban population - done;
(c)    to improve field survey, design, materials testing and research - accomplished;
and
(d)    to manage, operate and maintain flood control works, roads, buildings and other
municipal properties- not done.
At the time of appraisal, the above components were included within the project scope to strengthen the
institutional capacity of MCHUP. Some of the above components were not accomplished and
accordingly, the mission requested necessary communication from MCHUP on their Rlans to complete
the above activities: it was agreed that MCHUP's plan would be sent to IDA by end February 1999.
12.   Finance and Accounts:  The status of submission of audited accounts and audit reports is as
follows: (a) Audit of project accounts: The PIU has submitted the 1997 audit report on time; (b) Audit
of Special Accounts (including withdrawals made against statements of expenditures) - these have been
audited and included in the audit report of project accounts. Thus, in terms of timely submission of
audited accounts, MCHUP is in total compliance.
13.   Compliance with Covenants: The status of compliance with covenants is included in Annex 5.
14.    Disbursement:  The Credit will close on December 31, 1998 and a grace period for the
submission of withdrawal expenditures against eligible expenditures incurred before December 31, 1998
will be allowed in accordance with standard practice. The latest disbursement status is included in
Annex 4.
15.   ICR Mission and Future Operation Plan: In accord with IDA guidelines, after completion of
each project, an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is required to be completed. The mission was
provided with the Borrower's contribution to the ICR. All necessary information and data for completing
the ICR were provided to the mission.
16.    Other issues:  After Credit Closing, closing of all accounts, supervision of contractor's
performance and other related work will need some staff time and resource allocation. The PIU will be
disbanded after Credit closing and there will be no money that can be made available from the Credit.
The MCHUP thus made a request to the mission to consider financing the PHU expenses (preferably on a
lumpsum basis) after Credit Closure for a bare minimum staff to facilitate closure of all accounts. The
mission expressed its inability to financing such needs, but acknowledged that it was more of a
countrywide need for every such closing project. The mission indicated that until such time any proper
mechanism can be identified, the responsibility of managing (and financing) the project immediately
after project closure would be the responsibility of the line ministry.

PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE



PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER' S PERSPECTIVE
1.   COUNTRY
1.1  Yemen is located in the Arabian Peninsula between latitudes 12
- 20 N of the equator and longitudes 41 - 54 E of Greenwich.
It is bordered by Saudi Arabia in the North, the Arabian Sea
and Gulf of Aden in the south, Oman on the East and the Red
Sea in the West. In the South West of Yemen, the strait of
Bab-al-Mandab, in the middle of which the Island of Mayun is
located, which forms the point separating the continent of
Asia from Africa Socotra, the largest Yemeni Island, is 510
Kilometers from the Coast of the Yemeni Arabian Sea and has an
area of 3650 sq. km.
1.2 The area of Yemen is S55,000 sq.km. (excluding the Empty
Quarter). Its population density is 28 persons/sq. km.
Physically, Yemen is divided in 5 distinct features, that is
the mountainous, the plateau, the coastal, the plan and the
desert region. The climate varies from region to region i.e.
hot, wet and moderate.
1.3 Yemen is one of the developing countries that started its
economical development during the 60's and had achieved
significant progress during the 70's and 80's especially in
the sector of Agriculture, Industry and Services such as
education, health and transport etc.
1.4  During the past 30 years, in the process of urbanizatioc andf
natural development, the rural population started moving
towards the urban areas in pursuit of the higher wages, job
opportunities and modern life-style in addition to the natural
growth-of 3.7% annually in the urban areas. The situation
became worse with the return of about 700,000 migrants from
abroad due to gulf crisis.
1.5 For example, the population of capital city of Sana'a hag
doubled since 1989 and has reached a figure of more than 1.2
million out of country's total population of 16 million. The
situation is not different in other urban areas. The growth
has surpassed all predictions made in the Master Plan.
2.   IDA INVOLVEMENT IN THE URBAN SECTOR:
2.1 IDA lending for urban infrastructure started in 1974 with a
credit to help the Government finance the first public water
supply system in Sana'a and to strengthen NWASA which was
established in 1973, then Yemen Arab Republic (YAR). IDA
involvement  in  the  sector  broadened  in  1979  when  the
Government requested assistance for an urban sector review.
This review (Urban Sector Report No. 2699-YAR) identified the
major urban development issues and its findings formed the



Page - 2.
basis of the SanaIa Urban Development Project (Credit No.12CZ-
YAR) which was approved in January 1982. This first
demonstration project was aimed at asristing the- Government
to address the issues identified by the sector review,
tackling specific shelter problems, introducing the concept of
mortgage financing to low-income groups for self- h e 1 p
construction, as well as to strengthen the Housing Credit
Bank (HCB).
2.2  On the basis of the principles established under the Sana'a
Urban Development Project, IDA approved the Second Urban
Development Project (CR.1441-YAR) in February l9B4,4The second
project continued along the principles established under the
first one by applying the same standards in Hodeidah (Yemen's
third largest city) while expanding the activities of Ministry
of Municipalities & Housing (MMH) , which was later expanded as
Ministry of Construction, Housing & Urban Planning (MC.uP).
2.3  Overall  implementation progress  of the  first two urban
projects  was  satisfactory,   however,  the  institutional
component implementation was found to be slower than what was
originally envisaged. The main lessons learnt from the above
projects were (a) cozsiderable time should be allowed for
project implementation (b) adequate compensation should be
provided to attract and retain qualified local professionals
for key positions.
3.   DEVELOPMENT OF TAIZ FLOOD DISASTER PREVENTION & Mt=C1PPL
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (CR. 2160-YEM).
3.1  After the reintegration of both parts of Yemen in 1990, as
Republic of Yemen (ROY), the third Urban Development Project
was developed in agreement with Ministry of Planning &
Development (MOPD), the MMH (now MC(tP) and other departments.
3.2  The project was included in the Third Five Year Development
Plan (1988-1992). Messrs Halcrow Fox and Associates of England
were appointed as Consulting Engineers to prepare a
feasibility study. During the planning and conceptual design
stage, it was revealed that the flood control measures should
take priority over all other works because the funds spend on
upgrading would be wasted if the flooding of the area was not
effectively prevented. The scope of the project was therefore
MODIFIED TO ACCORD PRIORITY TO FLOOD CONTROL.
3.3  The appraisal of the project was carried out during Jasuary 24
to February 13, 1990 and major issues pertaining to the
project scope, cost estimates, procurement and cost recovexty
were resolved.
3.4  The Credit was negotiated at Washington from April 23 and 2a,
1930, approved by the Board of IDA on June 14, 1990 for SDR



Page-3.
11.7 Million (MM) or about US$ 15 MM and was ratified by
Yemeni Parliament in January 1991, and became effective on
May 14, 1991.
4.   PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
4.1 The main objectives of the project are:
a.   To provide most needed flood control structure to protect
private and public buildings and infrastructure, and to
minimize disruptions to the local economy and reduce the
risks to human life;
b.   To implement a project cost recovery mechanism at a
municipal level, and to promote implementation of a
national municipal resource mobilization policy;
c.   To strengthen the urban management capabilities to the
main branch offices; and
d.   To strengthen MMH Is (now MCHUP) institutional capacity to
address urban problems more effectively.
4.2 Prolect Design:
4.2.1           During the course of project-preparation. several
alternative design standards and primary drainage
routes were considered. All of them followed a basic
design concept incorporating drainage channels and
box culverts through the built-up  sections of the
city, and sediment and boulder traps upstream.
These also included the channelization of secondary
wadis originating from Al Qahira Hill (Cairo Eill)
to  the  south  of  the  project  area,  and  s8il
conservation measures.
4.2.2           Two alternative flow parameters were considered
for the design of hydraulic structures, namely, a
1:5 year frequency flood as the minimum acceptable
protection, and a 1:20 year frequency flood as ar.
economically acceptable maximum protection. The
impact of floods with return periods of 1:50 and
1:100 years was also considered to develop a loss-
probability   analysis   and  identify  the  cost
effectiveness and risk protection of the proposed
investment. Space constraints, due to the narrowness
of the streets, limited the design capacity that
could be economically provided. It was concluded
that a hydraulic design capacity to carry 100
percent of the 1:20 year frequency flood and about
90 percent of the flood flows with a return period
of 1:50 years, would yield, within the space
constraints, the least-cost alternative and the
maximum possible protection against any reasonable
risk to human life. Thus, flood waters caused by



Page-4.
events exceeding the design capacity (such as events
occurring with a freqnency of L.:S  or :100 years)
would be of minor or moderate impact and would pose
no threat to people or property.
4.2.3          Several drainage routing alternatives were also
studied to determine the least-cost solution.
Diverting Wadi Seena by  tunneling  under a high
ridge separating two adjacent watersheds was ruled
out on economic grounds. Diverting Wadi Al Vasser
into Wadi Seena was considered the only viable
option as the streets along its natural drainage
course are too narrow to enable construction of even
the minimum hydraulic capacity option (1:5 years
frequency flood) without the major demolition of
historical buildings in the "Old Town". The only
feasible option for controlling Wadi Madam flood
waters was to provide a box culvert along the
streets following the natural drainage course of the
Wadi.
4.2.4          PX  INCG OF THE PROJECT:
Finally, taking into consideration the financial
constraints, THE PROJECT WAS CONCEIVED To BE
TMPLEMENTED IN PHASES; from essential flood control
works providing the most needed protection to the
maximum investment including urban upgrading which
would enhance land development in the area bordering
some of these wadis. Therefore, the project was
designed to provide the essential flood control
works which has yielded the maximum economic
-        benefit.
S.   PROJECT COMPONENTS: The project comprised of the following
main elements:
5.1  The essential flood control structures consisting of open
channels6box culverts, sediment and boulder traps at various
places in wadi Seena, Wadi Nasser, Wadi Madam and wadi. Al
Kamet:
S.2  The restoration of street pavement; the conservation of soil
through the terracing of unstable slopes; surface drainage
footpaths in narrow and steep streets to control erosion;
and land acquisition;
5.3  The procurement of equipment for the Maintenance of flood
control structures;
S.4  The institutional strengthening of MMX (Now MCEP) and its
main offices through technical assistance;  and technical
assistance for project construction management;



Page-S.
5.5  To implement a project cost recovery mechanism at.a municipaL
level, and to promote implementation of a national municipal
resource mobilization policy; This component was deleted.
However, it was agreed between IDA and the Government that
Cost Recovery mechanism at various governorates would be
undertaken as part of the macro economic reforms curr-e.ly
being undertaken by the Government of ROY.
5.6  The training of MMH (Now MCHUP) and its main branch offices
staff; and
5.7  Consultant services will be provided to prepare a.-feasibility
study for a future urban development project, and on the basis
of such a study, to prepare a preliminary and final design as
well as tender documents and technical specifications.
6.   MODIFICATIONS IN THE PROJECT DURING IMPLEMENTATION:
6.1  As a result of physical changing circumstances at site andbt
overcome implementation problems the design of civil works was
modified in different places along the wadis while the basic
objectives of the project remained unchanged. Given below are
the modifications made in the project activities:
Contract 1 (Wadi 1)
a.   Open channel stn 1200-1349, alignment was shifted
one meter to the right side for getting to consuct=
stone wall on left side.
b.   Box Culvert SBE/9
Length changed from 20 to 25 meters and s= 1G20-
1040 shifted to stn 1008-1033.
c.   ODen channel stn 1008 948.5 was changed from stone
masonry to RCC U-Channel due to restricted space of
excavation.
d.  Box Culvert No. SEIB
Size of Box culvert was changed from 6. Ox3 .0 to
5x2.8 due to shifting of W-2 diversion to Wadi-3 and
the 500 nm water pipe crossing the box-culvert. The
length of this Box Culvert was extended from 100 K
to 496 M through Awadhy Street as additional work.
e.    Additional asphalt pavement was provided. (4,aa
meters in length on each side of Open Channel).



Page -6.
f.   Box Culvert SB/7
The size of Box Culvert was changed from G.0x6.xx2M
due to shifting of W-2 diversion to Wadi 3 and
plinth levels of adjoining building being lower than
road level.
Contract No. 2 (Wadi 2J
a.   Wadi 2 diversion shifted to its natural course to
join with Wadi 3 instead of Wadi 1 previously
planned, due to problems to acquire houses in its
route.
b.   Stn 442-378 foundations for stone wall changed to
combine  footing  due  to  restricted  space  of
excavations.
c.   Sedimentation, Traps and Ramp walls in Wadi 2 and 2A
reduced in length to make room for machinexy
movements.
d.   Foundation and drop walls  reduced due to rock
foundations and restricted space on sides.
Contract 3A (Wadi 3)
a.   Size of Box Culverts from stn 104.5-650 was changed
from 2.5x2.5 to 3.0x2.8 between stn 104.S-314.S; and
2.8x3.0 between stn 314.5-650. The size was changed
to take the additional flow of wadi 2 and excaration
limitations in narrow streets.
b.   Slopes and invert levels between stn 104.5-374.5
were also changed to save the adjoining buil dix g
from flooding.
7.   PROJECT COST AND P'INANCING
7.1  The project estimated to cost USS 22.25 million excluding
taxes and duties, of which US$ 15.0 million represented the
foreign cost component. The detailed cost estimate at
appraisal is given in Annex 1. The actual costs as incurred
are given in Annex-2.
7.2  The construction of the main works was programmed to be
completed by December 1996.
7.3  The entire foreign exchange component of the project i.e. Us$
15.0 million equivalent was proposed to be financed by IDA.
The local cost of USS 7.25 million equivalent was proposed to
be financed by Yemen Government.



Page -7.
8.   PROCUREMENT:
8.1  The procurement arrangements cQ thp- p=soect as agreed during
appraisal are shown in Annex 3.
8.2  The project was  divided  into nine civil works contract
packages, five of which (representing about 86' of the total
civil works) were proposed to be tendered following
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in
accordance with IDA procurement guidelines. Remaining four
civil work contract packages were to be tendered under Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedure acceptable to IDA,consists
of small works scattered all over the project area.
9.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION:
9.1  Civil Works:
The Civil Works component of the project were separated into
five International Competitive Bidding Contracts (ICE) and
four Local Competitive Bidding Contracts (LCB).
9.1.1     ICB Contracts:
Contracts 1, 2, 3A, 3B and 4 were finalized under the
procedures of International Competitive Bidding and these
Contracts were awarded to the Public Corporation for
Construction & Industrial Installation on September 12,
1991. The original contracts implementation period was
19.5 months including 6 weeks of mobilization.   The
contracts period had extended six times in order to
_    complete the project.
The Contract implementation was delayed by 66 months for
the reasons given at 9.4 in this report.
9.1.2.    LCB Contracts:
All LCB contracts were completed as of October 31, 1998.
-    Contract No. 2 a 3 were signed on November 6, 1996.
The duration of these contracts was 12 months. The
delayed time was approximately 12 months.
-    Contract No. 1 & 4 were signed on March 6, 1997. The
duration of these contracts was 6 months. The
delayed time was approximately 12 months.
-    The reasons for delay are given at 9.4 in this
report.



Page-B.-
9.2 Maintenance eocuiDment:
9.2.1     The maintenance equipment weae Laroaued from Marubeni
Corporation according to the WorId Bank procurement
guidelines. The contract was signed on November 2, 1992.
The details are given in Annex-4.
The contract for supply of maintenance equipment amounted
to Japanese Yen  (JY)  146,645,500  equivalent to US$
1,383,448. The equipment arrived at the site in October
1993.
9.3 Institutional Strenathening of the Ministry
Through the life-cycle of the project, the objectives of this
component are far exceeded compared to those at the time of-
appraisal, such as:
Consultancv services for municipal envirorment co ronent:
-   Employment   of   consultancy   firm   (Associated
Consulting Engineers) to study and recomuend
improvement of solid waste collection and disposal
including   landfill   sites;   and   to  propose
institutional strengthening of MCUP I's environmental
department to address the issues nationwide.
The study is received and is being used for
development of future projects within the mandates
of the Ministry.
Staff Training:
Training of 20 engineers and staff within
the country and abroad. The training included
different  fields  such  as  project  management.
Community Development, Urban Planning & Development
Management, Development of Low cost Housing,
Feasibility study & project evaluation, MateriaL
Testing  &  Quality  Control,  and  training  in
Laboratory equipment, and others.
Impact: ll of the 20 trained, are currently holding
responsible positions in the Ministry as Director of
the departments, three are managing other IDA,
Credits (Public Works Project, Social Fund & Taiz
Flood Prevention Project) . Remaining are now working
with other IDA projects or holding responsible
positions in the Ministry.
-    Enclish course for Ministry's staff - 32 staff
members of the Ministry had undergone lOo hour
english course. This has improved the efficiercy of
the staff signficantly.



Page -9.
Strenatheninc  Municiral  Branch  Offices:  This
component was identified during appraisal. In crder
to strengthen these and in agreement with IDA,
necessary equipments needed for the ministry and its
offices  i.e.   blue  printing  machine,  survey
equipments, computers and field vehicles were
procured.   This   arrangement   was  found  more
appropriate instead of hiring a consultant and was
agreed with IDA. This has strengthened the capacity
of the Ministry, Taiz Branch Office and Survey
department   and   enhanced   their   efficiency
significantly. This component was modified to
replace the provision of Advisor for Public Works
Engineering identified at appraisal.
Appointment of Technical Advisor to the ministry to
assist with preparation of new projects and to
assist the Ministry in developing policies in order
to achieve the mandates of the Ministry. The advisor
has played a positive role in identifying and
implementing staff training programmes.
Emnloyment of Lecal Advisor to the ministry to
assist with preparation of new laws and legislation
required for effective management of the policies
within the mandates of the Ministry.
EmDloyment of Construction Advisor to the project
unit to assist project staff in supervision ard
project management was undertaken. The need was
identified during appraisal. The construction
Advisor continued till January 1996 and trained the
local staff in project supervision independently.
Advisor to Urban DeveloDment & Housing Policies- The
need for this -position was identified during
appraisal. However, there is an existing cooperation
between MCHDP, United Nations Center for Human.
Development (UNCHS Habitat) and Institute of Housing
& Urban Planning Rotterdam. Within this cooperation,
a draft housing policy was drafted and sent to =DA
for their review. It was agreed that there is no
need for providing such advisor through the Credit.
Employment   of   consultancy   firm   (Consulting
Engineering Services) to study and design major road
crossings in the city of Sana'a to improve Traffic
movement. The study is expected to complete by the
end of December 1998 and would be used for obtaining
IDA credit within the concept of Urban Development
projects.

9.4 Problems encountered durinc the Project Implementaticn:
The major problems encountered and factors contributiLg
towards delay in implementation are Ps fllcwv:
1.   Utilities Problems
a.   A major problem is non-availability of adequate
documents related to Plans for existing
services within the project area. There were no
records available for sewerage and water supply
network. Most of the sewerage pipe locations
were identified from enquiries made from the
local residents during implementation. There
were very few access points that were visible
and many houses did not appear to bave
inspection chambers. It was common Lor direct
connections to be made to the main sewer. Many
of manholes were either buried or had been
capped with concrete and covered by soil. No
satisfactory records or knowledge of other
facilities were available such as electricity
and telephone cables which were spread everr
where underground.
b.  For dwelling within the project area which were
not connected to the wadis, new lines of
sewerage were executed by the mnmtractor to
solve this problem.
C.   Lack of coordination between the contractor and
services authorities to divert the services
which were encountered and affected the project
execution.
2.   Land acquisition problems in contract no. 2 had
forced the client to change planned rout of wadi 3.
3.   Inadequate  arrangement  forx  the  provision  of-
construction materials, equipments and man power as
per the programme.
4.   Insufficient  cash  flow  for execution  of work
according to the programme.
5.   Extra ordinary floods in the wadis.
6.   Contractor's lack of experience with this type of
work and their engineers not familiar with dealin.
with international contracts conditions (PtIIC).



Page-li.
7.   The work was delayed for about 7 months due to the
political crisis and the war that followed in the
couny_ -  e c>tL ra=&== waILd.ew a.s l his equipments
from the site, shortly prior to the war.
After the war was ended, the contractor started
the work but was lacking capabilities due the post
result of war.
The contractor's materials and eauipments were
looted from his stores forcing him to hire from the
market, and due to his short of cash flow, it was
not possible in many cases.
8.   Weakness  of  the contractor's  administration  in
managing the work activities according to prograxme
issued.
9.   As the contractor is a government organization, .Its
financial processes were hampered by the complex
government regulations and the routiLne.
10.  The government regulations does not allow for any
incentives more than a certain percentage of the
staff salary thus resulting in the general feeling
amongst the contractorIs staff of having a job to go
to work daily instead of a commitment to complete a
job within the agreed time frame.
11.  Contractor ignoring  the  penalties laid in the
contract condition, because the principle of
achieving profit in the contract does not exist
being a government body.
9.S Measures taken to exoedite the com=letion:
1.  Arrangements  were  made  to  transfer  all  interim
certificates to the account of the Contractor at Taiz
instead of its headquarter at Aden which bad ensured the
availability of sufficient funds. With the intervention
of World Bank representative, a loan of is million Riyals
was provided to the contractor through mCKuP.
2.   Strengthened  the  contractor's  management  unit  by
providing experts with extensive and similar work
experience. They were delegated all authorities to take
decision away from the routine government procelures.
3.   Coordination was done with higher level governorate
management and other relevant authorities to resolve the
problems related to the utility services.
4.   Close  monitoring  was  done  by  PIU  on  the  actual
implementation of activities by the contractor, deviatin



Page-12.
were referred to the higher management of the ministry to
take appropriate action immediately.
5.   It was ensured that the works are continued round t b e
clock  and  on  holidays  without  interruption.  The
contractor formed the working teams. Close monitoring was
done by PIU to ensure that working teams are operational.
round the clock.
6.   His Excellency the Governor of Taiz was approached, who
took personal interest to ensure completion of the
project within the credit period. Necessary cooperation
was assured from various other departments  such as
Traffic Police, Municipality, Sewerage, Water,electricity
and other departments.
10. ACHIEVEMENT OF' PROJECT OBJECTIVES
At the closing date, the project objectives are far exceeded
compared to those at the time of appraisal, such as;
10.1 Storm water control measures:
For the storm water control measures, a suitable channelizedT
network was constructed through the existing wadis i.e. Wadi-L
(Seena),  Wadi-2  (Al Nasser), Wadi-3  (Madam), and wadi-4
extension (Taiz).
The hydraulic structure constructed for the storm water
control and flood mitigation measures include:
3.20 kms masonry open channels (3-12 m wide).
3.01 km reinforced concrete single and twin box culvert.
(2-10 m wide).
Construction of 5 sedimentation traps. The traps are
constructed primarily for effecting clean water out-falls by
initial segregation of the larger boulders and then the
retention of sediments with trap, as the water flow. pass over
check weirs of the appropriate structures.
Construction of 3 drop structures. The drop structures had
been constructed in order to enhance upstream retention.
capacities of the traps.
10.2 Road Access:
Traffic flow system had been improved by the construction of
5.4 km asphalt roads and 2.3 km stone pavement roads.
New major road was constructed beside Wadi Seena chw.nel
currently serves the purpose of:



Page-13.
-   providing a continuous north-south route through the City
of Taiz;
-    enabling more effective use of southern ring road which
in the past, used to carry very little traffic movement
in relation to its standard and design new connections
access and links between existing road along the eastern,
margin of the project were established.
10.3 Seweraae system:
The project was successful in enhancing the sewerage systenm
network by providing 5932 meter sewer pipes and 183 manholes
with different sizes (lSOmm-400mm) within the project area and
for purpose of:
-   Replacement   main   sewer   affected   by   protect
implementation;
-    Establishing of new sewer to connect dwellings not
connected to the sewerage system along wadis.
10.4 Other services: 
By the substantial completion of civil work components all
services (telephone, electricity, water supply network) fully
protected from  damage during flood events. Most of these
services re-arranged and recorded with refer and easy to be
known underground.
10.5 Prolect Maintenance Ecuinments:
All the equipments purchased are being utilized effectively at
Taiz city by the local office of the Ministry of Construction,
Housing & Urban Planning who is responsible for operations and
maintenance at Taiz city under the superviso of Taiz Governor
in line with decentralization policy of the Government.
10.6 Institutional strenctheninc of the ministry:
By the closing date of the project the institutional
strengthening of the ministry satisfactorily achieved.
Project Manacement - The Ministry was dependent on expatriate
staff for project management at appraisal. Now the project is
being implemented independently by the national staff.
Prolect desion & Tender documents: International consultancy-
services were required for project design and preparation of
tender documents at appraisal. Now, the national staff has
independently prepared the drawings and tender documents for
Phase-11 activities of the project.



Page -1 4.
Staff traininc: During the time frame of the credit, a numbecr
of engineers and other staff members baxd undegSame training in
various fields   c  as. P=rjezt  a"-gemeant, Quality control,
Community Development, Low cost housing, financial management,
Material testing, Project evaluation and others. Now three of
them are managing IDA financed projects independently, others
are either working with other IDA projects or holding senior
positions in the Ministry. 32 staff members undergone training
in English language which has  enhanced their efficiency
significantly.
Strenctheninc  of Survey  Department.  Laboratory  & Branch
Offices: At appraisal the Ministry and its departments were
dependent on external support. By provision of much needed
survey equipments, Blue Printing machine, Arphalt testing
machine and other equipments, the capacity of Ministry and
its departments has enhanced significantly and minimize&.
the dependency on external support.
11.  IMPACT OF THE PROJECT:
1.  Mitication to Flood Damage - 100'r of approximately ZL, 000
household (5000 at appraisal) and 900 shops (280 at
appraisal) are now protected. The project mitigated flood.
damage to public infrastructure and private property.
During the last two years, residents and business
community inside the project area experiencing for the
first time heavy rains without any emergency protective
measures to be taken.
2.   Protection of .rooerty worth tSS 3.0 Million anmually:
Negligible damage to public or private property including
infrastructure (Road, Telephone, Water, Electricity) as
compared to regular incidents of major losses amoutinzg
to US$ 3.0 million annually.
3.  No loss to Human Life or cattle: No incident of loss to
human life, cattle as compared 3 to 4 incidents each time
during the floods.
4.   Savino of ySs 1.6 Million annually on Maintenance cost -
Enormous reduction in maintenance cost to public
infrastructure and private property. Presezt expenditure
in estimated at US$ 90,000 for 54,000 households as
compared to USS 150,000 for 5,134 households annually at
appraisal, which makes a saving of US$ 1.6 millein
annually on maintenance cost.
5.   Im2roved access - The project removed traffic disruption
and improved road network and access to health centers,
schools and mosques as compared to the situation during
appraisal. New exit and entry points had beer developed



Page-15.
for smooth vehicular and pedestrian traffic. This has
relieved traffic at crowded Al-Gamal street and 26
September Street especially as the ce=ter of the city.
6.   Develonment of Vehicle Parkinc - Vehicle parking has been
developed at the center of the city using the space
developed as a result of Box Culvert. No place was
available for vehicle parking at appraisal. This will
also develop green area in the city as compared to nane
at appraisal.
7.   Uninterruoted and enhanced commercial activities - The
project enhanced uninterrupted commercial activities
throughout the year as compared 5 to 10 times anmually
for to 2 to 3 hours each time during floods.
S.   Enhanced Land & ProDertv Value - The project increased
property value especially along wadis and within the old
city.
9.   Poverty Alleviation through Emrlovment Genertion n The
utilization of local skills and material for the
implementation of the civil works considered both
technically and economically acceptable to the community
and improved the employment opportunities. Uninterrupted
economic and commercial activities has also played a
vital role in employment generation.
10.  1100 street vendors & 900 shops as comvared to 280 shoes
at aDpraisal - No disruption to economic and commercial
activities within the city especially at the old city.
The shops in the project area enhanced to 900 as compared
to 280 at appraisal. This excludes about 1100 street
vendors.  At  appraisal  the  commercial  and  economic
activities were limited due to the danger of dAmage as a
result of flood water
11. Direct benefit to 90.000 beneficiaries - (children
45,000, Women 25,000 and men 20,000).
12.  Indirect benefit to entire Dopulation of Taiz (430.001
and others  residing  outside  of project  area whicb
includes farmers, dwellers, visitors, businessmen,
traders etc. whose economic benefits relate to the
activities in Taiz city.
14.  Develonment of Surface water drainace svstem - Surface
water drainage system has been established as compared tc
none at appraisal. No stagnant water is seen as soon an
the rains are over.



Page-16.
15.  100%l   rotection acainst erosion - Erosion has stopped
which ultimately damages the houses built along tb.e-
wadis.
16.  Effective use of Rain Water - Rain water is channeled in
a designed manner through the wadis towards an earthen
irrigation Al-Amra dam, which is connected to irrigation
channels built under another IDA financed southern region
Agriculture Development Project (CR.1772-YEM). With the
control on the rain water, it recharges the existing
wells.
17.  tse  of  flood  water  for  irrication  - The project
contributed to the improvement of the quality of water
for downstream flows so that the farmers benefitted from
the proper use of floodwater for irrigation.
18. Im?roved sewerage _and  solid waste management - The
implementation of new sewerage line along wadis and
the improvement of road net work contributed to the
improvement of environmental conditions. Because, before
the project, the people along wadis connected their
houses to wadis the collection of solid waste inside the
project area become easier due to the availability of
road access. A remarkable improvement was noticed in the
solid waste management activities of the local office of
MCHUP. This has also prevented the diseases to spread.
12.  PROJECT SUSTAIBABILITY:
- 12.1 Maintenance of Infrastructure:
Within the decentralization policy of the Government of Yemen,
each and every department of the Government falls under the
administrative control of the Governor. In this case, the
Governor of Taiz has the responsibility to ensure maintenance
and sustainability of the project through the Municipal office
of Taiz. The Governor is also responsible to recover a
reasonable cost from the users according to the 'New Cleaning
Law' which was approved by the Cabinet in September 1998.
Interim arrangements - A proposal for   maintenance of the
implemented infrastructure was submitted to His Excellency the
Governor of Taiz. The proposal was acceptable, in principle,
to the Governor of Taiz. Necessary budgetary provisions are
being made for proper maintenance of the infrastructure to
ensure sustainability of the project. The proposal included
formation of a Maintenance Unit, as an interim measure, under
the direct control of the Governor. The Maintenance Unit will
have following functions:



Page -17.
-    Cleaning the channels;
-    To ensure that solid waste and other debris are not
thrown into the channel;
-    Preventive maintenance of the infrastructure;
-    To develop and implement a Law which has a provision of
punishment to ensure that solid waste is not disposed.
off into the channels;
-    To ensure that all new houses are connected to Sewerage
Line so that the excreta is not disposed off into the
channels.
12.2 Lonc-term Plans: For sustainable maintenance of the Project,
it is planned to utilize the services -of Private Secror  'The
maintenance will be contracted. With the introduction of
'New Cleaning Law', the waste collection services will be on
the basis of 'Fee for Service'.
12.3 Cost Recovery: The Governor of Taiz has taken the initiative
towards cost recovery measures by imposing a surcharge to al.
households on  their   electricity   bills.   However,   the
institutional and legal arrangements for the cost recovery in
the governorate are awaiting financial directions of the
government under the macro economic reform. Efforts are also
being undertaken to rationalize cost recovery mechanism an
well as to introduce other taxes e.g. Toll tax and cther
taxes. A Socio-economic study was conducted recently which is
under review. The final recommendations will be forwarded ta
the Governor of Taiz for implementation.
22.4 Phase-Il of the Project: The existing project was appraised 1=
1990 and was phased out to match the financial resources
which were available during 1990. The project simed to
complete flood control structure.  A   proposal   is   under
discussions between MCKUP and MOPD for including Phase-Z: of
the Project under IDA assistance. The Tender Documents and
drawings are already completed. It is likely that delay in the
implementation of Phase-II activities will damage the already
implemented infrastructure during the Phase-1.
13. BANK PERF2MAN-CE:
13.1 The Bank officials had been monitoring and supervising the
project regularly. However, special attention to the project
was accorded after July 1995. Under the guidance and practical
advise from World Bank experts, the project could be completed
within the time frame. The efforts made in terms of
institutional strengthening of the- Ministry, expediting the
completion  of works and utilization  of funds are worth
mentioning.
13.2 The overall performance of the Bank can be rated as Eighly
Satisfactory (+).



Page-I8.
14. BORROWER PERFORMNCE:
14.1 The project was implemented by a Project flplementation Unit
(PIU) established by the line ministry i.e. Ministry of
Municipalities and Housing  (now Ministry of Const,ruction.
Housing Ec Urban Planning) . Initially the PZU was headed by an
expatriate Project Manager but later on taken over by a
national. The PIU under the guidance of the Ministry assisted
by the IDA supervision missions fulfilled all its obligations.
a.   The project is completed as per schedule.
b.  All procurement were done as per IDA guidelines.
c.   The allocated budget (IDA+Government) was utilized
efficiently and for the legitimate purposes.
d.  Uptodate financial records are maintained which were
audited by independent auditors.
e.   Quarterly and Audit reports were submitted to DA cm
time.
f.  All covenants of the Development Credit Agreement were
successfully achieved.
g.   Local staff is now fully trained in the areas of prcject
management,  quality  control,  design  aud  fimamial.
management.
14.2 The overall performazce of the Borrower can be rated at Highly
Satisfactory (+).
1i. ASSESSMm 0F OUTCOME:
151 In view of the positive achievements of all covenants by the
local staff, this can be rated as Righly Satisfactory. The
existing staff, with on the job training, was able to develop
design of the Phase-ii independently.
16.       E OPETIONS:
As an interim measure, MCHLUP is in the process of establiahing
a separate unit for maintenance of the existing intrastructure
through its local office in Taiz. Under the decentralizationL
policy of the Government, the Governor of Taiz is responsible
for maintenance and sustainability of the project. This Unit,
under the direct supervision of the Governor, will focs on.
operations and maintenance, preparation of plans and would
encourage the community participation. Special emphasis will
be given to the training of beneficiaries and the staff. A
plan of action has already been agreed in principle by th-
Governor of Taiz.
As a long term sustainable effort, it is planned ta utilizec
the services of Private Sector on a contractual basis for-
maintenance of the project including cleaning of the ceannels.



Page-'9.
The new 'Cleaning Law' which was approved by the Cabinet i-n
September l998 has the provision for recove:ing 'fee for
service'. The amount collected from more than 2, 000
households benefitted from the project will be sufficient for
maintaining the project.
MCHCP and MOPD has already in principle that immediate
implementation cf Phase-II of the project will sustain already
implemented infrastructure during Phase-I of the project.
MC1UP is in the process of developing new UJrban Development
Projects for the cities of Sana'a and Taiz. Proposals for
consultancy services are invited from international companies
for preparing a city development strategy for the cities of
Sana'a and Taiz. A study to solve the traffic problem in the
capital city of Sana'a (funded out of this credit) is expected.
to be completed by the end of December 1998.
17.  .KEY LESSONS LZAP1TED:
-   The Project Implementation Unit should be more autonomous
and be responsible only to the Minister or Vice Minister-
-   Sufficient time should be allowed for any civil work
components when they are implemented within the cities,
and  due  consideration  should  be  given  to  the
inconvenience of the local population.
-   The responsibility of the designated engineer should S0t
*    be undermined by decisions takerL outside of the framework.
of the contract.
-   The project preparation should have the participation
from all actors who are to play role in the
implementation  of  the  project  to  ensure  inter-
departmental support.
