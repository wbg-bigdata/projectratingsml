3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The primary objective of the project was to assist the Government in restoring production levels by easing
some of the critical physical constraints caused by war-related damage. To this end, the project was to
support the Government in its reconstruction program, focusing on the repair or reconstruction of
infrastructure, on the repair or replacement of agricultural assets, and on assisting the reinstatement of



displaced families through the repair of damaged housing, schools and health facilities, and local
infrastructure networks.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original objective was not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
(a)    Roads (US$11.7 million): the replacement of critical road maintenance equipment and spare parts
lost during the war.
(b)    Railways (US$9.8 million): priority items including (i) spare parts for diesel locomotives, rolling
stock, and track maintenance machines; (ii) a minimum replenishment of the depleted stock of
materials for tracks, electrification, signaling, and telecommunication; and (iii) replacement of
small tools for track repairs.
(c)    Power (US$16.6 million): (i) transmission interconnection to assure a reliable power supply to the
Zadar area; and (b) reconstruction of the Dubrovnik area distribution networks.
(d)    Water Supply, Sewerage and Flood Control (US$20 million): (i) about 20 small scale water and
sewerage projects to repair war-related damage; and (b) the refurbishing of flood control systems
through repair of damaged flood control embankments, water control structures, monitoring and
communications systems in the Sava river basin, and the replacement of damaged construction and
maintenance equipment.
(e)    Community Reconstruction (US$40.2 million): assistance to homeowners in priority commnunities
that sustained substantial damage to facilitate the retum of people to their homes, including: (i)
financial assistance to homeowners for acquisition of housing repair materials and services; (ii)
reconstruction of a minimum complement of social infrastructure (particularly primary schools and
primary health care facilities); and (iii) reconstruction of community-level water and sanitation
facilities and low voltage power networks.
(f)    Agriculture (US$19.7 million): (i) assistance in rebuilding national herds for milk and meat
production through the provision of pregnant cows, goats and mares to private farmers, and
through the strengthening of artificial insemination and veterinary services by providing boars,
special vehicles and equipment; (ii) partial replacement of lost tractors and motor cultivators for
private farners; and (iii) limited replacement of grain dryers.
(g)    Reconstruction Activities in Additional Areas (US$10 million): Some funds were set aside for
reconstruction in areas where the Government at the time of appraisal did not have full access.
3.4 Revised Components:
The components were not revised although the composition of items to be financed did change to
accommodate for changes in circumstances. There were reallocations within and between components.
The principal reallocations between components were the following:
*   US$5.7 million from Agriculture reallocated to Roads.
-2 -



*   US$10 million from Additional Areas reallocated to Railways.
*   US$1.25 million from Community Reconstruction reallocated to Water Supply, Sewerage and Flood
Control.
After the reallocations, the revised amounts were as follows:
* Roads: US$17.4 million
*   Railways: US$19.8 million
*   Power: US$16.6 million
*   Water Supply, Sewerage and Flood Control: US$21.25 million
*   Community Reconstruction: US$38.95 million
*   Agriculture: US$14 million
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at entry was satisfactory taking into account the emergency nature of the project and the
circumstances in which it was prepared. Project preparation took place in an environment that was
politically still fluid and not fully settled. Although the project was identified in October 1992 with Board
presentation planned for June 1993, it was presented to the Board only in June 1994. The project was thus
held in abeyance for one year until issues related to Croatia's involvement in the crisis in Bosnia were
clarified to the Bankes satisfaction. This necessitated a reassessment of the project composition and
re-negotiations with the Croatian authorities in May 1994. Adjustments had to be made to the original
project composition and envisaged arrangements to accommodate for the changes that had taken place in
the interim. Consequently, not all the actions and steps needed to make the project implementation
arrangements effective could be fully defined at the time project implementation began.
Ownership of the project components was clear as they were prepared in close consultation with the
respective sectoral agencies.
The design of the organization for project implementation was influenced by the multi-sector nature of the
project. Given the extensive and urgent needs for reconstruction, the inclusion of as many as six sectors
under a single operation could not be avoided. Inevitably, there were differences in the levels of experience
and implementational capacity in the sectoral agencies concerned. While the agencies for roads (Hrvatske
Ceste), railways (Hrvatske Zeljeznice), power (Hrvatska Elektroprivreda) and water supply (Hrvatske
Vode) had the necessary project implementational experience, including familiarity with Bank operations,
those involved in the other sectors, Agriculture and Community Reconstruction, had been less exposed.
The multiple agencies involved in project implementation called for a strong and experienced coordinating
agency, but neither of the two candidates, first the Agency for Reconstruction (AR) and later the Croatian
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (HKBO - later renamed HBOR) had the necessary experience
or capacity at the time. At the time of the re-negotiation of the loan in May 1994, the Government
designated HKBO to be the coordinating agency.
- 3 -



Detailed criteria were developed to ensure transparency and fairness in the inclusion of war-damaged areas
and communities that would be eligible for assistance under the loan. In view of their inter-linkages, for the
Community Reconstruction, Agriculture, and Water supply, Sewerage and Flood Control components, the
submission of Regional Implementation Plans was made a condition of disbursement.
Given the emergency nature of the project, the Bank's detailed assessment was limited to the technical
assessment of the proposed investments. No estimates were made of the economic benefits or the financial
situation of the implementing agencies.
Cost estimates generally proved to be conservative. With a few exceptions, bid prices in most cases were
lower than the estimated prices, resulting in substantial cost savings. This enabled the augmentation of the
original equipment lists to the benefit of the sectors concerned.
Readiness of project implementation at entry was generally satisfactory 'taking into account the
circumstances described above. Despite awareness of the issues and efforts to resolve them, not all of the
necessary steps, actions and procedures could be fully defined prior to start of implementation. Areas
which later proved problematic and led to delays in implementation are discussed in Sections 5 and 7, and
summarized below:
* inter-agency agreements and contracts
- adequate staffing of some of the agencies
i selection criteria for end-users and preparation of end-user contracts
incomplete definition of some procurement packages and the procurement methods to be employed
Flexibility was built into the loan structure by providing adequate set-asides for areas and communities that
could potentially become eligible later for inclusion under the project. Thus, in addition to the specific
category for Additional Areas for which an allocation of US$ 10 million equivalent had been included, each
component included amounts set aside for the use of the North East region once it became eligible for
assistance.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The project's outcome was successful as it met, and in many cases, exceeded the physical targets of
reconstruction assistance that had been envisaged. This was accomplished within the original cost
estimates. Any increases in amounts expended under specific components (e.g. roads, railways and water
supply and sewerage) were either due to realloactions from other components or to changes in composition
of investment (e.g. power).
4.2 Outputs by components:
Roads: The original allocation of US$11.7 million was increased to US$17.4 million with the transfer of
US$5.7 million from the Agriculture component. Further, there were cost savings in most items as
contracted prices proved to be lower than the budgeted amounts. Physical targets were exceeded in most
cases including in the most significant items in terms of value: trucks, specialized equipment and spare
- 4 -



parts. The reallocation of US$5.7 million was largely spent on purchase of winter service equipment for
motorway maintenance that was in critical short supply. The entire allocation was fully disbursed.
Implementation was highly satisfactory.
Railways: The original allocation of US$9.8 million was increased to US$19.8 million with the transfer of
US$10 million from the Additional Areas component. The additional amount was used to meet the needs
of Western Slavonia which became eligible for assistance under the project after the Dayton Accord in
December 1995. As in the case of roads, physical targets were met or exceeded in most cases. The entire
allocation was fully disbursed. Implementation was highly satisfactory.
Power: At the Borrower's request, changes were made in the items to be financed under the Cross Island
Inter-Connection sub-component. Due to the regain of the Krajina area by Croatia, and the ongoing repair
of the 110 kV transmission line crossing the Southern Krajina area, the originally planned investment in the
220 kV Zadar-Belice transmission line was no longer judged to be urgent. Instead, priority was given to
rebuilding of the 110 kV network (Belice-Benkovac-Obrovac-Zadar-Biograd) in the crucial coastal areas
where reconstruction of war damage had been postponed. An amount of US$5.6 million was reallocated
from the planned 220 kV investment to that for the 110 kV network. The Dubrovnik Distribution Network
sub-component was implemented largely as planned. The originally allocated amount of US$16.6 million
for the power component was fully disbursed. Implementation was satisfactory.
Water Supply, Sewerage and Flood Control: With readjustments in boundaries and return of some areas to
Croatian control, there were changes in the composition of investments as some of the originally identified
investments were assessed to be no longer needed in the changed circumstances. This led to substitution of
these investments by others. The final nunber of investments financed for water supply and sewerage was
about the same as originally envisaged. However, the changes led to some delay in implementation while
the new investments were prepared and approved. The overall amount spent for flood control was lower
than envisaged, and the amounts were reallocated to water supply and sewerage. The total investment was
about US$46.2 million equivalent, of which about US$32.0 million (70 percent) was for water supply,
US$12.7 million (27 percent) for sewerage and US$1.5 million (3 percent) for flood control. With the
reallocation of US$1.25 million from the Community Reconstruction component, the Bank loan amount
utilized under this component was US$21.25 million as compared to the original allocation of US$20
million, and was fully disbursed. Implementation was satisfactory.
Community Reconstruction:   For the Housing sub-component, out of the original allocation of US$29
million equivalent, US$27 million were utilized, with the remaining US$2 million allocated to Water
Supply, Sewerage and Flood Control (US$1.25 million), and Village Water Supply and Low Voltage
Power Networks (US$0.75 million). About 3,300 units were repaired at an average sub-loan size of about
US$8,200. While 12 banks participated as intermediaries, Privredna Banka alone accounted for about
US$11.4 million (or about 42 percent) of the total onlending. About 15 percent of the amount expended
was directed to the North East region. Around 25 schools and 15 health facilities were repaired, with the
originally allocated amounts of US$2.2 and 2.8 million being fully utilized. Allocations for the village
water supply and local low voltage power networks were increased by about 12.5 percent each with
reallocations from the Housing sub-component The reallocated amounts were fully utilized, and the two
sub-components implemented as planned.   Implementation under the Community Reconstruction
component was satisfactory.
Agriculture: Against the original loan allocation of US$19.7 million, the amount utilized was US$14
million, with the remaining US$5.7 million being reallocated to the Roads component. The reallocation
resulted from the lower than planned expenditure in the Farm Machinery sub-component. Physical targets
- 5 -



were largely met or exceeded in the case of the Veterinary and Livestock sub-components with the
exception of the purchase of mares. At the Borrower's request, this item was cancelled and the amounts
involved (US$0.5 million) reallocated within other sub-components as its priority was judged to have been
lowered with border readjustments and the resulting re-availability of previously inaccessible stock. Under
the Farm Machinery sub-component, the Borrower was able to undertake the necessary investments for the
grain driers sub-component from its own sources and, at the Borrower's request, the entire amount
(US$2.6 million) originally allocated for grain driers was reallocated to other items within the Agriculture
component. In regard to the other principal item under Farm Machinery, tractors, the originally planned
target of purchase of 230 small and medium sized tractors was exceeded at considerable cost savings on
account of favorable contract prices as compared to budget estimates. Total savings resulting within the
Agriculture component, about US$5.7 million, were reallocated for the planned purchase of an additional
250 medium sized and 20 large-sized tractors. However, due to procurement-related issues, which resulted
in re-bidding, the Borrower decided that it would go ahead with the purchase from its own funds and
requested that the amount involved be reallocated to the Roads component. The Bank concurred. Although
implementation under the Agriculture component, to a much larger extent than for any of the other
components, was affected by procurement-related matters and conclusion of end-user contracts, the
originally envisaged physical targets were largely met or exceeded, albeit with some delays. Overall
implementation is therefore assessed as satisfactory.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Not estimated given the nature of the project - emergency reconstruction.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
Given the emergency reconstruction objective and nature of the project, institutional development was not
an explicit or main objective. Nevertheless, there was a modest impact in increasing the implementational
capacities of the less experienced agencies involved in the project. This included, importantly, HKBO (now
HBOR) through its coordinating role under the project.  The Emergency Reconstruction Project
Development (ERDP) unit set up within HBOR progressively gained in experience which it is utilizing in
operations subsequently cofmanced with other international financial institutions including the EBRD.
HBOR is also involved as the Borrower in another ongoing Bank project for Municipal Environmental
Infrastructure (Loan No. 4352). Similarly, HV is utilizing the experience from the project in other Bank
operations including the ongoing Eastern Slavonia Reconstruction Project (Loan No. 4351).
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Delays in project preparation, e.g. the postponement of one year in Board presentation, or during project
implementation, e.g. the non-eligibility of the North East region for disbursement under the loan until after
the Dayton Accord in December 1995, were factors to some extent not within the control of the
Government or the implementing agencies.
-6 -



5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Ministries concerned could possibly have been more energetic in expediting inter-agency cooperation
and in facilitating the early preparation and submission of Regional Development Plans which were a
pre-condition for disbursements in the Community Reconstruction; Water Supply, Sewerage and Flood
Control; and Agriculture components.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Project implementation was slow to start due to significant delays in the conclusion of subsidiary loan
agreements and other contracts between HKBO and the other implementing agencies. Adequate staffing in
the ERPD and CRU within HKBO, and the ACMU in MAF was also a problem in the earlier stages of
implementation. Lack of procurement capacity affected in particular the less experienced agencies, notably
MAF. In this regard, the agencies did not fully utilize the possibilities of engaging appropriate technical
assistance for helping with procurement matters. The services of a procurement adviser, initially financed
through the Italian Trust Fund, were later dispensed with for lack of internal funding. Although the Bank
offered to provide for the services under the loan, this was not accepted.
5.4 Costs and financing:
Total project cost is estimated at US$221.7 million, slightly higher than the US$205.3 million estimated at
appraisal. However, this increase was largely on account of modifications in the composition of
investments to adjust to changed circumstances, including the readjustments of boundaries and areas which
obviated the need for some investments and increased the need for others. With some exceptions, there
were cost savings in most items with contract prices being lower than the corresponding budgets. Total
costs of some of the components, e.g. roads, railways and water supply and sewerage, were higher than the
original allocations on account of reallocations from other components.
The Bank loan of US$128 million equivalent was fully disbursed and accounted for about 58 percent of the
total required financing, slightly lower than estimated at appraisal.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability is assessed as likely given that the investments under the project were largely in respect of
supporting ongoing operations of the concerned sectoral agencies, or for restoring nornal activities as in
the case of support to private farmers and households.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Not applicable.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The Bank's performance in lending was satisfactory in being able to put together quickly a multi-sector
emergency reconstruction project. The hiatus of over one year in Board presentation was for reasons
beyond the Bank's control. Quality at entry was satisfactory taking into account the special circumstances
- 7 -



in which the project was prepared (as discussed earlier in Section 3). However, not all aspects could be
fully developed and designed by loan approval.  Three areas that later contributed to delays in
implementation were: (i) lack of clarity in the definition of HKBO's responsibilities as coordinating agency,
particularly in regard to procurement-related matters; (ii) inadequate preparation of procurement-related
aspects, including package design and procurement methods; and (iii) incomplete definition of end-user
contracts, including terms and conditions of delivery of goods and repayment of sub-loans. The first issue
led to substantial delays, particularly in the earlier stages of implementation, while documents submitted by
the sectoral implementing agencies were cleared by HKBO. The second and third issues affected
implementation of the Agriculture component in particular. They also led to some inconsistencies, e.g., the
fact that farmers purchasing livestock were eligible to obtain sub-loans under the project at zero percent
interest rates whereas others had to pay the higher prevailing (although subsidized) rates on loans provided
by the banks through other sources of assistance. Similarly, agricultural beneficiaries had to pay a
commission of I percent of the total sub-loan amount upfront at sub-loan signing whereas house-owners
could pay the commission over the life of the sub-loan.
7.2 Supervision:
Supervision performance was satisfactory. During project implementation, the Bank spent a total of 89
staffweeks at a cost of about US$392,700, with an annual average staff input of 16 staffweeks at a cost of
about US$71,400. Supervision was particularly intensive in the agriculture component to overcome the
weaknesses stemming from incomplete preparation of procurement-related aspects. The multi-sector nature
of the project caused some difficulties in terms of coordinating the visits of the staff concerned with not all
the staff being able to be in the field at the same time. While this led to some loss of synergy, it also
enabled a more flexible approach to supervision with sectoral staff being able to complement regular
supervision of the project with ad hoc reviews in the context of visits to Croatia for their other projects.
The number of formal supervision missions, 10, therefore understates the actual supervision undertaken in
the field. A Mid-Term Review was undertaken as scheduled, and changes made, including realloactions, to
expedite project completion.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Overall Bank performance is assessed as satisfactory. The Bank was client-responsive in making changes
during project implementation to adjust for changing circumstances through timely extension of areas
eligible for assistance, reallocations within and between components, and flexibility in procurement
requirements where justified, e.g. the use of international shopping or direct contracting to procure
equipment urgently needed for the winter season.

7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance during preparation was satisfactory with full cooperation given to the Bank in
putting together an emergency operation.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government's performance in regard to project implementation was satisfactory.  Delays in
implementation were caused by non-project related political factors, e.g. issues in relation to the Dayton
Accord.
-8 -



7.6 Implementing Agency:
Implementation agency performance was satisfactory overall, particularly for the agencies with substantial
implementational experience. Early problems were caused by the lack of adequate staffing, both in terms
of numbers and required skills, in some of the implementing agencies, particularly ERPD and CRU in
HKBO and ACMU in MAF. These were corrected as implementation proceeded, and the units concerned
became fully effective over time. Problems were also caused by the relative lack of experience on the part
of some of the agencies, particularly in regard to the Bank's procurement requirements. Procurement was
particularly problematic under the Agriculture component where virtually each major package had to be
re-bid, causing substantial delays.  In this regard, the implementing agencies concerned could have
benefited by continuing to engage the services of qualified consultants to help with procurement, but did not
fully make use of the possibilities, including through financing under the Bank loan.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall, the Borrower's performance was satisfactory, but as indicated above, could have been enhanced by
addressing in a timely manner the weaknesses identified.
8. Lessons Learned
The main lessons learned, applicable to other emergency reconstruction projects, are the following:
(i)    Complexity may not be entirely avoidable in emergency operations which need to address urgent
requirements across many sectors. The Bank should be prepared to support the Borrower through
proactive and staff-intensive involvement upfront during project preparation, and subsequently during
project implementation. Engagement by the Borrower of adequate technical assistance in project
implementation should be ensured through financing under the Bank loan, or, preferably for the Borrower,
under grant financing from donors. The Barik should assist the Borrower in exploring the latter possibility
to the fullest.
(ii)    The Bank needs to respond quickly in project preparation. Any delays can lead to changes in the
composition of assistance as the Borrower addresses the more urgent requirements first from whatever
resources are available to it. The consequent re-assessment of priorities can further delay the delivery of
Bank assistance.
(iii)   Timeliness and flexibility are of key importance during project implementation in ensuring the
effectiveness of the Bank's assistance. Changing circumstances of projects executed in politically fluid
environments call for quick adjustments within and between components.
(iv)   Special attention needs to be given to defining procurement arrangements, including installing the
required capacities in the local agencies, since time is of the essence in emergency operations. Weaknesses
in preparation place a subsequent burden through the need for intensifying supervision input to correct
deficiencies.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
(Verbatim, as provided by the Borrower)
Following successful implementation, and after the completion of the Emergency Reconstruction Project,
the Borrower conducted a survey among beneficiaries of the Loan funds (Ministry of Agriculture and
-9-



Forestry, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and Sports, Croatian Railways, Croatian Directorate
for Roads, Croatian Water Management Company, Croatian Electric Power Company). The survey
showed positive and visible results, and confirmed usefulness of the loan investments. After processing the
collected data, it was concluded that the purpose of the Project, meaning reconstruction of war-damaged
and destructed infrastructure facilities, renewal of agricultural machinery and livestock fund, reconstruction
of schools, health centers and housing facilities, was fulfilled in a best manner. Cooperation of the
Borrower with the IBRD (task managers) was very satisfactory, and in the course of this cooperation, a lot
of good experience and knowledge was acquired, and example practice obtained by the implementing
agencies and HBOR. The Borrower agrees with the final evaluation and comments as prepared by the
IBRD. Although war damages were of a much larger volume, the Emergency Reconstruction Project,
supported by the IBRD's financial and technical assistance, was the first step made towards the
normalization of living conditions in the most war-affected parts of the Republic of Croatia.
