MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF JAMAICA
FOR A ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING AND MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Government of Jamaica for US$35.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 17 years with five years of
grace and interest at the Bank's standard variable rate.
2. Background. Domestic policy reforms instituted since the beginning of
this decade and favorable external circumstances have improved Jamaica's
economy considerably during the 1980s compared to the 1970s. In the past
several years, macroeconomic indicators have steadily improved, with the best
sustained growth performance in over fifteen years. Nevertheless, Jamaica
still faces severe economic problems including a balance of payments deficit
and heavy indebtedness, and further reforms are needed to improve the
incentive system, eliminate distortions, and improve resource allocation.
Recognizing this, the Governrnent is seeking to develop viable strategies in
key sectors.
3. GOJ has identified the roads subsector as a priority sector because of its
importance to growth of the country's productive activity and the social well-
being of its citizens. Unfortunately the nation's road network, representing a
n&ulti-billion dollar asset vital to the performance of all productive sectors,
is disintegrating and traffic-related injuries and deaths are six-to-ten times
those experienced in Europe or the United States. Over 60% of the road system
is categorized as being in poor condition as a result of inadequate and/or
ineffective maintenance practices, poor investment planning and analysis, and
a deficiency in staffing and organization. Planning and evaluation of
investments are inconsistent and made more difficult by the multiplicity of
donor agencies involved in the funding of the roads subsector. The Ministry of
*         Construction (Works) IMOC(W)J is responsible for planning, design,
construction, and maintenance of public roads in Jamaica and is receiving
financing from numerous sources including USAID, EEC, Saudi Fund, IDB, CIDA,
*         CDB, the Bank, and others. External financing has typically funded 19% - 44%
of capital expenditures but has concentrated on individual projects and
primarily on technical aspects of implementation. With little coordination
among the donor agencies and organizational problems within MOC(W), these
programs compete for scarce human anid financial resources, and often have
overlapped or even had conflicting elements. Some investments were made which
were not necessarily the highest priority but were undertaken to maintain
activity in the donor's area of interest and/or utilize funding with the best
terms available.
4. Petroleum prices have recently been raised to above international prices
and total revenues generated by road transport activities (fuel taxes,
licenses and fees) far exceed expenditures. Public transport is provided by
private enterprise (currently undergoing reform with financing from the Bank)



2
and trucking is also private with freedom of access. The mix of contracting
out vs. force account in construction and maintenance is appropriate, with GOJ
seeking to privatize more design and supervision activities.
5. The primary issue in the road subsector is institutional. During the past
five years, the portfolio of MOC(W) has increased tremendously. In 1984 they
were essentially responsible for 2,900 miles of primary and secondary roads.
In 1985 all parish council roads were transferred to the Ministry (about 8,000
miles), as well as the 900 miles of urban roads in the Kingston and St. Andrew
Metropolitan Area. Economic austerity measures during this time precluded the
transfer of funds sufficient to meet these new demands, which had been
aggravated by inadequate funding during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Low
salary levels made hiring and retention of qualified staff difficult and, at
any given time, approximately 40% of the Ministry's professional positions
were, and still are, vacant. Some donor agencies, in an attempt to assure
proper execution of their project, insisted on the creation of project units,
often completely separate from the line agency normally responsible for that
type of program. For example, until recently, there were six road and bridge
maintenance programs being carried out simultaneously: five under the
direction of four different directorates and one program reporting directly to
the Permanent Secretary. There has been no systematic evaluation of
investments to establish priorities except within donor programs and,
essentially, priorities have been established more according to each donor's
perception of the needs than on economic and technical evaluation against all
proposed sectoral investments. Scarce counterpart funding was spread across
as many programs as possible with the result that there has been no
consistent, comprehensive approach to management of the island's road network.
6. Recognizing this problem, GOJ requested the Bank to assist in developing a
five-year road sector investment program which prioritized all maintenance and
investment activities proposed in the sector according to a consistent
technical, economic, and social evaluation. Government officials have met
with the various donor agencies and agreed on how the evaluated projects would
be financed, in what priority, and in what approximate time frame according to
total available funds. In conjunction with the Administrative Reform Program,
the Government has substantially increased the salaries of senior level staff
in MOC(W). This should enable them to keep experienced project directors as
well as attract junior engineers and technicians. The Ministry has agreed to,
and begun the process of, reorganization, which will provide for planning and
budgeting, and direct functional responsibility and accountability.
7. Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project is an integral part
of the Bank's over-all country strategy for Jamaica, which includes efforts to
improve efficiency within the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) through
improved economic analysis, implementation and monitoring. MOC(W) manages
over 25% of total PSIP expenditures and almost half PSIP expenditures financed
by the Central Government. The Bank's credibility with GOJ and external
lending agencies presents a unique opportunity for the Bank to take the lead,
through this project, to assist GOJ to reorganize MOC(W) and develop and
implement the mechanisms necessary to coordinate and prioritize external
funding. The Bank has financed five highway construction and maintenance
projects in Jamaica (all completed) since 1965 and there is an on-going urban



3
transport project (Ln. 2389-JM). Technical competence has steadily increased,
but inadequate human and financial resou_ces and organizational problems have
caused delays and reduced the sustainabIlity of benefits. The project is
focused on resource development and rational allocation, and organizational
and institutional changes necessary to overcome problems that affected past
projects and cope with the increased responsibilities of MOC(W).
8.  Project Objectives.  The objectives of the project are to:  (a)
strengthen the institutional capabilities of MOC(W) to plan, manage, and
maintain the road infrastructure in a cost-effective manner; (b) improve the
cost-effectiveness of the Borrower's public sector investments; and (c)
improve road safety.
9. Project Description. The proposed Road Infrastructure Planning and
Maintenance Project would finance managerial and technical strengthening of
the Ministry of Construction (Works) tMOC(W)J, and part of a US$ 302 million
five-year infrastructure investment program designed to upgrade and bring back
to a condition of maintainability, and improve safety on, the nation's road
infrastructure. Components to be financed by the project include: (i)
reorganization of MOC(W), development and annual updating of the multi-year
road infrastructure investment program, development of mechanisms to
coordinate implementation of externally funded projects within MOC(W),
development of an environmental impact assessment process, technical
assistance, training of staff, studies, and equipment to facilitate subsector
management (6%); (ii) design, construction, and supervision of selected civil
works including construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of roads and
drainage facilities, roadway geometric improvements, and traffic and safety
mprovements (90%); (iii) measures to improve the management of MOC(W) s
equipment fleet, including equipment, spare parts and tools, and management
systems (2%); and (iv) technical assistance, equipment, and other support
necessary to develop a comprehensive road safety program (2%). The project,
to be carried out over 5 years, provides funds for civil works, computer
equipment, tools and spare parts, studies, technical assistance, and training.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$50.3 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$17.1 million equivalent (34Z). A breakdown of costs
and financing are shown in Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Jamaica are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.  A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report. No. 8901-JM, dated October 16,
1990 is also attached.
10.   Agreed Actions.  The  Government has agreed to:  (i) implement the
reorganization of MOC(W): (ii) implement an equipment management program.
acceptable to the Bank; (iii) maintain full cost-recovery in respect of the
national road transport sector and maintain a pricing policy for gasoline,
diesel, lubricants, and bitumen, so as to recover fully the C.I.F. cost; (iv)
fund an annual core maintenance program of US$20, 21, 21, 23, 24 million for
FY 91/92, 92193, 93194, 94/95; (v) review with the Bank each year, and reach
agreement with the Bank on, its proposed road subsector investment program,
including the selected civil works to be financed by the Bank; (vi) hold an



4
annual coordination meeting of all internal and external agencies financially
active in the sector; (vii) implement all studies, training, and technical
assistance in accordance with agreed descriptions and schedule; and (viii)
advise the Bank of any surface transport investment exceeding US$5.0 million
during the project implementation period, provide information on the impact of
such investments on the Bank project and/or the Five-Year Investment Program,
and give the Bank adequate opportunity to comment on such investment prior to
its commencement.
11.   Benefits.  The project will precipitate institutional improvements in
the operation of MOC(W) and more cost-effective management of a major portion
of the PSIP. The useful life of infrastructure will be increased, and vehicle
operating costs reduced. Efficient operations will encourage continued funding
by external donors. Overall, the project's economic return is in excess of
402.
12.   Risks.  There is the risk that sufficient budget allocations and/or
timely authorization by the Ministry of Finance to spend allocated funds
(warrants) will not be made consistently during the life of the project. The
annual review mechanisms will help assure that, if external factors do
constrain desirable funding levels, the core maintenance program will remain
and capital investments that are funded will be of the highest priority. The
Government has, however, confirmed the priority of the program and its funding
needs, and warrant releases have been changed to a quarterly rather than
monthly basis. As part of macro-policy dialogue, Bank representatives will
still need to review periodically with Government the priorities of this
program.
13.   Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
