AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN 2304-PA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is a Completion Report on the Agricultural Credit Project
(Loan 2304-PA), for which a loan of US$40.0 million was approved on June 7,
1983. The legal documents were signed on August 10, 1983, and the loan
became effective on March 23, 1984. The Closing Date for the loan was
expected to be June 30, 1988, but the actual Closing Date was June 30, 1986.
The final disbursement took place in April 1987. The total US$40.0 million
of the loan was fully disbursed.
The project was the twelfth Bank/IDA-supported agricultural project
in Paraiguay. These projects comprised a general-purpose agricultural project
in 1951, followed by five livestock projects, four rural development
projects, and a livestock and agricultural development project. This agri-
cultural credit project was the first country-wide credit project. The two
latest completed projects, for which project completion reports have recently
been prepared, were the Second Rural Development Project (Loan 1418-PA) and
the Livestock and Agricultural Development Project (Loan 1674-PA). For both
projects the objectives, in general, were attained.
This report was prepared by Agriculture Division A of the Latin
America and the Caribbean Regional Office on the basis of country visits in
February 1986 and February 1987; a Completion Report prepared by the
Agricultural Department (AD) of the Paraguayan National Development Bank
(BNF) delivered to the World Bank on September 10, 1986; information on the
project which is available in the Bank, such as: the Appraisal Report
No. 4382a-PA dated May 16, 1983, the Loan Agreement and Project Agreement
dated August 10, 1983; supervision reports, correspondence with the Borrower
and internal Bank memoranda as contained in relevant Bank files; and
discussions with Bank staff associated with the project.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower for coments
*          on February 25, 1988.  A telex received from Banco Nacional de Fomen.o is
attached to the PCR.
*                    This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

PARAGUAY
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN 2304-PA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction and Objectives
1.        This project was the twelfth Bank/IDA-supported agricultural
project in Paraguay. The objectives of the project were to increase agricul-
tural output, including the production of export crops, and to help farmers
to increase their earnings and improve their living conditions (para. 2.02).
To attain these objectives, the project included a program of long-term and
short-term credit for financing on-farm investments, as well as incremental
operating costs. The project also financed the strengthening of BNF's office
equipment and vehicles used in its agricultural credit operations
(para. 2.03).
Implementation Experience
2.        The project was completed two years ahead of schedule because the
loan was disbursed much faster than anticipated. There were many reasons for
this: (a) front-loading of the Bank's contribution by using a higher
disbursement percentage initially; (b) the pent-up demand for long-term
credit at the start of implementation; (c) the favorable exchange rate for
imports made under the project; (d) the country 3njoyed good weather, rains
and crop yields during 1984 and 1985; and (e) there was a great demand for
new agricultural machinery (paras. 3.01 and 3.05). In addition, the
onlending interest rate on subloans (an effective rate of 21% throughout the
implementation period), which had been positive in real terms in 1983 when
the inflation rate was 14.1%, was negative in 1984-86, when annual inflation
rates were 29.8%, 23.1% and 24.1%, respectively. B2ginniug in late 1986,
interest rates turned positive and are expected to continue to be positive in
real terms. The negative onlending rates are likely to have contributed to
the demand for credit in 1984 and the first half of 1985, by which time
disbursement of the credit component had been completed. The project cost
was about the same as estimated at appraisal (para. 3.10). The performance
of the implementing agency, the Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF), was
satisfactory (para. 4.01).
Results
3.        The main objective of increasing agricultural output and specifi-
cally increasing export crops has been attained by the project, since soybean
production increased 5% in only one agricultural year (para. 7.01). The



cultivated area and total production were higher than anticipated at
appraisal (para. 6.03). However, prices of the main project
commodities--soybean, cotton and wheat--decreased in the international
markets during the period 1982-86 in constant terms. Consequently, the FRR
and ERR of the project were not as good as anticipated at appraisal
kpara. 6.06). The project was successful in increasing the number of
tractors, combines and other agricultural machinery (para. 6.04). The
project benefited about 9,000 producers, almost twice the number ?stimated at
appraisal, and a great majority of them acquired imported agricultural
machinery.
Sustainability
4.        The prospects for sustainability of lending for similar projects by
the implementing agency do not appear good, because there is a severe
shortage of BNF funds for medium- and long-term subloans. Credit activities
will, however, continue, albeit at a slower rate, utilizing the recovery of
previous Bank credit project funds and other lines of credit that may be
furnished by other external financial institutions.
Findings and Lessons Learned
5.        The main lessons to be learned are that: (a) although the project
was a good vehicle for improving the BNF's operational efficiency, it failed
to organize a BNF M&E system. The Bank should provide more guidance at the
start of a project to establish an H&E system; (b) BNF and the Central Bank
did not review/modify once a year the interest rate on subloans under the
project. The Bank should itself initiate such discussions early on and
should provide assistance to take necessary actions; (c) this project was
quickly disbursed due to the favorable exchange rate used for disbursement
purposes (US$1 - G 160) compared to the parallel market rate (US$1 - G 400).
If the Bank had acted on the exchange rate problem earlier, before
substantial disbursements were made, the loan would not have been di<0ursed
as fast, and perhaps the project would have been substantially delayed
(para. 7.02).



PARAGUAY
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
(LOAN 2304-PA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      At the end of 1981, the Paraguayan economy was expanding at an
annual average rate of about 3.5%. The population was about 3.1 million, 70%
rural. The agricultural sector was the most important and was doing better
than the whole economy. The value of agricultural production was growing at
an annual average rate of about 7%. The sector accounted for about 31% of
GDP, over 95% of the country's total exports, and nearly half of employment.
Sector growth resulted mainly from expansion of cropped areas in the eastern
part of the country, and favorable international prices for Paraguay's main
exports, soybean and cotton. Other important factors supporting this
development were the construction and improvements of roads in the eastern
region, and the demand originating from the construction of the Itaipu Dam.
The Bank has been supporting this process by financing a number of projects
designed to upgrade the technical and economic status of small and
medium-sized farmers in existing settlements, and also of new settlers.
1.02      Agriculture is still the most important sector in the economy and
continues to grow, albeit at a lower rate (5.7%), The population is now
3.3 million, 60% rural. The sector still accounts for about 30% of GDP, over
95% of the country's total exports, and nearly half of employment. There are
still possibilities for further growth. Tne land resources for crop and
livestock production are used at, respectively, only 30% and 70% of
their potential. Implementation of the two ongoing Bank-assisted
projects--the Caazapa Area Development Project (Loan 2087-PA) and the Eje
Norte Rural Development Project (Loan 2141-PA)--was delayed due to issues
(foreign exchange rate and subloan interest rate) that have recently been
resolved. However, the Agricultural Credit Project was completed two years
ahead of schedule, as explained further in para. 3.01.
11. PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Identification Through Board Approval
2.01      The project was identified in February 1982 by an FAO/CP-Bank
mission, and preparation was completed by the Government and FAO/CP in August
1982. It was appraised by the Bank during November 1982. Negotiations took
place in Washington, D.C., on April 25-28, 1983. The loan was approved by
the Board on June 7, 1983, without significant discussion.
B. Project Objectives and Components
2.02      The main objectives of the project were to increase agricultural
output, including production of export crops for which Paraguay enjoys a
comparative advantage, and to help small- and medium-scale farmers to
increase their earnings and thereby improve their living conditions. To



-2-
attain these objectives, the project provided funds to the National Develop-
ment Bank (BNF) to alleviate the scarcity of long-term resources for financ-
ing such development and to strengthen BNF's institutional capability.
2.03      The project included two components.  The major one consisted of a
program of long-term credit for financing on-farm investments, as well as
short-term credit for incremental operating costs. The minor component
financed a program to strengthen BNF's staff capabilities and expand the
office equipment and vehicles used in its agricultural credit operations.
The latter component was intended to complement Phase It of a Technical
issistance Program (TAP) financed mainly by BNF using its own resources, but
also with small amounts from IDB and the Bank. Tthe TAP program was designed
to strengthen BNF's accounting and computing services, financial management
and loan administration.
^. Cost and Financing
2.04      At appraisal, the total project cost was estimated at
US$72.0 million equivalent. The Bank loan of US$40.0 million was to finance
the full foreign exchange component, net of taxes and duties (55%). BNF was
to provide US$25.0 million (35Z). Project beneficiaries were to contribute
the remaining US$7.0 million (10%). However, during negotiations, the
Paraguayan delegation indicated that, because of growing budget deficits and
restrictive monetary policy, the Government could not assume the obligation
to provide the counterpart funds on this basis. Therefore, certain actions
were agreed to allow the bulk of the counterpart funds to be generated by the
project itself. It was agreed that: (a) the Ban- financing share of total
project cost remained unchanged; (b) the lending program was reduced from
US$60.0 million to US$55.0 million, a formula under which the average Bank
disbursement over the value of subloans increased from 62% to 70% (the Bank
front-loaded disbursements at the rate of 80% for the first US$20.0 million
of subloans made by BNF, and fell to 64% fo- the balance of US$36.0 million
of subloans); (c) no price contingency was included for the credit component;
(d) the farmers' contribution to the project cost under the on-farm develop-
ment component was increased from an estimated 10% to 20%; and (e) BNF would
have to contribute no more than US$4.0 million equivalent from its own
resources, and funds generated by the project would be sufficient to sustain
the project lending program over the implementation period. Under these
arrangements, the total project cost remained at US$72.0 million equivalent.
The Bank loan of US$40.0 million was still to finance the full foreign
exchange component (55%).  BNF was to provide about US$4.0 million of Its own
funds and about US$14.0 million was to be generated by the project lending
program (25%). Project beneficiarias were to contribute the remaining
US$14.0 million (20%).
III. PROJECT DMPLEMENTATION
A. Implementation Schedule
3.01      The loan became effective on March 23, 1984, after three and
one-half months delay, because the Government's signing of the subsidiary
loan agreement with BNF took more time than anticipated. According to
appraisal projections, the project was to be completed by December 31, 1987,



- 3 -
and the Closing Date was to be June 30, 1988. Completion was a',ead of
schedule by two years because the loan was disbursed much faster than
anticipated during appraisal. The main reasons for this were: (a) the Bank
loan included front-loading of the Bank's disbursements which reduced the
need for counterpart funding; (b) there was pent-up demand for investment
credit by medium-scale farmers at the start of implementation; and (c) credit
recipie-ts received a favorable rate of exchange for the imporcs made under
the project, and this fact created a strong demand for credit.  In addition,
the onlending interest rate on subloans (an effective rate of 21% throughout
the implementation period), which had been positive in real terms in 1983
when the inflation rate was 14.1%, was negative in 1984-86, when annual
inflation rates were 29.8%, 23.1% and 24.1%, respectively. Beginning in late
1986, interest rates turned positive and are expected to continue to be
positive in real terms. The negative onlending rates are likely to have
contributed to the demand for credit in 1984 and the first half of 1985, by
which time d4sbursement of the credit component had been completed.
B. Implementation of Project Components
The Exchange Rate Issue
3.02      An important discussion between the Bank and the Paraguayan
Government took place during project implementation concerning the exchange
rate applicable to the disbursements of Bank loans in Paraguay, which
remained at G 160 per dollar (about 40% of the officially sanctioned exchange
rate of the Paraguay parallel market). On May 29, 1985, when almost 100% of
the project credit funds had already been committed (see Annex 1, Table 2),
the Government sent a letter to the Bank stating that it intended to raise
the exchange rate for Bank disbursements from G 160 per dollar to G 240 per
dollrr, with the proviso that this rate would be adjusted later based on the
result of an on-going Government study on required economic adjustment
measures, including the exchange rate issue. The Bank concluded at that time
that the proposed rate of G 240 per dollar was not satisfactory. If the Bank
had acted on the exchange rate problem earlier, before substantial
disbursements were made, then the loan would not have been disbursed as fast,
and, perhaps, the project would have been substantially delayed.  There wJere
prolonged negotiations between the Government and the Bank on the exchange
rate issue starting in mid-1985; the issue was resolved only in late 1986.
In the meantime, other projects suffered serious delays due to virtual
suspens'on of disbusements.
Agricultural Credit
3.03      The project provided a lending program of about US$56 million over
a three-year investment period to finance some 5,000 farmers throughout the
country, the majority of them in the eastern region (about US$38 million was
expected to finance mediumr- and long-term subloans). Project beneficiaries
included small- and medium-scale farmers with up to 200 ha of crop land. The
project financed credit for on-farm investments, mainly mechanized destumping
of fields; purchasing farm machinery, including tractors, tilling implements
and soybean harvesters; on-farm roads; soil conservation practices; and
short-term credit for the production of annual crops.

3.04      At completion, 4,750 subloans were granted (95% of appraisal
estimate). However, out of the total subloans, 4,729 were individual sub-
borrowers and 21 were producer organizations (cooperatives), through which
more than 4,250 productive small units were financed. Therefore, the total
number of project beneficiaries was about 9,000, as shown below:
Sub-borrowers                Beneficiaries
Individuals                  4,729                         4,729
Associations                    21                         4,271
Total       4,750                         9,000
The average amount per subloan and the total amount of subloans for
investment in real terms and in current prices are shown in Annex 1,
Table 1.
3.05      Commitments and disbursements of credit funds proceeded at a faster
rate than anticipated at appraisal because, in addition to the reasons
given above in para. 3.01, during project implementation (1984 and 1985), the
country enjoyed good weather, rains and crop yields. Moreover, there was a
great need for new agricultural machinery, mainly to replace the old ones,
and also because of the great demand for mechanized land clearing and soybean
cropping and harvesting. Investment subloans were essentially granted to
finance land clearing (35%) and the purchase of agricultural machinery
(50%). Other investments were granted to finance on-farm infrastructure:
buildings and installations (10%); permanent crops (4%); and to purchase
working animals (1%).
3.06      The executing agency was BNF through 40 of its 48 field offices.
BNF provided (through its technical assistance offices) technical assistance
to about 2,500 new sub-borrowers under the project. This assistance was
complementary to the technical assistance provided (through its 100 offices)
by the specialized State-owned agency: Agricultural and Livestock Extension
Service (SEAG) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG). For
technical assistance purposes, BNF retained 87 professionals (about two per
field office), most of them agricultural engineers, agronomists and
veterinarians, who worked in coordination with the SEAG extensionists under
the framework of a BNF/SEAG agreement. Each SEAG extensionist attended about
60 farmers. BNF's professional staff supervised this technical assistance
effort. No comprehensive assessment has been done on the 4uality of the
extension service due to the quick disbursement of project credit funds.
However, in general, this arrangement worked satisfactorily.
3.07      It is not possible to assess the loan recovery situation, because
the investment credit funds were disbursed in such a short period of time
that most of the subloans are still in the grace period (see Annex 1,
Table 2). Moreover, during 1984 and 1985, the financial situation of farmers
and credit recovery improved and BNF recovered many subloans that had been
overdue since the 1980 crop year. In June 1985, after one and one-half
agricultural years of project implementation, BNF had recovered
G 2,700 million (US$18.5 million equivalent) from the project short-term
subloans. Loan recoveries were subsequently relent in the next ag:icultural
years, partly as BNF counterpart funds (para. 2.04(e)).



- 5 -
3.08      BNF does not keep records of the arrears of its different agricul-
tural lines of credit (about ten), and the information received included the
amounts of its consolidated agricultural portfolio made up of short- ,
medium- and long-term subloans. The rate of recovery of the total BNF
agricultural portfolio, measured as the ratio relating the amount actually
repaid during a given period to the sum of the arrears at the beginning of
the period and the amount that fell due during the period, ranged from 70% in
1982 to 82% in 1986.
Institutional Development
3.09      To help improve BNF's operational efficiency and services to
farmers, the project provided financing for 101 vehicles for field staff,
which enhanced mobility and the frequency of contact with farmers, and some
office equipment, which expedited processing of loan requests and
supervision. In most cases, more items were procured than anticipated at
appraisal, suggesting high estimates of unit prices at appraisal. The
following table compares the estimated and actual acquisition of vehicles and
equipment:

D. Disbursements
3.11      The proceeds of the Bank loan were expected to be disbursed over a
period of five years. However, for the reasons given above in para. 3.01,
actual disbursements under the credit component were completed in 14 months
and total project disbursement occurred during the first three years of
project implementation. However, the actual amounts of disbursements were
virtually the same as estimated at loan signing, as shown below:

E. Procurement
3.12      Vehicles and office equipment for BNF were procured through ICB,
which was satisfactory. Project beneficiaries, using the proceeds of
subloans, purchased on-farm development inputs, tractors and farm machinery
from established local agents, and no serious problems were encountered.
F. Reporting
3.13      BNF was responsible for monitoring the progress of the project and
evaluating the impact of the investments financed under the project. BNF was
supposed to establish a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) unit not later than
March 23, 1985. In spite of the fact that BNF has been satisfactorily
delivering monthly reporL , which contained data on financial and physical
implementation of the credit component, it failed to organize a system to



-7-
monitor and evaluate the project. However, in June 1985, BNF sent to the
Bank a general study to organize its M&E system for all its credit programs.
It was not implemented.
G. Auditing
3.14      Separate project accounts were to be kept by BNF.  Financial state-
ments for BNF as a whole and those for the project were autdited annually by
an independent auditor. BNF's audit reports for 1983 and 1984 pointed out
deficiencies in its accounting system and internal controls. The biggest
problem was lack of consolidated data on BNF's credit operations in its
branches. BNF's 1984 audit report was received with some delay, but the 1985
report was on time.
H. Compliance with Loan Covenants
3.15      BNF did not review/modify the interest rate on subloans under the
project to keep them positive when compared to the average cost of living
index in Paraguay. This review had to be done not later than April 1 of each
year, in compliance with the Project Agreement, Article II, Section 2.09 (a).
3.16      The Government of Paraguay (Borrower) did not cause its Central
Bank to take all such steps to enable BNF to comply with the provisions of
reviewing or modifying the interest rate on subloans under the
project, consistent with the Loan Agreement, Article III, Section 3.02.
3.17      Other covenants not complied with in the Project Agreement were:
(a)  P.A. Section 2.10: not later than twelve months after the effective
date, BNF shall prepare and put into effect a system for monitoring
progress in the execution of the project and evaluating tile
socioeconomic impact of the investments financed under the project;
(b)  P.A. Section 3.05 (b): not later than June 30 each year, BNF shall:
(i) review with the Bank progress in the implementation of the
Technical Assistance Prograu (TAP) II and the Debt Recovery Plan;
and (ii) update the programs for the implementation of TAP II and
the Debt Recovery Plan in terms satisfactory to the Bank.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
4.01      BNF, the executing agency through its Agriculture Department
(AD), has implemented the project satisfactorily. Implementation was very
quick as explained before.  The Bank increased its supervision effort during
implementation when it seemed that the favorable exchange rate might have led
to some diversion of project funds. However, field checks during both
supervision and PCR missions turned up no evidence of funds being diverted
from project purposes. BNF did not organize a M&E unit and had difficulty in
assessing the impact of the project, because it had no previous experience in
ex-post project evaluation.
V. ROLE OF THE BANK
5.01      The role played by tLe Bank, starting with project preparation and
throughout the execution of the project, was satisfactory and relations with



- 8 -
BNF remained cordial. The Bank was flexible during negotiations in
responding to the Paraguayan delegation's problem with counterpart funds.
The Bank's role in the supervision of the project was straightforward, and
supervision was carried out regularly. There was a continual open dialogue
and most problems were quickly resolved. However, regarding the BNF
commitment to organizing a system for project monitoring and evaluation, the
Bank could have taken a more forceful position early on to ensure proper
compliance with this condition of the loan.
VI. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
6.01      The analysis of the impact of the project was based on field work
in the project area conducted by BNF staff at the end of the 1985/86
agricultural year. About 260 farms were surveyed and the inquiry took into
account: farm size, capital investments, the incremental farm size gained by
the project and technology levels. Based on these results, three techno-
logical levels of farms were established: (a) improved traditional (animal
traction); (b) semi-mechanized; and (c) mechanized. Regarding cropping
patterns, farm size and technological levels, no considerable differences
were found with the farm models that were analyzed at appraisal. However,
the main differences found that are directly related to farm profitability
are: (a) the size of the farms' incremental area, which in the actual
situation is notably less than estimated at appraisal; and (b) the farm
models analyzed do not include benefits derived from livestock production and
from renting agricultural machinery to other farmers. These two elements
were included in the farm models at appraisal.
6.02      The following table summarizes the three farm models surveyed and
analyzed compared with the ones analyzed at appraisal:

6.03      The increased production was a direct consequence of increasing the
cropped area by clearing and destumping new areas of existing farms. In
addition some new farms from the forest have recently been opened to
production by the construction of new feeder roads or by upgrading other
roads.

6.05      The actual economic rate of return (ERR) for the whole project was
estimated at about 20%, compared to appraisal estimates that varied from 22%
to 100% (at appraisal, the ERRs were estimated from the analysis of each farm
model). The basic assumptions for the actual ERR calculations were: (a) a
shadow foreign exchange of G 600 per dollar was used: (b) farmgate economic
prices were estimated from the 1986 Bank price projections, adjusted by
freight, insurance, handling, etc.; (c) in the absence of conversion
factors, the total financial cost of the project was used, adjusted to 1986
constant prices; (d) due to the low level of unemployment in the project



- 10 -
area, the opportunity cost of labor (family and hired) was taken at its
market price; and (e) the estimated useful life of the project was 20 years.
Annex 1, Table 3 shows the actual ERR calculations.
6.06      Although the project cultivated area and total production
were higher than anticipated at appraisal, the project FRR and ERL were not
as good as anticipated. This is mainly because the prices of the main
project commodities-soybean, cotton and wheat--decreased in the
international markets, in constant terms, during the period 1982/1986 by 26%,
42Z and 17Z, respectively.
VII. SUMMARY AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      Summary.  The main objective of increasing agricultural output and
specifically increasing export crops has been attained by the project, since
soybean production increased 51 in only one agricultural year. About 9,000
producers benefited from the project (almost twice the appraisal estimate),
and a great number of them acquired imported agricultural machinery taking
advantage of the favorable foreign exchange rate. This was one of the main
reasons for the rapid disbursement of credit funds. The cultivated area and
the total production were higher than estimated at appraisal. However,
prices of the main project commodities decreased in the international
markets, and the financial and economic results of the project were nct as
good as anticipated at appraisal. The project cost was almost the same as
estimated at appraisal. The bulk of disbursements of the loan took place
over 14 months, and completion was achieved two years ahead of schedule. No
evidence of diversion of funds has been found. The performance of the
implementing agency (BNF) has been satisfactory.
7.02      Lessons Learned
(a) This project was a good vehicle for streamlining BNF's operational
efficiency and services to farmers through financing vehicles and
equipment for field staff; however, it failed to organize a BNF M&E
system. The Bank should have provided more direct guidance in
establishing an adequate M&E system at the start of the project.
(b) The Bank left BNF and CB to take the initiative in
reviewing/modifying, once a year, the interest rate on subloans
under the project to keep them positive. BNF and CB did not comply
with this obligation, as explained in paras. 3.15 and 3.16. The
Bank should initiate such discussions with the Government early on
and should provide guidance and assistance on required actions. It
should then be more forceful in obtaining compliance with legal
documents if the actions agreed upon are not implemented.
(c) Many things occurred simultaneously to produce a very quick
disbursement of project funds (paras. 3.01 and 3.05). One of the
main reasons for this was the low exchange rate used for
disbursement purposes (US$1 - G 160) compared to the parallel
market rate (US$1 - G 400). If the Bank had acted on the problem
of the exchange rate earlier, before substantial disbursements were
made, the project would not have been disbursed as fast, and
perhaps the project would have been substantially delayed
(para. 3.02).
