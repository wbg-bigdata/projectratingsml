REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ELECTRICIDAD S.A. WITH
THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE FOR A
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (ENDESA), with the
guarantee of the Republic of Chile, for the equivalent of US$35.0 million
to help finance a sixth power project. The loan would have a term of 17
years, including 3 1/2 years of grace, with interest at 8.7 percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Chile in October/November 1975, and
its findings are contained in Report No. 966-CH, entitled an "Economic
Memorandum on Chile", issued on December 24, 1975. Updating missions visited
Chile in May and November 1976. Annex I contains country data sheets. A
memorandum discussing Chile's current economic situation and prospects is
attached hereto as Annex IV.   It contains an account of the emergency
measures taken by the Chilean authorities to deal with the severe foreign
exchange constraint that resulted from the collapse of copper prices in 1975
as well as the longer-term policies intended to lay the basis for future
sustained growth. In light of the progress of these efforts and the conse-
quent improvement in the nation's external accounts, as well as of Chile's
excellent human and physical resource base and of the prospects for export
growth, Chile is considered creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CHILE
3.        Among developing countries, Chile is the Bank's oldest borrower.
The first development loan ever extended by the Bank was made to Chile in
1948 and, in subsequent years, the Bank has made 21 loans totaling US$296.8
million, net of cancellations. The Association has also extended one credit
of US$19 million to the country for a road project. IFC commitments in
Chile come to US$21.2 million with US$15 million of this amount committed
to copper mining and the remainder to industry. The Corporation presently
holds US$9.6 million of its Chilean commitments. Bank Group loans and
credits made to, or guaranteed by, the Republic of Chile constituted about
5.9 percent of Chile's total indebtedness (including undisbursed amounts)
in December 1975 and accounted for about 3.9 percent of the country's 1975
debt service obligations after rescheduling.
4.        Of total Bank and IDA lending to Chile, 42 percent has been for
power, 17 percent for mining, 15 percent for roads, and 13 percent for
agriculture. The remaining 13 percent has been earmarked for industry,
education and technical assistance.
This document has a rtricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



5.        Historically, the volume of Bank lending to Chile has fluctuated
substantially, varying in accordance with the country's economic perform-
ance and the availability of suitable projects. In FY71-73 the Bank did
not lend to Chile because of the severe deterioration in economic and
financial management described in the memorandum on Chile's economy. In
FY74 the Bank increased the amount of two existing loans to finance up to
US$8.3 million of interest and other charges and also made a US$5.25 million
Technical Assistance Loan. The Bank's most recent Chilean operations were
the US$20 million loan for agricultural rehabilitation and the US$33 million
loan for a copper sector project approved by the Executive Directors in May
1975 and February 1976, respectively.
6.        Execution of Bank-financed projects has, on the whole, been satis-
factory. In the case of the highway and education loans made in 1970,
however, a high rate of inflation coupled with deteriorating conditions in
the local construction industry and a shortage of counterpart funds combined
to slow down markedly project implementation. The difficulties facing these
projects are gradually being overcome, however, and their execution is
returning to a satisfactory basis. A summary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC commitments to Chile as at October 31, 1976, and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects are contained in Annex II.
7.        In addition to the proposed power rehabilitation loan and the one
for agricultural credit being presented to the Executive Directors at the
same time, the Government and Bank are also working on the preparation of a
DFC project designed to stimulate export-oriented industries and to strengthen
Chile's development banks network and on a rural development project aimed
at assisting poor farmers. The presentation of these projects to the.
Executive Directors will depend on the maintenance of sound economic policies
which give promise of strengthening creditworthiness, stimulating growth and
improving income distribution.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
8.        Characteristics:  Chile has an installed generating capacity of
about 2,600 MW, of which 55 percent is hydro. Generation reached 8,700 GWH
in 1975. The central zone of the country, where about 85 percent of the
population lives, is served by the Central Interconnected System (CIS).
Northern and southern Chile is sparsely populated and is served by smaller,
isolated systems. The extreme north also includes captive plants serving
the copper and nitrate industries.
9.        Historically, electricity consumption in Chile has grown at about
8 percent annually. However, severe economic disruptions limited this growth
rate to about 3.4 percent per annum during 1969-1975 or to 5.6 percent if captive
plants are excluded. But even this reduced growth occurred in an uneven fashion:
while industrial and commercial consumption grew at only about 6.3 and 3.6
percent annually, respectively, underpriced residential consumption grew at
9.1 percent annually (33 percent in 1972-73 alone).



10.       Institutional Framework:  The Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A.
(ENDESA) is, by far, the dominant entity within Chile's power sector. The
Government-owned agency was set-up in 1944 and given responsibility for
implementing Chile's national electrification plan. Today it operates 12
hydro plants, 25 thermal plants and 6,785 circuit-km of transmission lines;
its distribution subsidiaries have about 6,300 km of distribution lines. In
1975, ENDESA accounted for 56 percent of all electricity generated in Chile
and nearly 80 percent of electricity generated in the CIS. The second
largest company is the Companifa Chilena de Electricidad S.A. (Chilectra),
which serves Santiago and Valparaiso --Chile's largest cities-- and accounted
for 20 percent of CIS generation in 1975. Two other small private distribu-
tion companies also generate marginal amounts of public sector electricity
in the CIS.
11.       The division of responsibility between ENDESA and Chilectra reflects
the historical development of Chile's power sector. ENDESA has specialized
as a bulk supplier in the CIS, concentrating on generation and transmission
works while relying on cooperatives and smaller distribution companies (some
of which ENDESA controls) for distribution in the outlying areas of the CIS.
ENDESA also operates a number of isolated full-service utilities (which it
calls distribution companies) outside the CIS but most of its managerial
effort and talent are devoted to its function as a bulk supplier of electric-
ity. Chilectra has become primarily a distribution company for its original
concession zone, which covers the most densely populated portion of the CIS;
its own generation facilities supply less than 50 percent of its present
needs and this percentage is scheduled to increase slightly upon completion
of Chilectra's Ventanas No. 2 plant but to decrease thereafter. Further
specialization by both companies seems desirable for the sector's efficiency
and,. as management and administrative problems connected with the country's
economic situation subside, they will be able to resume sector rationaliza-
tion.
12.       Future Development:  Chile's best hopes for abundant and reasonably
priced electric power in the future lie in the development of her excellent
hydro potential while work proceeds in the exploitation of petroleum and coal
resources to reduce Chile's present heavy dependence on imported petroleum.
Chile produces about a quarter of its crude oil requirements but production
is declining and deposits under exploitation will be virtually exhausted by
1980. Worldwide shortages of offshore drilling equipment and lack of capital
for drilling have delayed further exploration and development of oil and
gas deposits in the country's southernmost province, Magallanes. The
National Petroleum Company (ENAP), however, launched a development drilling
program in the Straits of Magellan in late 1976. The Inter-Amerzican
Development Bank (IDB) is considering financial assistance for the construc-
tion of a liquified natural gas plant in Magallanes, some of the studies for
which were financed under the Bank's Technical Assistance Loan (978-CH).
Undersea coal mines near Concepcion, whose expansion was financed with the
aid of two Bank loans (171-CH and 172-CH), produce low-grade coal, about



- 4 -
half of which is used in electricity generation. The National Coal Company
(ENACAR) is planning the expansion of these mines deeper undersea; the
Government also plans to exploit other low-grade coal deposits in Magallanes.
13.       Reflecting Chile's resource situation, ENDESA's 1970 power develop-
ment plan contemplated greater long-term reliance on hydro-generation. How-
ever, the financial difficulties experienced by ENDESA since then (summarized
in paragraphs 20-21 below) forced it to postpone much of that development
and to rely increasingly on thermal plants to meet medium-term incremental
requirements. ENDESA's present strategy continues to emphasize hydro
development and its current program calls for the installation of 800 MW
of hydro capacity during 1981-84. ENDESA has identified 76 potential hydro
sites with an estimated total capacity of over 8,600 MW. All of these sites
are located between latitudes 270 S and 420 S where most of Chile's popula-
tion lives. Pre-feasibility studies are under way on eight of these sites.
The IDB is financing the Antuco hydroelectric project (300 MW), now expected
to be completed in 1981 and ENDESA has applied for Bank assistance in
financing the next hydro project (Colbun-Machicura, 500 MW) construction of
which is expected to get underway towards the end of this decade. Other
projected investments in the electric sector include: (i) the installation
of transmission and distribution lines associated with new generation plants;
(ii) improvements in the presently overloaded Chilectra system; (iii) the
interconnection by 1981 of ENDESA's and Mendoza's (Argentina) systems to take
advantage of different seasonal load patterns; (iv) a rural electrification
program to increase rural service from 35 percent, presently, to about 50
percent of the rural population by 1982; and (v) ENDESA's rehabilitation
program which the proposed loan discussed in Part IV of this report would
help finance.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
14.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's sixth for the power sector
in Chile and the latest in a series of loans --totalling US$131.3 million,
net of cancellations-- to ENDESA, the Bank's oldest client in a developing
country. The Bank's first loan to ENDESA dates back to 1948 and the most
recent, Loan 479-CH in the amount of US$66.4 million for a Fifth Power
Project, was approved in 1966. All five loans have been fully disbursed and
the projects they helped finance were completed successfully, and on sched-
ule, with the exception of the Rapel Hydroelectric component of Loan 244-CH
of 1959 and a small river diversion component of the Fifth Power Project
(Loan 479-CH of 1966). Events largely beyond ENDESA's control (a severe
earthquake, floods, difficult rock conditions and strikes) delayed Rapel's
completion by three years, to 1968. Completion of the Fifth Power Project's
river diversion component has been delayed by four years --to late 1977--
owing to a contractor's unsatisfactory performance and subsequent discharge,
to a lack of equipment and to unexpectedly difficult tunnelling conditions,



-5-
15.       The proposed project was first appraised in October 1974 and sub-
sequent missions updated this appraisal in April 1975 and in November 1976.
The appraisal mission's report (788a-CH, dated December 1, 1976)entitled
"Appraisal of a Sixth Power Project" is being distributed separately.
Annex III contains a Loan and Project Summary. Negotiation of the loan took
place from November 15 to 19, 1976 and the Chilean delegation was headed by
Mr. Sergio Lorenzini, ENDESA's Financial Manager.
16.       Project Description:   The project consists of ENDESA's system
rehabilitation program which includes, principally, small generation, trans-
mission and distribution works that would have been carried out during 1971-
1974 had the necessary resources been available. More specifically, the
project calls for:
(i) Improvements in ENDESA's transmission and distribution
network to correct overloads and to meet expected
growth in demand;
(ii) the purchase of equipment (a) to maintain ENDESA's
facilities and do specialized construction work;
(b) to carry out studies aimed at identifying and preparing
future projects; and (c) to replace outmoded or worn out
equipment at ENDESA's laboratories and general offices;
(iii) the installation of a modern load dispatching/tele-
communications system which would enable ENDESA to
operate the CIS more efficiently and to respond quickly
to problem situations which occur;
(iv) spare parts to keep up existing hydro and thermal
plants;
(v) installation of new generating equipment or the conver-
sion of existing units to enable them to burn cheaper
fuels. This is needed to overcome inefficient operating
conditions in isolated areas; and
(vi) consulting services to help prepare future projects.
17.       This project would depart from the Bank's past lending for power
in Chile which concentrated on construction of generating facilities. In-
stead, the objective of the project is to help restore reliable electric
service. This requires overcoming serious and widespread operating problems
such as system overloads, energy losses, voltage reductions and frequent outages
and breakdowns of old generation, construction and transportation equipment,
which cause unreasonably high maintenance costs and disrupt construction and



- 6 -
maintenance schedules. These problems result from years of insufficient
resources being devoted to upkeep or replacement of installed capacity.
Elimination of these problems will free ENDESA from having to resort to
additional high cost thermal generation and enable it to concentrate on the
development of Chile's hydroelectric resources.
18.       The project would be carried out over a four-year period, from
1977 through 1980. ENDESA's own staff would be responsible for its engineer-
ing and physical execution, with technical assistance from suppliers' repre-
sentatives where needed. ENDESA has successfully designed and installed
works similar to those included in the project and has the capacity to
execute this project.
19.       Although it is government-owned, ENDESA is autonomous, except
for rate setting. Its Board, made up of 11 members selected by the National
Development Corporation (CORFO), limits itself to the consideration of policy
matters and to the appointment of senior staff. Project planning and
implementation, the system's operation and day-to-day matters are the
responsibility of ENDESA's management which is capable and experienced; many
of the company's professional staff, particularly at higher levels, have had
20-30 years of experience with ENDESA. Political upheavals during 1971-73
and the current policy limiting salaries at government agencies have caused
an above-average turnover among younger, less experienced professionals at
the company. To replace them, however, ENDESA has launched an internal
training program and its progress would be monitored during project super-
vision.
20.       ENDESA's Finances:  After attaining a rate of return of about 8 per-
cent in 1970, ENDESA's financial situation rapidly deteriorated and has since
been characterized by low --or even negative-- returns and heavy reliance on
Government contributions to finance investments. From the end of 1970
through September 1973, ENDESA received only one rate increase --about 26
percent-- while prices, as measured by the official Consumer Price Index
increased by over 800 percent. The present Government which took office in
September 1973 reversed this pattern, and ENDESA's tariffs were increased
56-fold from October 1973 to December 1974. This adjustment represented
more than an 8-fold increase in real terms over the period and enabled ENDESA
once again to cover virtually all of its operating costs. Further tariff
increases higher than the Consumer Price Index in 1975-76 have enabled the
company to show marginal operating earnings (a rate of return of 1 to 2 per-
cent per annum on a fully revalued rate base), but financial charges have
exceeded operating earnings, resulting in negative net income.
21.       The Government has already taken steps designed to enable ENDESA to
generate substantial net internal cash for financing its expansion program in
future years and is considering other measures. One was the completion in 1975 of



-7-
the revaluation process of ENDESA's rate base assets to take into account the
severe inflation which had occurred since 1968. While Chilean legislation
provided for the revaluation of these assets every five years on the basis
of replacement costs as well as interim revaluations on the basis of the
Consumer Price Index, no revaluations had occurred since 1968 and a revi-
sion was essential for equitable rate-setting. An additional measure now
pending enactment is a major modification of the regulatory law applicable
to ENDESA and other public utilities. This revision would provide for more
frequent and timely rate-base revaluation in the future and for expediting
the filing, review and approval process for tariff increases. Because of
its importance to ENDESA's financial soundness, revision of the regulatory
law in a manner satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of the proposed
loan's effectiveness (Section 7.01 of the draft Loan Agreement). As a third
step it was agreed during negotiations that the Government will increase
ENDESA's tariffs sufficiently to enable it to attain a 3 percent rate of
return in 1977, 6 percent in 1978 and 9 percent thereafter. (Sections 5.05
and 3.02 of the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements, respectively).
Disbursements under the proposed loan in excess of US$12 million--approxi-
mately the projected level of disbursements for 1977-- would be conditional
on ENDESA's achieving a 3 percent rate of return during 1977 (Schedule 1,
paragraph 4(ii) of the draft Loan Agreement). Finally, to improve tariff
structures, Chilectra has undertaken a study of its own electricity rates
and it was agreed during negotiations that the Government would afford the
Bank a reasonable opportunity to comment on the study's conclusions (Section
3.03 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
22.       As a result of the application of the measures summarized above
ENDESA's financial position will be substantially strengthened and its
internal cash generation is expected to finance about 38 percent of the cost
of its expansion program during 1977-80. Borrowing would cover about 31
percent and the Government's contribution would decline to about 31 percent.
23.       Costs and Financing:  The project's cost is estimated at
US$107.93 million net of taxes and duties. The proposed Bank loan of
US$35 million, equivalent to the project's foreign exchange costs, would
cover 32 percent of net project costs. The balance of project funds would
be provided by Government contributions and by ENDESA's own cash genera-
tion.
24.       Procurement and Disbursement:  All machinery and equipment to be
financed under the proposed loan would be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines exc-ept for
items --expected to cost up to US$2.9 million-- which would be purchased on
a negotiated basis from manufacturers in the interest of standardization
and/or because of their varied composition. These items include:



- 8 -
(a) spare parts for ENDESA's Cipreses hydroelectric and
Punta Arenas diesel plants and for other various
generating plant and substation equipment. These
spare parts are expected to cost US$1.9 million;
and
(b) measuring, testing and laboratory equipment (amount-
ing to about US$1 million). ENDESA has been using
the same brands since 1960 and would prefer to con-
tinue doing so to maintain standardization of this
equipment.
For purposes of bid comparison, Chilean manufacturers of material and equip-
ment will be entitled to preferences of 15 percent or the applicable tariff,
whichever is lower.
25.       Disbursements from the loan account --expected to be spread over
a four-year period running from early 1977 through 1980-- would be made for
(a) the foreign cost of imported equipment, materials, and spare parts;
(b) the foreign cost of erection supervision by manufacturers' representa-
tives and consulting services; and (c) the ex-factory cost of contracts
awarded Chilean manufacturers.
26.       Project Justification:   The purpose of the project is to restore
reliable electric service to Chile. The project's varied components would
accomplish this by overcoming the most serious operating problems facing
ENDESA's system owing to underinvestment in recent years, particularly
1971-73. These problems include: (i) system overloads with concomitant
energy losses and voltage reductions; (ii) curtailment of service because
of outages of old generating equipment; and (iii) high maintenance and
construction costs because of frequent breakdowns in ENDESA's construction
and transportation fleets.
27.       Since most of Chile's industry (including large portions of the
mining sector and most agroindustries) and the railroads rely, to an
increasing extent, on public service electricity supply, the value of
restoring reliable electric service to the economy is high. Expansion of
output and employment in virtually all of Chile's productive sectors, or
even maintenance of present levels, will depend, to a considerable degree,
on the smooth operation of ENDESA's system. Conversely, disruptions in the
supply of electricity would seriously hamper growth and the economy's
ability to generate more jobs and increased exports to ease both the
country's unemployment and balance of payments. Viewed in this light, the
project's cost is low in relation to its benefits.
28.        ENDESA has been a pioneer in Latin America in providing electricity
to lower income groups. The company's tariffs for small users, for example,
are only 1/2 to 3/4 as high as those charged to larger commercial and



-9-
residential users. Moreover, ENDESA is placing increased emphasis on rural
electrification. At present, only 35 percent of Chile's rural inhabitants
(versus over 90 percent in urban areas) have access to public-service
electricity supply. To extend the benefits of electricity to larger segments
of the rural population, ENDESA and the Government have formulated a Rural
Electrification Plan which envisages providing electric service to an
additional 100,000 rural families (600,000 persons) by 1982. This would
increase the percentage of rural inhabitants having access to electricity
to about 50 percent. In this connection, nearly half of the project's
components benefit regions with above-average rural poverty indices where
2/3 of the inhabitants are classified as "extremely poor" in a nation-wide
survey carried out by Santiago's Catholic University and the Planning
Office in 1974.
29.       In addition to the benefits summarized above, the measures regard-
ing ENDESA's tariffs which the Government would carry out in connection with
the proposed loan (see paragraph 21) would put the company on a sound finan-
cial footing. ENDESA would thus enjoy greater financial independence and
be able to cover an increased part (nearly 40 percent) of its future invest-
ment needs. Moreover, the agreed-to measures would help assure more rational
energy-pricing policies in Chile.
30.       The project components represent the least-cost solution for meet-
ing ENDESA's most immediate rehabilitation needs using a 12 percent discount
rate. The rate of return on ENDESA's 1977-81 investment program, of which
the project is a comparatively small part, is 26 percent.
31.       Project risks in connection with the proposed loan are no greater
than can normally be expected with operations of this type.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
32.       The draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements between the Bank and ENDESA
and the Republic of Chile, respectively, the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. Features of the draft Loan and Guarantee
Agreements of special interest are referred to in paragraph 21 of this
report. A special condition of effectiveness is that the Government take all
necessary action to enable ENDESA to earn the rates of return referred to in
paragraph 21 of this report. It has been agreed that this condition would
be satisfied when modifications acceptable to the Bank have been incorporated
in Chile's electricity regulatory law. A special condition of disbursement
is that disbursements under the proposed loan in excess of US$12 million would
be conditional on ENDESA's achieving a 3 percent rate of return in 1977.
33.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 668 Third Education Project; US$5.45 million Loan of May 7, 1970;
Effective Date: October 21, 1970; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977.
Project implementation was hindered at the outset by a combination of
frequent changes in project unit directors and unstable conditions in the
construction industry between 1971 and 1973. Rapid price escalation in-
creased construction costs and competitive bidding for construction works
became impracticable. The Bank agreed to accept a system of cost-plus
fixed-fee contracts as an emergency measure. In March 1974 the new
Government issued a decree which transferred all teacher-training to the
universities. Since no new construction of primary teacher-training col-
leges or modernization of existing ones would be undertaken, the Government
requested that resulting savings in the loan be used to finance cost over-
runs elsewhere in the project. The corresponding amendment was signed in
October 1974. More recently, in view of a lower than expected capacity
in the public and private sectors to absorb the initially planned number
of graduates of the project's 11 agricultural schools, the Government re-
quested a second amendment of the project which entailed reducing the
number of project schools from 11 to 10 and the enrollments of 6 of these
schools from 406 to 160 students each. This request was agreed to by the Executive
Directors on a "no objection" basis in June 1976 and the loan amount was re-
duced--because of decreased project costs-from US$7 million (the original
amount) to US$5.45 million. The project is now proceeding more smoothly and
is expected to be completed by mid-1977, approximately three years behind
schedule.
Loan No. 688 Second Highway Construction Project; US$10.8 million Loan of
June 10, 1970; Effective Date: December 2, 1970;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977.
Substantial slippage occurred in starting construction of the project works.
This was due, initially, to delays in the prequalification of contractors-
and in the preparation of specifications, and later to numerous changes of
ministerial oticials and technicians. Competitive bidding became difficult
in an environment of rapidly rising inflation after 1971 and the Bank agreed
to proceed with a portion of the road construction on the basis of negotiated
contracts and works subdivided into small bidding sections. It was also
necessary to reduce the scope of the project and an amendment to the
Loan Agreement was signed in August 1974. Project works are now proceeding'
more smoothly and the project is now expected to be completed by mid-1977,
about three years behind schedule.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 978 Technical Assistance Project; US$5.25 million Loan of April
22, 1974; Effective Date: July 23, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977.
After a slow start due primarily to ineffective coordination of study prepara-
tion among the various public sector agencies, project implementation has
improved. The loan's proceeds have been fully committed for 13 preinvestment
studies, 11 of which are now underway. Approximately 45 percent of the
loan's funds have been disbursed but, because of the delays experienced in
early project implementation, the loan's Closing Date will likely have to be
extended by a year.
Loan No. 1119 Agricultural Rehabilitation Project; US$20 million Loan of
June 4, 1975; Effective Date: September 23, 1975; Closing
Date: September 30, 1976.
The project was virtually completed on September 30, 1976, a year after being
declared effective. Consultants financed under the loan are completing a
study regarding a proposed reorganization of the Government agencies providing
services to the agricultural sector. Their final report is expected by the
end of 1976.
Loan No. 1200 Copper Sector Project; US$33 million Loan of March 24, 1976;
Effective Date: June 15, 1976; Closing Date: September 30,
1979
The loan was declared effective on June 15, 1976 and CODELCO and ENAMI --
the project's executing agencies-- have begun to call for bids on individual
project components. Both agencies' lack of familiarity with Bank procedures
has resulted in some initial delays in the bidding process and in the selection
of consultants for technical assistance. With close Bank staff support on
procurement matters, however, existing difficulties are being resolved and
both bidding and the hiring of consultants are expected to proceed more
smoothly.

Procurement:             All machinery and equipment to be financed under
the proposed loan would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank guidelines except for certain equipment--
expected to cost up to US$2.9 million--which would
be acquired on a negotiated basis from manufacturers
which have previously supplied related equipment.
These items include, for example, measuring, testing
and laboratory equipment which ENDESA would buy from
its usual suppliers for the sake of standardization
and spare parts which must be compatible with existing
plant and equipment. For purposes of bid comparisons,
the Bank's preferential rules would be applicable to
local suppliers.
Technical Assistance:    ENDESA would contract the services of consultants
(approximately 65 man months) to carry out the
preinvestment studies financed under the proposed loan.
Average costs of consultants (including salary and over-
head) are estimated at US$4,700 per man-month.
Rates of Return:         The proposed project's components represent the least
cost solution for meeting ENDESA's most immediate
rehabilitation needs for discount rates of at least
12 percent. The rate of return on ENDESA's investment
program for 1977 through 1981, of which the project is
a part, is 26 percent.

Updating Memorandum on the Economy of Chile
The Economy Through 1975
1.        During the early 1970s the Chilean economy was disrupted by major
shifts in the political situation and in government economic philosophies
and policies, exacerbating such traditional weaknesses as heavy dependence
on mining exports, persistent inflation, unemployment, inefficient budget
and tax administration, a low savings propensity on the part of private
households, and high levels of industrial protection to' the detriment of
agricultural growth and export diversification. During the 1970-1973
period, a large share of the manufacturing sector, the entire financial
sector, the major copper mines, and approximately one-third of cultiv-
able agricultural land were taken under government control, with ensu-
ing problems of administration, structural adaptation, decline of in-
vestment, and the loss of technical-managerial personnel. The growth of
output, which had slowed perceptibly through the second half of the 1960s,
picked up sharply in 1971 in response to expansionary government policies
but then stagnated in 1972 and fell in 1973 as declining investment, sup-
ply bottlenecks, and general uncertainties exhausted the economy's ability
to respond to the continuing demand stimulus. Consumer prices, propelled
by massive government deficits and monetary expansion, rose some 35 to 40
times between 1969 and the end of 1973, reversing by 1972 the real wage
gains achieved in 1970 and 1971. Selective price controls seriously dis-
torted the structure of prices and resulted in supply shortages throughout
the economy. The decline in agricultural output was particularly sharp,
production in 1973 dropping below the levels of the mid-1960s. Rising food
imports and falling copper production contributed to an accumulated loss of
international reserves amounting to US$640 million between 1970 and 1973.
Chile ceased to make scheduled payments on most of its debt service obliga-
tions from 1971 through 1973.
2.        The Government that took power in September 1973 set
out to reduce the direct role of the public sector in the economy and to
move as quickly as possible to a mixed economic system where prices, with
few exceptions, would be determined by market forces. Among its primary
shortrun objectives were the stabilization and rationalization of prices,
the recovery of output and real income levels, the balancing of the inter-
national accounts, and the establishment of the basis for market-oriented,
"outward-looking" growth. Major policy changes affecting the international
sector were the re-introduction of flexible exchange rates, measures to
promote the expansion of copper and nontraditional exports, reductions in
tariff and non-tariff barriers to imports and stringent limits on new
foreign borrowings. The currency was sharply devalued in late 1973, and
gradual real devaluation continued through 1975. (Balance of payments
performance and projections are shown in Table 1, and exchange rate move-
ments are summarized in Table 2.) Agricultural imports declined sharply
as agricultural output rebounded, and the freeing of prices slowed the growth
of demand. Despite the larger import bill resulting from higher prices,
particularly for petroleum, the external accounts improved markedly in 1974.



ANNEX IV
Page 2 of 8
Increased copper output and higher prices, coupled with the doubling of non-
copper exports, reduced the trade deficit to US$95 million in 1974, as
compared with US$377 million and US$353 million in the two previous years,
respectively. A rescheduling agreement, covering service payments due in
1973 and 1974, was reached with major creditors, and settlement was achieved
of outstanding compensation claims of expropriated foreign investors. An
SDR 79 million Stand-By Agreement was negotiated with the IMF in January
1974, and an additional SDR 118.5 million was acquired under the 1974 Oil
Facility.
3.        Other major policy changes introduced in late 1973 and 1974 were
the freeing of most domestic prices and the divestment of most expropriated
assets. New taxes and increased tax rates were introduced, which--in com-
bination with improved tax administration, higher public sector prices and im-
proved efficiency in the public enterprises--have greatly improved the
financial performance of the fiscal sector. The Central Government achieved
a current account budgetary surplus in 1974 for the first time in four years.
Expenditures continued to grow, however, as the Government, encouraged by
high copper prices in the first half of the year, attempted to maintain real
wages and employment in the face of rising domestic and international prices.
Consequently, the Government budget deficit and resulting expansion of central
bank credit remained major sources of continuing inflation; consumer prices
rose 376 percent in 1974.
4.        The balance of payments deteriorated sharply in 1975 as a conse-
quence of the falling world copper price, which dropped to its lowest level
in real terms in more than a decade. Copper export earnings for the year
totaled US$834 million as compared with US$1,551 million in 1974. Thus the
economy had to adjust to a decline of more than US$700 million in export
earnings, about 34 percent of total 1974 exports, without a cushion of net
foreign exchange reserves. In addition, debt service payments in 1975, even
after rescheduling, exceeded 1974 payments by US$220 million. The reduced
exports and increased debt service combined to increase the debt service
burden sharply from 11.2 percent of exports in 1974 to 28.7 percent in 1975.
At the same time, inflation began to accelerate, consumer prices rising at
an average monthly rate of 18 percent through the first semester. Had
inflation continued at this rate, the annual increase in the cost of living
would have reached 630 percent.
5.        Faced with accelerating inflation, falling production and real
incomes, and a projected overall balance of payments deficit for 1975 ex-
ceeding US$800 million, the Government introduced drastic new austerity
measures in April 1975. Central Government capital expenditures (excluding
amortization) were reduced 54 percent in real terms as compared with 1974;
current expenditures (excluding interest) were reduced by 19 percent in
real terms. Overall, the Central Government's demand for real resources
(including its transfers to the public enterprises and decentralized
agencies) was cut almost one-third. Furthermore, despite the economy's
deep recession, the real value of current revenues collected outside the



ANNEX IV
Page 3 of 8
copper sector rose, and the overall deficit of the Central Government
(excluding amortization payments) was eliminated. The fiscal accounts are
shown in Table 3.
6.        Thus, despite a 46 percent decline in copper revenues, the loss
of reserves in 1975 was limited to US$275 million, only slightly above the
US$240 million IMF stand-by target which had been based on a much higher
copper price assumption.l/ Most of the deficit occurred during the first
half of the year. The continued rapid growth of non-copper exports pro-
vided some of the offset, the total for the year reaching US$664 million,
as compared to US$583 million in 1974 and US$254 million in 1973. This
growth came in the face of a stagnating world economy and reflects the
effects both of the exchange rate policy and the contraction of domestic
sales. The adjustment process was eased by net medium- and long-term loan
disbursements and IMF support, together totaling more than $400 million.
The major burden of adjustment, however, had to fall on merchandise imports,
which were reduced by almost 20 percent, falling to their lowest per capita
level in real terms since 1965. Net international reserves fell in 1975
to a negative $551 million.
7.        The powerful deflationary impact of the April 1975 stabilization
plan,forced by the reduced availability of foreign exchange, came on top of
already declining economic activity, and the costs in lost output and unem-
ployment have been very high. Although agricultural output continued to
recover, industrial production for the year was 23 percent below the level
of 1974, construction was down 35 percent, and mining output fell 8 percent.
Real GDP declined by 13 percent. The effect of deteriorating terms of trade
reduced the economy's real income by an additional 6 percent relative to 1974.
It is not possible to be precise regarding the distribution of the social
costs of the 1975 recession, but some broad observations can be made. Inevi-
tably, a major share of the burden has been borne by the unemployed, who
tend to be concentrated among the less skilled, lower-income members of the
labor force. By year end, unemployment had risen above 18 percent of the
labor force in the Santiago metropolitan area. For those who held their
jobs, average real salaries and wages fell 8 percent as compared with 1974.
Supplementary wage adjustments have favored the lowest paid workers. Alto-
gether, the average total wage bill in 1975 fell an estimated 12 percent in
real terms. Non-wage incomes in the aggregate fell by an even greater
percentage. The rural areas have in general fared better than the urban
sector, real incomes to producers of the 14 major crops rising more than
10 percent in 1975. Finally, among professionals, public sectortsalaries
have fallen significantly behind the private sector. The Government
instituted a "minimum employment program", food distribution and other
nutrition programs were expanded, and a wage subsidy program was introduced
for new hirings.
1/ A change of one-cent in the price of copper means roughly a $20 million
change in Chilean export revenues.



ANNEX IV
Page 4 of 8
8.        Taxpayers as a group, excluding the copper enterprises, paid
higher real taxes despite declining incomes. Direct taxes on income held
approximately constant, while taxes on property (including gifts and inher-
itance) rose more than 20 percent in real terms. Among the measures taken
were the broadened coverage of withholding taxes, the generalized applica-
tion of monetary correction to tax liabilities, increased taxation of
undistributed corporate profits, and the substantial upward adjustment of
property valuations. Indirect taxes also increased 4.5 percent in real
terms as a consequence of the elimination of most exemptions from the value-
added tax, increased excise taxes on petroleum, alcohol and tobacco, and the
subjection of public sector agencies to the same import duties as the pri-
vate sector.
9.        Official external development financing to Chile during 1974 and
1975 was provided principally by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
and USAID. The IDB made five loans to Chile during this period: US$75 mil-
lion for hydroelectric power, US$22 million for agricultural rehabilitation,
US$10 million for industrial credit, US$35 million for telecommunications,
and US$25 million for urban infrastructure and services. AID made two loans
in 1975--US$5 million for nutrition and US$15 million for agricultural
cooperatives. AID guarantees were authorized for US$55 million of housing
investments. In addition, a total of more than US$100 million of commodity
assistance was disbursed under U.S. Public Law 480 in 1975.
10.       In March 1975 Chile signed a new SDR 79 million Stand-By-Agree-
ment with the IMF, but only an SDR 20 million first tranche was drawn as
the greater-than-expected shortfall in copper earnings resulted in rates
of credit expansion to the Government and reserve loss in excess of the
agreed second-quarter targets. The Chilean authorities, in response to
the shortfall in copper earnings, introduced the adjustment program
discussed above (paragraph 7). Under the 1975 Oil Facility, the Fund
provided SDR 79.79 million in November and another SDR 45.43 million in
April 1976. In addition, the IMF approved an SDR 79 million compensatory
finance credit in 1976, while Chile repaid SDR 53 million received from
the compensatory finance facility in 1971 and 1972.
The Current Situation
11.       The year 1976 has been one of modest recovery for the Chilean
economy. The balance of payments, in particular, has improved markedly,
net international reserves showing a US$362 million gain through the first
nine months of the year. Chile is, at the same time, fully meeting its
debt obligations without rescheduling for the first time in several years.
More than 40 percent of the total public debt outstanding at the end of
1975, and almost half of debt service between 1975 and 1978 is the result
of previous reschedulings and compensation agreements with nationalized
enterprises. Many factors have contributed to the improved balance of
payments. The partial recovery of the world copper market has increased
export earnings by almost US$400 million. In addition, agricultural and



ANNEX IV
Page 5 of 8
industrial exports have continued to show strong growth, running some
21 percent above the 1975 level. As a consequence of these two factors
and an approximately constant import level, the current account deficit in
1976 is now expected to be near US$140 million as compared to a Us$628
million deficit in 1975. At the same time, capital inflows have far ex-
ceeded earlier expectations, the largest increases occurring in suppliers'
credits, financial loans to the private sector, and continued repatriation
of Chilean dollar holdings abroad.
12.       Progress is also evident in the effort to reduce inflation
(Table 4). Through the first ten months of 1976, the consumer price
index rose 151 percent, as compared to 281 percent for the same period in
1975. Similarly, the wholesale price index has risen 139 percent through
the first ten months, down from 343 percent over the first ten months of
1975. Inflation for the entire year, as measured by the C.P.I., is ex-
pected to total around 175 percent, as compared to 341 percent during 1975.
The seeming intractability of Chilean inflation, despite the large decline
that has occurred in aggregate demand and output as well as the contraction
of the real money supply, reflects the powerful inflationary expectations
that have built up over the nation's many decades of monetary instability.
These expectations have been sustained, to some extent, by the impact on
costs of the Government's efforts to maintain real income levels and in-
ternational competitiveness through indexing of wages and exchange rates.
With the inflation rate now diminishing, however, the size of wage adjust-
ments and other indexed costs are also declining, and there is reasonable
hope that the inflation rate can be halved again in 1977.
13.       With net international reserves still negative and the copper price
always uncertain, the Chilean authorities have been understandably cautious
in their efforts to restimulate the economy. In June several measures were
taken to stimulate demand, while at the same time reducing cost pressures:
these included an 11 percent revaluation of the peso, a small tax reduction
and increased credit to the private sector, particularly for construction
and nontraditional exports. The only production data so far available for
1976 show an increase of industrial output of 10 percent through September.
Agricultural output, on the other hand, is expected to decline some 3 to 5
percent as a consequence of bad weather and wheat blight. Overall, GDP
will be up about 4 percent in real terms. The rate of unemployment in
Greater Santiago remains high, 15.7 percent in September, but has improved
somewhat from the high point of 19.8 percent measured in March. At the
same time, the wage indexing formula, in the face of a falling inflation
rate, will permit an average real wage gain of around 10 percent in 1976
as compared with 1975.

14.       A syndicated private bank loan for US$125 million was signed in
May 1976 and will be drawn in December to cover debt service payments due
at the end of the year. Commitments from the bilateral and multilateral
development lending agencies have totaled some $120 million thus far in
calendar 1976. In light of the improved balance of payments, a new Stand-
by Agreement with the Fund was not requested..
15.       Since early 1974, the Government has steadily reduced import duties
and restrictions on foreign investment. With some rates previously exceeding
500 percent, a limit of 200 percent was set in March 1974. By mid-1976,
the maximum rate had been lowered to 60 percent with the intention of
reaching 35 percent by 1978. Over the course of 1976, Chile's desire
to greatly liberalize its international trade and treatment of foreign
capital came increasingly into conflict with the existing provisions of
the Andean Pact. Having failed to reach agreement either on changes in
these provisions or on terms for an associate member status, Chile with-
drew from the Andean Pact on October 30, 1976. Very little of Chile's
present exports depend on Pact preferences, and the withdrawal is not
expected to affect Chile's trade significantly.
16.       In summary, 1976 has been a year of modest recovery of domestic
economic activity. The foreign exchange constraint has eased, however,
and the foreign financial community has evidenced renewed confidence in
Chile's determination and ability to meet its debt service obligations.
As a consequence, Chile will enter 1977 with a much improved base for
accelerated economic growth and capacity to withstand unexpected shocks.
Net international reserves are now expected to become positive for the
first time since 1971. Thus, the Government has indicated its intention
to provide additional stimulus through selective tax reductions, increased
public works spending, and expanded low-income housing construction. Credit
in general will be expanded as the inflation continues to abate and the
demand for money increases.
Medium-Term Prospects
17.       Despite Chile's progress in diversifying its exports, sustained
growth in the medium term will continue to depend heavily on the world
demand for copper. The Bank projection for 1977 is US$.80 per lb. on the
London Metal Exchange. At that average price, less shipping charges and
a discount for quality differential, Chile's copper exports would exceed
US$1.5 billion in 1977, as compared with US$1.2 billion expected in 1976.
With a projected 6 percent real growth of non-copper exports, and capital
flows on approximately the same level as this year, it should be possible
for Chile to increase its real GDP by about 7 percent (5.3 percent per
capita) while fully servicing its debts reducing its high debt service
burden, and further replenishing reserves.

18.       The Bank projects the copper price to rise substantially, in
nominal terms, reaching $1.20 by 1980 and $1.80 by 1985 (see Table 5).
In constant U.S. dollars of 1974, the prices projected are: 1976-51.7i;
1977-60.5i; 1980-73.1; 1985-78.2i. The projection is, thus, for a faster
growth of copper prices than that of world inflation. It reflects the
fact that even though during the current recession some surplus capacity
has developed in the world copper industry, in the longer term copper is
a resource for which demand will be strong and which will require rapidly
rising prices to cover the costs of bringing new mines into production;
recent studies suggest that most producers currently need prices of
$.60-.70 per lb. to break even, and that higher prices will be required to
provide an adequate rate of return on new mining investments. With the
above copper price assumption, GDP growth at 7 percent per annum through
the rest of the decade would be consistent with a decline of the debt
service burden from 35.5 percent of exports in 1976 to 33.5 percent in
1977, falling to 21.2 percent by 1980. Thus, the balance of payments
should not be a major constraining factor on a recovery of growth of
output and employment.
19.       A 7 percent growth rate would make possible a considerable
reduction of unemployment and is achievable with relatively modest invest-
ment given the large amount of idle capacity presently available. Although
the required marginal savings rate, relative to the very depressed levels
of 1975, is high, the projected average savings rate for 1980 is only
slightly above the level achieved in 1974 and still below the savings rates
of the mid-1960s. It should be feasible to realize the marginal savings
growth necessary, along with an annual increase in private consumption of
2 to 3 percent per capita, if a large fraction of the gains from terms-of
trade improvement are captured and directed to investment uses. This can
be done if the public sector invests directly a rising share of profits
from copper sales or acts as a financial intermediary to private sector
investors. In any event, the anticipated availability of foreign exchange
will permit considerable freedom in managing the trade-offs between
domestic economic expansion, reserve accumulation, and debt reduction.
20.       Should the above assumptions about the foreign exchange constraint
not be met--as a result, for example, of a lower world market price for
copper--the Government has demonstrated its determination to abide by its
international financial obligations and to manage the economy in accordance
with the availability of the necessary foreign exchange. Table 5 shows the
value of copper-exports if the price falls 15 percent below the Bank's
projection. Such a decline in export revenues, other things being equal,
would require Chile to lower its GDP growth rate through the rest of the
decade to around 4.5 percent or to reduce the accumulation of reserves.

21.       Looking further ahead, the agricultural sector offers excellent
export potential. Forest products, in particular, are expected to become
a major export, second only to copper by the late 1980s. The Government is
currently engaged in a massive forestation program under which 80,000
hectares were planted in 1975 and another 100,000 are to have been planted
by the end of 1976. A total of 350,000 ha will have been forested by 1980.
Since October 1974, when the Committee on Foreign Investments was established,
more than US$325 million of foreign direct investments have been approved,
mostly in non-copper mining and manufacturing, and some US$2-3 billion of
investment in copper, gas, oil and petrochemicals are under active discussion.
22.       In conclusion, Chile is emerging from its most difficult economic
crisis since the Depression of the thirties. The Government has taken the
difficult measures required by the severe export shortfall of 1975 and by
the need to service external debts. Most Chileans have had to share in
the burden of these measures. Meanwhile, many fundamental economic reforms
have been made. The Government has gone a long way toward rationalizing
the structure of prices, including interest rates and the exchange rate,
made substantial improvements in the public sector budgetary process,
implemented a major tax reform, taken significant steps toward the moderniza-
tion of the financial system, and has opened the domestic economy to the
opportunities and competition of the international economy. In light of
these efforts and the consequent improvement in the nation's external
accounts, as well as of Chile's resource base and of the prospects for
export growth, Chile is considered creditworthy for Bank lending.

The balance of payments projection assumes a GDP real growth rate of 7.0 percent through 1980 and a rate of 5.0 percent from 1981 to 1985. The food
import projection assumes an exceptionally high income-elasticity of demand through 1980 and a continued reorientation of domestic production toward
the export sector in response to Chile's relative cost advantages. The oil import projection assumes that demand will grow at the ease rate as
output, while domestic production declines 10 percent per year untal 1979 and then stabilizes. Other intermediate goods imports are assumed to grow
at roughly twice the rate of industrial growth in 1977 and 1978, an depleted inventories are replenished, and at the same rate an industrial growth
thereafter. The capital account projections assame that: (a) the repatriation of Chilean-owned dollars coases after 1976; (b) net financial credits to
the private sector taper off sharply as existing loans are amortized; (c) that borrowings from euppliere are reduced in 1977 and 1978, compared with
the high level of 1976; and (d) that no new bilateral aid comnitments are obtained after 1976.
