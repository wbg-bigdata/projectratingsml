PROJECT COMELETION REPORT
CHILE: SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(Loan 1351-CH)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for Loan 1351-CH
in the amount of US$35.0 million made in February 1977 to Empresa
Nacional de Electricidad, S.A. (ENDESA). The PCR was prepared by the
Energy Division of the Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office
based on information in the Bank's files and discussions with Bank
staff and ENDESA officials. A completion report was not prepared by
ENDESA.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project
performance audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED
staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft
report to the Government and the Borrower.  The coimments which were
received have been taken into account in preparing the final report and
they are reproduced as an Attachment to the report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CHILE: SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(Loan 1351-CH)
Highlights
Effectiveness of the Loan Agreement was delayed two years. The
Project, consequently, was delayed two years except for urgent parts
undertaken without funds from the Loan. New components were added to replace
those parts.
Further delay was experienced because of ENDESA's concern that
disbursements might be limited to US$12 million equivalent of the US$35
million loan (under a special provision of the Loan Agreement) because of
failure to meet the agreed earnings performance. The limitation went into
effect and US$23 million of the Loan was cancelled in November 1981 inasmuch
as the Bank was unable to persuade the Government to take measures to improve
the Company's finances.
Items procured with the US$12 million equivalent were put into
operation and are functioning in ENDESA's system as intended.
Although ENDESA's earnings improved during project implementation,
they were not considered satisfactory by the Bank in view of the Government's
requirements for large tax and dividend payments. These payments had not
been anticipated in the appraisal. They were not considered advisable by the
Bank since they were based mainly on asset revaluation -profit and forced
ENDESA to additional borrowing.
Institutional changes obtained in connection with the Loan (changes
in electricity law pertaining to rate setting) were ineffective since the
Government soon after established a new regulatcry authority and different
procedures for dealing with the sector's rates.
The following points may be of special interest:
Effect of overestimated investment program on financial performance
objectives established in the appraisal (paras. 5.05, 5.06, 8.05).
Effect of unanticipated tax and dividend payments on financial
condition (paras. 5.04, 5.06, 5.07).
Application of 'automatic" provision for disbursement cutoff at
US$12 million equivalent based on earnings deficiency (paras. 2.14,
5.09-5.12).
Effect of unanticipated institutional changes on Project's
institutional measures (paras. 2.08, 6.01-6.06).

The Goverment endorsed the comments of the Enpresa Nacional de
Eelectricidad S.A. (ENDESA) which questioned the need for compliance with the
rate-of-return covenant. According to ENDESA, the rate of return covenant
was unneeded to ensure meeting the objectives of the project or repayment of
the loan. In the judgement of ENDESA, insistence on compliance was the main
cause of delay to the Project and subsequent cancellation of 71Z of the
loan.  ENDESA recommended that in future loan agreements the Bank should
limit its requirements to ensuring the feasibility of projects, not the
direction of sector economic policy. In the opinion of ENDESA, the PCIC
should have noted the impact of two world recessions on the growth of demand
in Chile and the measures taken to safeguard the interests of the country,
the company, and the Bank (Attachment 1. page; 3 and 4).
The Government also endorsed the comments of the National Energy
Commission (NEC), which made the following points: (i) the participation of
NEC in the expansion planning and electricity pricing in the Power Sector has
been positive because the NEC carried out analyses of investment planning by
state-owned energy companies which resulted in improved investments of
general interest to the country, if not to the individual companies, and
because the NEC implemented a pricing policy based on marginal costs which
promoted economic efficiency (Attschment 1. nages 5 and 6)- (ii) anplication
of marginal cost tariffs, besides promoting economic efficiency, has resulted
in satisfactory rates of return for ENDESA (9.0% in 1984) (Attachment 1,
page 7); (iii) a successful new law (1982) provided for reimbursable
financial contributions from clients in order to resolve any financial
problems which power companies might experience resulting from a tariff
structure based on the marginal cost of supply (Attachment 1, page 7); (iv)
the restructuring of ENDESA had as its immediate objective improved
efficiency through decentralization and specialization, not privatization in
the short term (Attachment 1, page 8); (v) private and state-owned companies
are subject to the same general tax and dividend system, regardless of
ownership or function (Attachment 1, page 8); and (vi) paragraph 6.03 of the
PCR reflects unfamiliarity with laws establishing the National Energy
Commission (Attachment 1, page 9).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CHILE: SIXTH POWER PROJECT
(Loan 1351-CM)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      ENDESA is Chile's principatl power generation company.  It operates
throughout the Country, generating approximately 81% of all public power. It
is 99.92 owned by the Government.
1.02      The first development loan of the World Bank was made in 1948 to
ENDESA for hydro and diesel generating plant and transmission and
distribution expansion (Loan 5-CH, US$13.5 million). In all, six loans have
been made by the Bank for power development in Chile, totalling US$143.3
million equivalent (net of cancellations), and all were to ENDESA. Host of
the funds were for assistance in constructing hydro generating plants.
1.03      The Sixth Power Project consisted of procurement of equipment by
ENDESA for system rehabilitation and improvement during 1979-82, and of
studies of future hydropower works which were carried out by ENDESA and
consultants from 1977 to 1981. Most of the Project originally had been
intended for implementation during 1975-77, but, for ENDESA's lack of funds,
was delayed to 1977-82.
1.04      The Loan Agreement for the Project was signed February 15, 1977,
but did not become effective until December 28, 1978, because of (i) delays
in fulfilling conditions of effectiveness, and (ii) the need to revise and
renegotiate provisions regarding ENDESA's financial performance.
Disbursement of proceeds of the Loan, and procurement of equipment,
therefore, did not begin until 1979.
1.05      In October 1981, disbursement was stopped at a total of
approximately US$12.0 million equivalent with USS23.0 million equivalent of
the Loan undisbursed because of non-compliance with financial provisions of
the Loan Agreement.   US$23.0 million equivalent of the Loan was cancelled by
ENDESA November 4, 1981, since it was expected that non-compliance with the
rate of return *:ovenant would continue for an indefinite period.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01      Durlng the early 1970s, ENDESA had deficlencies In earnings and
severe cash flow problems because of limitations on Its tarlffs while Chile
was experiencing extraordinarily high Inflation. Because of its lack of
internally generated funds and its inahility to borrow foreign currency,
the Company, by January 24, 1974, had deferred a substantial portion of ilts
planned Investments, when It requested its sixth loan from the Bank. The
situation was characterized as an emergency.
2.02      The Immediate objective of the Sixth Power Project was to restore
reliable service by overcoming ENDESA's most serious operating problems: (I)
system overloads, with concomitant energy losses and voltage reductions; (ii)
curtailment of service, particularly in isolated systems, because of frequent
outages in old generating equipment; and (iii) frequent breakdowns of
constructIon and transportation equipment.  To help achieve this objective, a
loan from the Bank of US$27.6 million was requested for generation,
transmission, distrlbution, telecommunications, and construction equipment
and materials to be purchased during 1974-75, and a small sum for equipment
and consultants for studies of future hydroplants. The amount was Intended
to cover the foreign cost of the items (including financial charges), which
were expected to have local costs amounting to abotut US$103 million
equivalent.
Preparation, Appralsal, Negotiation, and Approval
2.03      Preparation of the Project up LO the request for a loan had t-een
done entirely by ENDESA. The Bank suggested in replying to the request that
because of staff constraints In the Bank, the Bank's appralsal process could
be expedited by ENDESA's use of a consultant familiar with Bank requirements
to aid in completing preparation of the Project.



-3-
2.04      ENDESA agreed to this and contracted an Individual engineer
consultant, a former staff member of the Bank who was considered by the Bank
to be acceptable for the purpose, and who began working with INDESA in June
1974. The consultant's task included the preparation of material equivalent
to the technical portions of a Bank appraisal report, which was provided to
the Bank by ENDESA.
2.05      Preparation of the Project proceeded satlsfactorily, and its
appraisal began in September 1974. The yellow-cover version of the appraisal
report was completed in November. By then, the Project had been redefined
somewhat, and it had been rescheduled from 1974-75 to 1975-77. The total
project cost was then estimated at US$125 million equivalent, of which about
US$30 million was expected to be foreign cost, end for which a loan of US$30
million equivalent was sought from the Bank. It was Intended that the local
cost of the Project would be covered by internal cash generation and by
Government contributions.
2.06      The definition of the Project was arrived at during the appraisal
by the Bank's staff working with ENDESA and its consultant. The Project was
defined as the most urgent elements of the Company's total rehabilitation
program whlch could fit, approximately, a US$30 million foreign cost total,
which the Bank considered at the time to be the limit on Its immedlately
available funds for the sector. The full rehabilitation program was
estimated to cost US$227 million equivalent, Including US$78 million in
forelgn costs, and the Compdny expected to seek a seventh loan from the Bank
sometime later for most of the forelgn cost balance.
2.07      The key Issues raised in the appraisal related to ENDESA's future
earnlngs. Because of the Inflationary economy, political pressure,
bureaucratic delays, and an undervalued rate base, the Company's rates had
not been sufficient to enable it to azhieve the 10% return permitted by
Chile's electricity law. The appraisal report, therefore, recommended: (i)
that negotiations on the proposed loan be conditioned to revaluation of the
Company's rate base using replacement costs calculated from indices of
construction costs to supersede the existing valuation based on the consumer
price index (CPI); and (ii) that the proposed loan and guarantee agreements
contain provisions calling for the Company to make quarterly tariff
adjustments to earn 10% on the revised rate base.
2.08      In addition, the appraisal concluded that the electricity law
should be changed to speed up Government approvals of tariff increases and to
improve in various respects the bases used In determining the increases.
ENDESA already was wor:king on a proposal along that line, and it was hoped
that action would be taken and the changes made before loan negotiations with
the Bank. If, however, thls should not have occurred in time, such action
would be proposed at negotiations as a loan condition.
2.09      ENDESA was advised of the Bank's conclusions and asked to furnlsh
to the Bank as a condition for undertaking negotiations, the necessary asset
revaluatlon information, a draft of the changes to the law which it Intended



-4-
to propose, and additional technical specifications of various items for the
Project.
2.10      Most of the requested information was provided in February 1975.
The Bank disagreed with several aspects of the proposed revaluation of assets
and changes in the law, and in April a mission was sent to Chile to try to
resolve the matter, and to obtain information to update the appraisal report.
2.11      Some points of disagreement were resolved during the mission, but a
few issues, including one regarding the revaluation of assets, still
remained. The appraisal report was updated and advanced to the Green Cover
stage in June 1975, but lack of resolution of a part of the asset
revaluatlon issue prevented going ahead with a full revaluation and the
starting of negotiations, which had been conditioned on implementing an
acceptable revaluation. It should be noted that the issue of Chile's
creditworthiness also remained unresolved at the time, and might have held up
negotiations in any case.
2.12      Among the project issues remaining unresolved were: (i) the
need, In the Bank's view, to include in the electricity law, provisions to
allow companies to recover prior years' earnings deficiencies and to make
rapid automatic tariff increases in cages of inaction by the regulatory
authorities; and (ii) a recommendation by the Bank that ENDESA earn in 1975
a return of only 6%, instead of 10% as sought earlier by the Bank. It had
become necessary to reduce the percentage for 1975 since, by mid year, 10%
had become a practical impossibility for lack of sufficient tariff increases
earlier during the year. The Bank's intention to seek 10% in 1976 and
thereafter, however, remained unchanged.
2.13      By late summer 1975, a full revaluation of the Company's assets
satisfactory to the Bank had been put into effect (approximately doubling the
previous valuation), but other issues still remained, including the question
of country creditworthlness. During the remainder of 1975 and the first half
of 1976, discussions continued between the Bank, the Government, and the
Company, with a few changes in positions occurring. The Government
Indicated, informally, that it would be willing to make the changes in the
law which were being sought, but the timing of the action continued to slip.
The Bank modified Its views regarding: (I) the length of the period during
which the buildup in the Company's tariffs and revenue should be implemented,
and (li) the level of earnlngs whlch would be considered the minimum
acceptable for the long term. With respect to the latter, the Bank concluded
that a rate of return of at least 9%, Instead of of 10%, would be adequate.
It also concluded that a program for increasing returns to this level over
three years, Instead of two, would be acceptable, but with the added feature
of having quarterly targets to be achieved during the buildup phase.



-5-
2.14      The Bank also introduced a new concept. The idea was to separate
the proposed ioan into two tranches, with disbursements from the second
tranche to be conditioned on ENDESA achieving agreed-upon financial
performance during an initial period. The control was to be designed to be
virtually automatic, calling outright for no withdrawal of second tranche
funds if the performance were not met. (The concept was adopted and included
in the Loan Agreement, and put into effect to terminate disbursements at
US$12 million equivalent in 1981; see paragraphs 5.09 - 5.12).
2.15      In October 1976, the Bank's Loam Committee concluded, In reviewing
a partly updated version of the Green Cover Appraisal Report and other
documents, that processing of the Loan could continue. By then, the proposed
loan amount had been raised to US$35 million equivalent, and the rates of
return to be achieved were set at xnuima of 3% and 6% for 1977 and 1978,
respectively, and 92 thereafter. In addition, it was decided that the Bank
should propose that the desired revision of the electricity law be a
condition of effectiveaess of the Loan Agreement.
2.16      In November 1976. a mission visited ENDESA to obtain information
aeeded to again bring the appraisal report up to date. The content of the
Project was modified to reflect the fact that portions of the originally
defined project already had beea or w-ere being implemented because of the
time, over two years, which had passed since the original appraisal.
Generation, transmission, and distribution components were reduced
approximately 25%, and the difference, in terms of estimated total cost, was
made up by the addition of a load dispatch system and an increased allocation
for other equipment and spare parts.
2.17      Negotiations were subsequently held in Washington, and agreement
was reached on the issues discussed above, except that the provision proposed
by the Bank for the rate of retura covenant in the Loan Agreement which
called for quarterly return targets during the buildup phase was dropped. It
was agreed that the first tranche of the Loan should be US$12 million
equivalent, and that disbursements beyond that amount would be made only if
r:he Company's rate of return for 1977 should be 3Z or more.
2.18      The loaa was approved by the Board of Executive Directors of the
Bank oa December 21, 1976. The signing of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
took place ia Washington on February 15, 1977.
Project's Role in Long-Term Plan
2.19      When the Loaa was approved, the dates envisaged for implementation
of the Project ran from 1977 through 1980, and improvements in system
performance were expected to be realized gradually during this period as
components of the Project were completed. Reductions of at least two
percentage po,nts in system losses were expected, and outages were to be
reduced by about one third. In addition, the Project was expected to
coatribute to the expansion of ser'ice, including an increase of six
percentage points,from 37% to 43%, in the percentage of the rural population
receiving service (see paragraphs 4.01 - 4.04).



-6-
2.20      Also of importance were the improvements sought in the regulation
of the sector and in electricity pricing. It was hoped that the improvements
would contribute to attainment of financial self-sufficiency by the sector,
and that this ultimately would help improve operating efficiency.
2.21      Among other objectives, ENDESA's long term development program for
the sector called for further exploitation of the Country's hydroelectric
potential, and continued expansion of service in rural areas. It projected
the completion of the Antuco Plant (300 MW, financed mainly by IDB) in 1981,
the Colbun-+achicura Plant (500 MW) in 1983, and the Neltume Plant (450 KW)
in 1986. The rural electrification plan projected provision of service to
100,000 additional homes by 1982, which would bring the percentage of the
total rural population receiving service to 50Z.
2.22      The Company's investment program for 1977 through 1981 was
estimated to cost approximately US$1.3 billion equivalent. It was believed
that satisfactory Implementation of the program would depend on the physical,
institutional, and financial soundness of the sector, which could not be
assured without the Project.
Project Description
2.23      Tne Project -as intended to be an estimated US$123.4 million
equivalent of the total program, to be spent during 1977-80 as indicated in
Table 1 at Annex 1.
2.24      The irems to be procured with the amounts indicated in the table
for the Tarapaca, Antofagasta, and Ruasco systems were to consist mainly of
transformers, voltage regulators, switchgear, and protection equipment. In
addition, two 24 MW gas turbines at Huasco were to be converted for use of
heavy fuel o_l.
2.25      The Central Interconnected System (CIS) items were to consist
mainly of transmission line extensions totalling 434 km; associated
substations; control equipment, switchgear, and protection equipment for
existing sub-stations; and distribution voltage regulators, sectionalizers,
switching control, and protection equipment. The latter items also were to
be procured for the systems of the Sixth and Seventh Regions.
2.26      Six new diesel units totalling 7 MW were to be procured for
isolated rural systems at Taital, Porvenir, and Colhaique.
2.27      A load dispatch system was to be procured for the CIS.    It was to
Include up to date telemetering, display, and data processing equipment.
2.28      A variety of specialized substation, transmission, and
subtransmisSiOn LJnstruction equipment and vehicles were to be procured for
use throughout the Company. Similarly, miscellaneous equipment for
generation, transmission, and distribution maintenance was to be procured.
2.29      For studies of future plants, equipment was to be procured for site
invest-igation znd laboratory work. Also, a small amount of consultant
services was needed.



-7-
2.30      Finally, spare parts were to be obtained for several of the
Company's generating plants and substations.
Covenants
2.31      The key covenants for the Loan and Guarantee Agreements dealt with
financial performance, and may be summarized as follows:
(i)   ENDESA should achieve rates of return of at least 3Z in 1977, 6% in
1978, and 9% in 1979 and thereafter (Loan Agreement Section 5.05;
see also paragraph 3.13 below);
(ii)   The Government should take all action required to permit rates for
the sale of electricity by ENDESA to enable ENDESA to achieve the
rates of return called for in the Loan Agreement (Guarantee Agree-
ment Sectioi 3.02);
(iii)   No withdrawal of proceeds of the Loan would be made after US$12
million equivalent have been withdrawn unless the rate of return of
3Z for 1977 called for in Section 5.05 of the Loaa Agreement had
been reached (Paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement);
(iv)   Unless otherwise agreed by the Bank, ENDESA should not incur new
debt if unable to meet a 1.5 times debt service coverage test (Loan
Agreement Section 5.04).
(v)   The above provisions regarding rates of return and debt limitation
(i.e., Sections 5.04 and 5.05 of the Loan Agreement) replaced all
provisions relating to these matters in prior loaa agreements for
loans of the Bank to ENDESA (Loan Agreement Section 6.01).
2.32      In addition, it was agreed that the Loan Agreement would not be
declared effective until the agreed amendments to the electricity law, as
described in ENDESA's side letter to the Bank dated February 15, 1977, had
been made by the Government (Loan Agreement Section 7.01).
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, OPERATION, AND COST
Loan Effectiveness and Project Startup
*         3.01      Section 7.02 of the Loan Agreement set June 15, 1977, as the date
for termination of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements for failure to become
effective. Inasmuch as the Government had not approved by this date the
changes to the electricity law upon which the effectiveness of the Loan
Agreement was conditioned, the Bank extended the termination date to August
15, 1977, on the understanding that the Government iatended to make the
approval soon. A second extension, to September 15, 1977, was made for the
same reason. (The Baak eventually made six more extens.ons, for a total of
eight, before declaring the Loan Agreement to be effective.)
3.02      The Bank learned on September 9, 1977, that the Government had
approved by Decree 1882 oa August 17, amendments to the electricity law
which: (i) matched approximately one half of those that had been agreed upon
in the Loan Negotiations, (i.) changed substantially another one, and (iii)
omitted the rest. The Bank had learned, also, in an early August supervision



-8-
misslon to ENDESA, that tariff increases had not been sufficient during the
year to give the Company a reasonable possiblity of meeting the 32 rate of
return which had been agreed on as the minimum acceptable for 1977. The
effectiveness deadline was. therefore, extended a third time, to October 15,
1977, and a mission was sent to discuss the situation with ENDESA and the
Government.
3.03      The mission reached an understanding with the Government regarding
the changes to the electricity law which had not been made, and obtained a
letter to the Bank from the Minister of Finance indicating that acceptable
action would be taken administratively, even though not spelled out in the
law. Although this was not what originally had been agreed, the Bank
concluded that it was most of what had been intended, and, sufficient to
eliminate the issue Insofar as effectiveness of the Loan Agreement was
concerned.
3.04      At the same time, however, the Bank concluded that the impending
failure to achieve the 3Z rate of return agreed for 1977 was a new obstacle
to effectiveness under the provisions of Section 12.03 (Effective Date) of
the Bank's General Conditions Applicable to Loan and Guarantee Agreements.
The Bank, therefore, continued with further postponements of the effective-
ness termination date and with discussions of the matter with the Government
and ENDESA.
3.05      Underlying the unwillingness of the Government to increase tariffs
to the degree needed to obtain a return of 3% were changed views in the
KiLnistries of Finance and Economy (the Loan Agreement had been negotiated
with the previous Ministry of Finance):
(i)  The Government had begun to questioa during 1977 the suitability of
the new valuation of ENDESA's assets for use in tariff setting.
Key advisers in the Ministries of Finance and Economy felt that,
because many of the Company's facilities had been constructed by
its construction division, which the Government considered
inefficient and was closing down, the costs incurred by the Company
for these works were excessive. They felt that the tariffs that
would have been needed to achieve the covenanted rates of return
based on these costs would have been too high. To try to better
establish Its point, the Government contracted a US-based team of
engiaeering and accounting consultants to undertake an independent
valuation of the Company's fixed assets.
(ii)  The Goverament felr, in addition, that a real rate of return of 9Z
for ENDESA would be excessive in any case, given the Government's
latest investment projections for the Company, which were
considerably lower than those used by the Bank in appraising the
Project. The Goverament felt that an appropriate rate of return
ultimately to be achieved should be around 6%, and that the
buildup to that level should be stretched out over several more
years.
(Ill)  In addition, the Government felt that its tax of 20% on ENDESA's
sales should be taken i.to account in calculating the rate of
return, and that, apart from any disagreement over specific
aumbers, a rate of return covenant for the Loan Agreement was not
appropriate in principle. The Government felt that the Bank should



-9-
not be concerned about the financial coadition of the sector since
the Government was a guarantor of the Project and the Loan.
(iv) Finally, the Government argued that the Company's rates for
industrial consumers already put them at a significant disadvantage
with respect to competitors in other Latin American countries, and
that rate Increases would, therefore, worsen the situation as well
as have a significant inflationary impact.
3.06      Discussion of the issues with the Government and ENDESA continued
for another year and included considerable attention to details of asset
valuation, although at first, for about six months, the discussions were
relatively infrequent while the results of the consultants' study were
awaited. The valuation of gross replacement costs recommended by the
consultants was 8% below that prepared by ENDESA, a change which the Bank
concluded would be acceptable for purposes of financial performance
measurement under the terms of the Loan Agreement. The consultants'
valuation net of depreciation was, however, 21Z below the Company's, and the
recommended average annual depreciation was approximately 1.1Z, as opposed to
the average of 2.52 used in the Company's own calculations. These latter
conclusions were not acceptable to the Bank.
3.07      The large reduction which the consultants recommended in the
valuation of net fixed assets reflected conclusions of the consultants that
some of the Company's facilities were relatively obsolete. The Bank did not
accept this reductioa because the facilities were still in use and should. in
the Bank's view, be paid for by the sector's consumers. Moreover, the
acceptance of such a writeoff would have implied that the depreciation
foregone was not needed for the future capital needs of the Company, which at
the time was facing a large program of investments in increasingly costly
facilities.
3.08      The 1.1% average annual depreciation recommended by the consultants
impl.ed an average life for the Company's assets of close to 90 years. The
Bank considered this unrealistic in view of the nature of ENDESA's system and
the detailed assumptions and calculations of depreciation indicating an
average life of only 40 years made by the Company, with which the Bank was
famil_ar and had agreed in past years.
3.09      As the discussions developed between the Bank and the Government,
it became clear that there was little likelihood that the Government would
accept the Bank's views on valuation and rate of return. Also, the
Government had presented no supporting information for its arguments
regarding industrial competitiveness and inflationary impact, whereas rate
comparisons and analysis made by the Bank were considered by the Bank to have
disproved the arguments. Moreover, even though small real increases in
tariffs were being made by the Government almost every month, and changes in
taxes and import duties already had been made with positive effects on
ENDESA's net income, the Company's rate of return for 1978, as calculated by
the Bank, was expected to be less than 22, following 1977's result of 1.4%
(and rates of the same order or less in the six preceeding years). It was
decided, therefore, to reorient the discussion to a new investigation to be
made jointly by representatives of the Government, ENDESA, and the Bank, of
the Company's cash flow requirements without reference to predetermined
fiaancial ratios or to valuations of existing assets.



- 10 -
3.10      The result of the effort was an agreed set of financial projections
to be used in revising the financial performance requirements of the Loan
Agreement. The projections included (i) large reductions made by the
Government in the planned investment program of the Company, reflecting,
among other factors, acceptance of lower margins or security of power and
energy supply than before; (ii) real increases in tariffs of approximately
322 to be made over the next two years; and (iii) elimination of the
Government's tax on the Company's generation of electricity (equivalent to an
increase in tariffs of about 4%). On this basis, ENDESA could be expected to
achieve rates of return, with asset values and depreciation rates acceptable
to the Bank, of 1.8% in 1978, 4.7% in 1979, 7.1Z in 1980, and at least 9%
thereafter. These results implied a delay of approximately twt years in
reachIng the desired level of performance. To assure the Bank regarding the
result for 1979, the Minister of Economy provided a letter, dated November 3,
1978, sta_ing his intention to make real increases in the Company's tariffs
of 6% in the remaining two months of 1978 and 14% in 1979, which, according
to the agreed projections, would be sufficient.
3.11      The Bank's principal reservation about the projections was the size
of the investment program, less than half that which had been used in the
appraisal. The Bank concluded, however, that the program was acceptable, and
that substantially increased investment could be supported by the projected
internal cash generation if it should become necessary. With the reduced
investment program, the Company's self financing would be only 19% in 1979,
but from then on it would be very high (50% in 1980 and over 100% in 1981).
3.12      The Government accepted the projections because of:
Ci)    its desire to have ENDESA continue obtaining foreign commercial
loans, as had begun in 1978, on favorable terms and without
Government guarantee, which might have become more difficult or
even Impossible if Loan 1351-CH were to have been cancelled;
(ii)    Its desire co make ENDESA attractive for raising private equity
caDptal.
3.13      Revisions of the Loan Agreement in accordance with the projections
were approved -n December 1978 by ENDESA, the Government, and the Bank, and
the Loan Agreement was declared effective on December 28. The modified Loan
Agreemeat called for ENDESA co achieve financial rates of return of at least
4.7% In real terms in 1979, 7% in 1980, and 9% ia 1981 and thereafter. It
also specified that no withdrawal of proceeds would be made above the total
of US$12 mill-on equivalent unless the rate of return of 4.7% in 1979 had
been reached. The race of return requirements for 1977 and 1978 were
deleted.
3.14      Because of the uncertainty during 1977 and 1978 about the prospects
for funds becoming available to ENDESA frcm the Loan, ENDESA had started
procurement for the Project only on a few urgently needed items which it
could pay for with its own funds if necessary. The bulk of the
Project, therefore, was delayed approximately two years from the appraisal
schedule wh.le waiting for the Loan Agreement to become effective.



- 11 -
Revisions
3.15      Among the changes made in the Project and itti costs, in part as a
result of the delay, were:
(i)   The removal from the Project of the conversion of the Huasco Gas
Turbine, which ENDESA undertook with its own funds.
(ii) The removal of several transformers and other items
which the Company purchased with its own funds; the making of
various design changes and additions for CIS substation
improvements; and the indefinite postponement of several CIS
substation modifications and improvements.
(iii) Deletion of two 2 MW diesel generating units for isolated rural
systems because of lower than expected demand growth.
(lv) An increase in the estimated cost of the Load Dispatch System
reflecting updated prices, increased customs duties, increased
administration costs, and the inclusion of software costs
which had been omitted in the first estimate.
(v) An Increase in work by consultants on studies of future hydro
plants because of a shift of effort from the Company's staff to
consultants, and because of an expansion of the studies.
(vi) An increase in expenses for the studies for site investigations.
3.16      The final outline of costs presented by the Company as of December
31, 1982, in comparison with the appraisal figures, is shown in Table I at
Annex 1.  The figures in parentheses show the portion of the foreign cost of
each component of the Project covered by disbursements from Loan 1351-CH,
which, as noted earlier, totalled US$12 million equivalent.
Implementation Schedule
3.17      At the time of the appraisal, most parts of the Project were
scheduled for completion during 1978 or 1979, and the rest, certain CIS
transmission works and the Load Dispatch System, by the end of 1980. Because
of the two-year delay in starting, virtually no part of the Project had been
completed by the end of 1980. As of December 31, 1982, with disbursements
from the Loan terminated at USS12 million equivalent and the balance of the
Loan cancelled, the schedule was, in summary, as shown in Table 2 at Annex 1.
3.18      As noted before, approximately two years of the slippage were
caused by the delay in startup. Some of the cases of longer slippage were
influenced also by uncertainty about the availability of funds from the Loan
during 1980 and 1981 because of the Company's failure to reach its financial
performance commitment for 1979. Since most or all of the total amount of
each delay can be explained in this way, it may be inferred that the
appraisal schedule was largely a reasonable one in other respects.
Procurement
3.19      The Project consisted mainly of procurement and Installation of
diverse and relatively small items. A total of 27 separate supply contracts,



- 12 -
5 consultant contracts, and 87 purchase orders were required. The largest
purchase order t.Btalled US$2.1 million equivalent. ENDESA's correspondence
on procurement matters with the Bank was substantial, and was considered a
significant burden by the Company even though its procurement staff was an
able one, familiar with the procurement regulations of the Bank.
3.20      Procurement changes were requested by ENDESA during 1979 and 1980
In adjusting the composition of the Project, in part as a result of the
startup delay and uncertainty about the availability of the Loan. The
changes were agreed without difficulty by the Bank.
Costs and Disbursements
3.21      The largest changes from the appraisal cost estimates were, as
mentioned earlier, Increases in the estimates for the Load Dispatch System,
and for the equipmeat and consultant services for studies of future hydro
plants. The consultant services increase was primarily a volume change,
shlfting work to consultants which originally had been planned as
in-house, and expanding the studies to be done. The increased cost of
equipment for the studies was a result of this expansion. The change with
respect to the Load Dispatch System was the result mainly of updated prices,
customs duties, and administration costs.
3.22      Table 3 at Annex I compares actual disbursements from the Loan with
the estimate made at the end of 1976 ia the appraisal, and with the revised
estimate made in early 1979 immediately followIng the Loan Agreement's
becoming effective.
3.23       The revised estimate shows the slippage of two years which
occurred as a result of the delay in becoming effective. Further delays took
place during 1979 because of changes made in the content of the Project, and
during 1980 and 1981 because of doubt about the availability of disbursements
beyond US$12 million from the Loan as a result of 1979's earnings shuL'fall.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers, and Borrower
3.24       The consultants, contractors, and suppliers for the Project are
believed to have performed satisfactorily, although little was said on the
subiect in ENDESA's progress reports or in the Bank's supervision reports.
ENDESA confirmed to the Bank more recently that it considers the performance
to have been satisfactory, and that this explains at least in part the lack
of written commentary on the subject during the execution of the Project. As
for ENDESA itself, good managerial and technical performance was
maintained throughout the project implementatioa period. It is believed by
the Bank that the shortcomings in ENDESA's financial performaace have been
the result of financial pAlicies set by the Government for the sector, and do
not reflect unfavorably on the maaagement of the Company.

4.02       The actual results differ significantly from the forecast only in
the lower than expected sales by the distribution companies. These are
explained mainly by slower than planned implementation of the rural
electrification program.
Project's Role
4.03       Because of the Project's diverse nature, relatively small size,
and incomplete status, it is difficult to attribute Incremental sales to it.
The parts of the Project which have entered operation are, however,
functioning In the system as originally intended.
4.04       Among the Project's more important components, the 154 kV line
between Loncoche and Puerto Montt (291 km) in the CIS has contributed to
reducing Fifth Zone losses from over 20% to approximately 12% (see
Performance Indicators Table 1, Annex 2). Second Zone components have
e;abled most of the Zone to join the CIS and, thereby, replace thermal power
with hydropower. Distribution components have contributed to loss reduction;
and spare parts purchases have improved stock levels and generating plant
reliability.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Results
5.01       Tables 1-4 of Annex 3 compare 1977-81 appraisal and actual
financial figures for ENDESA. The Appraisal figures, which in the SAR were
presented in terms of November 1976 pesos, have been adjusted for
presentation here according to changes in Chile's CPI since 1976.
5.02       The main differences between the appralsal and actual figures are:
(1) substantially lower than forecast revenue from CIS sales (67% of the



- 14 -
forecast by 1981), due virtually entirely to lower than forecast tariffs;
(ii) annual constructLon expenditures approximately one-third to one-half the
appraisal levels; (iii) no contribution of funds from the Government,
compared to large, growing contributions forecast in the Appraisal;
(iv) larger than forecast Income taxes paid in 1981, and large dividend
payments in 1980 and 1981 compared to none forecast in the Appraisal; and
(v) lower than forecast total debt by 1981, but more short-term debt than
forecast. These differences and others, with their implications, are
discussed below.
5.03       The Appraisal's forecast of energy to be sold by ENDESA proved,
over the lonLg run, to be accurate for the CIS, and only slightly
overestimated for the distribution companies (which companies represent about
15t of ENDESA's total sales and 10 of its operating income). The forecasts
of annual operating expenses also were good in total, falling within 5-10% of
Lhe actual amounts, although there were wide variations among major
categories of expenses, including: (i) large underestimates of
persoanel-related expenses despite the fact that the numbers of personnel
were overestimated; and (ii) large overestimates of expenditures for fuel.
These results are explained by the facts that the Company's employees, on
average, received large, unanticipated increases in compensation during the
perlod; the Governiment required the Company to terminate a substantial part
of its conLstruction workforce, and to reduce slightly its operations and
admia.strative staff; and less than the projected thermal generation was
needed because better thaa expected rainfall and snowfall were experienced.
5,.04      The Goverament's limitations on the Company's tariffs resulted ia
rate of return shortfalls with respect to the agreed and projected levels
(Tahle 4 of Annex 3, and paragraphs 3.05 - 3.13 above). The earnings
obtained, givinig rates of return during 1979-81 in the neighborhood of 6Z on
revaluied assets, might have been adequate because of the lower than projected
livestment expenditures, but the Company's unanticipated tax, dividend,
and debt servAce requirements prevented this (paragraphs 5.06 and 5.07
below).
5.05       The annual Investment expenditures during 1977-82 averaged
approx.mately 6.5% of revalued Gross Fixed Assets in service. The investment
figures projected in the Appraisal were more than twice as large (over 13%
per year, oni average, of the Gross Fixed Assets in service). Since sales
grew at about 6% per year on average during the period, and, after levelliag
off in 1982, now are forecast to continue in the 5% - 7% range, it appep:s
that the actual Investment expenditures probably were adequate. In
retrospect, the Appraisal's figures seem excessive even against the
Appraisal's assumption of a long term growth rate of 7.5% for sales.
5.06       Because of the lower investment expenditures, there was no need
for the capital transfers from the Government which had been forecast, and
the Goverament instead used ENDESA as a source of funds. During 1978-82,
approximately US$850 mll1ion was borrowed by the Company, mostly from
commercial banks in medium term dollar loans at floating rates, of which
approximately US$275 million was transferred to the Government in dividends
and income tax on profit consisting largely of monetary correction" gains.
These gains, wh1ch are taxable under Chilean law, are balance sheet gains
occurring when asset revaluation in a year exceeds the revaluation of foreign



- 15 -
debt, as happened several years when the peso/dolla- Pxchange rate was held
constant (at 39.0 to 1.0) while peso inflation was running at an average of
about 30% per year.
5.07       As a result of ENDESA's transfers to the Government, in 1981 the
Company's net Internal cash generation was negative. In 1982, there was cash
for self-financing of 14Z of the Company's investments, but only with
rollover of the short term debt. In 1981, the Company rolled over US$135
million of short term debt, and in 1982. approximately US$170 million. The
short term debt balance at end 1982 was US$195 million equivalent, not
Including the US$82 million short-term portion of long term debt.
Financial Covenants
5.08       With respect to performance against the two principal financial
covenants (paragraphs 2.31 and 3.13), the agreed minimum rates of return were
not met, and the debt service coverage minimum (1.5 times) of the debt
limitation covenant was not met as new borrowlngs were undertaken by the
Company, but the Bank did not object to the borrowings. The earnings
shortfalls, as noted earlier, would have been considered less significant
given the Company's lower than expected rate of growth had the Company not
also been required to make large transfers of funds to the Government
(Paragraph 5.04).
5.09       For 1979, the first full year in which the Loan Agreement vas
effective, the Company's rate of return was 4.2Z, compared to the agreed
minimum of 4.7%. At the time, investment spending was runnlng at
approximately 50% of the level projected in the SAR, and the large tax and
dividend transfers to the Government had not yet begun. The Bank's laitial
response to the situation was, therefore, to seek reconfirmation by the
Company and the Government of the Intention to comply with respect to rates
of return in the future. There was no threat to suspend disbursements. The
Loan Agreement s provision for terminating disbursements at a total of US$12
million, however, had "automatically" gone into effect (Paragraph 4 of
Schedule I of the Loan Agreement) because of the failure to reach a rate of
return of 4.7% in 1979, and it was generally understood by the Company and
the Government that it would not be likely that the Bank would walve this
provision without being confident that the financial performance of the
Company would become satisfactory.
5.10       During the next year, the Company held back its applications for
disbursements so as to remain below the US$12 million limit while exploring
with the Bank and the Government what could be done to improve lts finances
and avoid cancellation of the loai. The Company was not very concerned about
the possibility of losing the loan funds, which were relatively small
compared to what were being obtained readily In new foreign borrowings at the
time from commercial sources. The Company did, however, want to avold a
default declaration and cancellation by the Bank because of the effect this
might have on the ava7lability to the Company of new commercial financing.
5.11       During 1980, there were further improvements in earnings resulting
in a rate of return of 5.9% compared to the agreed minimum of 7.0%. Thls
lower result, agaln, might have been considered satisfactory by the Bank
e;,cept for other factors. The first of these factors was the emergence of



- 16 -
the Government's tariff policy based on marginal costs, which explicitly
excluded making any allowance for the Company's debt service requirements.
The Government established the new policy by a decree defining formulas for
marginal costs to be used in setting tariffs. The formulas, which were
derived by the National Energy Commission, include provisions for periodic
adjustment according to indices for sector investment costs and generation
inputs, but do not take into account short or medium term financial
requirementsl/. The second factor was the impact of the Government's tax
and dividend policies, which began to take effect draining the Company of
resouLrces as the Government continued to hold the dollar/peso exchange rate
unchanged (Paragraphs 5.06 and 5.07)2/
5.12       Because of these developments, the Bank did not find the Company's
financiaL performance to be satisfactory even though the rate of return was
further improved. The Bank continued to try to perusade the Chilean
authorities, as it had done for the past year, to permit a more favorable
cutcome, until September 1981 when it became clear that the respective views
could not be reconciled. Disbursements reached approximately US$12.0 million
equivalent in October 1981, and the Company cancelled US$23.0 million
equivalent by letter to the Bank received November 4, 19813/. The Bank and
the Company agreed that this would he the best way for the Company of
handling the situation.
I/   The National Energy Commission commented that after the loan was closed,
a new law was issued, providing for reimbursable financial contributions
from clients, to partially resolve any financial problems which the
power utilities might experience resulting from a tariff structure based
on the marginal cost of supply. It also indicated that under the
existing marginal-cost based tariffs, ENDESA earned returns of 8.6X in
1983 and over 9.0% in 1984 (Attachment 1, Page 7). It should be pointed
out, however, that despite a healthy rate of return, ENDESA was still
facing debt service difficulties in 1984, that actual applicatiuon of the
new law has been uneven, and that contributions have been adjusted
downward several times by the utilities.
2/   Private and public companies are subject to the same general tax and
dividend system, regardless of ownership or function. The National
Energy Commission correctly points out that, and the Bank concurs, it
would be undesirable to introduce differential features into the tax and
dividend system to recognize differences of ownership or function
(Attachment L, page 8, and 9). The Bank considered, however, that other
measures would have been required to offset the financial impact of the
tax aad dividend policies applied.
3/   According to ENDESA, insistence on compliance with the rate-of-return
covenant on the part of the Bank was the main cause of delay to the
Project and subsequent cancellation of 71% of the loan. ENDESA
recommended that in the future the Bank should limit its requirements to
ensuring the feasibility of projects, not the direction of sector
economic policy (Attachment 1, page 4). Such recommendation would
represent a majr departure from Bank's policies and should not be
considered, if at all, in the context of a particular project.



- 17 -
5.13       It may be concluded that the financial covenants served their
intended purposes as well as could have been done under the circumstances.
It is not likely that additional or alternative covenants such as a dividend
limitation covenant or a contribution to investment covenant would have been
more influential with the Government. The debt limitation covenant might, in
theory, have been better if it had been written to include short term debt
(which was explicitly excluded), in view of the Company's subsequent short
term debt problem; but, in fact, the Company came under the covenant's
requirement for agreement by the Bank to new long term borrowings virtually
from the outset, and it was never denied this agreement.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01       The Appraisal's diagnosis of the institutional problems of the
sector focussed on deficiencies in the utility regulatory law and in the
application of the law by the regulatory authorities, the Superintendencia de
Servicios Electricos, de Gas y de Telecomunicaciones (SEGTEL), and the
Comision de Tarifas. The conclusion was reached that ENDESA's poor financial
performance had been due in large part to poor regulatory performance, which
was believed to be attributable to '...the attitude of the regulatory
agencies, reflecting, in turn, government pressure to hold prices down", and
to provisions in the law"...which are either directly prejudicial to the
titlities or are capable of being so interpreted as to lead to that result".
6.02       The thrust for institutional improvement in connection with the
Loan was, therefore, the requirement, agreed in the Loan negotiations, that
certain modifications to the regulatory law which had been proposed to the
Government by ENDESA should be incorporated into the law as a condition of
effectiveness of the Loan Agreement (Paragraphs 2.08, 2.32, 3.01, 3.02 and
3.03). As was mentioned earlier in this report: (i) the main intent of the
modifications was to reduce delays in obtaining approval by the Government of
tariff incr.ises proposed by a company, and to improve the bases used in
determining the increases; and (ii) the Government finally did modify the law
for approximately one half of what had been proposed, and agreed to take
appropriate administrative action on most of the other points, even though
not required to do so by law.
6.03       The practical effect of the changes was virtually nil because the
responsibility in the Government for analysis and decision-making on tariffs
had, by then, been taken over by the Ministries of Economy and Finance (with
new Ministers and staffs), and by the newly established National Energy
Commission (1979), which in effect was functioning as an arm of the
Ministries. The staff of these organizations bypassed the existing
regulatory authorities and established tariff policy and tariffs by new
decrees without regard to prior norms and procedures, including those which
had been agreed in connection with the Loan.



- 18 -
6.04       The creatlion of the National Energy Commission was one of two
major changes in the organization of the sector duL.ng the implementation of
the project. The other major change was the restructuring of ENDESA (and
also of Chilectra) into a holding company with multiple, wholly owned
subsidiaries. The intention was to achieve improved efficiency through
decentralization and specialization, and to facilitate, in the long-term,
partial privatization of State Enterprises through sales of stock or other
specific mechanisms (Attachment 1, page 8).
6.05       The management of ENDESA continued to function satisfactorily
after the changes, but with less influence on investment and tariff policy.
Also the National Energy Commission staff was given the job of investment
planning for the sector, which before had been assigned to ENDESA. The
intention was to separate the policy-formulation function from the operative
function in the power sector, and to facilitate the formulation and
implementation of consistent policies for the energy sector. ENDESA
continued to carry out studies, but, under the direction of the National
Energy Commission. Experience with this new organization has been, in
general, positive. (Attachment 1, page 5).
6.06       The Loan Agreement provisions for institutional change, therefore,
proved not to have been effective because of decisions by the Governmernt to
proceed along different lines. It is doubtful that any other or modified
covenants aimed toward the original institutional objectives would have
served better, given the relative ease with which the Government was able to
again change the laws in question.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
7.01       The Appraisal Report explained that no reasonable alternative
existed for much of the equipment of the Project such as the diesel
generating units and construction and transportation equipment. It stated
also that where alternative solutions were considered by ENDESA, as in the
case of transmission system improvements, least-cost configurations were
selected by the Company using a 12% discount rate.
7.02       The detailed presentation to justify the project in the Appraisal
Report (Annex 12) was an internal financial rate of return calculation for
the projected total investment program of the Company (not including
generation projects after the program's Antuco Hydro Project), because, the
Report explained, the Project was expected to be "....a comparatively small
part of the! total investment program...." The Appraisal found that an
internal fin..ncial rate of return of 26% would be achieved for the investment
program with revenue from Antuco (300 MW), assuming that future tariffs would
be at levels needed to earn the minimum rates of return on revalued assets
agreed in connection with the Loan. The Report stated that if expenditures
which already had been made for construction of Antuco had been included in
the calculation, the rate of return still would be 20.9%. In addition, it
stated that this indicated that "...the prices to be paid by customers will,
on average, exceed the marginal cost of supply."



- 19 -
7.03       An estimate of the actual program's internal financial rate of
return made on a basis comparable in most respects to that of the Appraisal
ls shown in Annex 4 Table 1. The main difference between the estimates is
the new estimate's projection of tariffs at existing le els 11i2 real terms)
compared to the Appraisal's assumption of levels meeting the Loan Agreement's
rate of return minimum.
7.04       The resultant inLernal financial rate of return of 12% indicates
that even with the lower than covenanted tariff levels, the cost of the
investment program would be recovered. (This does not, however, imply that
the tariffs are adequate since future investment requirements, the
availability of equity capital, and debt service should, Gf course, be takeG
into account in establishing tariffs).
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01       The Bank's appraisal of the Project's physical elements followed,
for the most part, normal lines for sector lending by the Bank to a well
established, relatively sophisticated power company. Heavy reliance was
placed by the Bank on analyses and judgements of ENDESA regarding its
requirements in view of the diversity and large number of components making
up the Project. There has since been no indication that any component
eventually procured was not needed, or was used in a less than optimal
application. (It should be noted however, that some of the components of the
original Project still are being deferred by ENDESA).
8.02       Supervision of the Project's physical elements by the Bank
concentrated on procurement administration, which, it is believed, was
carried out satisfactorily. Inspection by Bank staff of actual items
procurred and incorporated into the system would not be practical and was not
done because of the large number and geographic dispersal of the items.
8.03       The Appraisal's assessment of the sector's institutional problems
could not reasonably have ancicipatcd the major departures taken soon after
by the Government in establishing a top level agency for tariff and
investment policy, bypassing existing authorities, regulations, and
procedures. It also could not have anticipated the Government's dividing
ENDESA and Chilectra into subsidiaries aimed at eventual privatization. As a
result, the institutional strengthening measures (changes to the electricity
law) associated with the Loan were not verv useful. In addition, the Bank's
having allowed the measures to slip to a condition for Loan Agreement
effectiveness rather than insisting on their implementation prior to loan
approval seems to have been a mistake. IE may have contributed to weakening
the credibility of the Loan conditions in general, and it resulted in greater
resentment by the authorities of having to make the changes than probably
otherwise would have occurred_
8.04       The assessment of ENDESA's financial requirements in the Appraisal
was good regarding forecasts of sales and operating costs but flawed in its
overestimation of the Company's future investment. The latter led to



- 20 -
projected requirements for earnings and equity contributions from the
Government which proved not to be needed. Also, the Government's exchange
rate policy with its associated effect on monetary correction earnings, was
not (and probably could not have been) anticipated, nor were anticipated the
related funds transfers from the Company to the Government in taxes and
dividends.
8.05       The Loan Agreement's rate of return covenants called for excessive
performance minimums, and, therefore, had little credibility with the
Government and ENDESA. It is, however, unlikely that, under the
circumstances, any other covenants or modified versions would have served
better.
8.06       The Bank could have taken a stronger stand, and perhaps have
succeeded, against the Government's tariff, tax, and dividend policies, using
the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement's financial performance provisions
with respect to all prior loans from the Bank to ENDESA. A substantial
balance remained to be repaid to the Bank from these loans. It was felt,
however, that the potential negative consequences of threatening to call for
prepayment would have been worse than the possible harm that might be done by
the disputed policies. In general, the h ink maintained a positive approach
throughout its dealing; with ENDESA and the Government in the belief that even
with financial polcie:; ,hich the Bank could not support, the sector would
continue to function idequately if not optimally, and the security of the
debt to the Bank would continue to be good.
8.07       The working telationships between the Bank, Government, and ENDESA
during project supervision weLe good. Routine financial reporting to the
Bank was, however. less than it should have been, mainly because of failure
by the Bank to estdblish appropriate detailed guidelines. The needed
information was obtained during supervision missions, but probably at
some-.-ht gre- Br cost in staff effort than otherwise would have b --
requir- d.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01       From the broadest perspective, it may be concluded that the
proceeds of the Loan were usefully invested and the financial performance of
ENDESA improved substantially, although less than had been desired. It is,
however, unlikely ;hat the improvement in performance was related to the Loan
or to Bank influence.
9.02       The Bank had no influence on the Government regarding policies
emerging with which the Bank disagreed after the Loan Agreement became
effective. The financial covenants of the Loan Agreement did not in
themselves affect the policies and performance to which they pertained, and
the Bank chose not to take the strongest measures available to it to try to
obtain compliance.



- 21 -
9.03       The main lesson to be learned from the experience is that in
similar circumstances in the future less reliance should be placed by the
Bank on formal instruments (state law and Loan and Guarantee Agreements) to
help assure adherence by borrowers to policies promoted by the Bank. Such
Instruments -mst continue to be used, bue greater emphasis should be placed
on persuasion of authorities to acceptance of the policies as being in the
public interest. Greater emphasis on persuasion and achieving genuine
acceptance should, in most cases, lead to better policy as well as to better
adherence. Bank staff should be expected to judge the degree to which policy
in question is accepted, apart from explicit, formal evidence of agreement,
and to give an cpinion on it. The Bank should try to assure that commitments
made by borrowe-s and Governments in Loan and Guarantee Agreements are made
only to policies which they genuinely accept.

No. 131/128                              Santiago, January 28, 1985
Mr. Yukinori Watanabe
Director
Operations Evaluation Department

Washington, D.C.
Re: Report on Sixth Power Project - Loan 1351-CH
Dear Mr. Watanabe:
We refer to your letter of November 21, 1984, with which you sent us
your department's report on the execution of the Sixth Power Project (Loan
1351-CH) and also requested commuents by Chilean agencies and authorities on
that report.
We consider it appropriate to enclose herewith the comments
furnished by the Empresa Nacional de Electricida'  S.A. (ENDESA) and by the
National Energy Commission, institutions that were directly involved in the
project and whose comments contain views that are shared by this Ministry.
A general observation that must be made regarding the content of the
report is that the criticisms expressed concerning problems in the execution
of the project and noncompliance with certain conditions are extremely harsh.
In addition to the points made by ENDESA and the National Energy Commission,
it is felt that the indisputable influence on the environment f^r the project
of the world recession, which had a-major impact on Chile's entire economy, is
not taken sufficiently into consideration.
We would also like to refer specifically to the criticisms made in
the report regarding the policies on taxes and dividends applied to ENDESA
during the execution of the project. It has to be borne in mind that the
taxes and profit distribution referred to are matters of general legislation
applicable to all enterprises, whether public or private, domestic or
foreign. As a result, exceptions cannot be made for any one individual
enterprise.

ENDESA's Comments on the World Bank Project Completion
Report dated November 21, 1984 on the Sixth Power Project
(Loan 1351-CR) a/
The report states, regarding ENDESA, that "good management and
technical performance was maintained throughout the project implementation
period."
This statement could be taken as justification for refraining from
commenting on the report. However, with a view to helping to ensure that
future operations prove to be fully satisfactory to the Bank and the borrowers
we would like to draw attention to certain aspects.
To analyze this project objectively, and to lessen the risk of
drawing erroneous conclusions, it is important to bear the following four
features of it in mind:
(a) The amount of the original loan was small, compared with ENDESA's
high yearly levels of capital expenditure;
(b) The loan financed a wide variety of equipment intended for a large
number of facilities scattered throughout the entire country;
(c)  The project was carried out during a time when major changes were
taking place in Chile's economy;
(d) The long period that elapsed between the initial appraisal of the
project and the date on which the loan was declared effective.
These features of this particular project make it essential to
observe prudence in seeking to derive from the completion report conclusions
that will be valid for future credit operations.
It seems clear that the Bank's insistence that ENDESA comply
strictly with certain annual rate of return requirements was the main cause of
the delays with the project and the subsequent cancellation of 71S of the loan.
Since the amount of the loan was no more than a small proportion of
ENDESA's total investment expenditure, this requirement was absolutely
unneeded to ensure repayment of the loan and accomplishment of the project's
objectives. In the event, such obligations were more of an obstacle to the
achievement of these objectives, with the result that their berefits were not
obtained until later than originally intended.

reflect comments by ENDESA.

Moreover, it seems difficult to reconcile a requirement regarding
short-term annual return goals with a system of tariff setting based on
marginal costs, a system that was after all advocated primarily by the Bank.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, we consider it apposite to note that
the preliminary figure for ENDESA's return for 1984 (based on the data
available to date), calculated according to the system laid down by the Bank
in Loan Agreement 1351-CH, works out at slightly more than the 9X required by
that agreement.
We accordingly believe it would be more productive to limit the
requirements in future loans to ensuring the feasibility of the projects
concerned, and act to seek through them to direct the entire economic policy
of the sector in question, thereby running the risk that neither objective
will be achieved.
Despite the difficu"ties that the project experienced, practically
all the benefits expected from it were obtained, whether the achievements in
question were financed from the loan or with ENDESA's own funds. At tLe same
time, other projects involving much larger snms were completed without delays
or financial problems. It is true that a part of the total investments
envisaged by ENDESA in 1974 were postponed. However, the report ought to note
that between the time the project was appraised and the present day the world
has experienced two major recessions that severely impacted Chile. These
recessions caused a slowing down of the rate of increase in demand for power
in most countries, so that generating companies had to adjust their equipment
programs. The steps that ENDESA took in these circumstances served to
safeguard the interests of the country, of the company itself and of the Bank.
The Completion Report also includes a description and analysis of
the progress of the project and of relations between the Bank, ENDESA and
certain Chilean Government authorities, and also some assessments of the
credit position of ENDESA and of the country at that time. Although we prefer
not to go into details on this point, we nevertheless feel obliged to obs..rve
that the analysis made is somewhat superficial and incomplete, since the facts
and opinions referred to in the report cannot be properly assessed without
taking into account all the circumstances prevailing at that time and the
changes that were occurring in Chile then.
It is accordingly evident that simply reading the report under
review, without taking into account the context to which we have drawn
attention, could easily lead to erroneous conclusions.

NATIONAL ENERGY COMI SSION
Comments of the National Energy Commission on
the Completion Report Concerniug the Sixth Power
Proiect. Financed by World Bank Loan 1351-CH to ENDESA
1.   General
This document presents the comments of the National Energy
Comission (NEC) on the Completion Report on the Sixth Power Project (Loan
1351-CE).
The comments given here do not relate to specifics of execution of
the project, regarding which it is more appropriate that ENDESA should comment
directly.
We do, however, wish to make certain observations concerning the
electric-power policy objectives that the Bank sought to achieve through the
loan in question. These objectives are evidenced by the obligations placed on
the guarantor (the Chilean Government) and the borrower (ENDESA) to achieve
certain rates of return for ENDESA and to implement amendments to Chile's
Electricity Law of the time (DFL No. 4 of 1959). It should be noted that the
amendments required by the Bank to DFL No. 4 of 1959 did-not question tne
basic principles of that law, but were directed essentially toward achieving
quicker adjustment of tariff levels in the high-inflation situations that the
country's economy was experiencing at the time the loan was granted.
In addition, the report comments on the policies applied to ENDESA
with regard to tax and dividend payments to the State.
2. Planning of the Power Sector and Tariff Policy
The report refers to the establishment of the National Energy
Commission (NEC) as one of the important changes made in the organization of
the sector during the execution of the project, resulting in transfer to the
NEC of investment-planning functions formerly performed by ENDESA and
reduction of ENDESA's influence in tariff policies. b/
Although the report does not express explicitly negative opinions
about this change, given the context in which it is written we feel it
desirable to set forth here the reasons why the change was made and also to
commnent on the effects that the creation of the NEC has had on the planning of
investments in the sector and on the tariff policies applied in the country in
recent years. b/
The rJEC was formed because the Government recognized the importance
of the energy sector for Chile's economic and social development and also
because the interrelationship between the different forms of energy renders
the formulation and implementation of consistent policies for the sector as a
whole eminently desirable.

comments by NEC.

In this context a fundamental feature of the organization of the
State is considered to be separation of its normative functions from the
business activities to be pursued by public enterprises. The Government
accordingly considered, and considers. that it is inappropriate for its
enterprises to play a dual role of business activity coupled with preponderant
participation in policy formulation without there being an effective
counterpart at higher level in the State administration.
The experience gained with this new organization has been positive,
specifically in regard to investment planning and tariff matters.
In investment planning the NEC's role has beet twofold:
-    anaylsis of the State enterprises' investments from the standpoint
of the general interest of the country, which does not necessarily
always coincide with the aims of individual enterprises;
-    promotion and creation of the conditions necessary for the
implementation of investment projects that were outside the purview
of the State enterprises.
Regarding the former - and thanks in considerable measure to the
new organization - the Government has had available to it the necessary
analysis capacity which has enabled it to postpone capital expenditures and
eliminate projects promoted by State enterprises.  As examples of this in the
power sector, the following may be quoted in particular:
-    elimination of a nuclear power project for the Central
Interconnected System (CIS) promoted by the Chilean Nuclear Power
Commission, with ENDESA and CHILECTRA participation;
-    elimination of a thermal power station in the CIS that would have
been put into service before the Bolbun-Machicura complex, a project
promoted by CHILECTRA;
-    postponement of the Pehuenche project for four years;
-    final decision to carry out other medium-scale hydroelectric
projects while deferring the Pehuenche project for a further year.
Concerning the second facet, and still with reference to the power
sector, it has been possible to implement the Norte Grande Interconnected
System and to promote study of development of medium-capacity (100-150 MW)
hydroelectric plants which have proven to be economically competitive with
larger projects.
With regard to the report's comments concerning tariffs, the
adoption by the Government of a price policy based on marginal costs is based
on a principle of economic efficiency since, in the Government's opinion,
prices are the most suitable instrument for prompting correct decisions by
both power users and the enterprises that generate and distribute the power.
In addition, this tariff policy for power is consistent with the policy that
has been applied in Chile for other forms of energy.

The old Electricity Lay (DFL No. 4 of 1959), that was in force
during the execution period of the project, suffered in the Government's view
from serious flaws in its fundamental principle of seeking to provide a legal
guarantee of a particular rate of return to power companies in all
circumstances, regardless of the efficiency with which they operated. IL is
an incontrovertible fact that the former rate system, based on the principle
of average cost, led to a distorted tariff structure into which cross
subsidies between different categories of users became incorporated, with the
resultant negative effects on resource allocation. It would be naive to
believe that a marginalist structure in and of itself could provide an assured
safeguard against a policy of subsidies, but it at least has the merit of
rendering explicit the cost such subsidies entail for the country. This
factor alone serves to introduce an element of moderation in subsidy policies,
which the old system could not do quite apart from the economic inefficiency
as already noted.
The policy of tariff setting based on marginal cost as applied by
the Government may well be in conflict with the financial restrictions imposed
by the Bank, bat regarding those restrictions it must be borne in mind that
they could compromise other roles to be played by prices to which the
Government assigns greater importance.
To resolve any financial problems that the enterprises might have.
the new law (DFL No. I of 1982) currently in effect provides for reimbursable
financial contributions from clients that are more efficient from the economic
viewpoint and also fairer from the social standpoint. This mechanism, besides
forming an instrument for partially resolving the financial problem of toe
power companies is also working - in a limited fashion right now but on a
larger scale in future - toward the goal of partial privatization of the
power sector discussed further on in this document. c/
The possible incompatibility of a tariff policy based on marginal
costs with objectives of a financial nature that, according to the report, was
a major consideration in the position adopted by the Bank, is not moreover
consistent with the evidence provided by the results of the application of
this policy in regard to power tariffs in Chile. The fact is, that
application of this policy resulted in ENDESA obtaining a rate of return of
8.6X in 1983 and over 9-OS in 1984. c/
Taking into consideration the realities of price policies applied
for power and for other forms of energy in other countries which the Bank has
assisted financially over the past decade and comparing these with the
situation and results achieved in Chile in recent years, it appears somewhat
paradoxical that it was considered necessary to cancel a part of a loan -
which was moreover a small one - granted by the Bank. Rather than
criticizing the way in which this loan was negotiated, in our modest opinion
we feel it is necessary to review the orthodox policies that the Bank is still
applying in the power sector in various countries without giving adequate
consideration to their circumstances and the context of their policy in the
rest of the energy sector in particular and in the rest of the economy in
general. The more so since it has been the Bank itself which, through various
seminars for the Latin American and Caribbean countries, has promoted tariff
setting schemes based on marginal cost.

3.   Organization of the State Power Enterprises
The views stated in the report regarding the new organization the
Government has been introducing for the State power enterprises and its
privatization aims call for the following conments on our part:
(a) Privatization of the State power enterprises was not the sole, nor
the most important, objective sought by the restructuring of these
enterprises.  The organization based on subsidiaries is designed in the first
place to achieve decentralization of the enterprises and to allow the
subsidiaries to operate more efficiently in their areas of specialization. dl
(b) At no time has privatization of the entire power sector been stated
as an objective. Partial privatization of the State enterprises is seen as a
long-term goal and one that will have to be brought about gradually. In this
respect, organization by means of subsidiaries is considered a necessary
condition, but in no case sufficient for privatization and it is also felt
that other more specific mechanisms should be applied to achieve a growing
measure of participation by other agents in the sector.
(c) These specific mechanisms include the system of reimbursable
contributions from clients envisaged in the new Electricity Law (DFL No. I of
1982) which, in the case of the State enterprises, should preferably be
effected by means of sales of stock in the enterprises. Application of this
scheme has already resulted in privatization of 7.3X of
CHILECTRA-Metropolitana, the country's largest power distribution enterprise.
(d) Another specific means for achieving greater private stockholdings
in State power enterprises is the recently promulgated amendment allowing
pension funds to be invested in State power enterprises. among others. This
important amendment will make it possible for institutional investors to
participate in the power sector.
4. Tax System and Dividend Distribution Policy
Finally, although it is a subject that goes beyond energy policy
proper, we would like to refer to the comments made regarding the tax and
dividend payments the State corporations are required to make: c/
In the first place, all c3mpanies in the country, whether private or
public and regardless of their sphere of activity, are subject to the same
general tax and dividend system. Discretionality with regard to taxation and
the existence of different tax systems for businesses depending on who owns
them and what they do, are not felt to be desirable.
Moreover, there are also generally applicable legal provisions
governing dividend distribution policy that lay down a minimum percentage of
profits that must obligatorily be distributed among the shareholders;
distribution of more than that minimum is a matter for decision by the Meeting
of Stockholders of each company.
Apart from these considerations of a general nature. the following
additional comments on these points are called for:
d/  OED Note:   Highlights and para. 6.04 amended to reflect substance
of NEC comments.

-39-                       Page 9 of 9
(a) The report's criticisms of the dividend policy applied to ENDESA are
considered to be incongruous bearing in mind that - as is admitted - the
investments actually effected were in fact substantially less than was
initially programmed.
(b) Permanent application of a minimum dividend distribution policy to
the State power companies will probably compromise the objectives sought
through greater private participation and also the aims of achieving a
healthier diversification of investment portfolios for pension funds and other
institutional investors. It also tends to weaken the system of reimbursable
contributions through stock purchases envisaged by the current Electricity Law.
(c) Ciearly, if it is thought desirable that the State make greater
financial contributions to its power companies, these can always be made, but
it is considered inappropriate that these should be made by creating tax and
legal exceptions for some or any of the companies and even less by
compromising the possibility of other financial contributions to the sector
which, while they may be modest at this time, are considered a much better
option than the traditional capital contributions that the State has had to
make in the past.
As a final comment, we feel we should refer to what is stated in
paragraph 6.03 which, in our opinion, reflects unfamiliarity with the laws in
force in Chile during the execution period of the project, and more
particularly the body of law by means of which the National Energy Commission
was established, together with the degree of autonomy possessed by the
Commission. el
