MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE STATE OF ERITREA
FOR A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUND PROJECT
I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the State of Eritrea for SDR 11.8 million, the equivalent
of US$ 17.5 million on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a
Community Development Fund Project. The proceeds of the credit would be made
available as grant to the Eritrea Community Development Fund (ECDF). The ECDF
would on-lend US$ 0.5 million equivalent to Village Administrations or other Financial
Intermediaries up to 2 years at an interest rate sufficient to compensate for inflation,
administrative costs, and loan loss provision. The Village Administrations or other FIs
will on-lend to final beneficiaries at commercial rates.
1.    Country and Sector Background. Eritrea is located in the northeastern part of
Africa. The overall size of the country is about 125,000 square km, with a coast line of
1,000 km, and a population estimated in the range of 3.0 and 3.5 million, including nearly
half a million refugees in Sudan. Eritrea is one of the poorest countries in the world, with
a GDP per capita in the range of US $160 to US $190 (less than half of the average per
capita income of Sub-Saharan countries). While there are no firm estimates of the
incidence of poverty, it is believed that about two thirds of the population is poor. The
country's social indicators are consistent with its low per capita income. Life expectancy
at birth is estimated to be low at about 46 years, compared to 50 years for Sub-Saharan
Africa. Infant mortality is 135 per thousand live births, the under-five child mortality rate
is 203 per thousand live births, and maternal mortality is over 700 per one hundred
thousand live births. Also in the education sector the indicators are lower than in most
African countries. The illiteracy rate stands at 80% for men and 90% for women, and the
gross enrollment rate at the primary level is among the lowest in Africa (47% in 1994).
2.    Historically, Eritrea was a nation of skilled people with a wealth of experience in
entrepreneurship, commerce, and international trade. At the time of its liberation, in 1991,
Eritrea inherited a devastated economy: enterprises were not operational; the agricultural
sector was severely damaged by the war; major infrastructure was damaged or destroyed;
and basic social service facilities had suffered from the effects of the war or serious
neglect. The disruption of family life due to war, displacement and drought, has left
thousands of children as destitutes and orphans. It is estimated that there are nearly
100,000 internally displaced people, and some 50,000 ex-fighters have been demobilized
for reintegration into civilian life.
3.    Since independence the Government has been expanding the provision of social
services, putting particular emphasis on reducing the regional imbalances by providing
services to the traditionally neglected areas, improving the quality of the services
provided, and increasing the access of women to basic social services. In the health sector
the health expenditures as a percent of total Government expenditures though still very
low, show a consistent incremental trend after independence, with a consequent
improvement in the extension of primary health services. The MOH estimates that only
46 percent of the population presently have access to basic health services, but the share of
population with access to PHC services has been increasing. Data gathered during a



-2-
recent informal Health Sector Review (1995), show a significant increase in the number of
children from 0-5 years of age whose weight and height were monitored at health facilities
from 1993 to 1994. The share increased from about 6.9 in 1993, to over 22.4 percent in
1994. The same review also recorded nearly a doubling of the share of pregnant women
having at least one ante-natal visit from 1993 (14.5%) to 1994 (28.2%). The share of
births delivered at a health facility increased from about 2.7 (1993) to 9 percent (1994).
From 1991 to 1994 a total of 181 health facilities at various levels have been constructed
or rehabilitated, facilitating the provision of PHC in the rural and most remote areas of the
country.
4.    The same positive trend is found in education. The budget for the education sector
increased almost threefold between 1992 and 1994, and the results have been impressive.
When compared to the 1992/93, academic year enrollments in pre-school, primary, middle
and secondary education increased by almost 10%, 12%, 15% and 4% respectively
(reaching 47.4 percent in 1993/94 at the primary level; 22.4 at the junior secondary level;
and 13.7 at the senior secondary level). In more than 25 centers, literacy programs were
provided to 4,000 adults, while the evening programs enrolled more than 12,500 adults.
5.    Project Rationale. Investing in human capital is the principal government
strategy to achieve self-sustained and balanced growth. A large portion of Eritrea' s
population continues to suffer from lack of basic social services and doesn't have the
educational skills and access to capital that will enable it to participate in and benefit from
the recovery and growth process. Recent Bank studies (Country Economic Memorandum,
1994) have identified four major strategies to achieve the country's development
objectives: (i) supporting the participation of communities in the development process,
including management and maintenance of basic social services, and building community
managerial and implementation capacity; (ii) strengthening the role and contribution of
private sector in local development efforts; (iii) improving cost-efficiency, and
maximizing resources mobilization at the community level; and, (iv) focusing on the
social and economic advancement of women, and on environmental conservation.
6.    The ECDF would provide a valuable instrument to implement these strategies. As
successfully tested during the pilot phase implemented under the RRPE (Recovery and
Rehabilitation Program for Eritrea, IDA Credit No. 2478), the ECDF would build upon
the traditional structure of the Eritrean society, based on a strong role of local
communities. It would promote community ownership and strengthen the capacity of
local communities to identify and prioritize their needs, implement sub-projects, manage
the facilities built with ECDF financing, and play an active role in their maintenance and
sustainability. ECDF would also maximize resources mobilization at the community
level, reducing the burden of capital and recurrent investment on the central budget.
Finally, the pilot ECRF (Eritrea Community Rehabilitation Fund) under RRPE, has
proven to be a very cost-effective instrument to achieve the Government's development
objectives: (i) the average cost of construction has generally been lower than those of the
same facilities built by line ministries; (ii) the average sub-project cycle is faster than the
same financed by line ministries; and, (iii) the role and contribution of local communities
is stronger.



-3-
7.    Project Objectives. The Project's objectives are to finance community-initiated
sub-projects which will: (i) support the rehabilitation and development of basic social and
economic infrastructure critical to the improvement and development of the economic and
social conditions of the population, especially in the rural and war devastated areas of
Eritrea; and (ii) improve the income-generating capacity of poor people and households.
8.    Project Description. The ECDF would be a demand-based project. It would
finance sub-projects that have been identified and requested by local communities, and in
whose design, implementation, monitoring, maintenance, and sustainability local
communities would play a key role. Sub-projects would be appraised to ensure that: (i)
they are developmental initiatives; (ii) they are sustainable, and that assets created with
ECDF support would be maintained and recurrent costs covered by responsible line
ministries and local communities as appropriate; (iii) they respond to basic needs and
priorities of poor communities, and especially vulnerable groups; (iv) the investment is
justified in terms of economic and social benefits; (v) they are acceptable in terms of the
Government's conservation and rehabilitation policies; and (vi) they are consistent with
the Government's sector development strategies. For each sub-project it is mandatory that
the benefiting community elects and forms a Community Project Committee, which will
be party to the contractual arrangements with the ECDF. It is also mandatory that
communities invest at least 10 percent of the project costs. The Project would consist of
three broad components:
(a)  Financing community-initiated sub-projects (US$ 40.47 million or 81% of total
project costs) to: (i) improve basic economic and social infrastructure,
especially primary and junior secondary schools, health stations and centers,
rural water supply, soil, water, and forestry conservation projects, and rural
feeder roads rehabilitation; and (ii) improve basic social services including
primary and pre-primary education, nutrition, basic health, and basic skills
development;
(b) Pilot Micro-credit for Income Generation and Micro-enterprise Development
(US $3.11 million or 6% of total project costs; of this US$ 2.6 million for line of
credit and US$ 0.51 for administrative expenses and operational costs). This
component would support on a pilot basis the launching of a savings and credit
program aimed at strengthening local micro-credit and savings institutions. The
program's objective would be to demonstrate the effectiveness of institutional
building efforts aimed at creating new income and employment opportunities in
targeted communities, thereby contributing to the improvement of living
standards, and to increase overall prosperity of these communities. The pilot
program will use the model of the village banking and would provide credit
incrementally to individuals who have first demonstrated a minimum capacity to
save for at least three months through elected village Administrations. The
average initial loan would not exceed Birr 750 (US$ 120) per member of the
borrowing group and would be repaid in six months. Subsequent loan amounts
would be increased in steps to a maximum of Birr 1,500 repayable in 6 months;
Birr 3,000 repayable in up to one year; and Birr 6,000 repayable in up to two



-4-
years. The program would also fund a limited number of larger small enterprises
either individually or collectively owned operating in the pilot areas. These
second-tier loans (which would vary from Birr 10,000 up to a maximum of Birr
100,000) would provide added flexibility to the Savings & Credit program by
filling gaps in the availability of financing for larger, somewhat more formalized
ventures which would still have no access to formal bank credit. Credit would
be delivered through selected intermediary organizations, which would be
provided with a small start-up revolving fund for on-lending to individuals
within the overall framework and guidelines of the program. The interest rate
charged from ECDF to the village Administration Unit would be sufficient to
compensate for: (i) inflation; (ii) cost of administration at the level of ECDF;
and (iii) anticipated losses tied to bad debts. ECDF and IDA will review annually
the interest rate applied from ECDF to the financial intermediaries. At the retail
level the FIs would be free to determine the interest rate charged to individual
borrowers; and
(c)  Training and Capacity Building (US$ 1.7 million, or 3.5% of the project costs)
for ECDF staff, community leaders, local government officials, NGOs,
contractors, and community facilitators to ensure effective sub-project
implementation, community leadership and responsibility, and the effective
maintenance and sustainability of assets created with ECDF support.
9.    The remaining US$ 4.4 million in project costs (8% of the total) would be for
project administration. The total Project costs are estimated at US $49.68 million. The
Government of Eritrea would provide US $7.5 million, local communities US $4.56
million (including non-monetary contributions), IDA US $17.5 million, and other donors
an estimated US $20.12 million. Schedule A presents the estimated project costs and
financing plan, and Schedule B provides tables on economic and financial analysis, and
key performance indicators. Schedule C presents procurement methods and disbursement.
Schedule D presents a timetable of the project's key processing events and Schedule E
presents the status of Bank Group Operations. The Staff Appraisal Report (No. 14937-
ER) is being distributed separately. The attached map shows the sites of the ECDF
Regional Branches.
10.   Project Implementation. The ECDF would operate as an autonomous structure
within the Ministry of Local Government. It would have a Management Office (MO)
which would be responsible for the overall project implementation, and oversee six
Branches, one in each region of the country, responsible for community outreach, and for
receiving, screening, appraising, and recommending community proposals for ECDF
support.
11.   A detailed Operational Manual has been developed, which will regulate all ECDF
activities. Necessary modifications to the Operational Manual can be made only with the
agreement of IDA. The Operational Manual contains the policy framework; aims and
objectives of the Fund; its organization and functions; the roles, responsibilities and
authority of ECDF staff and other participating parties; the criteria and procedures for



-5-
identification, appraisal, implementation, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of sub-
projects; the implementation, procurement, and disbursement arrangements; and the
monitoring, reporting, accounting, and auditing requirements. Annexes to the Manual
provide sample contracting documents and standard forms for use in processing sub-
projects, such as job-descriptions and professional profiles for all professionals to be hired
by ECDF in the Management Office and Regional Branches.
12.   During the sub-project appraisal, special attention would be given to the broader
impact of the sub-project on the community and special groups within the community
(especially poor women); the likely benefits of investments; factors determining both
effective utilization and sustainability; the extent to which the project satisfies technical
standards for the sector and is sensitive to environmental goals; the realism of project
costings; the arrangements for implementation and supervision; and the commitment of
beneficiaries to maintenance. The Project Officer would also coordinate with the relevant
sector ministry to assess that the sub-project is: (i) in line with the technical standards
approved by the ministry; (ii) consistent with the sector development strategy; and (iii)
covered in terms of its recurrent costs by an allocation in the approved regional
government budget, or by a cost-sharing arrangement with the interested community.
Implementation arrangements would be kept flexible to reflect different conditions in
different areas of the country in terms of availability of contractors, services, and
materials. However the general principles guiding the implementation would be to: (i)
maximize community involvement and responsibility; (ii) ensure adequate quality; and
(iii) ensure the most cost-effective methods through a competitive bidding process.
13.   In order to keep the momentum of project implementation started under the pilot
ESRF, retroactive financing will be made available for expenditures incurred after
December 1, 1995, up to US $ 1.75 million (10 percent of the IDA credit) for social and
economic infrastructure and services sub-projects, and capacity building and training
activities.
14.   Lessons Learned form Previous Bank/IDA Involvement.. The pilot ECRF
(para 6) has completed 75 sub-projects and other 80 are being implemented (and will be
completed in early 1996). They included elementary schools (34), health station and
centers (26), water supply facilities, small-scale irrigation schemes, feeder roads
rehabilitation, etc. The projects have been implemented mainly in rural areas (90%), and
have benefited about 600,000 people. Community contribution has always been above the
mandatory 10%, on average about 16%, with a peak of more than 80% in the small-scale
irrigation sub-projects. The average cost of construction has generally been lower than
those of the same facilities built by line ministries. A mid-term evaluation in September
1994 carried out by a team of independent consultants identified the ECRF's greatest asset
as its dedicated staff, and their problem-solving capacity and determination to succeed
against substantial obstacles. It judged the most important achievements of the ECRF to
be its outreach capacity to communities, especially in remote areas; and the quality and
cost-effectiveness of the sub-projects implemented. The evaluation and mid-term review
demonstrated that the pilot ECRF accomplished its objectives, and the Government



-6-
concluded that its satisfactory performance justifies the expansion of the Fund's activities
in terms of both volume of project investments and sectors covered.
15.   Like the pilot ECRF, other social funds supported by the Bank worldwide, have
shown that community-initiated infrastructure projects can be implemented at a lower cost
than equivalent publicly managed projects. The social fund mechanism can be an
effective way of attracting community investments for development, which reduces the
costs to public funds and establishes a basis of ownership around which maintenance
arrangements can be built. Successful social funds have made a valuable contribution to
community development, by building managerial competencies, encouraging community
decision-making on shared assets, and developing a sense of achievement and self-reliance
16.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Government's overall development
strategy is accelerated and sustainable broad-based economic growth, human resources
development, and well targeted social programs, all aimed at improving the living
standards and reducing poverty. In line with this policy, the Bank's program of assistance
as stated in the Eritrea Country Assistance Strategy being distributed separately, will focus
on supporting the country's efforts towards rehabilitation and recovery, investment in
infrastructure and priority productive sectors, and the development of human resources, all
with the over-riding goal of reducing poverty. Since a large proportion of Eritrea's
population continues to suffer from lack of basic social services and doesn't have the
educational skills and access to capital that will enable it to fully participate in and benefit
from the recovery and growth process, the Bank's strategy aims to enhance the access to
and quality of basic social services for the poor and to support well targeted community-
based programs that will address the needs of the most vulnerable people in the society.
17.   The Bank has several advantages in terms of supporting ECDF. Firstly, ECDF
would be an important part of the Bank's contribution to poverty reduction in Eritrea
because of its focus on vulnerable groups, and remote and particularly depressed areas.
Secondly, the Bank team has gained valuable insight into the operation of a social fund
mechanism in Eritrea through the participation in the ECRF pilot, and through studying
the experience of the many other social funds IDA has supported. Finally, the Bank is in
an advantageous position to help attract support for ECDF from other donor agencies.
18.   Agreed Actions. Before Credit Effectiveness, the Government will have: (a)
established a Local Account in the name of ECDF and deposited counterpart funds
equivalent to the Government's share for the first three months of project costs; (b) made
operational a Project Accounting and Management Information System acceptable to IDA
and reached agreement with IDA on sample standardized MIS outputs
(monthly/quarterly/annual reporting formats); (c) adopted the consolidated and regional
budgets and work program for the first year of ECDF operations acceptable to IDA; and
(d) established a unit data base of costs for commonly procured items.
19.   Key agreements reached with the Government include that: (a) the project would
be implemented in accordance with the Operational Manual and that any proposed change
to the Operational Manual would be subject to agreement by IDA; (b) twelve months after
effectiveness, the GOE will require an independent entity to conduct a procurement



-7-
assessment, to evaluate the economy and efficiency of procurement, and identify the need
for any modification to procurement arrangements; (c) the GOE and IDA will conduct a
mid-term review of project implementation and impact; (d) ECDF, both at the central and
regional level, will maintain a unit costs data base to monitor costs of goods, works and
services under the project; (e) the General Manager, the Deputy General Manager and the
Regional Managers of ECDF will at all times have qualifications commensurate to their
duties; (f) the GOE will make quarterly deposits of amounts representing its share of
project costs into the account established for that purpose; (g) the GOE and IDA will
review annually the interest rate applied from ECDF to Village Administrations of other
financial intermediaries for the Pilot Savings and Credit Program; and (h) ECDF will
annually submit to IDA for review an assessment of the progress made in the work
program and planned for the following year, including the activities for the Pilot Savings
and Credit component..
20.   Poverty Category. The Project would be mainly targeted at rural communities,
particularly those living in the poorest, most neglected, and war-affected areas of the
country. The Project would contribute to poverty reduction by providing poor
communities with basic infrastructure and services to improve productive outputs and
incomes, and improving the quality of basic health care, education, nutrition, and access to
water. While the infrastructure and services provided by ECDF would benefit the
community as a whole, special attention would be given to maximize the benefits for
particularly vulnerable groups, such as returning refugees, demobilized soldiers, and poor
women. Finally, the micro-credit component, while not restricted to any specific target
group, would provide special benefits to disadvantaged groups, particularly women.
21.   Environmental Aspects. The Government accords a high priority to the
preservation of the environment, as long-term growth depends on the sustainable use of
the country's natural resources and assets, as stated in the national Environmental
Management Plan for Eritrea (NEMP-E), officially adopted in the first half of 1995. All
the principles and strategies guiding the NEMP-E have been taken into account in the
design of the ECDF Project. The Project would ensure that no sub-project has a negative
impact on the environment. The appraisal process for each sub-project is designed to
ensure that any potential negative environmental impact would be identified at an early
stage and discussed with the community to reach an agreement on appropriate mitigating
actions. Where no solutions can be found, the sub-project would not be further processed.
22.   The Environmental Analysis anticipated that most ECDF sub-projects would be
unlikely to have any adverse impact on the environment. As the roads component of the
project would consist almost exclusively of the rehabilitation or upgrading of existing
feeder roads or footpaths, no major environmental issues are envisaged for this
component. However, attention would need to be paid to prevent potential erosion of
slopes bordering rural roads financed under the project. As most of the potential
environmental problems that are likely to occur can be dealt with through special features
of project design, close monitoring and technical support to communities, the project has a
limited potential for environmental harm. Thus the project has been rated category B.



-8-
23.   Program Objective Categories. ECDF is a targeted poverty intervention that will
benefit the poorest segments of the population, and the most disadvantaged groups such as
women, and returning refugees.
24.   Participatory Approach. The project has been designed on the basis of close
consultations with local communities carried out by ECRF staff during the pilot phase.
These consultations were carried out initially as a part of the promotion activities, and at a
later stage as needs assessments to better define the scope, areas of activity, and
implementing capacity in each region of the country. In particular, to prepare the pilot
Savings and Credit program the ECRF staff carried out qualitative surveys across all
regions, to identify the potential demand, and gather infonnation about similar income-
generating schemes being implemented at the community level.
25.   A key feature of the Project would lie in its use of community participation in the
planning, design and implementation of sub-projects. Communities would form sub-
project committees which would design and manage sub-project implementation, as well
as assist in maintenance and operation of facilities. Communities would provide a
minimum of 10 percent contribution to sub-project capital costs, either in cash, kind, or
labor, and would be responsible for supervising sub-project implementation. In line with
the Government policy, the Project would also try to maximize communities' involvement
in sharing the operational costs of the facilities built, with a consequent relief on the
Government's budget, and thus enhancing sustainability.
26.   Project Benefits. The ECDF will contribute to the much needed rebuilding of
social and physical infrastructure in Eritrea. Since it is a demand-based project and will
finance sub-projects that are requested by the communities, it is not possible to predict in
advance the composition of the project. However, based on data gathered from the pilot
phase, the following results are expected. It is expected that 22 primary and junior
secondary schools will be built per year, increasing their total number from 575 now to
687 by the end of the decade. Based on the current norm of about 500 students per school,
the new schools would provide enrollment opportunities for about 55,000 additional
students, or an increase of over 20%. These schools would be built in villages and
communities which do not have any facility at all, and it is expected that they would be
fully utilized since communities will have asked for them. There is not enough data yet in
Eritrea to calculate the rate of return to this investment, but estimates for other countries
show an average private rate of return of 41% to basic education in sub-Saharan Africa
(higher than in any other part of the world) and a social rate of return of 24%.
Additionally, there are other social benefits through the impact of education on health and
fertility. It is also expected that about 20 health stations/centers will be built per year,
increasing by two/thirds the number currently existing (160). Data on outpatient visits
nationwide show that about 15,000 visits occur per year per health facility, translating to
an average of less than one visit per person. This is exceptionally low; in other Sub-
Saharan countries the number of visits is 1.5-2, and in more affluent countries it is 7-8. It
is reasonably expected that with the project the utilization rate will increase closer to the
regional average, with current improvement in health status. The ECDF would provide
drinking water facilities to 230 communities covering 5% of the rural population. While

there is no complete data on the availability of safe water in rural areas, it is known that
most Eritreans have access only to unprotected wells and rivers. A study of 244 villages
estimated that per capita consumption of clean water was only 2.5 liters per capita per day.
For this meager amount women and children may travel up to 2 hours each way,
contributing substantially to a long working day lasting 14-16 hours. School-age children,
particularly girls, may be held back from school (a study of distance to water facilities and
school attendance in Nigeria has shown a strong correlation). The health consequences of
polluted water are well-known; for example the percentage of deaths of children under
five in Eritrea due to diarrhea is as high as 13% (double the rate in Uganda and Tanzania).
27.   The project is also expected to rehabilitate and improve about 1,200 km of rural
roads (about 50% of the feeder/local/minor roads network). In a country where nearly
100% of these roads are classified to be in poor or very poor condition, this component
can be expected to provide a major impetus to increased economic activity, as well as
better access to the social infrastructure being built. The micro-credit component will be
tested on a pilot basis. Preliminary analysis of data on poverty collected in a Rapid
Appraisal Survey (1993-94) shows that self-employment and trade are critical for growing
out of poverty. The share of income from these activities, generally in the informal sector,
is 21% for the non-poor, compared to about 10.5 for the poor. Experience elsewhere
suggests that the provision of small amounts of capital can make a substantial difference
to escape from poverty. Experience with the pilot project demonstrates and enhances the
cost-effectiveness and feasibility of realizing these benefits.
28.   Project Sustainability. Sustainability of sub-projects financed with ECRF
support has been dealt with very carefully in its two main implications - operation and
maintenance upon completion; and financial. The Capacity Building Support Program has
been designed with the aim of building within local communities the capacity necessary to
adequately build and maintain the assets and services created with ECDF support. The
steps to support the sustainability of ECDF-financed sub-projects would include: (i) an
assessment of community commitment and capacity during the sub-project appraisal,
which will ensure local ownership and motivation to maintain assets created with ECDF
support; (ii) capacity building and participative processes to strengthen the involvement of
local communities in all phases of project implementation, with special attention to
maintenance arrangements; (iii) community investments in sub-project costs, and
contracts on their maintenance responsibility; (iv) prior to sub-project financing decisions,
clear commitment from sector agencies to budget recurrent costs for utilization and
maintenance of ECDF-financed infrastructure; (v) selection of technologies that lend
themselves to community-based maintenance; and (vi) training of sector experts and
community specialists in technical aspects related to maintenance.
29.   The annual budgetary impact of recurrent expenditures due to health, education,
and feeder roads sub-projects (the recurrent costs of rural water supply sub-projects will
be fully covered by beneficiary communities, and the pilot savings and credit component
is not supposed to have any recurrent cost implication on the Government budget)
compared to the FY94 budget (Birr 1,867 million) would be insignificant. Even if the
budget remains constant at the FY94 level, the highest budgetary impact of the project in



-10-
year 5 and beyond would still amount to only 1.2% of recurrent expenditure. In reality,
the budgetary impact is likely to be lower than estimated here because communities are
expected to make contributions to the maintenance and recurrent costs of projects. In
primary education, although no tuition fees are charged, parents bear the costs of
maintenance of schools; in future they may be expected to finance a larger share of
recurrent costs, for example by paying a charge for textbooks. In the health sector there is
presently a symbolic fee charged for services delivered at the health stations and centers,
but there is an active dialogue in the Government about a significant increase in the user
fee charge structure.
30.   Risks. The main risk to the success of the Project concerns the weakness of local
implementation capacity in some of the poorest and most isolated regions of the country
most in need of ECDF support. Therefore the identification of capacity building and
training needs for all actors involved in sub-project implementation - ECDF staff, regional
branches staff, communities, sectoral ministries staff, facilitators - as well as the design of
the relevant capacity building and training activities, has been given particular attention
during project preparation. A second risk relates to the quality of some types of
infrastructure to be developed with ECDF support. To respond to this risk, the ECDF has
established a collaborative program with the relevant sector agencies, which will help to
build capacity, produce rigorous standards, and improve the design and monitoring of
construction. Another risk relates to the sustainability and effective utilization of the
assets created with ECDF support. High priority would be given to measures that enhance
sustainability, including careful planning of maintenance programs, training of
communities in maintenance routines, and assurances that resources to cover recurrent
costs would be allocated to support both utilization and maintenance. A plan to cover
recurrent costs related to the infrastructure built with ECDF support, and to be covered by
local communities contribution, or Government budget allocation, has been prepared, and
agreed with the Government.
31.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

Main Assumptions
Discount Rate                12%
Real Exchange Rate           Constant 1995 prices
Time Horizon                 health, education, rural water supply, rural feeder roads (25 years)
Project Composition            Based on experience with the pilot, it is expected that the
composition of this demand-driven project will be as follows:
Health, Education, Rural Water, Feeder Roads, Natural Resources
Management and Pilot Savings and Credit
Nature of Benefits
Health Component             Reduction in (a) incidence of illness due to preventive care -
Expanded Program for Immunization, Maternal and Child Health,
Family Planning and (b) duration of illness due to curative care.
Benefits calculated from Health Survey 1994. Productivity gains
from fewer sick days valued at opportunity cost-shadow wage
Education Component          Incremental lifetime earnings net of opportunity cost of children's
time
Rural Water Supply Component  Reduction in water-borne infectious diseases. Benefits: (a) lower
medical care cost; (b) productivity gains from fewer sick days; (c)
productivity gains from release of women's time valued at
opportunity cost.
Rural Feeder Roads           Reduction in transportation costs
Risk                           The project is not without some risk (mainly for institutional
reasons) but the potential benefits are so very high that the risks are
well worth taking. Also, with such high net benefits, the project
could perform significantly worse than expected and still be
economically justified
Main Beneficiaries
Health Component             800,000 people served by 100 primary health facilities
Education Component          55,000 children every year - more girls than boys
Rural Water Supply Component  11,250 people served by 236 water supply facilities, women
preferentially benefited.
Rural Feeder Roads           500,000 Farmers approximately
