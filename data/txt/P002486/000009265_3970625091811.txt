MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE SOMALI DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to the
Souali Democratic Republic for SDR 10.1 million (US$12.7 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms and help finance the Second Agricultural Extension
Project, including research components. The project would be cofinanced by
ADF for SDR 8.3 million (US$10.4 million equivalent).
2.        Background.  Somalia is among the poorest countries, having a per
capita income estimated at US$270 in 1985. Large and sparsely populated,
its 5.8 million inhabitants are unevenly distributed over nearly 638,000
square kilometers of semi-desert. About 50% of the population are nomads
and semi-nomads who depend on livestock for their livelihood. About 13% of
the land is suitable for cultivation, but only about 8.5Z of this land is
cultivated, with water the main constraint. Crop production is centered
mainly upon bananas for export, and sugar, sorghum and maize for the
domestic market. About 39% of GDP, and 80% of export earnings, stem from
livestock production-, while crops generate about 12% of GDP. Although
overall agricultural performance during tha fifteen-year period 1970-84 was
poor, crop production during the first half of the 1980's increased by an
Impressive 63Z, from 634,200 metric tons to 1,034,400 metric tons. This
was spurred by good weather, combined with a dramatic improvement in
pricing incentives provided by the Government's shift toward a more
market-oriented policy framework. IDA has supported this policy change
with quick-disbursing Credits for imports of agricultural inputs and fuel
(Agricultural Inputs Program, CR., 1612-SO, 1985 and Agricultural Sector
Adjustment Program, Cr. 1711-SO, 1986).
3.        In addition, IDA has assisted the Government in introducing
extension services based on the training and visit method in eight of 10
arable regions (Cr. 905, 1979). The project has also assisted the Ministry
of Agriculture (MOA), responsible for extension services and agricultural
research, to improve its capacity to manage extension activities.  The
Agricultural Farm Management Extension and Training Unit (AFMET),
established in MOA, has gained the confidence of farmers in the project
area.  By following simple, improved farming practices, contact farmers in
irrigated areas have had substantial yield increases in their main food
crops and more modest, but still significant gains have been recorded in
rainfed and drought-prone areas. The next phase of this effort calls for
expanding training and visit coverage to include all 158,000 farm families
in the regions concerned, strengthening the delivery of extension messages
based upon the experience gained, and improving the quality and quantity of
the messages. The last-mentioned entails linking extension to agricultural
research activities, to identify plant varieties and cultivation techniques
suited to local conditions and available technology. To do this, the



- 2 -
Government will need to manage better its research program by setting
priorities and coordinating donor participation. The proposed project
focuses upon these key elements of extension and research development.
4.        Project Objectives.  The project supports (i) the expansion and
improvement of the extension service established under Credit 905-SO; (ii)
improved research planning, coordination between research agencies and the
strengthening of research-extension linkages; (iii) strengthening  the
capacity of the Somali research system to identify farmers' production
constraints and to find solutions through relevant adaptive research.
5.        Project Description.  The project comprises: (i) Extension
Services: improving field services in eight regions of southern Somalia by
providing technical assistance, vehicles, staff housing, operating costs
and improvements to headquarters facilities; (ii) Training: local and
overseas training of extension and research staff, constructing and
improving training centers, providing adequate equipment and staffing; and
(iii) Research: establishing a research directorate, financing to operate
the dryland research station at Bonka, and a fund for additional adaptive
research. The project would be implemented over eight years. A Project
Preparation Facility of US$1.2 million provides bridge finance until the
effectiveness of the proposed project and funds to accelerate the start of
improved training programs. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$26.7 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$19.7
million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement, and disbursements and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the Status of Bank Group Operations in the Somali
Democratic Republic are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
(No. IBRD 20121) and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 6615-SO, dated March
10, 1987, are also attached.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Bank's strategy in Somalia is
to identify areas of greatest growth potential and assist in their
development. Agriculture has been identified as the major source of
medium-term growth, specifically crop production, livestock and fisheries.
The Bank's involvement in Somalia's agriculture focuses both on policy
adjustments, to remove constraints affecting the sector, and on development
of basic services and infrastructure, to provide the needed
technical/physical complement to the new policies. The Association plays
an important part in donor coordination for agricultural extension and
under the proposed project, would expand its role into agricultural                       e
research.
7.        Actiors.  During negotiations, agreement was reached that the
Government will: (i) by December 31, 1987 establish a Technical
Coordination committee for extension and research activities and appoint a
Research Advisor acceptable to IDA; (ii) appoint a Director of Training
in AFMET, acceptable to IDA by June 30, 1988; (iii) formulate and implement
a national research program and review it annually with IDA; (iv) implement
specified procedures for research/extension linkages and for donor
coordination for research; (v) make provisions annually in its budget to
increase gradually its contribution to the recurrent costs of the project,



so that by completion, the Government would cover annually 100% of such
recurrent costs; (vi) follow agreed criteria governing the use of the
research support fund; (vii) prepare annual work programs and budgets and
submit them to IDA for prior review each February. As agreed, the
Government has established a Research Directorate and, prior to
effectiveness, will appoint a Director General to head it.
8.        Justification.  Benefits under the proposed project are expected
from improving extension and research capacities and their impact on
agricultural productivity and farmers' incomes. About 158,000 farm
families are expected to be covered by the improved extension service,
including 35,000 families not covered under previous project. Assuming
that the entire farming population served by the project would achieve
yield increases equivalent to those obtained by contact farmers under the
first project, annual maize and sorghum production would increase by about
135,000 tons and those of sesame and pulse by about 80,000 tons. The
additional maize and sorghum production alone would represent an increase
of about 20 percent over current production levels.
9.        Risks.  The success of the project will depend on capable staff
and adequate supplies of production inputs. Staff salary incentives,
improved housing and transport, provided under the project would sustain
the present high staff morale. The Government supports adequate incentives
for farmers and free trade between the public and private sector which
ensures adequate input supplies. These measures would minimize the risks
to a low and acceptable level. With effective staff and a proven
management team already in place, the risks for the project are within
acceptable limits.
10.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed credit.
