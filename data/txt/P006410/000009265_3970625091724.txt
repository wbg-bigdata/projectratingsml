MDIORANDtH AND fIC(IuENDATION OP THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INT8RN&UIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPKENT
TO THE EXECUTrVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE STATE OF SAO PAULO OF BRAZIL
FOR A STATE HIGHWAYS IANAGEHENT PROJECT
IN THE STATE OF SAO PAMLO
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the State of Sao Paulo
of Brazil for US$174 million is submitted for approval.  It would help to
finance a State Highways Management Project in the State of Sao Paulo. The
proposed loan would be repayable over 15 years, including three years of
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and charges. Tbe
Federal Gov-ernment would be the Guarantor for the loan.
2.        Background.  The State of Sao Paulo plays a preeminent role in the
national economy, accounting for about 40% of Brazil's GDP and approximately
the same share of the country's total export revenues. The transport sector
plays a critical role in supporting this level of economic activitv. Inland
freight transport is dominated by roads (73%), and road transport also
accounts for some 96% of the total passenger movements. The shortage of
funding in the early 1980s, combined with the relatively low priority
accorded to maintenance, resulted in an accelerated deterioration of the road
network. In 1984, the State Road Department's (DER-SP's) budget for road
rehabilitation and periodic maintenance was more than 50% below that for
1980, while routine maintenance expenditures were some 40% below those in
1980, both in real terms. A road condition survey conducted in early 1986
indicated that about 3,300 km of the 18,000-km paved road network are in poor
condition and require urgent rehabilitation or pavement strengthening, while
the remaining length of the network requires an accelerated program of
periodic maintenance to arrest a further deterioration. In recognition of
the importance of restoring the condition of the road infrastructure, the
State Government decided to increase substantially its programed level of
investment for road rehabilitation and periodic and routine maintenance, and
also to introduce institutional reforms to achieve more effective management
of the State transport system.
3.        Project 0ective.  The proposed project would support the State of
A    Sao Paulo's efforts to improve the condition of its road network over a
four-year period and would further develop the transport administration to
assure, in particular, that the State's dominant road transport mode would
function with increased efficiency. The proposed project would achieve this
objective by supporting: (a) the road rehabilitation and periodic
maintenance component of DER-SP's 1987-1990 expenditure program; and
(b) policies and measures to increase the capabilities of the State
Secretariat of Transport (ST) and DER-SP to plan, evaluate and implement the
transport program of the State more effectively.
4.        Project Description.  The proposed project comprises:  (a) civil
works for the rehabilitation and periodic maintenance of about 5,100 km of
State roads, and associated consultant services for engineering design and
construction supervision; (b) equipment rehabilitation; (c) a training



-2-
program; and (d) technlcal assistance for studies related to State transport
sector policy, planning and operations, and highway management and research.
5.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$405.65 million
with a foreign exchange component of US$174.40 million (43Z). Costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursement, as well as a disbursement schedule, are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map showing the first two groups of rehabilitation
subprojects (1,609 km) to be financed under the project is also attached.
Staff Appraisal Report No. 6440-BR is being distributed separately.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involveuent.   The Bank lending strategy for
Brazil is based upon an intensive policy dialogue through which the
conclusions of the Bank's economic and sector work are being taken into
account by the Brazilian authorities. Most of the loans to Brazil aim at
supporting one or more of the three key Government objectives:
(a) structural reforms in agriculture and the management of the public
sector; (b) rehabilitation and development of essential infrastructure; and
(c) an increase in productivity, and the improvement of living conditions, of
the rural and urban poor. The proposed project is in line with these
objectives by providing continued assistance to the rehabilitation and
maintenance of important links of the country's road network, simultaneously
with the systematic strengthening of the highway agency of the State of Sao
Paulo. Although earlier Bank loans have assisted several states to
strengthen road maintenance management,this would be the first time that the
Bank would directly support institutional strengthening of a state highway
agency.  Improved highway management practices thus developed would be-
extended to other state and municipal road authorities. Such transfer of
experience is in line with the Bank-supported fiscal and administrative
decentralization efforts initiated by the new Federal Administration. It
also coincides with the overall highway subsector study to be implemented
under the technical assistance component of the proposed project, targeted at
coordinating the efforts of the Federal; State and Municipal agencies in the
management of the road infrastructure under their respective jurisdictions.
7.        Agreed Actions.  The Borrower agreed to the following:  (a) the
Borrower would make available to DER-SP, in the Project Revolving Account, an
amount equivalent to US$8.0 million as a condition of loan effectiveness;
(b) DER-SP would periodically review its highway expenditure and funding
program to ensure that it conforms to policies and economic criteria
satisfactory to the Bank, present it to the Bank not later than August 15 of
each year, and regularly provide funding for the program, including adequate
counterpart funding for the Bank-financed project components, through the
rolling three-year State budget programing process; (c) DER-SP would follow
procedures acceptable to the Bank for subproject selection and evaluation
using criteria consistent with its maintenance and rehabilitation strategy,
and in no case would a road section with an estimated ERR below 12% be
included in the highway rehabilitation component of the project; (d) DER-SP
would consult with the Bank regarding organizational changes and the proposed
actions resulting from the recommendations of Phase I of a management study;
(e) DER-SP would assess the impact of the measures which have recently been
taken to improve routine maintenance operations, such as the application of a



- 3 -
comprehensive routine maintenance management system and the undertaking of a
portion of routine maintenance by contracts, and submit n report to the Bank
on its findings, by December 31, 1988, with an outline of DER-SP's intended
future policies on routine maintenance, for comments; (f) DER-SP would
evaluate the impact of the measures being introduced for controlling
axle-loading and vehitle weights and consult with the Bank, by December 31,
1988, regarding further actions planned for the program's development;
(g) the Borrower would ensure the availability of sufficient funds in the
Project Revolving Account for project costs during the forthcoming months,
according to work and procurement schedules; and (h) 'ER-SP accounts,
including project accounts, financial statements, Special Accounts and
Statements of Expenditutres would be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank, and audit reports, for each financial year, would be
furnished to the Bank within four months of the ct..sing date of the audited
period.
8.        Justification.  The highway rehabilitation component, which
represents 96% of the total base cost of the project, yields an estimated
economic rate of return of about 45%. In addition, intensified staff
training and other institutional measures supported by the technical
assistance are expected to improve the overall efficiency of the management
and operations of the State transport sector and, in particular, the highway
subsector.
9.        Risks.  There are no special risks.  Little difficulty is
anticipated in the provision of counterpart funding since the loan is the
only direct source of foreign financing in DER-SP's funding program and the
counterpart requirements represent only about 11.5% of DER-SP's 1987-1990
expenditure program.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
