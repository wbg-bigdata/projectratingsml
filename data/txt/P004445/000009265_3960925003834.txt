SECOND URm      DV OpHT PROJECT
(LOAN 1647-PB)
PREIACE
This   Project   Performanc    Audit   Report (PPAR) represents    a
performance audit of two Philippie projectst the Manll Urban Development
Project and the Second Urban Developmnt Project. For the, first project,
loans 1282-PH and 1272-PH for $32.0 million equivalent were approved on May
27, 1976, including a $10.0 million Third Window Intermediate Term Loan (No.
1272-0-PH). A supplementary loan (1282-1-PH) for $10.5 million equivalent was
approved in February 1984 under the Bank's Program of Special Assistance to
Member Countries 1983-84.   Bank Group  financing for   the second project was
provided through Loan 1647-PH for $26.7 million equivalent, approved on
December 21, 1978. The final loan disbursement on the first project was made
in July 1986 and the undisbursed balance of $3.2 million equivalent was
cancelled. For the second project, the final disbursement was made July 24,
1985 and the undisbursed balance of $1.4 million equivalent was cancelled.
The PPAR consists of the following: (a) a Project Completion Report
(PCR) on the first project, dated April 1986, prepared by the East Asia and
Pacific Regional Office; (b) a PCR on the second project, dated December 1986,
prepared by the Borrower and supplemented by the East Asia and Pacific Region
memorandum of December 31, 1986; and (c) a Project Performance Audit
Memorandum (PPAM) prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The PPAM is based on the PCRs, Appraisal and President's Reports,
discussions with Bank staff directly involvod with the projects, a review of
the projects' files and records, and the transcripts of the Executive
Directors' meetings which considered the project.
The Audit finds that, in most respects, the PCRs accurately describe
the projects' background and experience and provide adequate factual support
for the   conclusions  reached.    The PPAM supplements the discussion of that
experience with a review of the economic and sector contexts as they affect
project outcomes.   Otherwise, the PPM  largely sumnarizes and attempts not to
repeat the details provided in the PCRs.
Copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the Borrower for their com-
ments.   These comments have been   reproduced as Attachments A    and B to the
report.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE AUDIT REPORT
PHILIPPINES
MANILA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOANS 1282-PHI 1272-PH)
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1647-PH)
EVALUATION SMMIARY
Introduction
The first and second urban development projects financed by the Bank
in the Philippines followed each other in rapid succession. Loans 1282-PH and
1272-PH, approved in May 1976 for the first project, also financed the prepar-
ation of the second. Before the first project was 25 percent complete, in
December 1978 Loan 1647-PH for the second project was approved. This circum-
stance made lt dlfflcult for the Borrower and the Bank to use the lessons
learned from the first project in the design of the second, and consequently,
both projects share many of the am* implementation dLfficultLes.    This is in
part the reason why the two projects are being audited togethor.
Objectives
Both projects aimed at establishing cost-effective models for the
provision of housing services to lower-income urban families through in situ
upgrading of slum areas and the development of new serviced sltes for housing
construction. The first project focused exclusively on Manila, while the
second combined the investments in the capital with the expansion of the
shelter program to three regional cities (Cacayan do Oro, Cebu and Davao).
Through technical assistance the projects were expected to strengthen the
recently created National Housing Authority (NH) -- an autonomous public
corporstion dedicated to the production of housing and the principal implemen-
tation agency for both projects. In the execution of the projects, NRA was
expected to coordinate the activities of several other particLpE Ing agencies,
including the Metropolltan Waterworks and Sewerage System (kwiS) and the
Manila Electrical Authority (HERALCO) for water supply and power in Manila,
and the Ministry of Public Works, Transport, and Communications (MPWTC) for
toads, drainage, and community facilities both in Manila and in regional
cities.  In addition, under the second project,   NUA was to    function  as a
mnuiLipal lending bank to local governments, financng project Implementation
in regional cities. Shelter objectLves were combined with employment promo-
tion through the development of commercial and industrial lots at the housing
sites and a line of credit to assist  small businesses.   This  line of credit
was to be administered by the Philipplne National Bank (PNB) with assistance
from other Government-owned banks and agencies under NHA's general coordina-
tion. Other main project objectives comprised supporting the MPWTC program of



I
traffic improvement and urban transport infrastructur expansion in Manila,
under the first project, and its flood control program, also in Manila, under
th, second project (PPAM, par&s. 18, 32 and 33).
Imolem_ntation Experience
Both projects were largo in terms of the scope of the physical works
involved, complex in their institutional arrangements, and novel in so far as
sites and services and upgrading components were being Introduced for the
first tim   In the Philippines under the auspices of a new agency.  The combi-
nation of these design features did not facilitate implementation nor did the
process of project preparation. Project preparation was deficient in the case
of the first project due to the inexperience of NHA and the Bank In the kinds
of work  proposed.  It wa  also deficient in the second project, as design wa
completed before clear lessons could be drawn from the first project. Both
projeets took significantly more time to complete then expected at appraisal.
The completion of the first project wa delayed by approxinately six years and
that of the second by two years. Delays were caused by slow start-up mainly
due to 'land acquisition problems, recurrent technical and administrative
difficulties, and increasing financial problems associated with the downturn
of the Philippine economy as of the oarly 1980. (PPAM, paras. 44-53).
The first project was significantly modified during implementation,
partly  to  overcome  design  shortcomings,  but also in response to political
pressures of various sorts (PPAM, paras. 54-58). A more than double increase
in the scope of work of the major roads components made necessary the approval
of a supplemental Bank loan in February 1984, for the equivalent of $10.5
million, to permit completion of that component. Cost overruns for the proj-
ect as a whole ascended to approximately forty percent.   Modification made tn
the second project during implementation consisted In reductions in the scope
of certain components in order to offset   cost overruns   In  others.   These
adjustments, together with the rapid devaluation of the Philippine peso, kept
project costs within the original budget, without unduly distorting its basic
design (PPAM, paras. 59-64).
Remedial action afforded by the Bank's 1983-84 Special Assistance
Program (SAP) has proven essential for the completion of the projects (PPAM,
para. 53). Bank loan disbursements on both projects accelerated after FY83
due to the positive Impact of the SAP but, in general, lagged considerably
behind the over ambitious appraisal estimates (PPAM, par"s. 65-67).
Results
The Audit would have profited from a field inspection of the proj-
ects and the lack thereof has caused certain uncertainties as to the project
results to remain unclarified.
In general, the physical results of both projects were satisfactory.
In shelter, the first project succeeded in upgrading the Tondo Foreshore Area
comprising  approximately  15,000 housing   structures,  and  in developing an
additional 2,000 serviced lots in adjacent Dagat-Dagatan to relocate families
dislodged as the Tondo underwent rehabilitation. The second project extended



xi
the program to three regional cities, where so"e 7,500 housing structure were
upgraded and approximately 2,700 serviced sites were provided, and also
expanded the Dagat-Dagatan development by an additional 8,300 residential
lots. Urban transport investments under the first project increased the road
carrying capacity of Manila by over 20 km and introduced several improvements
in the traffic system.    Modest  but also satisfactory outeomes resulted from
the supply of equipment *nd technical assistance in support of the Manila
Flood Control Program, although the solution for the flooding problems of the
city would require substantial additional investments (PPM, paras. 68-75 and
79-86).
Notwithstanding the satisfactory physical accomplishments of the
projects, the longevity of the infrastructure "ssots built is still dependent
upon maintenance arrangements which have not yet been completed. The turnover
of assets!to the appropriate line agencies responsible for operations and
maintenance has not been clearly defined in the project documents and had
ultimately to be specified by a Cabinet and Presidential directive signed in
December 1986.   Though the matter is In principle resolved, the directive has
yet to be implemented (PPM, para. 103).    Furthermore, the   indirect environ-
mental impact of the second project upon the built-up communities surrounding
the Dagat-Dagatan housing development has been adverse, since site in-filling
contributed to worsen flooding problems in the lower-lying areas (PPAM, para.
83).
The two projects were less successful in several important aspects.
In the area of urban employment, project performance was disappointing because
the expected demand for commercial and industrial lots and for small business
credit did  not materialize.   While  this outcome resulted primarily from the
downturn of the Philippine economy, the Investment risks could have been
minimized if demand studies and marketing plans were completed during project
preparation (PPAM, paras. 76-77 and  87-88).    Secondly, both   projects were
unable to meet financial appraisal objectives on account of: (a) the introduc-
tion of subsidies in the prices of residential lots at higher levels than
deemed appropriate at appraisal; (b) the erosion of the potential profits from
the sale of commercial and Industrial lots by lack of demand, thus invalidat-
ing the cross-subsidy assumption made at appraisall and (c) the general short-
coming in collections of project accounts receivable by NHA and local govern-
ments. The combined impact of these factors resulted in extremely poor cost
recovery performance under both projects. This outcome has unnecessarily
increased the already heavy external debt burden of the Philippine Government
and seriously curtailed NRA's financial sustainability (PPAM, paras. 92-98).
The institutional development achievements of the projects were less
than fully satisfactory because NHA was unable to attain financial stability
and serious problems of  inter-agency  coordination porsist.     Moreover, the
projects assumed a narrow institutional development approach, which appears
unrealistic in retrospect, since it focused primarily on the internal admini-
stration of NRA and failed to take into account the policy environment within
which the Authority operated. This approach isolated the projects from a
major sector reorganization which took place in 1978, when the Ministry of
Human Settlements (MHS) and six other shelter agencies were created, and
clearly reduced the potential for establishing long-term sector programs based



xit
on the alternative housing development *odel- which both projects aimd to
demonstkate (PPAM, paras. 99-102).
Conclusions and Lessons Learned
Project Investments met real needs in the shelter and urban trans-
port sectors in the Philippines, fmiliarixed the Borrower with now techniques
for housing development, and reduced (although not replaced) the Government's
reliance on th. slum demolition and resettlement approach to the problem of
landless squatters by introducing a more humane and efficient alternative.
Although still  facing serious problems at present, NHA    evolved through the
implementation of these two projects into an agency capablo of delivering
significant quantities of shelter to low-income Filipinos (PPAM, pare. 99).
Estimated returns on project investments approached appraisal esti-
mates in urban transport but wero lower than anticipated In shelter and
employment promotion. In the case of shelter, losses ensued from the deferral
of benefits associated with overdrawn project implementation and from large
unexpected increases  in development costs.    Yields on commercial and indus-
trial estato Investments were reduced under the first project by approximately
60 percent compared to appraisal projections, and remain negativo under the
second project. These investments were the most directly affected by the
sharp retraction in business activity which followed tho national financial
and political crises of the early 1980. (PPAN, paras. 72-76 and 86).
Negative financial returns represent a serious constraint to the
replicability of the projects.    The combined impact of minimal returns and
high levels of inflation have decapitalized NHA in real terms to the extent
that it is presently ill-equipped to service its external loans, including
those made under the projects being audited (PPM, paras. 97-98).
On the basis of the implementation experience with these two proj-
ects, the following lessons surface (PPAM, pares. 105-107)5
(i) as a demonstration project, the Tondo upgrading was over ambitious
and overwhelmed the implementation capacity of the Borrower and of
local contractors.     However, an   alternative smaller target area
would probably not have been politically acceptable at the time;
(ii) a two year interval between the Inception of the first and the
second projects proved Insufficient to consolidate the operational
capacity of NHA and, at the same time, expand the program on a
national scale.   The  repetition of certain operations errors might
have been avoided by postponing the second project until substantial
results were achieved under the first; 1/
1/   The East Asia and Pacific region contends that the advantages of "aiting
the results of the first project were outweighed by the need to sustain
institutional developments and to retain trained staff who would have
been unemployed had the second project been delayed several years.



sili
(i1i)  implemntation proble_     faced by both    projects  could have been
4ninizsed If the acquisition of land had been completed prior to
loan effectiveness  and final engneering deigns for *11 components
had baen produced during the project preparation pbhe.    Sfmilarly,
Insufficient attention appears to havo boen given to non-clivl works
elmenta of the projects during preparation and execution of both
projects;
(iv) loss than successful Institutional arrangements for project lnple-
mntation revealed unrealistic    appraisal expectations    as to the
Inter-agency coordination capacity of NHA and the level of financlal
management and policy coherence required by tho projects at the
national  and  local  levels.    Improv m nts  of both financial and
Institutional arrang_ments ar- presently being explored sectorvide,
but satisfactory solutions have yet to be devised.
At the sector level, the Audit attributes the modest policy gains
achieved by the projects largely to the lack of an effective dialogue between
the Borrower and the Bank on several lmportant sector issues such as bousng
finance and relocation of  squatter settlements.   It  is conceivable  that by
slowaing down the pace of sector lending the Bank might hve better a aisted
the Borrower in Instituting needed sector policy reforms.    Fortunately, how-
ever, both the Region and the Borrower report the lessos learned from the
experience of these first two projects are presently being applied to the
restructuring of on-going operations and aro likely to improve future project
performance (PCR - Urban I, paras. 8.10-8.11 and PCR - Urban II, pars. 5.28-
5.32).

(LOAN 1647-PH)
I. BACKGROUND
Economc Context 1/
1.        The first and s*cond Bank-assisted urban development projects In the
Philippines followed a decade of rapid economic growth in the 1960., when GNP
increasod  in  real torms   at  an  average  rate of 5.5 poreent per annum (or
approximately 2.2 percent per person per year). Unfortunately these economic
gain   had been unevenly    distributed  among regions and income clases, and
considerable poverty persisted at the end of the decade. Low levels of tau-
tion reulted in inadequate public expenditures for necessary Infrastructure
and social services. Rapid population growth (at an average rate of 3 percent
per annum between 1960 and 1970) placed an additional burden upon the avail-
able supplies. In response to these needs, the aim of both projects was to
increase the provision and correct the inequalities in the distribution of
urban services and shelter by supporting public sector investments for the
benefit of the urban poor.
2.        When the  first project was prepared   In the early 1970-, economic
growth In the Philippines accelerated to an average annual rate of 6.2 percent
end the level of public investment increased significantly. Expanded agricul-
tural output  led to  self-sufficiency in  food grains  and yielded exportable
surpluses. The population growth rate slowed to 2.5 percent per year. Higher
prices for agricultural export counodities   (particularly  sugar) temporarily
sheltered the economy from the world recession. In general, economic condi-
tions appeared promising and the time propitious for launching a major effort
to expend public services in urban areas. Tho manner and form in which these
services would be supplied wa expected to have a significant bearing on
employment, income distribution and on reducing urban poverty.
1/   This section  is based on World Bank studies of the Philippines'  economy
covering the 1970/85 period, especially the followings "Philippines,
Priorities and Prospects for Development, Basic Economic Report, "1976
(Report No. 1095a-PH); *The Philippines, Domestic and External Resources

Economic Reports A Framework for Economic Recovery,' 1986 (Report No.
6350-PH).

3.        Notwithstsading this  positive outlook, the Philippine economy still
had s*veral underlying webknessea that were already apparent in the mid-seven-
ties.   Industrialization was  slower than dsaired, exhibited high lncremental
capital-output ratios, and     generated   only   modest   employment growth.
Government policy was inappropriate in many areas (Including trade, financial
and exchange rate policies), lXading to Investments in sectors where the
Philippines  did  not have   a clear comparative    advantage and artificially
inflating the value of the peso.    External borrowing   and  imports expanded
rapidly but export receipts and domestic resource mobilization lagged. 2/
4.        With the  collapse of sugar prices In late 1975 and the second sharp
rise in oil priccs, the country's terms of trade dropped by 23 percent and
growing import requirments were not met with commensurately higher export
receipts. In consequence, the current accounts deteriorated from an average
surplus of 0.7 percent of GNP In tho 1970174 period to a deficit of 4.6 per-
cent of GNP in 1975180.
5.        To sustain a high rate of growth under     these circmstances, the
Government borrowed extensively to finance the deficit and continue to stimu-
late exports. Unfortunately, much of the gains expected from an expansion in
export volume were offset by further deterioration in the terms of trado. As
most of the deficit was  financed with   foreign  loans,  total  external debt
increased from US$4.9 billion at the end of 1975 to US$13.4 billion at the end
of 1979, an average rate of growth of 28.6 percent per year during that
period.
6.        The performance   of the economy deteriorated sharply in the early
1980s under rising interest rates, culminating in an open crisis situation in
1983.   When a political crisis developed following Aquino's assassination in
1983, and the international banks stopped lending to the Philippines, the
country's critical balance of payments position was exposed. The situation
was further exacerbated by a flight of capital out of the country, and a
cessation of short-term lines of credit from the commercial banks.
7.        To overcome the    crisis,  the Philippine Government negotiated, in
1984 and 1985, a new repayment schedule for the country's 'external debt and
introduced stern internal financial stabilization measures, including drastic
cuts in public expendituroe and restrictive monetary policies.   Stabilization
measures succeeded in eliminating the current accounts deficit and in reducing
domestic inflation from a peak of 50 percent in 1984 to 2 percent in the first
quarter of 1986, but at the expense of a sharp drop in economic activity.
During 1984185, GDP growth was negative, unemployment increased, income per
capita declined to 1975 levels, capacity utilization dropped further and real
2/   While a large portion of the public     sector  investment helped reduce
petroleum imports by developing indigenous energy sources, much of the
investment financed during this period was  ill-conceived, overpriced, or
proven unprofitable under a rapidly changing international onvironment.
Similarly, much of the private investment was made with guarantees or
loans from government-owned banks and became a public liability when
proven unprofitable.

interest rates reached unpracedented high levels.  The new administration of
President Coreson Aquino is attempting to increase output, employment and
living standards, but In an environsmnt of constrained domestic and interna-
tional resources, prospects of recovery are not encouraging.
8.        Project Implementation  in all sectors suffered from the downturn of
the Philippine economy and from the counterproductive policies that preceded
the crisis.   The  first and second urban projects were no exceptions.  Direct
sector rejarcussions of macro conditions were apparent in the declining per-
formance of the construction industry under accelerating inflation and tighter
credit; in delayed transfers of funds for project investments; in the
depressed demand for coc- rcial and industrial lots; in greater difficulties
of recovering project costs as urban unemployment and political interference
increased; and  in less efficient project administration.    The attention of
public sector managers became increasingly focused on more pressing political
issues to the detriment of project performance. These circumstances partly
explain why the projects being audited achieved less than fully satisfactory
results.   While both projects focused upon high priority urban development
investments, their chancos of success were reduced due to the prevailing coun-
try conditions.
Urban Trends, Institutions and Policy 31
9.        Although the Philippines was still a predominantly rural economy in
the mid-1970s, the urban population had expanded rapidly during the previous
decade, reaching approximattly 12.3 million (or thirty percent of the total)
in 1975. Urban growth had intensified the dominance of Manila in the coun-
try's urban structure.    With an estimated 5.6 million inhabitants in 1975,
Manila Metropolitan Area (MMA) comprised roughly 13 percent of the national
population and accounted for nearly one-half of the gross domestic product.
10.       Much  of the urban population growth     resulted from economically
motivated internal migration.4/ Avorage incomes in the cities were signifi-
cantly higher than In rural areas and urban employment was expanding at

approximately  th   same  rate  as the   labor  force. .I The growth of urban
employment during the 1965175 period, almost wholly In the formal and informal
service sector (estimted to account for 67 percent of all urban jobs in
1973), prevented open urban unemployment from rising above 12 porcent.1I
Howver, sustained   labor forc expansion and low labor absorption In manufac-
turing led to increasingly higher rates of underemployment, as seasured by the
incidence of part-time and poorly paid workers.
11.       Depite higher average income levels, the distribution of income and
public services in urban areas since World War II was very skewed, making for
wide disparities in standards of living, a high Incidence of poverty and rapid
expansion of slum  and squatter   settlements where   environental conditions
were appalling. Typically, the urban poor lacked regular employment, occupied
crowded and structurally Inadequate housing (mostly  as renters  or squatters)
and had limited or no access to water supply, sanitation, electricity and
transportation. 71 By the mid-1970s, an stimated 40 percont of the urban
population (*ad 80 percent of the slum population of major cities) had insuf-
ficient means to obtain an adequate diet and satisfy other essential needs.
Such were the prevailing conditions of the 180,000 inhabitants of the Tondo
Foreshore slum in banila -- the largest and most visible settlement of its
kind in the country, which became the focus of the first urban project.
12.       Informal sector production    accounted  for the bulk of tho housing
supply in urban areas during the 1960.. Formal sourcos of finance for housing
were limited and accessible only to persons at the highest levels of the urban
5/ It is estimated that total family income in the Philippines grew by about
4.7 percent per annum in real terms during 1961171 and that urban incomes
Increased at about 5.5 percent a year during that period.   The rurallur-
ban income gap persisted throughout the 1970.. By 1982, the median family
Income in Metro Manila was estimated at P 1,750 or more than twice the
national level.   See, BCS, Family   Income and  Expenditures SurvjsL (of
1957, 1961, 1965 and  1971).   See also  Coleman et  al., "Shelter Sector
Assessments An Update on the Phlilppines,' paper prepared for the United
States Agency for International Development, Washington, D.C., June 1984.
6| Between 1965 and 1975 measured unemployment remained at approximately 5
to 7 percent for the Philippines as a whole and declined in the MM from
16 to 11 percent.    Although  systematically  higher than   the national
average, much of the unemployment in the MM and in other urban areas wa
of temporary nature, reflecting the fact that migrants often spent their
initial weeks or months in the cities *earching for jobs. See The World
Bank, 'The Philippines -- Priorities and Prospects for Devolopment, Basic
Economic Report,, (Report No. 1095a/PH), datod May 5, 1976.

income distribution scale. Contrary to what has ben obsorved in several other
developing countries (where iaitially low-standard bouaing units are gradually
upgraded), the quality gap between formally and informally financed housing in
the Philippines has tended to perdsit over time.8i      Thus, although housing
production expanded at an average rate of 4.5 percent por year (or approxi-
mately as  fast as the urban population), most of the new units built were of
low quality. Therefore, the houaing problem of the mid-1970s centered upon
the rapidly deteriorating quality of the housing stock and its lack of ade-
quate infrastructure services.
13.       The size of the housing problem in the 1MA w"s of particular concern
to  the  Government.    A  large  concentration of poorly housed people In the
capital was seen by the Government not only as contrary to the Image It wanted
to project of Manila (as a modern city capable of attracting new businesses
and tourism), but also as a potential political threat to the regime. 9( To
address this problem, the Government financed partial demolitions of squatter
settlements and forced relocation of an estimated 16,000 squatter families
from the MA( to   the periphery of the   city.   The program proved to be ill-
conceived and wasteful.   By 1973 most families   had already  abandoned their
resettlement sites and returned to Manila.
14.       In general,  Government programs had not been concerned specifically
with the spatial distribution of development or with programs to aid the urban
poor.   Confronted with  armed insurrection in the provinces, both the private
sector and the Government concentrated investments in Manila, constraining
economic growth outside Central Luzon.101 In the capital, public investments
during the early 1970. were directed to the expansion of water supply and
electricity systems, but housing, sewerage disposal and transportation ser-
vices were neglected.
15.       It was  only during the 1975180 period that    the Philippine public
housing system began to expand, both institutionally and in terms of actual
investments. In 1975, coinciding with the approval of the first urban proj-
ect, the Government created the National Housing Authority (NHA) and the
Manila Metropolitan Comission (MMC). The NHA had a mandate to provide shel-
ter to the urban poor throughout the country (primarily through slum-upgrading
and development of serviced plots) and was chosen to act as principal agency
for the implementation of the first urban project assisted by the Bank. The

91   In a 1972 study, the Presidential Assistance on Housing and Resettlement
Agency (PAHRA) concluded that about 50 percent of the national housing
shortage was concentrated in the HMA.
10/ Moderate efforts to promote urban decentralization were Initiated by the
Government  in the mid-1970s.      These  consisted of incentives for the
location of small and medium scale industries outside the NMA and of
investments in water supply programs in several regional cities.

MMC wa    expected  to  coordinato  the activities of the 17 local governmants
operating in the Metro Menila and play only an incidental role In project
execution.
16.       On the  occasion of  the approval  of the second urban project other
institutional changes were made. In 1978, the Ministry of Human Settlements
(MHS) was created and shortly thereafter three new agencies were established
to operate a secondary housing mortgage  finance facility.   Under  this newly
organized system, public housing financo was highly subsidized and conceived
as an incentive to the private sector housing industry. In practice it served
primarily the more affluent segments of the urban population. 11/ As a result
of these various initiatives, by 1980 the MHS had consolidated under its
jurisdiction the various functions of public housing production, finane-,
regulation, and policy formulation; program implementation became the respon-
sibility of seven semi-autonomous public corporations, theoretically coordina-
ted by the MHS. 121 Notwithstanding the financial subsidies and the expanded
state presence in the housing sector, both public and private formal housing
finance combined served only an estimated 20 percont of the Market in the
early 19809.
17.       In sum, throughout the 1970s and early 80s, the urban sector in the
Philippines underwent many institutional cnanges, but the prevailing govern-
mental policies and practices showed little support for distribution objec-
tives. The NHA's mandate to serve the urban poor remained isolated and
unstable in this context, sustained primarily by the support received from the
World Bank. Lank sector policy, informed by several urban sector missions
which visited the Philippines during the 19709, focused on the need to reduce
the great disparities in access to basic public infrastructure within urban
areas (particularly in Manila) and on the need to supply regional cities with
improved public services, fostering decentralization. Despite the apparent

12/ In 1980 the public shelter system in the Philippines comprised: (i)
housing finance agencies including the Home Development Mutual Fund
(HDMF), the National Home Mortgage Finance  Corporatwon (NHMFC), and the
Home Financing Corporation (HFC); (ii) housing production agencies,
including the National Housing Authority (NHA) and the Human Settlements
Development Corporation (HSDC) with its subsidiaries BLISS Development
Corporation and National Housing Corporation; and (iiI) a regulatory
agency denominated Human Settlements Regulatory Cosmission (HSRC). For a

lack of Governmental support for these prioritios, they became central objec-
tives of Blnk lending   in the  Phllippine  through the firat and second urban
projects. The joint audit of these projects offers an opportunity to examine
the extent to which discrete projoet objectives are sustainable In an advers,
policy environment.
II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN
Manila Urban Development Proiect 131
18.       This wa  the first shelter project   financed by   the  Bank  in the
Philippines and  also the first attempt to demonstrate a more efficient alter-
native to the Government's large scale slum demolition and rosettlement pro-
gram in Manila. The project would provide improved onvironmental sanitation,
infrastructure and social services for the Tondo Foreshorc, one of Manila's
worst slums, develop a first phase of sites and services program at nearby
Dagat-Dagatan, and build and Improve trunk infrastructure and roads In the
Tondo Foreshore  area.   It would also support traffic Improvements in the MM
and provide technical assistance to key sector institutions.
19.       The project was appraised in August 1975. Total costs were estima-
ted at $65.0 million equivalent (P 487.8 million), 49 percent of which was in
foreign exchange. Bank loans 1272/1282-PH for $32.0 million, approved in May
1976, were to finance the entire foreign exchange component; the Borrower,
which was the Government of the Philippines, would finance the remaining local
project costs.
20.       The new  NHA would be responsible for overall project coordination,
execution of the Tondo upgrading and Dagat-Dagatan sites and services compo-
nents, and the administration of various advisory services.
21.       The other agencies involved in project implementation were: (i) the
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) for tho trunk sewer and
water supply components; (it) the Department of Public Highways (DPH) for
major roads, bridges and traffic components; (Ili) the Developmont Bank of the
Philippines (DBP) for the administration of a line of credit for materials for
home improvement and small businesses development at the housing sitesl (iv)
the Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communications (DPWTC) for
a land use and transportation study, a two-year program of cadstrum surveys,
and for additional studies intended to strengthen the newly created MHC; (v)
technical assistance to small businesses at the housing sites was to be pro-
vided by NRA through the Medium and Small Industries Coordinated Action
Program (MASICAP); and (vi) the Department of Health (DH) and the National

Nutrition Council (NNC), undor the supervision of NIA, would adminlster the
health progrms eomwn to Tondo and Dagat-Dagatan. 141
22.       The effectiveness of the Bank loans was conditional on tho signature
by the Borrower of Subsidiary Loan Agreements with NRA and HWSS. Other spe-
cial conditions  of loan offectiveness    included  employment of engineering
consultants by NHA to assist In project execution and manageoent development,
and thc issuance of a Prosidential Letter of Instruction (LOI) specifying the
responsibilities of each agency involved in the project.
23.       Project components  (described in the PCR, par&. 2.06), with estima-
ted costs with contingencies, comprised:
(i) Tondo Foreshore U,gradint (180 ha), serving approximately 15,000
housing  structures   as well   as  che. development of    1,000 new
residential  lots  and  15 ha of     Industriallcommercial  estate,
established at $27.1 million equivae10r (or 41.7 percent of total
cost);
(ii)  Dazat-Daaatan sites and services  (40 ha),  including development of
some 2,000 residential lots and 3.5 ha of industrial/commercial
estates, estimated at $7.7 million equivalent (or 11.8 percent of
total cost);
(iii) Offeite Sever and Water SuPPlY Trunk Infrastructure serving the
Tondo and Dagat-Dagatan sites, estimated at $1.5 million equivalent
(or 2.3 percent of total cost);
(iv) Major roads (7.5 ktn) and two bridges, estimated at $13.6 million
equivalent (or 20.9 percent of total cost);
(v) Traffic im,rovements, including procurement of traffic signal and
radio equipment and construction of intersection works, road mar-
kings and bus shelters, estimated at $6.9. million equivalent (or
10.7 percent of total cost); and
(vi) Technical Assistance for detailed engineering (NHA, MWSS, DPH), man-
agement support (NHA, DPH), preparation of future projects (NHA),
special studies (MPWTC and HPWTC on behalf of MHA), training and
fellowships, estimated at $8.2 million (or 12.6 percent of total
cost).
24.       The housing  components were  conceived as including a wide rang of
comunity services.    Settlers  at Tondo  and Dagat-Dagatan would be provided
with secure tenure to residential lots served by roads, footpaths, surface
drainage, water supply, sewerage and street lighting, as well an complementary
health, nutrition, primary and secondary education and other social services,
14/ In addition, the NRA had the option of engaging the Philippines Business
for Social Progress Foundation (PBSP) and/or the Philippines Notional
Bank (PNB) to assist DBP in the provision of credit to small busin$esse.

and would have accses to building  matorials lo  s  for hom   Improvements. In
addition, the 3,000 resettlement lots would contain sanitary core units to
facilitate housing consolidation.   Employment creation would be prooted at
the sites through 18.5 ha of serviced Industrial and comercial estates, and a
supervised line  of credit  for small scale businesses.    Land at both sites
would be transferred to settlers through a twenty-five y-ar leso instrument
with option to purchase after five years.
25.       Upgrading works at the Tondo were expected to displace approximately
1,500 families, one-third of which would be relocated to Dagat-Dagstan and the
remainder accomodated at the new lots   developed on  site.   However, because
other public works In the Tondo area would di lodge some eight to nine thou-
sand additional families, relocation needs far exceeded the property's capa-
city to provide new serviced sites.151
26.       Cost recovery provisions for the housing components wer estimated
to yield approximately $30 million *quivalent, or 82.7 percent of the combined
costs of site development and off-site infrastructure. The national govern-
ment would absorb 53.6 percent of total project costs, including the remaining
housing related costs and the full cost of technical assistance, major roads
and traffic components (see PCR, Annex K). The costs allocated to the housing
beneficiaris would be reduced, by approximately sixty percent, through cross-
subsidies afforded by NHA on the basis of expected profits from the sale of
commercial and industrial properties on site and revenues from other public
ag*ncies.
27.       Procurement conditions  provided for  international competitive bid-
ding (ICB) for civil works contracts valued at more than $1.0 million equiva-
lent each. Civil works contracts of lesser value would be procured on the
bais of local competitive bidding (LCB). Contracts for equipment and mater-
ials valued at over $100,000 equivalent would be procured through ICB and
those of lesser value through LCB, excopt for equipment under the small busi-
ness credit program, which would be procured according to DBP procedures. An
estimated 46 staff-years of consulting services would also be contracted for
the project.
28.       The project was justified by its expected employment  impact, direct
welfare gains for approximately 180,000 persons living at the Tondo, and
Increased traffic efficiency. The weighted overage economic rate of return on
Investments at the Tondo Foreshore, Dagat-Dagatan and major roads components
of the project was estimated at 27 percent (SAR, para. 6.15).
15/ The resettlement of approximately 9,200 families was associated with the
following public workss Tondo upgrading (1,500 families, of which 1,000
would be resettled on site), two roads financed under the project (700
families), the international port complex (3,800 families), and a
fisheries port at Navotas  (3,200).   During Negotiations  the Government
agreed to transfer to NUA the funds necessary to pay for the incremental
cost of providing serviced  lots for the families   to be  resettled as a
result of the port expansion and highway construction works.

29.       The project was expected to be completed in four years, by March 31,
1981. The loan closing date was scheduled for six months later, on Septembor
30, 1981.
30.       At the  Board meeting which considered   the project, Bank Executive
Directors discussed the risks arising from assigning major project Implemen-
tation responsibilities to NHA, in view of the obvious Inexperience of that
agency in the type of work proposed. Additional questions were raised as to
the level of Government commitment in support of NHA and the project; the
risks of speculation associated with the process of land lease transfors at
the Tondo; and the relatively narrow project approach to the large urban
problems of the Philippines, which called for a broader urbanization strategy.
Considering these various risks, Board members requested to be periodically
informed of the progress of the project and expressed interest in visiting the
Tondo on occasion of the following Annual Meeting, scheduled to tak. place in
Manila in 1977.16/

31.       The second project was appraised in October 1977, before the perfor-
mance of  the first project could be assessed.     Inevitably, therefore, both
projects shared the relatively high risks of experimenting with new programs
and institutions.181
32.       Although similar  in concept to the first project, the objectives of
the second project were more specifically focused on the housing sector, where
emphasis would be given to the expansion of the Government's upgrading and
sites and services program to three regional citiess Cebu, Davao and Cagayan
de Oro. In Manila, sites and services development was expected to represent a
net addition to the city's housing stock rather than simply provide for relo-
cation needs.

creation (through provision of commercial and industrial estates and small
business loans) and Institutional development (through technical assistance to

18/ The SAR (paras. 1.21-1.26) refers to the experience gained at the time
under the first project as satisfactory, noting that the NHA staffing
problems, which had caused delays, had been resolved.    Nonetheless, the
SAR acknowledged several project risks, including the inexperience of the
local units formed to implement the project at regional cities; addi-
tional staffing problems at NHA, which were likely to arise from the
rapid expansion of its work program; and financial uncertainties due to
the untested ability of NHA and the participating local authorities to
collect payments from project beneficiaries.



NHA and the participating loc-al governments). Technical assistance under the
second project would also be extended    to the National Kconomic Development
Authority (NEDA), to the HC and to the newly created MRS. In addition, the
project would support the Government's drainage and flood control program in
Manila through procurement of flood control equipment and technical ssis-
tance.
34.       Total project cost, estimated at $69.9 million (P 517.7 m), included
46 percent in foreign exchange. Bank loan 1647-PH for $32.0 million equiva-
lent, approved in December 1978, would finance the foreign exchange component
of the  project.   The Government, which was   the Borrower, would finance the
remaining local costs.
35.       The project's financial plsn allocated $26.2 million (81.9 percent)
of the proceeds of the Bank loan to be re-lent by the Borrower to NRA (under a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement to be entered into between the Borrower and NRA) on
terms and conditions approved by the Bank. The NHA was expected to relend to
local governments the necessary amounts for the implementation of the project
in regional  cities.   Of the  remaining loan proceedings, $4.6 million (14.4
percent) would be made available by the Borrower to the Ministry of Public
Works, Transportation and Communications (MPWTC) and $1.2 million (3.8 per-
cent) to NEDA, MWC and MRS. The foreign exchange risk on the Bank l.oan would
be borne exclusively by the Borrower.
36.       Loan  effectiveness,  planned  for March 1979, would be conditional
upon the signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Borrower and
NHA.    The  Borrower was   expected  to satisfy other special loan conditions
Including provisions for: additional NHA staff; periodical reports on the
technical, financial, and personnel aspects of project implementation; yearly
audited project accounts; establishment of satisfactory procedures for the
selection of housing beneficiaries under the project; maintenance of adequate
project implementation offices at regional cities; and timely information
about any major public expenditure (other than the project's) planned in the
project areas.
37.       Project components (described in the PCR, para. 2.05), with respec-
tive costs and contingencies, comprised:
(i) Dazat-Daaatan sities and services (90 ha) for about 8,600 families
in Metro Manila, at an estimated cost of $33.6 million equivalent
(or 48.1 percent of total project cost), including land acquisition,
provision of water supply, drainage, sewerage paved footpaths and
streets, schools, clinics, and material loans for house improvement.
On-lot development would range from single service connections to a
shell house;
(ii)  Sites and  services (3.800  families) and uggradina of   about 74 ha
(7.600 families) in the regional cities of Cebu, Davao and Cagayan
de Oro, at an estimated cost of $15.8 million equivalent (or 22.6
percent of total cost), including land acquistion and reclamation,
and the provision of water supply, waste disposal, surface drainage,
sea defense works, footpaths and streets, health, education and



12
social services, and building saterials loans for hoam Improvement.
Development standards at sites and service areas would provide for
lot eonnections to utility networks, while only public water tape
and septic tanks (or pit privies) would bo provided at upgrading
sitesg
(iII)  Industrial and co.m.rcial estates at Da-at-Dta-tan and two reaional
cities, involving development of approximately 56 ha (40 ha in
Dagat-Dagatan and 16 ha in rogional cities) at an estimted cost of
$9.4 million (or approximately 13.4 percent of total cost);
(iv) Small business development In Dagat-Dagatan and regional cities
including technical assistance and a line of credit stimated at
$2.2 million equivalent (or 3.1 percent of total cost);
(v)  Flood  control equigment  for Metro Manila    in support    of the
Government's flood control program lnitiated In 1972, at an estima.
ted cost of $3.0 million equivalent (or 4.3 percent of total cost);
and
(vi) Technical assistance and traininat at an estimated cost of $5.9
million equivalent (cv 8.5 percent of total cost), including foreign
and local advisory services   to bo allocated to NHA, NEDA, MMC, MHS
and MPWTC for institutional development, special studies and support
for project implementation in Manila and at regional cities.
38.       The NHA would have the      largest share of project implementation
responsibility, including all elements of the Dagat-Dagatan sites and services
component (except main drainage); all elements of the slum upgrading and sites
and services components at regional cities (except sea defense works); all
elements of the employment components; and the administration of various
technical assistance services.
39.       Other agencies   involved  in the  Implementation of the project
included MPWTC for construction of main drainage and sea defense works at the
housing sites, procurement of flood control equipment, and preparation of an
updated Metro Manila Flood Control Master Plan; and NEDA, MA, and NMS,
responsible for studies and training activities financed under the technical
assistance component.
40.       All housing beneficiaries under the project would sign a 25-year
lease contract with NHA, which contained an option to purchase the freehold
interest after a qualifying period of 5 years or less, to be determined in
each city according to local conditions. As in the first project, the cost
recovery approach in this second project aimed at recovering from project
beneficiaries (through the lease cum mortgage and the sale of C/I lots) all
investment costs other than those normally financed from general tax sources
and utility charges. Beneficiaries of residential lots would be charged 75
percent of development costs and buyers of industrial and commercial proper-
ties would pay approximately 110 percent of development costs.  The projected
profits from the sale of industrial and commercial areas would be used to
subsidize the price of residential lots.



13
41.       Procurement procedures,  virtually identical  to those  of the first
project, established ICS procedures for civil works contracts valued at more
than $1.0 million equivalent and LCB for those of lesser value. Except for
materials for house omprovement, all contracts for goods and equipment valued
at over $100,000 would be awarded on the basis of ICB. For purposes of bid
comparison, local manufacturers would receive a preferenco of 15 percent of
c.i.f.  cost  (or the   level  of  customs  duties, whichever was lower).  Tne
remaining contracts for goods and the procureoent of materials for house
Improvement would  be tendered  by LCD.   Approximately 84 staff-years of con-
sulting services werc planned for technical assistance, over half of which was
to be supplied by local consultants.
42.       The  justification  for  the  project rested on Its expected poverty
alleviation impact, realised through the distribution of housing and commuity
services (estimated to benefit approximately 20,00C lower Income families in
Manila and regional cities), and the creation of some 25,000 jobs in the
vicinity of the housing   sites.   Of total project cost, some 72 percent was
estimated to benefit the urban poverty group directly.   The weighted average
economic rate of return for the housing and employment components, which
represented 85 percent of the project cost, was estimated at 34 percent.
43.       The project was expected to be completed in five years, by December
31, 1983, and the Bank loan closing date was scheduled for June 30, 1984.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation Schedule
44.       Both projects  experienced considerablo  implementation delays.  The
first project took ten years to complete rather than four, and the second took
six and a half years Instead of the five years projected at appraisal. The
PCRs give detailed accounts of the factors leading to the unsatisfactory
performaace and clearly show that appraisal schedules were over-optimistic
given the innovative nature of several components, the inexperience of the
participating agencies, and the difficult political climate surrounding the
project. 191
45.       The start of the two projects was delayed due to inadequate prepara-
tion.   Rights-of-way and  detailed engineering  designs were lacking for most
components. The topographic surveys and soil tests, conducted during the
preparation period, were inaccurate and had to be redone. Under the first
19/  In the case of  the first  project see  PCR, paras.  4.01-4.06.   For the
second project see PCR, pars. 4.01-4.13. In general, the implementation
schedules prepared at appraisal made insufficient or no provisions for
the completion of detailed engineering, land acquisition, execution of
financial and social elements of the projects; and did not account for
the learning time required by new units and project agencies.



project, construction of the sewer outfall and the major roadt components
began only four years after loan approval.
46.       Most of these initial problems could have been avoided. Bank exper-
ience at that time had already demonstrated the iWportance of acquiring land
and completing detailed engineering  a part of the project preparation pro-
cess, as for example in the case of the Lusaka Urban Project and the Senegal
Sites and Services Project,  both approved  in  1972.    Unfortunately, these
lessons appear not to have been applied to the first and second urban projects
in the Philippines.
47.       Delays continued  to accumulate  during project   execution due to
inefficiencies in contract administration and procurement problem at times
involving unsatisfactory quality of work by contractors and consultants.
These difficulties were due to the    inexperience of NRA compounded by other
factors, such as unanticipated physical contingencies, lack of coordination
among implementing units and agencies, and changes in project design during
execution.
48.       In the case of the first project, technical difficulties were aug-
mented by the sheer size of the Tondo upgrading component, the complexity of
which neither  the Bank nor NRA had predicted.    The process of reblocking,
whereby plots were realigned and houses were moved within each block, for
example, resulted in the relocation of approximtely 14,000 structures (or
almost the entire community) instead of only the few layout adjustments
planned at appraisal. Operations on site were seriously disrupted by politi-
cal problems arising from community groups competing for power and trying to
use the Bank to discredit the Government, whose policies toward squatters
outside the project area were inconsistent with policies adopted under the
project.
49.       Implementation difficulties were carried over from the first to the
second project.     Over  a year elapsed between loan approval and the first
significant allocation of local funds for that project.  The coordination of
activities by different agencies clearly remained beyond NHA control.
50.       In Manila, start-up problems at Dagat-Dagatan (which corresponded to
65 percent of the project) were surmounted only In the third year of implemen-
tation.   Land reclamation on site posed special difficulties, the original
drainage built by MPWTC proved defective, and the necessary corrections were
postponed by tWo years until interagency differences regarding the works were
resolved. Construction standards for the water supply and sewer systems were
upgraded by MSWW mid-way during implement-tion. As a result, construction was
delayed pending completion of new engineering designs and contract revisions.
The quality of construction was often wanting. A main sewer was found to have
serious structural defects and the corresponding contract had to be reten-
dered.
51.       In regional cities (whose components represented 24 percent of the
project), works began more than a year late on account of land acquisition
problems, difficulties in securing community cooperation, and unwillingness of
local governments to commit funds in advance of Bank loan effectiveness.



1S
Throughout lmplementation, project administration suffored from the Inexperi-
*nc- of local goverAneuts In the kinds of work Involved.
52.       The growing scarcity  of local financial rsources      In  the 1980s
created additional implementation problem_ for both projects. From that time
on, counterpart funds were disbursed late and in  insufficient amounts.   This
circumstanc- forced  NHA to  use cxpnsive   short-tenc bock  loan  to maintain
project momentum. High Inflation rat" In 1983 and 1984 led to construction
price escalations in excess of the contingency sargins built into most civil
works contracts, requiring the cancellation of seven contracts In Dagat-
Dagatan and additional time for retenderlng.
53.       Remedial action  afforded by the Bank's 1983-1984 Special Assistance
Program (SAP), although somewhat late, proved essential for the completion of
both projects. Under the SAP, a supplemental loan of US$10.5 sillion, made in
March 1984, helped finance cost overruns for the major roads and bridges
component under  the first project.    For both projects, a revolving fund was
established for the disbursement of loan proceeds and disbursement percentage
on civil works were raised from 43 to 85 percent. Th e measures accelerated
disbursements and ultimately permitted tho belated completion of the two
projects.
Modification in Proiect Design
54.       Physical and administrative changes were made to the projects during
implementation.  In the first irolect,  the main   changes  in physical scope
reflect inadequate pre-appraisal preparation and includes
(i) in the Tondo uparading component land reclamation works exceeded
estimated quantities by over six times due to unforeseen subsoil
conditions and obstructions, and the total upgraded area was reduced
by 24 percent (from 180 ha to 137 ha) causing a 14 percent decline
In the number of housing structures bmproved (from 17,500 to 15,000)
and increasing by four times (from 500 to 2,500) the number of
structures that had to be demolished;
(ii) in the sewer outfall component, design specifications for pipelines
were raised (from 48" to 72" diameter), a wator main was built
across the C-2 highway, and the scope of work of the ewer inter-
ceptor was increased;
(iii) in the ma1or roads and bridges component, additional works under-
taken included filling the Fisherman's Channel for alignment of
highway C-2, construction of a bridge over the Navota River, and
extension of highway C-2 through the Dagat- Dagatan industrial and
commercial area. The volume of civil works under this component is
estimated by MPWH to have increased by 110 percont over SAR esti-
mates. To help finance cost overruns of this component, a supple-
mental loan (No. 1282-1-PH) for $10.5 million equivalent was
approved in February 1984;



16
(iv) in the traffic imarovement component, civil work, valued at approxi-
mately $2.4 million equivalent were deleted.  comprising   mrosuDent
of intersections, construction of bus shelters, road mArkings end
footpaths.
55.       In the second project,   approximately  $4.9 million equivalent in
civil works were deleted to maintain overall costs within the appraisal bud-
get. The elements deleted compriset
(i) the Carbon upgrading site (1 ha) at Davao, originally budgeted at
approximately $0.1 million equivalent;
(ii)  a water main at Dagat-Dagatan, estimated    at appraisal at approxi-
mately $0.6 million equivalent, which was built under the regular
MWSS capital investment program;
(iii) three of the five elementary schools at Dagat-Dagatan, estimated at
appraisal at approximately $2.1 million equivalent; and
(iv)  on-lot development at Dagat-Dagatan,  including service connections,
fire walls, and housing options, estimated at appraisal at approxi-
mately $2.1 million equivalent.
56.       In addition, the scope of the industrial and  coummercial lots compo-
nent was increased by approximately 46 percent in terms of area developed.
The increment occurred in regional cities (Davao and Cagayan de Oro) and
neither the PCR nor other project documents provide a clear Justification for
this particular change.
57.       Both projects  introduced administrative  changes during implementa-
tion, of which the most important are the following:
(i)  transfer   of   the   responsibility  for  administering  the small
businesses and materials loan Programs from local banks (DBP and
PNB) to NHA;
(Ui) modification in the formula for recovering costs from project bene-
ficiaries (which resulted in much higher subsidy levels) and in the
form of tenure under which land would be transferred (changed from
leasehold with option to buy to freehold tenure).
58.       The closing date for the  Bank  loans was   extended   for the first
project by four-and-a-half years from September 1981 to December 1985, and for
the second project by one year from June 1984 to June 1985.
Project Costs and Disbursements
(a) Costs
59.       The Audit is limited in its  analysis  of project   costs  by insuf-
ficient data and inadequate appraisal cost estimates. The PCRs for both
projects provide incomplete actual expenditures (for the second project actual



17
costs of flood control and technlcal assistance components are missing), show
these data In peso amounts aggregated by component rather than on a yearly
basis, and offer only averag* exchange rates over the life of the projects as
the basis for converting total project cost into US dollar equivolents.201
This is unfortunate since currency conversions are likely to be significantly
distorted if made on the basis of Imprecise, aggregated data, particularly
under highly variable inflation rates as in the Philippines during the first
half of the 1980..
60.       Comparison between  actual and appraisal cost estimates are hampered
by the various modifications made to the scope of work of both projects during
I'plementations as well as by the deficiencies of some of the appraisal esti-
mates based on preliminary engineering.
61.       These uncertainties notwithstanding, cost  performance in US dollar
terms seems to have improved somewhat from the first to the second project.21/
At an estimated total cost of $91.86 million equivalent, the first project
exceeded the $65 million appraisal figure by over 40 percent, while the cost
of the second project, at $67.75 million equivalent, resulted 3.1 percent
lower than the appraisal estimate. Notwithstanding the apparent improvement,
cost performance under the second project remains uncertain because the actual
impact of currency devaluations cannot be measured with the available dats.22/
62.       The estimated cost overruns under the first project reflect substan-
tial increases in the actual costs of major roads and bridges, sewer outfall,
and Tondo upgrading components, which together accounted for 65 percent of
project  costs  at  appraisal.    The increases may be attributed to extensive
start-up delays, large increases in the price of land, additional expenses
associated with  deficient works  requiring replacement  or extensive repairs,
and generally higher labor and materials costs resulting from the second major
increase in oil prices in 1978/79. 231 In addition, cost increases reflect
the underestimation of work quantities at appraisal.     The  deletion   of the
civil works from the traffic component, combined with minor differences in the
cost of technical assistance, kept overall project costs from rising further.
20/ Project costs are reported in the PCR, paras. 4.07-4.09 and Annex B for
the first project, and in the PCR, paras. 4.14-4.21 for the second proj-
ect. In both cases detailed expenditures by components are shown in
Philippine pesos only.
211 Total costs for the first project were converted into US dollar equiva-
lent using the average exchange rate of P 10.6 - US$1.00. For the second
project the average exchange rate used was P 11 - US$1.00.
22/ Using preliminary expenditure figures expressed in current pesos, the PCR
estimates a 45 percent cost overrun for the second project (Table 4.1)
despite reductions in project scope.
23/ See for example, Letter from MPWH dated 03/21/86 in PCR, Annex M, where
the Borrower estimates at 110 percent the increase in scope of work for
the major roads and bridges component under the first project.



63.       In the  second project, cost inctases in pesos war* asociated with
similar factors. Larte varlations In the work quantities for land reclamation
and sharp rlass In land prices increased considerably tho cost of shelter
development, while Implemntation delays led to   extonsions In  th  engagement
perlod of   xpatriate consultants,  causing technical aistance cost to rise.
As notod above, reductions in project *cope and the devaluation of the peso
kept overall costs below appraisal estimate.
64.       The following  tables  uarilse tho appraisal and current cost esti-
mates for the two projects (Table 1) and show tho variations in cost structure
which occurred during implementation (Table 2).

sal and PCR tables for both projects as part of the cost of upgrading or
sites and services. The Audit has disaggregated these costs based on the
area used for commercial and industrial lots in each site as a proportion
of the total.
Le   The actual cost of technical assistance and flood  control equipment under
the second project was estimated by the Audit on the basis of disbursement
figures for Bank Loan No. 1647-PH since cost data on these components are
lacking in the PCR.

65.       Both projects  failed to utilixe the   full amount of the Bank loans
due to exchange rate fluctuations and in spite of the increase in disbursement
percentages  made  under the   SAP.    The undisbursed balance of $3.2 million
equivalent on loans for the first project (7.5 percent of the total $42.5
million approved) was cancelled on the closing of project accounts in July
1986. Likewise, the undisbursed balance of $1.4 million (or 4.4 percent of
the original loan amount) on loan 1647-PH was cancelled in July 1985.
66.       The  disbursement  profile  (see Figure   1)  closely approaches the
Bankwide average for urban projects in the second project, but lags consider-
ably behind that curve in the first project. 24/ In both cases, actual dis-
bursement periods significantly exceeded the optimistic appraisal projections.
Disbursements on both projects accelerated after FY83, reflecting the positive
impact of the measures taken under the Bank's Special Assistance Program.
67.       Table 3 shows the proportion of total project  cost financed  by the
Bank loans as compared to appraisal projections. The Bank's share doclined
from 49.2 to 42.7 percent in the first project but remained only slightly
below the appraisal estimate for the second project.
24/ The disbursement profile drawn by the Audit for the first project diffors
from that shown in the PCR because the latter was prepared prior to the
closing of loan accounts.

IV. PROJECT RESULTS
68.       The evaluation of both projects was based exclusively upon documents
made available to the Audit and the lack of direct field experience partly
explains the tentative nature of some of the conclusions presented in the
following paragraphs.
Physical Accomplishments of the Manila Urban Development Proiect
69.       The physical accomplishments of  the project were satisfactory des-
pite considerable implementation delays and cost overruns. Investments in
shelter, corresponding to approximately 46.6 percent of actual project cost
($42.8 million equivalent), resulted in the upgrading of approximately 15,000
housing structures at the Tondo Foreshore Area and in the development of 2,500
serviced  sites  for  relocation  in Dagat-Dagatan   (2,000)  and Tondo (500).
Compared to appraisal targets, these achievements represent approximately 71
percent for upgrading and 83 percent for serviced lots.
70.       The shelter investments combined with the provision of secure tenure
led to considerable private  investment in housing on both sites.     In Tondo
approximately 13,500 structures were improved (90 percent of the total), 12
percent of which were replaced by entirely new houses (PCR,   para. 3.04).   A
similar build-up process was reported for Dagat-Dagatan (PCR, para. 3.08).
Development costs for an average residential lot (at approximately $2,400
equivalent) amounted to about a quarter of the cost of a minimum-standard,
contractor-built, completed house in Manila, demonstrating the more efficient
use of public resources in upgrading and sites and services than in conven-
tional housing programs.
71.       The two housing sites were provided with all elements of on-site and
off-site infrastructure planned and services are fully operational, although
in some sections in Tondo flooding and water shortages remain a problem.25/
251 According to the Borrower, the incidence of periodical flooding in Tondo
is not due to defects in drainage works built under the project but
rather to the elevation in the sea level which occurred since then. See
PCR, Annex M, Letter from the MPWH dated March 6, 1986.



23
The community facilities built include 165 classrooms for primary education,
50 classrooms for secondary education, two now health centers and upgrading of
five others, and 28 multipurpose community centers, all of which are operating
regularly.
72.       Unquestionably, the higher levels   of housing-related services sup-
plied by the project vastly Improved the physical environment, health, and
general welfare of over 185,000 people in Tondo and Dag-t-Dagatan, compared to
their previous living conditions. Based on market values for land at Tondo
and Dagat-Dagstan at project completion, the Audit concurs with the PCR (pare.
7.02) in estimating the economic rate of return on the shelter investments at
15 percent (vs. 21 percent at appraisal). The lower ERR reflects higher
development costs and the fact that the project took longer to complete than
expected and, consequently, benefits were deferred.
73.       While considerable  Improvement in the quality of housing in Manila
was achieved, all sites and services units were used to meet relocation needs
of squatters dislodged by public works, and thus represented no addition to
the city's housing stock. This objective would be tho focus of the second
project in which the bulk of the shelter investments were allocated to new
housing.
74.       Investments in urban transport, corresponding to  approximately 37.9
percent of actual project cost ($34.8 million equivalent), increased by almost
20 km the carriage capacity of the Manila road system (through a section of
2.4 km in four lanes on highway R-10 and 5.1 km sections in two lames). Three
bridges were built on these new roads and some 88 interconnected traffic
signals were  installed.   In addition, the project equipped a central traffic
control center aided by 400 mobile radio units (for traffic control by police)
and created a Traffic Engineering and Management unit to administer the city's
traffic system. Due to cost overruns of over 100 percent in the major roads
and bridges component, the Borrower, vith the Bank's approval, deleted from
the project the civil works elements originally planned under the traffic
component.
75.       The road access to Dagat-Dagatan area contributed to the increase by
approximately 367 ha in the supply of urbanizable land in central Manila.
This achievement in itself represents a major project benefit which unfortu-
nately is not readily  quantifiable.261    In  addition,  the  project's urban
transport investments facilitated traffic movement in and out of the Tondo
Foreshore Area (including the International Port Area) and improved traffic
management in the city as a whole. The PCR (paras. 7.03-7.05) estimates the
economic rate of return on these Investments, based on savings in road trans-
port cost, at 29 percent for traffic improvement and, tentatively, at 23
percent for major roads and bridges, since that component was not complete at
the time  the analysis was made.    The Audit agrees with the    PCR that both

which only a small portion (approximately 40 ha) was developed under the
first urban project.



24
components have generally met appraisal objectives but lacks the appropriate
data to coment on the specific ERR figures.
76.       Project  investments   under the   employment  promotion  components
achieved mixed, if not wholly disappointing,  results.   Approximately 15.8 ha
of saleable commercial and industrial land was developed at Tondo and Dagat-
Dagatan at an est.mated  cost of  $8.7 million  equivalent (or 9.4 parcent of
total project  cost).   One year  after the  completion of  this component, in
December 1984, only 57 percent of the lots had been sold and demand since then
has not much improved (PCR, para. 5.04). This outcome reflects the general
retraction in business activity in the Philippines in the early 1980s but also
suggests that investment risks for the component were unduly high due to lack
of prior demand studies. Financially, the investment resulted in large losses
for NRA, since expected sale revenues may not exceed one-third of the apprai-
sal estimate. For the lots actually sold there is no information on whether
or not enterprises are operating on them or on the number of jobs actually
created. The PCR (par&. 7.02) estimates the economic return on this component
at 25 percent (vs. 40 percent at appraisal) based on the market value of the
land, but the Audit would expect the ERR to be somewhat lover due to pro-
tracted sales and the eventual deterioration in the value of the Inventory.271
77.       The  second  instrument used   in the project to promote employment
creation consisted in a line of credit extended to existing small businesses
in Tondo. At project completion only 36 percent of the original allocation of
$0.4 million equivalent had been disbursed under this program, loan collection
rates were just over 55 percent, and evidence of employment promotion was
lacking (PCR, par.. 3.15) or was ineffective under the circumstances.
78.       Achievements under    the  technical   assistance  component, which
accounts for approximately 6 percent of project cost ($5.4 million equiva-
lent), consist primarily in strengthening NHA project implementation capacity.
In addition, several special studies were completed, includings (i) municipal
services for Metro Manila; (ii) Metro Manila Transport and Land Use; (Iii)
fiscal base of the MMC; (iv) cadastral surnvy of HMA; (v) organization, man-
agement, and financial planning for NHA; (vi) feasibility study for the second
urban development project; and (vii) a National Transport Investment Plan
prepared by DPWTC. In general, the studies were useful to the Borrower and
led to the approval of two subsequent Bank-financed operations in the urban
section (Loans 1647-PH and 1821-PH). The MMC staff training program did not
materialize except for a number of ad hoc short courses (PCR, par&. 3.14).
Physical Accomplishments of the Second Urban Development Prolect
79.       Shelter investments  under the second project emphasized new housing
in Manila through sites and services and the expansion of the slum upgrading
and resettlement program (SIR) to regional cities. Investments amounting to
$39.5 million equivalent (or 58.3 percent of actual project cost) resulted in
271 While theoretically land values may be expected to keep pace with infla-
tion, physically the inventory is likely to deteriorate due to lack of
infrastructure maintenance and occupation by squatters.



25
the upgrading of approximately 7,500 housing units In Cebu, Davao und Cagayen
de Oro end some 11,000 serviced lots, of which 76 percent were in Mnila and
the remaining In Davao (18 percent) and Cagayan de Oro (7 percent) (PCR, Annex
4). Thee units were distributed in eight siteos a ninth site In Cebu (Carbon
upgrading, 1 ha) was deleted from the project due to lend relamstion prob-
ems. Substantial private investments in housing followed completion of civil
works and land titling (PCR, para. 3.03). Average development cost per shel-
ter unit, at approximately $2,100 equivalent, was slightly lower than under
the first project. Overall, the shelter components met quantitative appraisal
targets in upgrading and fell short by 11 percent In sites and services.
80.       The provision of on- and off-site    infrastructure  at  the housing
sites in regional cities was completed to appraisal standards, although with
large variations in work quantities due to underestimates at appraisal of land
reclamation and off-site infrastructure works (PCR, para. 4.15). At Dagat-
Dagatan land reclamation and on-site infrastructure works also vastly exceeded
appraisal projections.
81.       In general, the quality of the works completed was acceptable (PCR,
pars. 6.28) even though all but one of the upgrading project areas were situa-
ted on low lying, swampy coastal sites subject to tidal Inundation (PCR, pare.
3.01). The Audit notes that there was little flexibility in the choice of
upgrading sites since squatters seldom have access to better terrain. Never-
theless, the location of these sites remains a problem for the sustainability
of the infrastructure investments since additional sea defense works will
eventually be rquired to protect the sites from the gradual elevation in the
sea level observed in the Philippines over the last few years.
82.       The higher  than average  quality of  civil works  completed in this
project, as compared to the first project, is the result of Improvements in
construction supervision on the part of NHA and, in the case of regional
cities, the assistance provided by resident planning and engineering advisors
on site. Sanitation and basic infrastructure in upgrading areas substantially
improved health conditions among resident populations, as documented in a
study conducted in the main Davao upgrading ares.28/
83.       At  Dagat-Dagatan,  notwithstanding  the physical site Improvements,
the project failed to meet enviroumental standards advocated in Bank-financed
operations. Land reclamation and subsequent filling resulted in the elevation
of the site by several feet above the level of the surrounding built-up ares,
exacerbating flooding problems in the nearby commnities (PCR, par&. 8.07 i).
Project design should have anticipated this outcome and taken provisions to
minimize its ill-effects.
281 Results from this study (cited in PCR, pare. 7.08) show that incidence of
serious gastrointestinal diseases was reduced from 60 to 10 percent,
infant mortality rates dropped from three times the national average to
slightly above that average, and child malnutrition declined from 80
percent to only 9 percent, as a result of the project.



26
84.       Community facilities at the housing sites were generally implemented
according to the appraisal plan, except at Dagat-Dagatan where the number of
primary schools was reduced by 60 percent (from 5 to 2 schools) to avoid cost
overruns. Otherwise, the facilities actually built were those specified at
appraisal, namelys 9 new or upgraded primary schools with approximately 160
classrooms; 5 now or upgraded secondary schools totalling 84 classrooms 10
new or upgraded health   centers; 19 new multipurpose community centers; and 3
markets, all of which are presently oporational.
85.       As in the first project, the  second project  succeedod in improving
the quality of shelter for the urban poor but made only a modest quantitative
contribution to  the country's housing stock.    Contrary  to project expecta-
tions, demolition of squatter housing continued unabated, adding to the demand
generated by population growth and pent-up need for low-cost housing. Between
1975 and 1983 an estimated 63,000 squatter families in Manila and other
Filipino cities were relocated by the Government, their number far exceeding
that of families benefiting from in situ upgrading and sites and services
programs carried out by NHA under Bank-financed projects. The 11,000 serviced
sites built under the second project represent less than 5 percent of the
country's demand from new growth alone (estimated at between 40,000 to 50,000
units per year) in the market segment served by NHA and were clearly insuffi-
cient to relieve the squatting pressures in the capital region.291
86.       The NHA estimated at 19 percent   the  economic  rate  of   return on
investments for t4e project as a whole (PCR, paras. 7.01-7.08) but unfortu-
nately omitted from the report detailed analysis of returns per component.
Considering the problems associated with the development of commercial and
industrial properties, the Audit cannot confirm this figure and considers the
ERR  estimated by NHA    exaggerated.   For shelter components alone appraisal
estimates of the ERR were 25 percent in Manila and 37 percent for upgrading
and 13 percent for sites and services in regional cities. The Audit would
expect actual returns to be probably lower, varying between 10 and 15 percent
depending on the site, although it lacks the necessary data to replicate the
appraisal analysis.
87.       Project investments aimed at employment creation,  in the equivalent
of approximately $18.5 million equivalent (or 27.2 percent of total cost),
performed poorly in this as in the first project.    Commercial and industrial
lots at appraisal comprised 56 ha in Manila and two regional cities. In fact,
82 ha were developed for this purpose, reflecting an increase of over 46
percent compared to the SAR figure.30/ Of the total saleable land developed
(73.4 ha) 79 percent  (58 ha)  remained unsold  at project  completion.  Sales
29/ See Malpezzi (1986) for several housing finance demand projections for
the capital and regional cities.
301 Area increases occurred only in regional cities and may be attributed to
the hope on the part of the local governments to maximize housing cross-
subsidies with the profits expected from the sale of these properties and
from the concomitant expansion of the municipal tax base. The changes
made do not appear to have been an issue for Bank supervision missions.



27
have not Increased significontly since then and not much progress ts foreseen
in  the  near  future.    As  in the first project, demand analyses were never
undertaken and insufficient attention has been given towards marketing (PCR,
pars. 5.05). The PCR (para. 5.30) questions the wisdom of Incorporating large
8cale commercial/industrial development in future housing projects but still
expects sizablo revenues to be generated from these properties on the projects
being audited. This expectation appears optimistic to the Audit since long-
term losses would likoly ensue from the declining value of the lnventory due
to poor physical maintenance and/or occupation of the lots by squatters.
88.       Similarly, the small business loans failed to meet  appraisal objec-
tives. Loan disbursements of approximately $0.46 million equivalent corres-
pond to 21 percent of the original allocation, collections have been consis-
tently low, and the employment Impact remains undocumented.311 In general,
the business loans were administered by NHA and the local governments in the
manner of a welfare relief fund, as suggested by the term 'livelihood'
attached to the program. Government banks and   small business  advisory agen-
cies of the Ministry of Trade and Industry never became Involved in the imple-
mentation of the program, as expected at appraisal.   There   is no information
regarding the outcome of NEDA's national small-scale business program anal-
ysis, originally planned to improve performance of this program.
89.       The flood control equipment, procured under the project at a cost of
$2.2 million equivalent (or 3.3 percent of total project cost) and consisted
of estero and sewer-drain cleaning and maiptenance equipment, assisted the
Borrower in carrying out critical flood control activities, as planned. The
city's flooding problem, however, has  grown more   severe  over  time.   With
limited resources, the MPWH has implemented several drainage improvement
measures in addition to its normal maintenance activities, but a special
project will be required to resolve the problem. Such a project is presently
under discussion based on a comprehensive flood control program (including
rehabilitation of existing works and construction of new works) prepared by
MPWH with assistance from consultants financed by the project.
90.       The technical  assistance  investments,  estimated  at   $7.6 million
equivalent or 11.2 percent of total project cost, were largely used to finance
expatriate advisory services employed to strengthen the project implementation
capacity of  NHA and  local governments.   The  availability of these services
helped resolve several technical difficulties which arose during project
execution and succeeded in building lasting technical expertise within NHA.
In addition, NHA management was improved in several ways and a feasibility
study for the Third Urban Development Project (Loan 1821-PH) Was completed.
In regional cities the results of technical assistance were not as successful
31/ In the justification of the project the appraisal report (para. 7.08)
does not quantify the expected employment impact of the project, although
it states that most jobs created would benefit the urban poor. In the
PCR (para. 3.08) the Borrower reports the creation of 15,000 new jobs in
regional cities and incomq gains for some 9,000 households in Dagat-
Dagatan as a result of the program, but these figures are not based on
verifiable data.



28
because the local Institutional proble_ for exceeded the technical mandates
of th  expatriate advisors (PCRI,  pare. 6.09-6.15).     As alroedy mentioned
(PPAH, pare. 89), technical assistance to MPWH resulted in the preparation of
Phase I of the Metro Manila Drainage and Flood Control Master Plan.   Planning
assistance extended to NEDA was largely used in supporting regional cities in
project planning and implementation and, with the exception of the study on
business loans, achieved satisfactory results. No information Is avallable on
the results of the technical assistance extended to MHS for policy planning
and progrsm  development.   In general,  the PCR (para. 8.07 j) notes, and the
Audit concurs, that future technical assistance programs ought to place
greater emphasis on technological transfer to local staff as well as on direct
engagement of local consultants.
91.       In both prolect, the   credit line  for buildins materials has been
underutilized. Loan disbursements in relation to the original allocation were
36 percent in the first project  and 21  percent in  the second.   Inefficient
administration of this credit line by NRA and local governments accounts for
the unsatisfactory performance. For the second project, the PCR (para. 3.09)
notes that project beneficiaries appeared to have preferred acquiring their
own materials from the private sector.   Since  the follow-on projects (Urban
III and IV) contain similar provision, a thorough analysis of this component
seems urgent to help Improve the utilization of this credit line.
Financial Performance
92.       The shelter components in both projects were intended   at appraisal
to provide both affordable housing for lower income families and a financially
viable operational model that would permit NHA to expand the upgrading and
sites and services program on a scale commensurable to tho PhilippineOs' hous-
ing needs. Project results indicate that affordability targets have been met
(PCR-I, para. 5.10 and PCR-II, para. 5.14) but financial viability goals had
not been achieved (PCR-I, pares. 5.01-5.09 and PCR-II, pars. 5.02-5.11).321
93.       Basically, the poor financial performance of the projects resulted
from the combined impact on cost recovery of distorted pricing policies, poor
sales performance, and inefficient  collections.   These problems were aggra-
vated by the failure of the cross-subsidization scheme and by the general
decline in the performance of the Philippine economy.
94.       The pricina distortions are  attributable to  the foll --ing factors:
(a) establishment of lot prices prior to completion of land acquisition and
civil works, based on unreliable projections of what such costs would be; (b)
modification in the form through which capital costs for utilities would be
recovered, shifting these costs from the mortgage instrument to the respective
321 This section only summarizes the main financial problems encountered by
both projects and the reader should refer to the cited PCR paragraphs for
more detail.   In particular, it should be noted that NHA is fully awaro
of its cost recovery problems and has taken recently several measures
that might indeed improve future financial performance.

utility tariffs without verifying    If tariff lcvels Vero appropraste to actu-
ally cover these costs, and without agreement from utility companies as to
wvhther the charge. were accptable to them (a similar procedure was adopted
for on-site road works); (c) application of large subsidies to the price of
residential lots based on assumptions regarding profits from sales of comer-
cillindustrial lots without testing the validity of the assumptions; and (d)
owdssion from the pricing formula of provisions for bad debts, administrative
costs and interest during construction. In addition, political conditions and
Interference clearly aggravated   HA's pricing proble_s.
95.       Lot sales  performance was   poor primarily becauso project land was
not acquired In advance and cumbersoms land expropriation procedures resulted
In protractod land acquisition, delaying titling and mortgage origination. On
land legally owned by NHA sales lagged due to mortgage documntation dolays
and several other legal and practical difficulties, Including title award
without concomitant mortgage signature. Accordiag to the lat data available
roflecting sales as of December 1986 under the second project (PCR, Annex 4),
60 percent of the residential lots and 80 percent of tho CJI lots remain
unsold.t3/
96.       Collections  of mortgage    lnstallaents  from  project beneficiaries
averaged 56 percent of amounts due under the first project and are reported to
be extremely poor under the second project, despite a concerted effort on ibe
part of NHA to improve performanco as of 1984 (PCR-I, paras. 5.L, and 5.20 and
PCR-II, para. 5.32).     In regional cities where collections are the responsi-
bility of local governments no roal attempt at initiating collections has yet
boen made and it appears that the political will and the technical captcity to
do so are lacking.
97.       In addition, NMA has   oncountered seemingly  unsurmountable prbt'_ms
in collecting payments from the government agencies on behalf of ihich tt
incurrod significant expenditures by fiat without   previous Interagency agree-
ments. Similarly, the Authority's loans to local govornments represent large-
ly uncollectable papers, although formal agreements were signed.    The overall
result of these various factors has been a sharp deterioration in NHA's debt
service capacity which, thus far, has not been improved.
98.       Tho cost recovery status under the    second  project  gives  a rough
measure of  the extent  of the   problem. On residential lots approximately 15
pereent of actual costs are expected to be recovered (vs. 75 percent estimated
at appraisal) and on commercial and industrial lots the figure drops to 11
percent (compared to approximately 110 percent projected at appraisal).
Similarly poor cost recovery performances are comon to *sveral public ector
enterprises in the Philippines, and evidently the present difficult country
conditions have aggravated the problem. However, it appears to the Audit that
additional problems were created by the accumlation of housing finance and
housing production  functions within NBA.     In the  long-run, tho Audit would

rather lots which for various reasons are not yet under collections.

expect NHA to stand a better chance of success by opersting solely as a hous-
ing production agency supported by speciallzed housain finance institutions.
Institutional Performance and Policy Impact 341
99.       The projects helped establih NH as sn agency    specializing in slum
improvement  and  sites  and services   and,  in particular, strengthened the
agency's technical capacity.  The NU   remains the only public agency in the
Philippines producing housing affordable to the lowoet two-thirds of the urban
population. However, because attention (of both NSA and Bank staff) was
focused primarily on physical output, administrative and financial aspects of
NHA's development were comparatively neglected during sost of its first decade
of operations. The Philippines' financial and economic crisis of 1983/84 and
the subsequent restrictions imposed on the public budget have made it diffi-
cult for the Government to continue to compensate for NRA' operational losses
through budgetary transfers and the issue of the Authority's financial survi-
val now appears to be a main focus of concern.
100.      Besides directly  executing several  components, NHA was expected to
coordinate the activities of all the other participating agencies, including
national ministries and, in the second project, also local governments. The
Authority was not capable of performing this coordinating role efficiently.
Unsatisfactory interagency coordination Is apparent In the difficulties NHA
faced in turning over infrastructure at the housing sites to the line agencies
responsible for operations and maintenance. As noted in the PCR (paras. 6.19-
6.26), the NPWH has now accepted completed works for maintenance purposes but
the financial asset transfer has not taken place. The MWSS remained unwilling
to accept water supply and sewer works until a most recent Cabinet decision
and Presidential Directive (dated December 18, 1986) clarified the maintenance
responsibilities of each project agency. In regional cities, under the second
project, the line agencies were directly responsible for building their own
share of infrastructure and  community facilities.   This  arrangement averted
turnover difficulties but created serious scheduling problems since works by
each line agency were not completed in time to fit NHA's needs.
101.      The second project placed NHA in the position of a municipal lending
bank responsible for financing local governments in the amounts required by
the project. At the same time, the functions of selling lots, originating,
holding, and collecting mortgages were left to each municipality. Local
governments were expected to use the combined resources from tax revenues and
direct cost recovery from project beneficlaries to repay the NRA loans. These
expectations were frustrated and local governments appear unable to repay
their debts to NHA. As noted in the PCR (pares. 6.09-6.15 and 5.22-5.24), the
341 For a more comprehensive account of NHA' institutional development see

the other agencies involved in the projects are to be found for the first

experience clearly demonstrated that joint ventures of this kLnd aro $nppro-
priate In the Philippines given present local govnroment conditions.31I The
issue Is, of courso, broader *ince it undermines tho viibility of the national
SIR, one of the central objectives of tho second urban project.
102.      Neither project addresood sector olicv Issues dlrectly.   Instoad, a
demonstration effect wao planned whereby the *uccessful implementation by NRA
of in situ alum upgradinp' and sites and services would persuade the Government
to abandon Its slum oracication and relocation practices and instoad support
shelter programs modeld aftor   those  in the   projects.    The deonstration
effect failed to produce the desirable policy changes. As both projects wore
difficult to complete, Bank assistance focused on strengthening NRA inter-
nally, but neglected the external policy environsent surrounding that agency.
Thus positioned, the Bank was   unable  or unwilling to establish effective
working relationships with the other parts of Government working In the ahel-
ter sector and meaningful policy dialogue with the Borrower seem   not to have
taken place until the mid-1980s. Ultimately, the projects had little positive
impact on sector policies throughout the decade, the Government continued to
eradicate slums  and relocate squatters, and increased (rather than decreased)
the shore of housing budgetary appropriations benefiting higher Income groups.
In this context, NHA became relatively Isolated and primarily dependent upon
continued Bank support for survival.
Project Sustainability
103.      The longevity of the housing infrastructure   assets created  by the
projects will depend upon routine maintenance on-site. In addition, In low-
lying coastal areas, periodical upgrading of flood control works would likely
be required.   Turnover from NHA to other agencies of completed infrastructure
for maintenance purposes has improved as of 1985 but msintenance continues to
be problematic.   Given  the current economic difficulties facing the country,
these problem  cannot be  expected to be resolved on the    short tem.    As a
result, at  least a portion of the assets    built (as  for example the unsold
commercial and industrial lots)  are likely  to deteriorate  rapidly.   In the
first project inadequate maintenance has contributed to low mortgage payment
levels at the Tondo (PCR, paras. 5.21 and 5.23). As an alternative to accel-
erated decline in asset value resulting from lnadequate maintenance, the NEDA
has suggested that means be devised  for involving   the  comuzsity  itself in
maintenance activities.
Bank Performance
104.      The Audit  agrees with the PCRs in noting deficiencies In Bank per-
formance during the preparation and the supervision phases of both projects.
The first project was   appraised prior to complotion of detailed *ngineering
designs and land acquisition leading to serious implementation difficulties
35/ The fourth urban project financed by the Bank In the Philippines con-
tained the same NHA-Local Government joint venture arrangements, but in
view of the unsatisfactory results of the second project it is being
restructured so as to assign all financial functions exclusively to NRA.

(PCR, para. 6.28). Its supervision, although intensive (comprising 194 staff-
weeks in the field), was marred by high staff turnover, general inexperience
of Bank staff and consultants,, and excessive ephasis on civil works at the
expense of other project lements. In the second project, Dank assaitance in
project preparation Improved but *upervision problms recurred, vith the
additional logistic difficulty of combining coverage of project implementation
In regional cities with the preparation of follow-on operations in Manila
(PCR, paras.   6.31-6.32).    In contrast,   the  remedial  financial measurec
afforded by the inclusion of both projects in the Bank's 1983-84 Special
Assistance Program greatly facilitated the completion of both projects.
Lessons Learned
105.      The experience  of Urban  I end II has been valuable to the Borrower
and the Bank. The useful operational lessons learned are clearly stated in
both PCRs and may be sunmmarised here as followss36I
(i) as a demonstration project the Tondo upgrading was overambitious and
overwhelmed the implementation capacity of the Borrower and of local
contractors*    However, an alternative    smaller target area wuld
probably not have been politically acceptable in view of the high
priority assigned by the Borrower to improvements in the Foreshore
area of the capital;
(ii) a two year interval between the inception of the first and the
second projects proved insufficient to consolidate NHAs operational
capacity and at the same time expand the program on a national
scale. The repetition of errors might have been avoided by postpon-
ing the follow-on operations until substantial results were achieved
under the first project;271
(iii) belated land acquisition and cumbersome expropriation procedures led
to serious implementation difficulties in both projects, reemphsisz-
ing the  importance of  land ownership  as a necessary condition to
project success;
(iv) the availability of detailed engineering designs for civil works
under the second project, combined with on-site advisory services
and more efficient construction supervision by NHA staff, contri-
buted to reduce the technical implementation problems of that proj-
ect as compared to the first; nevertheless, insufficient attention
361  For the  first project see PCR, para. 8.10 and for the second project see
PCR, paras. 5.28-5.32.
37/  After the Second Urban Development Project  in  1978 Bank   loans  to the
Philippines  supporting urban sector programs     were  approved  for the
'Regional Cities Development Project,' in 1980 (for $72.0 million equiva-
lent) and for the 'Municipal Development Project,t in 1984 (for $40.0
million equivalent), raising total Bank financing for the urban sector in
the Philippines to $250.6 million equivalent in a ten year period.

continued to be paid to non-civil worki elemnts In project prepara-
tion and exzcution, a deficiency that ought to be correc4ed in on-
going and futur* projects;
(v)  le than successful institutional arrangemnt for project     Implemen-
tation revealed unreallstic apprdisal expectations regarding the
interagency coordination capacity of NU and the level of financial
managgemnt and policy coherence required by the projects at both the
national and the local levels. Financial and Institutional Issues
are presently being addressed on a sectorwide context, but satisfac-
tory solutions have yet to bo devised.
106.      Other points of special interest highlighted in the PCRs Include the
need for explicit policies towards renters (who comprise a large part of the
population In upgrading sites) and various pricing measures designed to
Improve cost recovery.
107.      At the soctor level the Audit reiterates     the  adverse  effect on
project performance caused by lack of an effective policy dialogue betwen the
Borrower and the Bank. In addition, by not slowing down the lending pace in
face of unsatisfactory performance under the first project, the Bank might
have in fact contributed to delaying the necessary sector reforms.

ATTACHMENT A
SORROWVR'S COMMENTS
The draft PPAR was forwarded to the Borrower for comments. The
response is reproduced in Attachment A to the report. The summary of the
comments is as follows:
(1) It Is observed that while now new lessons were presentod, the short-
comings of the project emphasise the need for better project preparation and,
in particular, more careful consideration of local situation *nd culture.
(ii) The report provides inadequate focus of the social benefits of the
project which parallelled the physical achievements.
Note:     While these achievements are noted in  general terms  throughout the
report, available data did not per-it measurements in the degree of Improve-
ment in the standard of living of the affected population.
(iii) The unsatisfactory cost recovery is noted and the insufficient
analysis of the risks associated with the cross-subsidization assumptions is
correctly noted. Adequate considerations of affordability is also questioned.
(iv) It is suggested that community participation in the maintenance of
facilities be considered.
Note:     The report  notes (PPAM,  para. 103) that such action was under con-
sideration by NEDA.

Subject:   Project Performance Audit Report:
Manila Urban Development Project
(Loans 1272-PH/1282-PH) and
Second Urban Development Project
(Loan 1647-PH)
Dear Mr. Nowicki:
Thank you for sending us a copy of the abovecaptioned report
and for allowing us to give our camments. While we concur in general
with the findings of the PPAR, we have a few comments on the report
as follows:
On Implementation Performance
Overall, the report offers no new lessons but reiterates the
same lessons learned from the implementation experience of past
projects, i.e., the need for thorough and adequate project prepara-
tion especially in the case of the subject project, which was experi-
mental in nature and the need for the executing agency to have
adequate institutional capability to carry out the project. It
appears high time for both the government and the Bank to place
emphasis on these aspects in future projects.
In addition, to the 'technical'factors that accounted for the
poor implementatior. performance of the project, we note that the
experimental nature of the project, as well as the sensitive issues
involved, e.g., relocation of squatters, necessitate a more careful
consideration of local situations and culture.
On Project Results
We note with disappointment the report's lack of focus on the
project's socio-economic results. It would have been more worth-
while if the report considered not only the achivement of physical



36                     ATTACHMENT A
Page 2 of 2
target but those of socio-economic outcomes of the project,
particularly on addressing inequalities in the distribution
of urban services in support of the urban poor, improvement
in the quality of life and effects on beneficiaries' attitudes
and behaviors.
Relatedly, the issue of cost recovery should be seriously
looked into. The report mentions the lack of political will
and technical capacity of local governments for collection of
mortgage installments. While the latter may be true, afford-
ability by target beneficiaries (e.g., urban poor) should also be
considered. It is noted that the targetted cross-subsidy assump-
tions made at appraisal did not materialize on account of low
sales of commercial and industrial lots. The risks involved with
cross-subsidies should have been foreseen at appraisal, and the
level of anticipated risk should have been incorporated in rate
of return analysis.
It would also be helpful if estimates of financial internal
rates of return could be presented in the final report.
On Maintenance of Project Assets
We agree with the Bank's observation on the need to expedite
operation and maintenance arrangements for the project to sustain
the positive results that have been generated. In this respect,
maximum participation by the beneficiary commmities in operation
and maintenance should be explored.
We hope that our comments will be useful in the finalization
of the PPAR.
Very truly yours,
SOLITA COLLAS-MONSOD
Secretary of Socio-Economic Planning &
Director-General

FROM      D. Haldane, AE      f
EXTENSION    61931
SUBJFCT     PHILIPPINES: Second Urban Development Project
Project Completion Report (PCR)
1.   Attached is the PCR on the above project prepared by the National Housing
Authority (NHA). This memo supplements the PCR in order to:
(a) highlightsome of the more important issues and lessons of Urban II
and add the Bank's perspective;
(b) cover points omitted from NHA's report; and
(c) update the reader on the status of recommendations made in the PCR.
2.   The attached report attempts to minimize duplication of material covered
under the PCR on Urban I issued last April 11, 1996, on which little, if any,
change has occurred. It -focuses therefore mainly on features specific to
Urban II or requiring follow up in the Urban I PCR. The environmental context
and institutional assessments of the NHA's first ten years will be found in
the Urban I PCR. Thus for a full picture of the NHA's Bank-assisted program,
both reports should be taken together.
3.   The central new feature of Urban II was the introduction of the agency's
first regional operations, and one of the project's most important lessons
related to NHA's unsatisfactory experience with joint ventures with the local
governments. Recommendations for revised institutional arrangements for
future national shelter development have played an important part in the
shelter sector rationalization, the first stage of which was recently signed
into law by President Aquino. Thus, despite serious problems encountered
under Urban II with regionally dispersed operations, the project experience
has usefully contributed to what will hopefully be a more rational and
efficient shelter delivery network in future.
Key Issues
Issue I: Institutional Arrangements
4.   The project's financial arrangements placed NHA in the de-facto position
of a municipal lending bank, with NHA making loans to local governments which
originate,   hold and collecting on the mortgage assets built.          Local
governments, however, proved to be unstable partners, with Cagayan withdrawing
from the project shortly after local elections installed a new mayor. Much
time was lost to rebuilding the project's momentum. In addition, sites were
turned over to local governments following physical completion, making cities
responsible for sales and collections. A combination of poor administration



38
and lack of political will has resulted in negligible cost reco,very on the
regional component as outlined in para 6 below.
5.   This experience helped crystalize the decision that local governments
represented an inappropriate institutional base for the management of
financial instruments such as mortgages. Particularly so for serviced sites
where participation is voluntary and eviction for non payment both possible
and necessary. The question is less clear for upgrading where participation
is largely but not entirely voluntary, and eviction extremely difficult. While
many mortgages in upgraded areas are viable, a proportion are not. The
appropriate institutional home for such relatively uncollectible paper is
still under discussion. However, recommendations that NHA disengage from
joint financial (mortgage) ventures with local governments have been
implemented, and the Bank's Urban IV project, which contained such provisions,
is being restructured to place 100% of the financial responsibility with NHA.
Local governments continue to play important roles in nonfinancial matters.
Issue II: NHA's Debt Crisis/(Cost Recovery/Sales)
6.  Collections were just underway at the time of the Urban I PCR, and only a
year has passed since then. However, further work has been done on the
combined (compounded) impact of deficiencies in the Authority's pricing
structure, sales performance and collection efficiency. Tables I and II
present the compounded effect of these three problems on overall cost
recovery. Actual recovery on residential units at the time of writing is
about 15% vs. 75% estimated at appraisal. For commercial/industrial units the
comparable figure is 11% vs roughly 110% estimated at appraisal. A significant
and unforeseen proportion of this gap is due to slow sales, meaning document
signature which enables startup of repayment. At appraisal, immediate sale of
all lots was anticipated. However, in reality titles appear to have been
awarded in large politically motivated events without simultaneous signature
of the mortgage document. Thus many more lots are reported as awarded than
are "sold" in the sense of signed and under collection. Sales in upgraded
areas are particularly troubled with only 17% of completed units sold as of
June, 1986. Obtaining signature is difficult on completed and occupied
upgrading sites and evicting occupants who have not yet signed is difficult.
For serviced sites, only 56% of completed units are sold (under collection)
but 68% are reported as allocated. It is not clear if the remaining one third
are illegally occupied. It appears both NHA and the cities lack the political
will to enforce eviction in serviced site areas on unsigned units. (Table III
summarizes sales as of June, 1986.) A diagnostic study is needed to check this
data, pinpoint the bottlenecks and lay out a program for resolving NHA's sales
problem.
7.   This lethal combination of institutional weaknesses triggered NHA's debt
crisis which threatens the institutions very survival. The Authority's debt
service ratio was 0.25 in 1985 and has further deteriorated in 1986. Sales of
existing assets and annual budget allocations are helping bridge the gap until
new policies and procedures can be put in place to rectify the situation.
8.   The Authority is aware of these problems, and some progress is being made
in resolving them. Specific recommendations and their status are listed
below:



39
With regard to pricing:
(a) costs of both on-site and off-site water, sewerage and roads
infrastructure previously charged off to other agencies (subsequently
not accepted under both Urban I and II) will in future be charged to
beneficiaries and included in the mortgage unless a signed
contractual agreement exists stipulating the amount and terms of
payment to NHA by another agency. In the latter case, NHA will
function as a contractor to the owner agency. As a result, unit costs
could double in future projects. The MWSS indicates that it has
refused to accept water and sewerage works because it's pricing
structure is inadequate to cover the associated costs. Thus charging
beneficiaries would not result in double charging.
(b) construction in future will not begin until NHA holds title to a
property and therefore knows the acquisition price;
(c) administrative costs and interest during construction will be added
to the sale price, both of which were omitted from Urban I and II;
and
(d) a 20% "default surcharge" has been added to the base cost.
The new pricing policy is already being implemented in the Pasig site of
Urban III.
With regard to sales:
(a) in future it is proposed that NHA function as a developer, selling
its mortgages to a financial institution.      Thus sales must be
complete before NHA can obtain payment for its mortgage. This should
create a strong incentive to execute sales immediately upon
completion, if not before. Since land title will be in hand before
construction, lack of title would no longer delay sales;
(b) a system of pre-sales combined with downpayments is to be tried out
under which lottery winners will begin savings accounts to build a
downpayment (10% agreed; 20% recommended by the Bank). Deposits of
those unable to meet the downpayment requirement after the allowed
period will be refunded together with earned interest, or the
application may be extended until the next lottery;
(b) the practice of title award without simultaneous document signature
must be immediately terminated.
With regard to collection efficiency:
(a) as noted above, NHA will no longer collect under future arrangements.
Collections will be handled by a financial institution with a private
Bank interface between the public agency holding the mortgage and the
individual mortgagee. However, it is possible that as long as public
agencies hold loan assets, payment may be poor in view of the relaxed
payment culture existing in the Philippines which is well described
in the attached PCR. Much depends on the financial agency's



40
administrative efficiency and willingness to enforce sanctions; and
(b) loan loss reserves must be established by all institutions holding
uninsured mortgages. COA has concurred in this recommendation which
is to be implemented in 1987 for NHMFC and 1986 for NHA.
9.  If all the above recommendations are implemented, cost recovery on
residential units could theoretically rise from the present 15% to 103%, as
shown in Table I assuming 95% sales and 90% collection efficiency. The
pricing changes are already in effect, and the Authority is in the process of
shifting to a policy of not initiating construction until land has been
acquired and the price is therefore known. These two policy shifts represent
fundamental and quite difficult changes. However, tightening sales procedures,
enforcing sanctions and cleaning up the unsold (undocumented) inventory
backlog represent several of NHA's most compelling and difficult tasks,
particularly under the present political climate. The task is complicated in
Urban II by the local governments' ownership of the sites in Davao and Cebu.
These may simply have to be written off to experience. The institution's very
survival will depend upon its success in addressing these procedural and
financial issues.
Issue III: Turnover
10.  The Urban I PCR noted NHA's difficulties in turning over infrastructure
completed under both projects to MWSS, MPWH and others. As noted in this PCR,
the MPWH has now accepted all completed works for maintenance purposes, though
the financial asset transfer has not taken place. The MWSS, however, remains
unwilling to accept works and the legal documents under both Urban I and II
are vague on this important point. As a result, NHA remains at least formally
responsible for servicing the associated debt. In future, legal documents
should clearly stipulate which agency ultimately will own the asset built and
bear the associated debt burden. Due to this gap in project documentation, it
was necessary to obtain a Cabinet approval and Presidential directive, signed
December 18th, clarifying maintenance responsibilities and directing MWSS and
others to accept completed infrastructure. Though the matter is therefore in
principle resolved, the directive has yet to be implemented and will doubtless
take time to execute.
11. Under the regional cities component of Urban II, an experimental approach
was tried out with MPWH, MWSS and others directly building their own off-site
infrastructure. While this successfully averted the turnover problem, it
predictably generated difficulties of coordination and timing of these works
to dovetail with NHA's needs. Until sites are functional, they cannot be
occupied and collections started. Having now tried both approaches, the NHA
has concluded that self-contained projects are preferable, and that the extra
costs must, as noted above, be added to the mortgage. Standards will be
trimmed back to meet affordability constraints.
Issue IV: Cross-Subsidies
12. Both Urban I and II entailed substantial cross-subsidies, utilizing
projected profits from commercial/industrial (CI) lots to subsidize prices on
the residential units. These proved unworkable in both projects, and have
contributed significantly to NHA's current debt service crisis. The essential



41
weakness in the cross-subsidy theory is that it ignores business cycles, and
differential demand for residential and commercial/industrial properties. A
steady demand curve was assumed at appraisal lasting through completion, a
period anticipated at four years and spanning in reality 7 years (Table IV).
The worldwide economic recession of the 1980-81 period, followed by the 1982-
83 crisis flattened demand for CI property, and eroded affordability on
residential units. Demand moved downward toward cheaper units such as NHA was
building. Accompanying high inflation in 1984 and 1985 as sites were completed
depressed economic expansion, but stimulated demand for inexpensive
residential real estate as a classic store of value in inflationary periods.
Some sales also occurred in CI property, but this represents a far less
liquid, longer-term investment prospect. Thus NHA encountered heavy demand for
the subsidized residential units (many of which are occupied though not
documented) and quite depressed demand for the Cl units which were to provide
the requisite profit. The Authority's inventory value will doubtless keep pace
with inflation if it can afford to hold the investment until market conditions
improve, but inventory contributes nothing to NHA's acute cash needs for debt
servicing.
13. Commercial/industrial properties in the regional cities are a particular
problem, with only about 5% of the existing inventory sold. As a result,
proposed CI investments under Urban IV have been deferred until the existing
inventory is reduced, and demand picks up.
14. Experience under both Urban I and II has therefore forced NHA to the
conclusion that internal cross-subsidies are excessively risky, and cannot be
relied upon to provide cash when needed. Borrowings secured against these and
other properties have reached a maximum prudent limit. The business
environment on which these arrangements rely is too cyclic, volatile, and
unpredictable for NHA to risk its institutional viability. The Bank fully
concurs in NHA's judgement. It is in fact, our view that the private sector
should undertake commercial/industrial property development, and that NHA
should disengage from this type of activity. The new Executive Order on
rationalization of the housing sector appears to approve this change, but the
language is not explicit and a clarification is needed.
Issue V: Business Loans
15. Urban II included a small business loan (SBL) component which was to be
implemented by a Bank, though firm arrangements had not been agreed at the
time of appraisal and were left to be worked out during implementation. In
actuality, the two banks identified at appraisal declined the role and NHA
ultimately implemented the component.     Experience with SBL's has been
exceptionally poor. Only a third of the amount earmarked was taken up, and
collections total only 20% of the amount due. Though NHA is committed to the
program which is politically popular, business lending has not been
professionally managed and has become blurred with the Authority's social
objectives. Ultimately the success of any business lending program must be
judged by whether the funds are recycled into a replicable program or become a
grant to the initial loan recipient. By this criteria the component must be
judged a failure. The Bank has recommended to Government that a specialized
institution be named into which such programs could be transferred, and that
NHA terminate further business lending. The new Executive Order concurs in
this mandate directive.



42
Issue VI: Resettlement
16. Urban I and II focused largely on establishing a national upgrading
program which, as noted in the NHA's PCR, brought about an important
modification in a 30 year old Government policy of squatter relocation. It did
not, however, terminate relocation which has continued to dominate an
excessive amount of NHA's institutional capacity. Of the approximately
133,000 units built by NHA in its first ten years, only 6,000 to 10,000 (or a
maximum of about 7%) have contributed to expanding the housing stock. All of
these were under Urban II and III. The 10,000 new low cost units served less
than 2% of the demand from new growth alone estimated at between 60,000 to
80,000 units per year in the market segment serviced exclusively by NHA and
the informal sector. Thus squatting pressures in fact intensified over the
decade. Production of new housing stock must be significantly expanded. While
the NHA's new six year program should reflect this shift, private sector
participation is ultimately the only means capable of delivering the volume
needed, and the Housing Sector Loan is intended to help develop the necessary
mechanisms to achieve this goal.
Issue VII: Flood Control
17. The PCR correctly points out that the project's modest contribution of
additional equipment and TA did not resolve the flooding problems of Manila
which have, in fact, grown more severe. A comprehensive review of the causes
of flooding in Manila is needed along with a project focused on resolving
these problems. Such a project is under discussion between the Government and
the Bank. A separate PCR report prepared by MPWH is available on file
detailing results of the flood control component.
Issue VIII: Land Acquisition
18. Land costs were significantly underestimated at appraisal, and land
acquisition problems plagued the project throughout implementation. Appraisal
estimates were based on the assumption that the prices frozen under the Areas
for Priority Development (APD) Order would prevail. In actuality,
expropriation took years and in many cases is still unresolved. Despite
protracted litigation in the courts, prices were finally set far closer to
market than expected. This enabled NHA to get on with s 4%division and
titling. For years lack of land title prevented finalization of  t sales as a
Deed of Sale with Mortgage was being utilized requiring title. Thus lack of
title resulted in NHA's inability to document the sale and initiate
collections. In 1984 the NHA shifted to a Conditional Contract of Sale in
which title was not required, thus removing legal obstacles to completing
sales and starting collections. A further and more important policy shift is
also taking place under which the Authority will now undertake construction of
a site only after title is acquired and the final price known. Adjusting to
this new policy will be quite difficult, with several years of intensive land
acquisition and little construction, but over the longer term is expected to
yield substantial dividends.
Issue IX: Disbursements
19. A learning curve is clearly evident in the contrast between the Urban I



43
disbursement profile and the Urban II profile (Chart V). The first project
closely paralleled the overall urban profile, but the second significantly
improved on it, cutting over two years from the profile. The fact the project
did not achieve the highly optimistic appraisal schedule (of substantively 3
years) should not be allowed to detract from this Improvement.
Issue X: Economic Evaluation
20. The 19% return noted in NHA's revaluation is probably quite optimistic
and suffers from some methodological constraints inherent in the nature of the
instrument rather than the method or data utilized by NHA. The evaluation
utilizes "market" values of commercial/industrial property based on a few
sporadic sales in an otherwise highly depressed market in which little
movement was occurring. As noted above, even the Authority's own CI property
remains largely unsold to date. The market's general suppression may have been
partly mitigated by demand generated by speculative buyers seeking inflation
hedges during this period, especially for residential properties. However,
the reliability of the data as a true judge of the market may be arguable, and
the economic rate of return similarly affected.
Issue XI: NHA's Financial Management
21.  The Authority's financial management and performance remains weak -- a
protracted problem which virtually endangers the agency's survival. Loans
under Urban III will severely strain NHA's debt service capacity and dramatic
steps will be needed to rectify the pricing, sales and collections problems
now depressing NHA's cash generation if the Authority is to regain its
capacity to again borrow and repay external loans.
22. In conclusion, the project achieved its key objective of nationalizing
the upgrading and serviced site program. However the institutional model
utilized (NHA loans to local governments) proved unreplicable. The projectbs
failures (notably the joint financial ventures with local governments, and the
performance of small business loans, home material loans and cross subsidies
have contributed to both the NHA's and the Bank's understanding of the
sectoral institutions strengths and weaknesses, and key issues leading to the
development of the Housing Sector Rationalization Plan, the first stage of
which was approved in December, 1986. It is hoped that with the adoption of a
significant proportion of the policy agenda under this Plan, many of the
problems encountered under both Urban I and II will be rectified, and the
sector placed on a sounder policy and financial footing to achieve its longer
term objectives.

PHILIPPINES
Second Urban Development Project (Loan 1647,PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
1.  The project was set against a background of severe service
deficiencies and rapid growth of squatter settlements in urban centers
throughout the country. More than 25% of the population in major
regional cities were living in dense central sites, usually located
on foreshore areas, under exceptionally poor sanitary conditions.
Population growth contihued at more than 5% per annum (p.a.) in Manila,
and regional development was clearly needed to relieve pressure on
the primate city.
2.  The prQject included the Third phase of development at the
Dagat-Dagatan sites and services area in Manila and initiated the
national upgrading and serviced sites program in three key regional
cities. The basic thrust of the First Urban Development Project (Loan
1272T/1282-PH) was continued, aiming to provide low-income urban resi-
dents with secure tenure and basic services for which they were to
repay over 25 years costs of land and on-plot and on-site development.
The project was the first effort of Government through the National
Housing Authority (NHA) to establish a national shelter program in
concert with local governments outside of Manila.   The project also
intended to spur ecoromic activity and employment opportunities through
a small business loan component and the development of three associated
commercial/industrial areas. Additional objectives included acquisi-
tion of flood control equipment for Manila and technical assistance to.
a variety of agencies.
3. The project design and implementation. period spanned 7.5 years
rather than the five-year schedule optimistically projected at appraisal.
However, actual construction, once begun, required little more than
5.5 years. Disbursements were substantially complete Within 7 years.-
4. Delays were attributable to technical problems at Dagat-Dagatan,
slow land acquisition, and slow release of Government counterpart funds.
The organizational and logistical challenges of establishing-new projects
in the regional cities were also significant.
5. Total costs for the main housing component of the project were
P689.12 M (excluding interim interest), a 45% increase over the apprai-
sal estimate. Much of this increase was attributed to the cost of land
and reclamation, which rose by 362% over appraisal estimates.- Never-
theless, because of the declining value of the peso during the project
period there was a 1.5% dollar decrease in total project cost.
($62.65 M actual at P11 = $1, v_s_. $6.5 M appraised at P7.5 = $1).



52
6. Increased casts did not affect the project's affordability as
incomes also rose. Average lots in all proJect areas are afforded by
households with incomes at or below the 20th percentile of the respective
income distributions.
7. Affordability was maintained through internal subsidies as a
result of differential pricing for residential lots and projected commer-
cial/industrial sales. C/I sales are of great importance, comprising
52% of estimated revenues against 57% at appraisal.   Sales have, however,
been disappointing in two of the three C/I areas, and improved marketing
efforts are needed if profitability is to be achieved.   Nevertheless,
taken overall, profitability can only be maintained if there are also
substantial reimbursements and/or assumption of liabilities by concerned
agencies for works undertaken by NHA on their behalf which amount to
41% of total investments.
8. Serious cost recovery efforts were initiated in early 1984 when
government was faced with an economic crisis in 1983 when NHA had to
rely on its collections to sustain its operations. Faced with a commu-
nity unaccustomed to paying charges for the lots awarded to then, NHA
embarked on a cost recovery information program throughout its project
areas. As a result, NHA's overall collections increased by 56% from
P100.99 M in 1984 to P158.11 M in 1985. Collection efficiency in Bank-
assisted projects was higher than that for locally-funded projects with
69% collected in 1985 increasing from 54%'in 1986. The serious attention
given by NHA to its recovery program has been commendable.- Improved
monitoring and control has been reflected in performance and recovery is
being enhanced through an improved rate of disposition for both residential
and commercial areas.
9. Turnover to other agencies of completed infrastructure for main-
tenance purposes has improved from a slow start with MPWH accepting
the major responsibilities during early 1985.   Despite continuing
efforts,problems are still being experienced with MWSS over the acceptance
of comoleted water and sewer works and reimbursement of expenditures from
ctherGovenmeittministries has not taken place. Taken overall these consti-
tutes a large drain on NHA's limited resources. Compounding the problem,
repayment of subsidiary loans by local governments to NHA has not bee.a
satisfactory. In future NHA projects,appropriate measures must be taken
in advance to alleviate these problems.
10. NHA showed remarkable flexibility in dealing with the technical
challenges, dramatic inflation, and a highly politic'ized environment
which characterized the project implementation period. The capacity to
produce affordable units has been demonstrated, and NHA's credibility
as an implementor is well established. Much work remains to be done,
however, on financial performance and coordination with Government
housing finance agencies. NHA's'future is heavily dependent upon in-
creased generation of corporate receipts to finance new projects and
service debt.



53
II. Performance of local govermnents under the project was uneven.
Their role in future efforts to expand the national shelter program is
of critical importance and must be detenmined in concert with tho extent
to which NHA is able to decentralize its operations.
i2.   In conclusion, the project achieved a dramatic improvement in
the living conditions of more than 25,000 low-income Filipino families.
Government policies now formally embrace upgrading and serviced sites
development as more socially acceptable and cost effective than previous
approaches. However in future projects, more attention should be given
towards cost recovery and the "soft ware" aspects of project implement-
ation and management if a truly replicable national program is to take
place.

PHILIPPINES
SECOND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1647-PH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. CONDITIONS LEADING TO THE PROJECT
1.01 The First Urban Development Project (Urban I) in the Phil-
ippines (Loan No. 1272 T :1282-1-PH) was approvedin May 1976 and con-
centrated mainly upon the improvement of the tondo Foreshore slum area
and the development of the first phase of the adjacent 400 has. Dagat-
Dagatan sites and services project in Manila.
1.02 The Second Urban Development Project (Urban II), the subject
of this report, sought to continue assistance to the Philippine Govern-
ment in developing affordable solutions to problems of poverty, shelter
and environmental sanitation, not only in Manila but in major regional
cities throughout the country. Specifically, the project's objectives
were (SAR, pg.8):
a. Establishment of a national program to improve basic
services and regularize land tenure in major urban
slum areas;
b. Establishment by the National Housing Authority (NHA)
of a nationwide sites and services development program
to make available well located and affordable residential
plots in major urban centers;
c. Promotion of employment through development of commercial
and industrial sites, and provision of business loans
and technical assistance; and
d.  Assistance to NHA and local government to improve
planning and development through an institutional
framework capable of implementing long-tenm, cost
recoverable programs.



55
1.03 A major goal of the project was to involve local governments
directly in upgrading slums and development of new serviced sites within
their areas. -The priority cities of Cagayan de Oro, Cebu and Davao were
identified for inclusion by NHA and its Board of Directors. In Metro-
Manila, the project sought to assist development of the first sites
and services area not tied to a specific relocation program. This deve-
lopment of the third phase of Dagat-Dagatan would not only add to Manila's
housing stock but would also produce a balanced residential and cwmuer-
cial center for the north-central part of the metropolitan area.
1.04 Experience with the Tondo project under Urban I had persuaded
government thata programofin-situ upgrading of slums and development of
serviced sites could provide viable, low-cost solutions to the burgeoning
housing problems of the country's rapidly growing urban population. It
was also clear that development in major regional cities must be pursued
in order to spur local growth and alleviate mounting pressure on Manila.
o 1.05 Thus, beginning in mid-1977, a series of Presidential Letters
of Instruction (LOIs 555, 557 and 686) were issued formally establishing
the nationwide Slum Improvement and Resettlement (SIR) program. The new
laws directed NHA to take the lead role in assisting local governments
to plan, finance, implement and administer cost recoverable upgrading
and serviced sites projects within the framework of long-temn programs.
Guidelines were set-forth regarding regularization of tenure, allocation
and recovery of costs, responsibilities of other government agencies
and establishment of local government housing offices. The LOIs were
truly innovative since they reversed government housing policies enforced
since World War II. The previous approach of outright relocation of
squatters to distant resettlement sites was replaced by a more realistic
and affordable strategy of in-situ upgrading. Overnight the country had,
on paper, a national program to work with low-income urban citizens to
redress basic service inequities. The Second Urban Development Project
was the first attempt to implement this policy on a national scale.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01 Project identification was carried out in 1976 and early
1977. In Metro Manila, the third phase of Dagat-Dagatan was identi-
fied as highest priority, following early development of Phases I
and II. Phase I was developed under Urban I with World Bank assist-
ance while Phase II, initially started by NHA, was subsequently
supported through a loan agreement with KFW.signed on April 10,1981.
In addition, high priority was assigned to the acquisition of flood
control equipment for Metro Manila by the Bureau of Public Works
(now MPWH).



56
2.02  Three major regional cities were also identified as
high priority sites for major development:
(i) The central visayan city of Cebu which in
1977 had approximately 25% of its one million
-       population living in slum and squatter areas;
(ii) Davao, the largest city in Mindanao with a
population of about 525,000 in 1977 of whom
22% were living in slum and squatter areas,
with densities up to 1,600 persons per hectare
in several central sites; and
(iii) Cagayan de Oro, located on the northern cost of
Mindanao with a population of 85,000 in 1977
of which 26% were living in slum and squatter
settlements.
2.03 Since under and unemployment were extensive among resi-
dents in slum areas, a high priority in the project was given towards
the promotion of employment and income generation activities through
the development of commercial/industrial land and provision of small
business loans and technical assistance.
2.04 Project preparation started in mid-1977 and foreign
and local consultants were extensively utilized to assist NHA and
the newly created project teams in the regional cities. Pre-appraisal
by the Bank began in late 1977 and was completed in December 1978.
The loan was subsequently approved and became effective in April
1979.
B.  Project Components
2.05 The project was to include the following components;
(SAR, pp. 8-9)
a.  Sites and services in Metro Manila - ($33.57 million
equivalent) at Dagat-Dagatan for about 8,600 residential
plots on about 90 ha. including (i) land, (ii) infrastructure,
(iii) core houses with sanitary facilities, (1v) materials
loans for house completion through self-help, (v) health,
education and social facilities.
b.  Slum imDrovement in the three regional cities of Cebu,
Cagayan de Oro and Davao ($9.31 million eauivalent) in-
vol ving basic infrastructure services and community
facilities for about 7,600 households.-



57
c.  Sites and services in the regional cities ($6.53 million
equivalent) including (i) about 3,800 plots on open land,
(ii) about 800 infill plots in low-density slums and ad-
3acent to high-density slums, (iii) sanitary facilities,
(iv) building materials loans, (v) community facilities.
d. Industrial/commercial development ($9.40 million equiva-
lent) involving 40 ha. of serviced land in Metro Manila
and 15.3 ha. in regional cities for, income generation and
employment purposes.
e. Small business development ($2.19 million equivalent)
including markets, technical assistance and loan funds
for equipment and working capital. In Dagat-Dagatan
approximately 2 ha. and in the regional cities about one
ha. of serviced land was to be provided for cottage
industries integrated within residential areas.
f. Flood control equipment ($2.22 million equivalent) in-
volving purchase of special dredging equipment to control
flooding in Metro Manila.
g. Technical assistance and training ($6.72 million equivalent)
Assistance: to NHA for planning and policy development,
training, project execution, monitoring and feasibility
studies; to MPWTC for flood control studies; to NEDA for
feasibility studies for metropolitan program analysis in
Cebu, Davao and Cagayan de Oro, and for review of national
small scale business programs; to MHS for assistance in
policy and program planning and to the MMC for training
and planning studies.
2.06 Of the total Bank loan of US$32 million equivalent,
US$26.24 million was to be on-lent to NHA. Terms of the loan were
for twenty years including a five-year grace period on principal
repayments with interest at 7.35%. Commitment charges were at 3 1/4%
of 1% computed on the basis of the undrawn balances.
III. MAJOR RESULTS
A. Physical jmpPovements
3.01 All but one of the upgrading project areas were situated
on low lying, swampy coastal sites subject to tidal inundation with
extremely poor drainage and totally inadequate sanitation. As shown
in the accompanying photos, the project achieved dramatic improvements
to the environmental conditions of these areas.



58
3.02 Another major hazard was fire and two upgrading sites
suffered large conflagrations during the project.impleementation  .
period.  Reblocking to provide access to all.ttructures ai.d create
firebreaks as well as the construction of water systems greatly
reduced this hazard that no fires have been experienced in a:y of
the project sites since completioni of construction.-
3.03 Serviced site development at Dagat-Dagatan is depicted
in the accompanying photos, showing how core units prov,ided by the
project were adapted over time by new residents to produce substantial
dwellings. Proper monitoring and    aluation of,residential.improve-
ments has not been pursued but a s..ple study in Davao shows, that
71% of the beneficiaries of upgraded,sites had.invested an average of
P6,000.00 in home improvements during the one.year study period.. As
the photos show, the level of investment Bt-Dagat-Dagatan was obviously
higher. The project clearly demonstrated that substantial private
investment in housing will follow when environmental and infrastructure
improvements are made and tenure.is regularized.
B. Increase in Housing. Stlck   '     -
3.04 Table 3.1 shows the project developed'18,549 residential
lots, about 97% of'the Appraisal estimate. Of-these, more than
11,000 are new serviced lots, the great majority of which were not
linked to relocation.programs. Starting in 1983 in Davao and culmi-
nating in Dagat-Dagatan in late 1984 more than 9,000 of these;lots
were raffled to more than 20,000 prequalified ,landless, low-income
families, an unprecedented.event in'the Phil.1ppines.
C.  Commercial/Industrial-Development      .
3.05  Three major,commercial/industrial. areas were, developed.
under the project encompassing a.gross area.of.82 ha., a 49% increase
over Appraisal estimates.  The 70 has.. net sileable area is valued
at more than P482 million representing 62% of expected revenues.*
3.06  As of December 31, 1985., onl3% of the.commerc  1/indus-
trial area in Cagayan de Oro has been disposed, while in Davao the
figure is 14% and in Dagat-Dagatan 30%. Overall some 54 has. of
saleable land remains undisposed.representing 78% of that completed..
While sales have lagged in the areas of Davao (despite the connmissioning
of a private brokerage firm), Cagayan de Oro and in tile 'ommercial
area of Dagat-Dagatan, sales in the industrial-area of Dagat-Dagatan
are more encouraging with 78% disposed.
D.  Small Business Development
3.07 The project included P16 M to finance a small loans
program intended to create new employment opportunities and increase
incomes of the project beneficiaries. At appraisal;it was assumed



59
that these funds would be administered by Government banks with
assistance from two agencies of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.
These arrangements did not materialize, and the small loans program
was eventually administered directly by NHA in Dagat-Dagatan and
the,local governments in the regional cities.
3.08 Less than one-third of the P16 N available was event-
ually disbursed to beneficiaries (P1.4 M in Dagat-Dagatin; P3.7 M
in Regional Cities). Despite numerous administrative aifficulties
and a low collection efficiency, the program has created over
15,000 jobs in the regional cities at a cost of about P2,000 per
job. In Dagat-Dagatan, the program has benefitted 9,049 households
with P3,648 additional income earned per family per annum. Invest-
ments were mainly for subcontracting and trading ventures.
NHA has remained committed to this program since no other
agency of government is currently providing small business assistance
to the low income urban population.   However,   tighter loan appraisals
and improved collection effqrts are required.
D.  Building Materials Loans
3.09 The project also included about P14 M building materials
loans to promote self-help home improvements but less than one-
third of this amount was utilized (P1.7 M in Dagat-DAgatan; P1.9 M
in regional cities) due to administrative difficulties. Beneficia-
ries appear to have been perfectly capable of acquiring their own
materials from the private sector. The building loans program has
continued with a variety of administrative adjustments under RCDP/
Urban IV but its performance should be more closely monitored and
revised as necessary.
E.  Flood Control Equipment
3.10 The project included $1.9 M equivalent to purchase
flood control equipment for use in Metro Manila. The Metro area
continues, however, to be plaqued by widespread floods every rainy
season.
F. Technical Assistance
3.11 The project included 543 manmonths of technical assistance
for NHA, WEDA, MMC, MHS and MPWH. In addition to project-related
advisory services, NHA also had allocationsto prepare feasibility
.studies for the ZIP in Metro Manila which eventually received Bank
assistance under the Urban III loan.

IV. PROECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
A. Start-Up
4.01 Project start-up was delayed by more than one year
due to (1) protracted loan negotiations which culminated in loan
effectivity only in April 1979; (2) dealys in release of govern-
ment counterpart funds to NHA, partially as a result of delayed
loan effectivity; (3) delays in land acquisition which prevented
entrance to various sites and (4) delays in project staff organi-
zation due to lack of funds and difficulties in attracting tech-
nical personnel especially at the local government level.
4.02 The Appraisal estimates; were extremely optimistic in
projecting the start of implementation by mid-1978 considering that
feasibility study preparation began in mid-1977 and the Appraisal
Report itself was finalized only in December 1978 (figure 4.1).
A more realistic projection would have been mid-1979 following loan
effectivity, which was when implementation actually started.
B. Implementation Schedule
4.03 Flexibility and timely management action on specific
problem areas have significantly contributed to the completion of
physical works in Dagat-Dagatan within a 5 1/2 year period despite
initial difficulties. The repackaging of infrastructure works into
smaller contract packages, the establishment of a Special Action
Program to speed up fund releases, the modification in the Bank to
local equity disbursement percentage for the civil works program in
1983 and the crashing of contract schedules are factors which have
contributed to this effort, considering that there were additional
works carried through the program and significant constraints brought
by the construction delays by other agencies. For the Regional Cities
component, Appraisal estimates were very optimistic projecting full
implementation for Davao in three years and only 2 1/2 years for Cebu.
As was the case in Urban T, these overly optimistic ,-ojections
resulted mainly from a lack of actual experience in the regional
cities.
4.04 Dagat-Dagatan - the key feature of Dagat-Dagatan is the
site itself, a 410 has. fish pond which constituted the largest con-
tiguous undeveloped area within urbanized Metro Manila. This 'huge
strategically located site had remained as fishponds precisely
because it was extremenly low-lying, very difficult to drain, full
of silt, and without major road access, water supply, and sanitary
drainage. Predictably, implementation in this difficult site was
delayed for a variety of reasons.

4.05 As noted in the July 1978 Feasibility Study for Dagat-
Dagatan (Llewelyn-Davies Kinhill Pty. Ltd., pg 25), "the timely
development of the project, if not its feasibility, will be dependent
upon the implementation of major infrastructure components". A major
setback during the initial implementaiton period was the deficient
reclamation undertaken by the then Bureau of Public Works which
necessitated additional bulkearthworks by NHA in 1980, after two years
of futile negotiations with BPWforittoundertake additional filling
required.
Likewise, the then Department of Public Highways (DPH) and
the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage System (MWSS) had existing
and independent programs of work for the construction of major roads,
drains, water systems, all of which were delayed in implementation
due to financial and institutional difficulties. Dagat-Dagatan's
phasing of construction was related to and dependent on the timely
implementation of 2 major circumferential roadways, C-3 and C-4 by
MPH and the permanent water supply by MWSS; these works were only
nearing completion by end of 1985.
4.06  Major drainage works were slowed by poor soil condi-
tions. Roads were delayed until reclamation was complete, and re-
designs were necessary again owing to the poor soil. MWSS water
and sewer specifications were upgraded in 1981 requiring total
redesign including the components of the initial NHA infrastructure
contract which had already been awarded. The economic crisis of
1983-1984 brought a dramatic escalation in construction costs
(See Annex I). The existing governmental contract administration
system (PD 1594'as amended) was incapable of dealing with escalations
of such magnitude and as a result seven contracts at Dagat-Dagatan
were terminated.
4.07 To complicate matters further, the Ministry of Budget
made the first release of government counterpart funds only in
June 1980, more than two years after the projected start of imple-
mentation and even then in inadequate amounts. In October 1983, the
government's disbursement ratio on contract payments was lowered
from 57% to 15% due to its failure to provide the funds as a result
of the financial crisis of 1983. A Special Action Program was ini-
tiated,setting up a revolving fund from which NHA could disburse
foreign funds instead of front ending payments and seeking reimburse-
ments later. Allocation of loan funds were revised to meet the increased
costs of civil works. The pace of implementation quickened consi-
derably to meet the revised closing date of June 1985.
4.08 To summarize, the coordinated implementation of major
infrastructure by other national agencies at Dagat-Dagatan as well
as the timely release of counterpart funds did not occur res'ilting
in.- delays in project implementation. These interagency difficul-
ties are carried over from tie Tondo/Urban I project.   As a fledging



64
government corporation, NHA was in no realistic position to attempt
to coordinate the activities of long established government ministries
which, in any event, have hundreds of other projects and competing
priorities at any given time. The evidence from Urban I and II clearly
indicates that large scale projects such as Dagat-Dagatan which rely
heavily on inputs from several agencies cannot reasonably be expected
to achieve desired implementation schedules.
4.09 Regional Cities - the less complex Regional Cities com-
ponent of the project was delayed for more mundane reasons. First,
all three Cities were reluctant to coanit significant resources to.
the project until they were certain it would materialize, a fact
which was established only in early 1979 following negotiations.
4.10 Second, land to be acquired for the project amounted to
over 108 has. spread across nine sites and involving more than 50
owners in the three cities. NHA's continuing lack of legal staff
and resources combined with the chronically slow provincial judicial
system to produce long delays in acquisition. Land owners appealed
expropriation proceedings right up to the Supreme Court, legally
barring project staff from entering sites even for geodetic surveys.
A writ of possession for the 45 ha. Davao New Matina site, for
instance, was finally secured only in December 1979, almost 1 1/2 years
after the start of implementation estimated at Appraisal.
4.11  Third, relations with prospective beneficiaries in most
upgrading sites were slow to develop. Local governments had no ex-
perience in fostering cooperative arrangements with the upgrading
area Residents who had, up until mid 1977, been the subject of erratic
relocation attempts by government since the Second World War. NHA
could offer little assistance since its community relations staff
was still heavily involved in the Tondo Project. Disastrous fires
in Macabalan (1979) and Piapi (1980) eventually broke the impasse by
providing urgent opportunities for development. As in Tondo, however,
the SAR implementation schedule clearly underestimated the amount
of time and effort, usually at night on weekends, required to elicit
community participation upon which the upgrading projects are so
heavily dependent.
4.12 Fourth, failure of government to release local counter-
part funds in significant amounts until mid-1980 caused further
delays.
4.13 Finally, there were lengthy periods when crucial cons-
truction materials, particularly asphalt and crushed aggregate, were
simply unavailable in the regional cities. Still, with the exception
of the Lapasan project in Cagayan, the regional cities component was
substantially completed in little more than five years (late 1979
to mid-1984) virtually as estimated at Appraisal.



65
C. Costs
4.14 The total cost of the Shelter component is estimated
to be P689.125 M or P214.275 M higher than the appraisal figure of
P474.850 M, an increase of 45%. This estimate is provisional since
precise costs for components constructed by certain line agencies
(for water supply and electricity, community facilities and off-site
works) and for services provided by the cities (pre-development
and some city housing office expenditures) under the SIR program were
not known and estimates were made. In addition, final land acquisi-
tion costs have not been fixed in some projects and again estimates
were made. Table 4.1 compares the costs at completion and appraisal
which are detailed by project and component in Annex III.
4.15 The figures show that the principal cost overruns relate
to reclamation P69.065M) land acquisition (P64.324 M), on-site
infrastructure P62.324 Ml and technical assistance (P39.944 M). A
further P38.337 accounts for the design and supervision cost for
which it is unclear whether or not this was included in the appraisal
estimate. The full impact of these increases was lessened to a
certain extent as a result of reductions in the costs of water supply,
sewerage and with the lowering of on-plot development standards
throughout.
4.16 Under the SIR component, the total cost of P213.163 M
(including technical assistance and small business loans) exceeded
the appraisal estimate of P142.110 M, by 50% with reclamation, land
acquisition, and off-site infrastructure costs accounting for 97%
of the total net increase. It is likely that unrealistic estimates
were made during appraisal and the problems of private land purchase
under estimated. Likewise, the apparent non-recognition of design
and supervision costs at appraisal was on- oversight.   The increase
in technical assistance costs resulted principally from the extended
period that the expatriate engineers-and advisors were needed while
the delay in construcing off-site works is thought to contribute
to the increase in costs of components constructed by MPWH. In-
creases in off-site and reclamation costs were the result of rising
prices for construction materials, as a result of rapid inflation
during the construction period and the need for additional extra -
; works unforeseen at appraisal.
4.17 Similar cost increases were evident at the City and
project level although in Cebu the cost overrun was almost twice
the percentage established in the other cities. This was the only
City where the on-site work costs significantly exceeded those
estimated at appraisal. Land.costs in Davao and Cagayan de Oro,
currently estimated at P24.3 Million and P21.7 Million, greatly
exceeded the appraisal figures of P0.2 Million and P5.3 Million
respectively. Reclamation costs in Cagayan de Oro and off-site
works in Davao too were much greater than expected.

4.18 In Dagat-Dagatan, the total cost of P475.962 M (inclu-
ding technical assistance and small business loans) exceeded the
appraisal estimate of P332.740 M by 43% with actual land acquisition
and reclamation costs accounting for 52% of the cost overrun. No
allowance was made for land cost nor was the need for additional
earthworks foreseen at appraisal. Other major cost overruns are
evident for the drainage component and for roads and footpaths.
The main reasons for the increases were the downturn in the economy,
deficiencies in the earth works originally undertaken by MPWH,
poor subsoil conditions and changes needed to the specifications for
some work items. In addition, the manmonths of technical ssistance
greatly exceeded the appraisal expectations. Savings, however, were
achieved through the lowering of on-plot provision, limiting the
disbursement of building materials and small business loans and
reducing the number of community facilities constructed (only two
elementary schools instead of the.five programmed were constructed).
4.19 The peso was devalued three times during the project
period, and comparison of Appraisal estimAtes made at P7.5 - $1
with actual costs at an average of P11 - $1 reveals a dollar savings
of 1.5% on direct costs and an increase of only 4% on total costs
including interim interest.
4.20 Despite the increases in land and reclamation costs,
NHA minimized overall increases by reducing standards and costs of
development particularly for on-plot items in Dagat-Dagatan. Succeeding
projects, particularly RCDP/Urban IV, have benefitted from the Urban II
experience and now utilize market values to more realistically esti-
mate land costs during project preparation.
4.21  Various calculations of gross development cost for the
304:8 ha. area developed under the project are shown below:
Urban II - Gross Development Costs
Total Ha. Developed: 304.8
a.  Total Allocable Cost                Gross Cost/square meter:
P326.15 M1                           P107.UU/mZ
b. Total Direct Cost
-689.12 M                             P226.09/m2
c. Cost Including Interest
P821.13 M1                           P269.10/m2
These figures are a great improvement over Urban I, in which
costs reached P620/m2 net (see Urban I PCR, p.20) and clearly indicate
NHA's greatly improved cost control mechanisms under Urban II.

D. Disbursements
Of the total loan of $27.94 M, (representing the original
loan of $26.24 M and an additional loan of $1.7 N approved in
1984) about $26.13 M or 94% was disbursed by March, 1986. Disburse-
ments were made over seven (7) years, as opposed to the appraisal
estimate of 4-years. Disbursements were slowed by government's
failure to release counterpart Oinds until mid-1980, but followed
a relatively straight line thereafter with annual disbursements
of about $5 M from 1981 through 1985.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01 The key aspects of financial perfomance relate to
cost recovery, demand and affordability, infrastructure turnover
impact on municipal finance and replicability of the national SIR
program.
A. Cost Recovery
5.02 The project aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of
city wide programs that provide services to low income groups with-
out external subsidies. The level of payments afforded by benefi-
ciaries was to be a principal determinant of appropriate standards
and financial terms. Commercial and industrial lots were proposed
to generate additional revenues. The overall cost recovery plan
was to adopt the principle that costs, normally borne by private
developers in private housing schemes, would be recovered through
the lease and sale of developed land, while those expenditures
normally ,incurred by government such as community facilities, would
be borne by the appropriate agency. On this basis, about 25%
of the project capital costs were to be recovered through local
revenues and consumer tariffs (off-site works, community facilities,
water and electricity) and were not to be included in the plot
charges.
5.03 The outcome did not meet Appraisal expectations since
P344.993 M or 50% of the overall project cost-of P689.125 M is prog-
grammed for recovery from the line agencies, the cities and the NHA.
The percentage for Dagat-Dagatan is even higher at 65% but the Regional
Cities component more closely approximated Appraisal estimates.
Although implied, but not quantified at the appraisal, the project
was expected to realize a substantial surplus principally through
commercial/industrial lot sales. On the basis of the latest estimates,
almost P435 M is projected as profit, principally from Dagat-Dagatan
(P425M). Both the residential lots and the commercial/industrial
lots are programmed to realize profits ofyPl]lM and P315 M respectively.
However in the regional cities, profits of only P9.00 M are expected but
considering the extent of the commercial/industrial development in
Davao and Cagayan de Oro, this amount should have been much higher.



69
5.04 WJhile Dagat-Dagatan is clearly expected to realize
substantial profit, the financial performance of the SIR component
is disappointing. For instance, to break evenon the basis of the
agreed cost allocation principles, P119.313 M would have to be
recovered from the sale of residential lots and a further P38.895 M
from the disposal of the commercial/industrail areas. From the sale
prices adopted only P76.951 M is to be recovered from the-residential
lots resulting in a deficit of P42.362 M (Cagayan de Oro P11.197 M;
Cebu 012.539 M and Davao P18.626 M). This deficit, however, is
planned to be offset in Davao and Cag4yan de Oro through the net
proceeds of the sales of commercial/industrial areas (estimated
to be P32.35 M in Cagayan de Oro and P19.05 M in Davao) and by the
NHA and the Cities (P4.30 M) from their own revenues. In Cebu
the loss will be made up entirely by the City since there are no'
comiercial areas for disposal.   All power and water costs, however,
are progranuned for recovery through user charges. Tables 5.1 and
5.2 summarize the costs allocated and those to be recovered according
to the major project components for each City. Annex II details
the figures at appraisal and actual.
5.05 Nevertheless, the disposal of comuercial/industrial
lots within the regional cities is well below that projected and
as of December 31, 1985,only 17,700 sq.m., hap been disposed. Some
.209,500 sq.m. or 92% of the completed remains undisposed. Although
prices were set at current market rates, most of the sales enacted
are through installment contracts from which only limited collections
(P1.38 M) have been made to date. The concept of using profits
generated from the sale of these lots clearly has still to materialize.
and although the cities and the'NHA do retain the assets, their li-
quification remains in the pipeline., Serious financial problems
are likely to occur unless these lots are disposed quickly and
revenues realized soonest. On this performance, there must be some
doubt about the actual demand for Such land in -these'areas; ade-
quate demand analyses were never undertaken and insufficient attention
has been given towards marketing. In Dagat-Dagatan efforts have
concentrated on the sale of industrial land with 78% of the completed
area disposed as of 31 December 1985. Although disposal is through
installment sales and profits will only be realized over the longer
term, total collections of P15.17 N exceed the total debit of
P11.88 M as of December 1985. The disposal of the commercial area
has been much sloe'rwith almost 296,000 sq.m. or 96% remaining
unawarded.  This is the direct result of policy decisions of NHA
to delay sales until -market conditions improve,inth6hope of realizing
higher revenue but at a later date.
5.06  Residential lot disposal, in the regional cities, too,
has lagged behind the completion of physical:works. As of December
31, 1985, approximately 36% of the 10,200 completed lots were
unawarded. More progress has been achieved in the sites and services

projects than in the slum upgrading sites. In New Matina (Davao)
and Kauswagan (Cagayan de Oro) sites and services projects 66%
and 75% of the completed lots have been awarded.    However in the
slum improvement projects, no awards had taken place iniLapasan
(Cagayan de Oro); only 18% of the lots in Pasil and Alaska (Cebu),
14% in Piapi and 3% in New Matina (Davao) and 31% in Macabalan
(Cagayan de Oro) have been disposed. Annex IV.
5.07 Collections from the residential beneficiaries and
those under the SBL and HML programs are low. As of December 31,
1985 total collection by the cities (Davao and Cebu) and NHA
(Cagayan de Oro) from the beneficiaries amounted to P6.14 Million
or 53% of-the total due with arrears standing at P5.74 Million.
Net collections for the fourth quarter of 1985 stood at 8% of the
total due in Cagayan de Oro (23% for the residential lots, 2%
for HML and 3% for SBL). Low collection rates for the same
period are evident on the residential lots in Cebu (less than 1%
of the total due) and on all SBL and HML accounts (less than 4%
of the total due). Residential lot collectionsin Davao, however,
were better at 28% of the total due.
5.08 At appraisal, it was assumed that funding for the SIR
program of the cities would be through loan, financing from NHA.
These loans would be repaid through project revenues which at that
time were estimated to be sufficient to service project debt and to
generate surpluses to finance future projects. Unfortunately, this
has not been the case. By the end of 1985, Cebu City although
virtually current in its payments to NHA were utilizing funds drawn
almost entirely from the City budget. In Cagayan, the local govern-
ment withdrew and NHA is collectinq directly from beneficiaries.
Payments from Davao and to a less extent Cebu have lagged and
total arrearages as of December 31, 1985 stood at P6.6 Million (Davao
P6.1 Million). Clearly the lack of attention paid to cost recovery
from the beneficiaries is manifested in Davao's attitude towards
payments to NHA and the City has refused to utilize its budget to
pay because of the alleged failure of NHA to complete land acquisi-
tion in a timely fashion which prevented sales.
5.09 In Dagat-Dagatan Phase ITI, 5,650 of the 8,349 resi-
dential lots h-ve been disposed as of 31 December 1985. Of these,
63 beneficiaries have paid in full. Total collections have reached
P12.21 M were P2.42 M as of December 31, 1985, more than 3 times the
monthly potential. Of the resi-commercial lots, 273 out of 1,517 were
disposed as of December 31, 1985. Collections from these accounts
have reached P2.71 M mainly through advance and down payments.
Clearly, there is still room for improvement regarding the regular
collect4ons but lot disposition on a large scale was only achieved
during the last quarter of 1985 on account of the late implementa-
tion of the main water supply by MWSS.
5.10 Cost recovery continues to be the weakest aspect of
shelter projects and, indeed, of all government projects involving
lending in the Philippines.  While problems specific to the Urban II



74
project are examined in detail in this report, it is important to
note that,no segment o-f the Philippine government is notably success-
ful in collecting dues from citizens.and that available sanctions are
seldom if ever.enforced. Numerous studies, point out that government
rarely collects more.than 50% of property taxes, business permit fees
are routinely undervalued by 200-300% and more large scale government
loan programs to small and medium business (Biyayang Dagat, KKK, etc.)
have recovered virtually nothing,of billions of pesos invested. In
short, government programs are widely viewed by politicians and
beneficiaries alike as hand'outs.
5.11  Cultural impediments-aside, there are.three major.
causes of low cost recovery:-
(i) the failure to dispose completed lots in a timely
fashion;
(ii)  the lack of "legal"'beneficiaries.from.whom to collect
particularly in the upgrading areis where many original
beneficiaries have transfered their rights for "illegal"
occupants who under presen-t regulations cannot legally
purchase the lots they occupy; and
(iii) the low sales volume in the commercial/industrial areas.
5.12 Much has been said and written about cost recovery but
little will be accomplished until the following fundamental steps
are taken:
(i)  title to land must be-acquired before sales commence;
(ii)  beneficiary selection..regulations.must be revised to
accommodate turnover;
(iii) sales documents must be executed much earlier in the
project cycle;
(iv) commercial/industrial sales must be' handled by competent.
professionals; and
(v)  sanctions must be enforced on beneficiaries whose accounts
fall into arrears.
B.      nd a   Affoabilit          -.
5.13 At appraisal, the proposed tenure-was for residential
beneficiaries to be offered a 25-year transferable lease with an



75
option to purchase the freehold interest. Subsequently, very few
lease options were entered into, since the beneficiaries preferred
and could afford to purchase on an installment basis. Initially,
Deeds of Sale with Mortgage were taken up, but these presented
their own problems. First, it was not legally possible to execute
a mortgage without title and land acquisition was still incomplete
in some project areas even after completion of construction. Second,
Philippine law requires a one year waiting period before a mortgagee
in default can be evicted. Thus, even when titles were available
the DSM was not efficient. In the end, a Conditional Contract to
Sell (CCS) was employed which did not require that title be clear
and in hand. Under this arrangement, beneficiaries only receive
the lot title upon full payment of all amounts due.
5.14 Final sales prices were higher than those estimated
at appraisal principally as a result of the increased land acqui-.
sition costs. In the regional cities, the average sale prices for
slum upgrading and sites and services lots in Cagayan de Oro projects
were computed at Pll,oU.0O0ZagainstP5,800.&P8,200 at appraisal, in
Cebu average prices of P4,900 against P3,100 at appraisal and in
Davao P5,400 for slum upgrading and P12,300 for sites against P2,600 and
p8,800 at appraisal. Nevertheless, affordability was not adversely
affected and the higher prices were offset by increasing family
incomes with benefits materializing much later than programmed
(Table 5.3).
5.15 In most slum upgrading and in New Matina sites and
services projects, within the regional cities, prices were set below
cost. Prior commitments, encouraged by the local government, to the
communities were made well in advance of knowing actual project
costs (particularly land) and these were impossible to retract.
However, in Kauswagan sites and services project (Cagayan de Oro)
prices were set without beneficiary or local government interference
resulting for once in a financially viable project. Nevertheless,
in all computations, neither interest during construction nor all
project administration costs were included.
5.16 Prices could have been somewhat higher in almost all
projects without exceeding theoretical affordability limits.
However, in the upgrading projects, beneficiaries were keenly aware
of the structures imposed by LOI 686 on cost allocation and, it was
agreed during negotiations with the Bank that prices for all projects
would be finalized and announced prior to the start of construction
at each site. This well-intentioned agreement actually resulted
in "premature" pricing of several early projects. When delays in
land acquisition forestalled initiation of cost recovery,it was
virtually impossible to amend agreed prices and interest which accrued
in the interim could not be directly recovered.



76
.17   In Dagat-Dagatan, two pricing schemes were adopted
for the ocial residential lots, one for some 1,500 censused house-
holds from Tondo under which subsidies amounting to P78.1 per square
meter were included, the other for the balance of lots disposed
-through  an open lottery., Here, the prices were set at market rates,
far higher than direct costs with "mark-ups" of between 50% and
130% depending upon lot size and locatiorv. This has not impaired
affordability since the smallest lot is afforded by households at
the 6th percentile of the mid-1985 urban income distribution in
Metro Manila, and the largest lot by households at the 44th percentile.
However, the prices are based upon costs which do not include water
supply nor sewerage.
C. Turnover
5.18 Under the SIR program, water supply, electricity,
community facilities and off site works were constructed by the con-
cerned agencies using their own funds. No turnover was therefore
needed. However, in Dagat-Dagatan, all works with the exception
of the inittal land fill were funded arid constructed by NHA. Following
the cost recovery approach adopted for Dagat-Dagatan wherein expenses
nomally incurred by Government Agencies in support of private
agencies, 65% of the total development cost for Phase III is allo-
cable to line agencies and local governments although paid for by
NHA.
5.19 The handover of roads and other public works to MPWH
has been significant with 100% of those in Phase III turned over
as of December 31, 1985. Five (5) Deeds of Transfer (DOT) affecting
Tondo Foreshore and Dagat-Dagatan projects have been signed in a
span of 5 months with the first signed in 5 March 1985 and the-last
in 18 July 1985. Total value of works turned over for operation and
maintenance amounts to P200.061 M for Phase III. However, no firm
agreements have been reached to reimburse the expenditures funded
through loans and NHA equity.
5.20 The turnover of water and sewer lines inclusive of the
SewageTreatment works to MWSS has not yet been effFted but nego-
tiations are progressing and agreements are almost on hand. The
total cost allocated to MWSS for Phase III is P83.63% or 28% of the
total cost chargeable to line agencies.
5.21 While the turnover of community facilities to the-local
government has progressed, there is little likelihood of their
reimbursement of the expenditures incurred. A loss to the project
is contemplated. Taken overall some P300 million for Dagat-Dagatan
Phase III remains to be reimbursed or assumed by the line agencies
and local governments. Unless this is achieved, the estimated profit
will be reduced substantially from P425 million to P126 million.



77
D.  Impact on Municipal Finance
5.22 The projects were designed to promote local economic
activity principally through the development of serviced commercial/
industrial land and were excepted to expand the local tax base.
It is likely that actual revenues realized are extremely low and
are not sufficient to cover the cost of routine services that the
cities and the municipalities normally perfonm. In reality, these
services are not being undertaken and without satisfactory main-
tenance, the improvements will soon deteriorate.
5.23 In Dagat-Dagatan, NHA is maintaining the completed
infrastructure using its own resources. In the regions, SIR projects
generally receive the same minimal maintenance that the local
governments provide throughout the country. Improvement should
be forthcoming in Davao and Cagayan as a result of RCDP/Urban IV
equipment acquisition and training activities. However, local
governments continue to budget scant resources for maintenance
almost entirely on a political basis with very little activity*
occuring unless elections are imninent.
5.24  Since collections from beneficiaries in the regional
cities are low, the local government will need to commit funds
from other revenue sources to repay NHA. All in all the improve-
ments expected to the City finances remain a long way off.
E. Replicability of the National SIR
5.25 To date, the program in the regional cities has not
proven its viability, since current revenues are not enough to
service the debt burden. No surplus has been built up such that
the second phase of the program in Davao and Cagayan de Oro (also
under a World Bank loan - the Regional Cities Development Project)
and in Cebu require a total infusion of new capital. The oppor-
tunities to generate capital from the profits of the sale of
commercial/industrial land has been abandoned since these revenues
are now needed to subsidize the loss resulting from the approved
sale prices of the residential lots.
5.26 Many financial benefits proposed under SIR program
have been lost because of the long delay in realizing revenues
resulting in the steady erosion of capital invested through low
pricing and poor collections. Much of the blame must be attributed
to institutional arrangements which placed an undue work load on
the local governments regarding cost recovery. Such politically
inspired agencies cannot under the present circumstances be expected
to effectively implement a just and equitable cost recovery program.
Changes are now proposed for future projects in the regions to reduce
the role of local governments in program implementation and to shift
the financial burden to other more appropriate agencies.

5.27 On the other hand, in Dagat-Dagatan, initial computa-
tions show a replicable program, although, the policy of disposing
commercial/industrial lots, through installment   sales, means repli-
cability in the longer tenm and not as assumed at appraisal over the
short temn. However the lack of progress regarding the reimbursement
of expenditures made on behalf of other agencies is likely to reduce
profits significantly to the detriment of the much needed growth of
NHA capital.
E. Summary and Lessons
5.28 Pricing - the lack of consistency in the application
of a finm pricing olicy in the regional cities, often as a result
of pressure from the communities and local politicians, has jeopar-
dized the concept of full cost recovery. Too often prices were
established on the basis of estimates which did not include real
costs. In Dagat-Dagatan, on the other hind prices largely were set
at market rates without impairing affordability. This approach must
be applauded and shows the way forward for future projects.
5.29  Reimbursement - significant expenditures were incurred,
particularly in Dagat-Dagatan, on behalf of other agencies with
little or no attempt at the outset to ensure their recovery. There
are still no finm agreements for the reimbursement and/or the assump-
tion of liabilities by concerned agencies for these expenditures
amounting to P297 million.
Despite legal requirements and agreements, NHA continues to
experience difficulties in collecting payments from other agencies.
NHA had very little recourse in this instance other than to negotiate,
cajole, and wait. Future projects should require that specific
budgetary provisions be made: (1) from the national budget for com-
ponents allocated to MPWH, MWSS, and 2) as statutory items in local
government budgets providing a continuing basis for repayment of
laon obligations. Statutory appropriations in local budjets are an
established practice and should be clear requirements in any future
subsidiary loan agreements.
5.30 Profits - these have still to materialize to the
extent projected at appraisal as a result of the policy to sell lots
on credit and the deliys in disposing lots principally in the regional
cities. Policies regarding the development and marketing of commer-
ciallindustrial land must be improved. The slow rate of disposal
of these areas are clear indications of insufficient attention being
given towards market demand analysis and the lack of an aggressive
marketing strategy. Credit sales in Dagat-Dagatan and the suspension
of sales in the commercial areas, mean that revenues will only be
realized in the longer term. This must bring into question the
wisdom of incorporating large scale commercial/industrial develop-
ments in the projects. The reliance on profits expected to be



80
realized must be downgraded, unless it can be demonstrated that there
is a real demand and that profits can be realized quickly through
cash sales with credit sales the exception rather,than-the'rule.
5.31  Residential lot disposal - lot awarding has been slow
and documentation not efficient.   Admittedly, problems over land
titles has been a major factor, but no attempt was made earlier to
seek alternative tenure arrangements. Still some 54% of all resi-
dential lots remain unawarded overalls-(32% in Dagat-Dagatan and
72% in the SIR projects).
In future residential lot disposil, documentation and the
start of collections must be speeded up. Land should not be developed-
unless NHA has a clean title. Lot awards should closely follow or
even predate the completion of development and collections should
start immediately upon lot award.
5.32 Collections - no real attempt at collecting dues from
beneficiaries has been made in the regional cities.   People have
been allowed to remain on lots without paying, no serious effort
has been made to enforce'sanctions and starting dates for compulsory
collections have been continuously'put forward. The collection effort
in Dagat-Dagatan, has' suffered from the:Effects of strong community
pressure groups exerting political influence whenever NHA attempted
to enforce sanctions on beneficiaries and the operation of.a fully
computerized billing and coll.ection system has suffered numbrous
technical setbacks.  It will now prove to be a difficult task to
bring collections up to an acceptable level. -A vigorous enforcement
of sanctions on erring beneficiaries by NHA however remains in words,
and not deeds.  The Cities-show even less will to enforce collections
and it must be concluded that the.local governments are too politically
involved-to sustain a'continous collective drive. In the future
alternative arrangements must be explored.



VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
A.   National Housing Authority
6.01 The project represented a large step forward for NHA
in terms of establishing its position as the country's dominant
housing institution. The national mandate provided by LOI's 555,
557, and 686 represented both an affirmation of NHA's new central
role in the country's urban development efforts as well asi,a major
challenge to the young institution's ability to move aggressively
beyond the confines of Metro Manila. The project also required
that NHA rapidly improve its capacity to manage the projects it
built. The Appraisal Report clearly noted that a major project
risk was continuing skepticism among some government officials
concerning the project's low development standards and uncertain
prospects for cost recovery (SAR, pg.44). No sooner was the
project underway in 1979 that the newly fonmed Ministry of Human
Settlements (MHS) attempted to merge NHA with its subsidiary
corporation involved in financing middle and upper income completed
units. NHA managed to emerge from this in tact, but competition
for funds increased and relations with MHS were strained at best.
6.02 The National Program - while the Dagat-Dagatan compo-
nent of the project accounted for more than two-thirds of total
cost, it was basically a technical challenge with limited signi-
ficance in terms of NHA!s overall institutional development. Of
greater importance was the effort to initiate a truly national low-
cost housing program through the Regional Cities Component. Prior
to the project NHA had very limited operations outside Manila, and
a new Regional Peoject Department (RPD) was created in 1979.
RPD's initial organization was very much oriented to the task of
assisting local governments in the technical aspects of-project
planning and construction.
6.03 The process of establishing working relations with local
government was delicate and based largely upon direct negotiations
between NHA's General Manager and the City Mayors. The project's
attempt to link local governments to a centralized national agency
was a marked innovation, effectively allowing NHA to harness local
resources while avoiding the overhead expenses of establishing
its own regional offices. In addition, the cities entered into
subsidiary loan agreements with NHA, assuming responsibility for
repayment to NHA of project investments at 10% interest over 25
years. In short, the project's attempt to establish a national
program outside Manila was heavily dependent upon the participation
of local governments.



82
6.04 By late 1979, all three reglonl cities had approved
subsidiary loan agreements with NHA and ambarkedl upen itiitial upgrading
projects. Progress was quite good until the local elections of
April 1980 which brought in new mayors in all three cities. Long delays
were encountered due to skepticism on the part of new city executives.
Local staff turnover as a result of patronage appointments was prevalent
and a major impediment. The City of Cagayan withdrew from the project
altogether and lIHA was forced to take over.
6.05 Meanwhile, NHA's attention shifted back to Manila were
Urban III/ZIP project preparation was well advanced. The initial
momentum in the Regional Cities was irrevocably lost and RPD was left
to cope as well as it could. RPD succeeded very well considering
its logistical problems and limited resources and the Regional Cities
component of the project was successfully constructed. However, NHA
did not succeed in forging the solid institutional linkages between
central and local governments so critical to the project's attempt
to establish a national program.
6.06 Organization - NIHA underwent two major reorganizations
during the project period, in 1978 and 1981. The main feature of
the 1981 reorganization was the creation of the Financial Services
Group with a much clearer delineation of basic functions. However,
little was accomplished with regard to decentralizing critical support
and post-implementation functions. While Manila projects can be
effectively serviced under the 1981 structure, the dispersed regional
projects still receive limited and sporadic support especially with
regard to legal problems, estate management and cost recovery, and
marketing of commercial/industrial areas. Table 6.1.
6.07 The problem of NHA's organizational bias towards Manila
will be exacerbated when the P400 M shelter component of Urban IV/
RCDP is completed in 1989. By that time, more than P600 M will have
been invested in six regional cities under Urban II and IV alone.
The rapid expansion of NHA's national program will soon outstrip the
limited resources devoted to the implementation of regional projects.
NHA's continuing role in the attempt to establish a national low-cost
shelter program will be decided in large part by the way in which it
meets the demands for decentralization and regional organization.
6.08 financial Performance - NHA's financial perfomance has
improve somewhat in recent years. A genuine awareness of and commit-
ment to cost recovery has emerged particularly as internally generated
corporate revenues have assumed an increasingly important role in
continuing operations. Still, as discussed in Section V of this
report, inadequate progress has been made in removing basic impedi-
ments to recovery of costs. At least five different departments
within NHA are involved in the process of acquiring and subdividing
titles, selecting beneficiaries, making awards and executing sales
documents, marketing C/I areas, and actually collecting payments in

any given project. Until this interrelated process is recognized
and dealt within a more unified manner, financial perfonmance will
continue to suffer.
B. Local Governments
6.09 As briefly discussed in the previous section, local
government played a major role in the project's Regional Cities
component. The project constituted a major change for local govern-
ments by requiring the following innovations:
a. Achievement, virtually overnight, of a political
consensus that relocation policies directed at
squatters for more than thirty years were wrong;
b. Acceptance, particularly in Davao and Cagayan, of
easily the largest single debt in the cities
histories;
c. Organization, virtually from scratch, of project
staffs requiring scarce technical skills capable
of dealing with a highly complex engineering and
administrative task, yet willing to work for lower
wages than prescribed by national government;
d. Expropriation of valuable properties in central
city locations from locally influential owners;
e. Acceptance of long-temn involvement into local
affairs by both national government and a variety
of foreigners;
f. Construction of the largest civil works projects
in the cities' histories entirely outside of the
established city engineering organization; and
g. Commitment of each city as a whole to a twenty-
five year debt on behalf of a little understood
low-income population, many of whom were already
technically guilty of breaking the law by squatting.
6.10 The enormity of the changes to be wrought in local govern-
ment were probably not appreciated at the project's outset. NHA was,
initially, not in a position to offer much assistance due to its own
extremely limited manpower. Expatriate advisors could assist on
technical aspects, but were not equipped nor employed to deal with
the complexities of creating new institutions withih the conservative,
insular local government systems.



85
6.11 It is surprising, therefore, that the regional cities
governments responded as well as they did to the project. As noted
above, all three cities had created project teams, entered into
project loan agreements, and begun initial construction by 1979, the
year of loan effectiveness. But the local elections led to new admi-
nistrations in all three cities.
6.12 In Cagayan, the new mayor had grave reservations about
the project loan agreement and, eventually, withdrew the city alto-
gether, While relations with the Cebu administration were congenial,
a fully staffed and equipped project team never completely jelled.
The city seemed always to look upon the project as-a politically
expedient but losing proposition, and loan payments to NHA are, to
date, financed almost entirely from the general city budget.
In Davao, a penmanent City Housing Office was created and it
functioned reasonably well. But a true political consensus in
support of the project never formed.
6.13 As a result, NHA was in 1985 seriously considering assuming
direct control of all regional cities projects under Urban II and IV.
Details of this plan were being worked out when the national adminis-
tration changed.
6.14  The fundamental issue remains, however, are local govern-
ments,the appropriate lead agencies for regional cities development
programs? If they are not, as some would argue, then two major insti-
tutional alternatives suggest themselves:
a. NHA could assume direct control of regional project
design, implementation, and administration as it
has done for all Metro Manila projects. It effect,
NHA would have to fully regionalize its operations
as have major ministries of government. This would
require a substantial reorganization of NHA's
highly centralized structure and a substantial
increase in operating costs. In the current Phil-
ippine environment it does not seem likely that
sufficient funds would be available for such an
expansion.
b. As advocated by the Mayors of several regional
cities semi-autonomous local housing authorities
similar to the;existing local water districts could
be established. Under this alternative, NHA would
directly administer Manila projects (as does MWSS)
while local housing authorities with their own
corporate identities would assume the functions now
assigned to local governments. The principle
advantages of autonomous local housing authorities
would be insulation from city political influences
and the ability to attract and-retain qualified



86
staff due to higher allowable salaries and benefits.
The principle constraint, as in the case of NHA
regionalization, is lack of funds.
6.15 Clearly, the expansion of shelter projects outside Metro-
Manila cannot continue until this major issue is resolved. The role
of local governments is the single most important variable in the
continuing effort to establish a truly national shelter program in
the Philippines.
C.  Interagency Coordination
6.19 As in N1rban I, the project suffered numerous difficul-
ties in coordination between NHA and, notably, the flinistry of PLblic
Works and Highways (MPWH) and the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage
System (MWSS).
6.20 In Dagat-Dagatan, the then Bureau of Public Works could
not fill the project site to.agreed levels. NHA was forced to
contract additional earthworks in excess of one million cubic meters
(in addition to removing large amounts of unsuitable fill materials)
the costs of which were unforeseen at Appraisal.  Likewise, the late
implementation of two major roadways, C-3, C-4, by MPWH resulted to
additional costs by NHA in the construction of lengthy access roads
leading to the different phases of the project.
6.21 However, MPWH has been cooperative with regard to accepting
almost P200 M worth of Dagat-Dagatan infrastructure for wliich it is
responsible by law for maintenance purposes.
6.22 MWSS upgraded their water and sewer specifications in
1981 affecting the implementation of awarded infrastructure contracts.
Modifications in the specifications initially escalated contract
costs and resulted in delays. This move by MWSS however, had its
positive effect over the-long term period in terms of a more effective
system and.relatively reduced maintenance costs.
6.23 After lengthy negotiations, the MWSS, by mid-1986, had
still to accept the physical transfer of the water and sewer systems
at Dagat-Dagatan for operation and maintenance purposes. Agreement
on the assumption of financial obligations also has still to be
finalized.
6.24 In the regional cities, other government infrastructure
agencies had much smaller roles in the project. MPWH has not ful-
filled its commitment* regarding community facilities in any of the
cities. This aspect of the project was-extensively studied during
preparation and appraisal ,but has now been more or less abandoned
to the whims of the MPWH budgeting system. Coordination with the



87
Ministry's regional offices has proved futile since all budgetary
matters are settled in Manila.
6.25  In summary, interagency involvement was not ideal.   In
future, NHA should 'not construct or finance any items which are the
responsibilities of other agencies unless funds are available feom
the appropriate budget, and this condition should be made a loan
covenant.
6.26 Attempts to coordinate with non-infrastructure agencies
were also largely futile. Government banks and small business
advisory agencies of the Ministry of Trade and Industry never became
involved in the business loan component as expected at Appraisal.
The Ministry of Social Services Development (MSSD) was helpful in
Dagat-Dagatan but not in the regional cities. UNICEF input to the
project amounted to little more than occasional seminars and acqui-
sition of some equipment. The experience with UNICEF was particu-
larly frustrating, and under RCDP/Urban IV the project Wams have
despaired of ever meeting the constantly changing UNICEF requirements
for project proposals.
D. Consultants
6.27  The project included a large technical assistance component
aimed primarily at improving construction supervision and fostering
the institutional development of NHA and local governments.
6.28 Construction supervision did improve and the general
quality of works under the project was acceptable. Numerous and
costly technical difficulties which arose at Dagat-Dagatan, however,
were unforeseen at Appraisal, calling into question the feasibility
study for that project which was prepared almost entirely by consultants
and upon which the Appraisal was largely based.
6.29 Attempts to strengthen NHA technically were notably
successful.. NHA's sharp distinction between Bank-assisted and in-house.
projects severely limited the extent to which broad changes could be
assisted by advisors whose inputs were limited to the Urban II projects.
6.30 Construction of the regional cities component were greatly
adied by resident planning and engineering advisors. Future advisory
inputs in the regions should place greater emphasis on the gridual
and difficult process of developing local capacity to manage
programs during and after implementation.



88
E. The Bank
6.31 Appraisal of the project was thorough although somewhat
optimistic and the groundwork was well laid for the following
Urban III and IV loans.
6.32 Several features of Bank performance throughout the
project period are noteworthy as lessons for the future:
a. Staff Turnover - membership of supervisory mission
after 1979 was unstable. As mission membership
changed emphasis on different project aspects also
varied causing a good deal of confusion among local
staff and advisors.
b. Technical Bias - during the crucial project imple-
mentation years (1980-84) mission supervision con-
centrated almost exclusively upon civil works
difficulties mainly in Dagat-Dagatan. Although
mission members regularly called for increased
emphasis on cost recovery, little substantive
advice was ever given until late in the project
which engendered a cynical attitude on the part
of local staff.
c.  Multiplicity of Functions - from 1981 onward the
regional. 'cities component went virtually unsuper-
vised by the Bank due mainly to competing responsi-
bilities in preparing Urban IV and the Central
Visayas projects. Learning from the problems of
ongoing projects was therefore minimized. Further,
the main Bank emphasis upon preparation of new
projects was reflected in the orientation of local
staff resulting in negligence of the ongoing
project. Local staff resources were stretched very
thin, and to some degree the Bank must accept
responsibility for the inevitable lack of attention
to Urban II which resulted.

VII. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
7.01 The project was designed to have "a substantial influence
on the government's approach to urban shelter and infrastructure".
Significant equalization of access to basic public infrastructure in
key urban areas was targetto!d through the provision of services to low
income and squatter families and the regularization of tenure on the
basis of a substantially self liquidating project.
7.02 In order to justify the project economically a standard
cost-benefit evaluation was undertaken at appraisal. This exercise
has been rerun with the completion of project using a methodology
which follows the same principles adopted by the World Bank for the
Appraisal Report, and under which net project benefits are computed and
discounted to arrive at an economic rate of return for each component.
7.03 The measurement of net economic benefits for the project
is based upon the increases in property values brought about by the
provision of infrastructure and other services and through the develop-
ment of serviced, residential, commercial and industrial sites. Other
benefits which have certainly resulted, including direct and indirect
employment generated as a result of project implementation, improved
health and better education facilities and an improved environment
cannot be quantified directly. Increases in property values therefore
have been taken to represent a composite measure of the value of improve-
ments undertaken. In addition specific benefits in the form of room
rentals have been included for the house construction and improvement
which resulted from the implementation of the building loans program.
7.04 Land values were established from actual records of land
sales within or near to the project areas. They reflect market values
as of 1985 for residential, commercial and industrial lands in Dagat-
Dagatan and the Regional Cities. The market land values were converted
into annual rental values according to the prevailing economic terms
for rent. Room rentals were established from actual rates prevailing
within the project areas and reduced to allow for land rent already.
included in the assessment of land values. Project life was estimated
to be 25 years from the final completion of the project in 1985 although
the benefits for residentail land in the upgrading sites were assumed
to be realized in accordance with the disbursement-of civil works
expenditures, while the benefits of the commercial/industrial areas and
the residential lots in the sites and services projects were assumed
to match actual and projected disposal.
7.05 Project costs which represent those actually occuring
(or estimates where no firm date was available) were converted to
mid-1985 prices. Phasing of costs matched those expended with the
exception of land which were assumed during the first year of project
implementation. For all project sites within the regional cities, the
cost of land was its opportunity cost reflecting the best estimate of



real market value prior to development. In Dagat-Dagatan the oppor-
tunity cost of land was taken as the difference between the value of
unserviced land and the cost of fill and reclamation needed to trans-
form the site into developable land.
7.06 The financial costs for all civil works, design and
supervision and technical assistance were extrated from accounting
records' of actual expenditures, although estimates were made regarding
the cost of some components constructed by other agencies. These costs
were adjusted to economic costs as follows:
a. To 1985 prices using accepted price inflators;
b. estimated taxes were deducted;
c. shadow pricing was undertaken for foreign costs
(1.2) and unskilled labour (0.8) in accordance
with NEDA practice; and
d. additional costs were included for Dagat-Dagatan
to reflect land fill undertaken by the MPWH and
apportioned expenditures of facilities and works
constructed outside Dagat-Dagatan Phase III but
partially serving that area.
Maintenance and operating costs were established on the basis of a
formula relating to capital outlays, while the cost of collections
were based on estimates of collectibles.
7.07 The economic rates of return for the project and its
components compared to those at appraisal are shown in Table 7.1.
The rates of return are for Dagat-Dagatan below those of appraisal,
however, for the SIR program, with the exception of the slum improve-
ment component, they are near to or above the appraisal figures.
Nevertheless, the overall project return of 19% is below the expected
34% at appraisal, because:
a. additional costs items were uncurred, particularly
land reclamation and fill in Dagat-Dagatan;
b. the project took more time to complete: than originaliy
planned resulting in higher costs (principally as a result
of inflation) and a corresponding reductfon and delay in
the realization of benefits;
c.  the disposal of marketable land, particularly the commercial
and industrial areas, has been delayed; and
d. the benefits computed at appraisal (particularly land
values) were probably too optimistic.



91
7.08 As usual, this type of analysis does not capture very
significant additional project benefits including increased employment,
improved education, reduction of property losses due to fire and floods,
and improvements in health and general productivity. One study in the
main Davao upgrading area, for instance, showed that:
a. incidence of serious gastrointestinal diseases was
reduced from 60% to less than 10% of the project
population following implementation;
b. infant mortality rates, three times the national
average before upgrading, fell to slightly above
that average by 1984;
c. Only 9% of children aged 0-6 (61 out of a sample of
703) were suffering some degree of malnutrition
in 1984 versus more than 80% prior to the project.
VIII. Conclusions
A. Achievement of Objectives
8.01 The project succeeded to varying degrees in achieving its
stated objectives (SAR, pg. 8). Improvements in sanitation and basic
infrastructure were dramatic in upgrading areas and more than 11,000
new residential lots were developed through the sites and services
program.
8.02 Regularization of land tenure was less successful and sales
of more than 60% of residential lots are not complete. Delays in land
acquisition hindered the project and land costs increased dramatically
over Appraisal estimates.
8.03 Promotion of employment through commercial/industrial
development and small business loans was also less successful than
anticipated. A large percentage of commercial land remains unsold.
The small business loans program did not reach its intended scale due to
withdrawal of government banks but despite a variety of administrative
difficulties, a large number of new jobs were created in project areas
and NHA remains committed to the program.
8.04 Efforts to assist institutional development were notably
successful in the case of NHA, less so with regard to local governments.
NHA's financial management capacity improved greatly although actual
recovery of costs is still inadequate. Efforts to develop lasting
institutional capabilities-at the local government level were successful
in only one of the three project cities. The role of local governments
in future projects remains a major question mark with critical impli-
cations for the national shelter program.



92
8.05 In general, the basic approach of upgrading and serviced
sites development is now well accepted within the country and NHA has
demonstrated a substantial production capacity. However, further .
enhancement on the "soft-ware" aspects of project implementation and
management can be achieved by the experience learned from this program.
B. Loan Covenants
8.06 With several notible exceptions covenants of the loan were
generally fulfilled. Annex 5 summarizes compliance with covenants.
C. Lessons
8.07 A number of lessons should be drawn from the Second Urban
project for application in future undertakings:
a.  Decentralization and Regional Orenization- the expansion
of the national shelter program cannot reasonably proceed
until the role of local governments is determined. Full
regionalization of NHA's operations may simply be too
expensive given the current economic difficulties in the
country. If local governments are to continue as NHA's
development partners then much tighter on-lending terms
must be embodied in loan agreements, including statutory
city budget appropriations sufficient to service repayments
to NHA.
b.  Interagency Coordination - The interagency approach can
only be successful when the roles and scope of agency
participation are clearly defined and agreed upon through
formal covenants during project design. The aggressiveness
of NHA to perform and comply with its commitment to the
World Bank led to implementation of works normally under-
taken by other agencies, later proving to be detrimental to
its recovery program. NHA. should not in the future finance
projects in this manner, unless specific loan covenants have
been formally agreed and release of funds are through separate
budgetary releases.
Future projects should likewise consider execution
of works by other agencies themselves with assurances of
a timely delivery in the implementation of its component
in the context of the overall program.
c. Land Acquisition - the toal unreliability of judicial
expropriation as a method of acquiring land-has left no
recourse but negotiated purchase, as is now the NHA practice.
This method of acquisition is, however, also unsatisfactory
in that Government is subject to the capricious whims of
landowners in the negotiation process. An equitable and
simplified method by which Government can acquire land for
public use is urgently needed.



93
d. Commercial/Industrial Areas and Gross Subsidies - C/I area
de-velopment under future projects should not be simply
eliminated as the result of unsatisfactory experience in
Urban I and II. Rather, NHA must be encouraged to :
(1) improve market studies in the preparation phase to
avoid over supply; (2) employ competent professionals to
undertake sales and assist in establishing realistic pricing
structures; and (3) maximize integrated development as was
the case in the Urban II and IV overlap in the Davao C/I area.
e. Beneficiary Selection - A critical step in the cost recovery
process is beneficiary selection.. ,Current procedures in NIA
are too combersome. It is unreasonable to expectthat lOOX of
original beneficiaries in any project will remain there for-
ever. Turnover in both serviced site and upgrading areas
has been established at about 20% by NHA surveys (see Urban I
PCR Annex 1) and may run as high as 40% in some sites. A
formal procedure exists for NHA to approve a new occupant,.
but still is too cumbersome to keep pace with informal real
estate transactions in these areas. A realistic system must
be established by which "right" to lots may.be transferred
to new residents, and NHA's inability to police resales does
not obstruct its ability to complete the mortgage origination
document and thus begin collections.
f. Land Use - The utilization of reclaimed land forlow-cost
- sites and services projec,ts should be reviewed considering
Dagat-Dagatan's experience in incurring substantial cost
increases due to necessary works on soil stabilization. The
net economic benefit has been lower than anticipated in the
Appraisal due to this unforseen expenditure.
j.  Technical Assistance - The validity of over extended technical
assistance by expatriate consultants is raised from the point
of view of harnessing self-confidence and reliance on local
technocrats. The country should move towards encouraging
experienced professionals to form local consultancy groups
to programs/projects.
9. Project Acceptance - NHA should engage in a more agressive
information campaign prior.to project implementation to gain
wider acceptance to its programs from beneficiaries and local
government officials. A comprehensive knowledge of govern-
ment's honest effort and involvement to uplift their standard
of living should result in. better cooperation and confidence
in accepting their financial obligations accruing from the
housing benefits received by them.



94
h. Documentation and Lot Award - there should be flexibility and
foresight in adfressig theF problems of documentation and
award of lots pertinent to the situation at hand.
Due to the tedious process of expropriation which has
led to NHA's inability to secure and consolidate land titles
in some of its project-sites, a change in documentation was
only conceived in mi4-1984 leading to time lags in the
recording of sales reports since the effectivity of sales
was related to the signing of contract documents. The
reorientation period for the community to-accept this change
took some time and raised skepticism on the-honest intentions
of NHA.
i. Project Scope - Dagat-Dagatan is geographically well situated
wherein'the problems of housing can be addressed to, being
in the midst of a highly populated area and where housfing.
conditions were at their worst. Reclamation and the sub-
sequent additional filling have resulted in its beir, at a
most advantageous elevation when compared to the surrounding
low-lying flood-prone built-up-area.
Although the occurence of flooding in the regional area
has been found by MPWH as being a result of natural phenomena
(a marked increase in the sea and tide'levels) the unpopularity
of the project expressed by the nearby population has not
diminished on account of the disparity in the level of develop-
ment and attention of government between the project and the
surrounding areas.
Government should, in the future, consider development of-
a particular site, not in isolation, but together with-a
parallel program for development of the surrounding contiguous
area, where solutions to issues/problems in the region are
related to a wider field of application.
j.  Pricing - In most slum upgrading projects, initial lot prices
are presented to the communities in order to gauge public
acceptance to proposed developments. However, this approxi-
mation is perceived as final by the community and. difficul-
ties in collection have been experienced when-higher lot charges
are imposed based on actual'development costs. Prior commit-
ments by local government officials in this regard, have like-
wise pressured NHA to revert back to the predetermined cost.
In this respect, where pricing policies have been estab-
lished and have gained popular acceptanc'e, it is imperative.
to undertake cost control measures to peg final development
costs to committed charges.  Development standards should
be reassessed and mQdified during implement4tion whenever
necessary.
Cost recovery programs in low-cost fhousing can only
be successful if supported by the target beneficiaries.-

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PHILIPPINES
MANILA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 12ZZT/1282-1-PH)
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Sectoral Context
1.01      The Metropolitan Manila Area (MMA) had an estimated population in
1975 of 5.5 million (132 of the national total), with an average annual growth
of S2. Projected at that rate of growth, greater Manila would have 23 million
people by the end of the century (302 of the Philippines' total population and
652 of its urban population). The reasons for locating the Bank's first
Philippines' urban project in the capitol city were compelling.  The MM had
severe deficiencies in shelter, water supply, health and nutrition, public
transport and institutional capabilities. Approximately half of the
substandard dwelling units in the Philippines were in the MEA, and this meant
about 1.8 million persons living on unserviced lots with inadequate sanitation
facilities and health services, compounded by flooding and stagnant water.
Incidences of typhoid, cholera and other gastro-intestinal infections and
malnutrition had been rising noticeably since 1968.
1.02      The MKA had a larger area (870 km2), a larger population base and a
faster annual population growth rate than other urban areas in the Philip-
pines. It also had a higher unemployment rate than the national average (112
in Manila compared to 7X nationally in 1971) and by far the worst housing con-
ditions in the country. While the proportion of the urban poor was about the
same in Manila as in other urban areas, Manila's poor was the largest concen-
trated poverty group in the Philippines.
1.03      Informal sector employment currently provides about 282 of Manila's
total - a relatively large proportion. One major reason for this is that from
1970 to 1980 real wages for both skilled and unskilled workers in Metro Manila
declined sharply to half their 1970 levels. Poverty would have therefore
increased, but families have supplemented formal earnings through increased
participation in the formal labor force as well as through private entrepre-
neurial activities. As a result, total household income actually rose (para
5.11) and evidence suggests poverty may have declined.
1.04      In transportation MMA was experiencing major problems.  Chronic
congestion had become a common condition because of population growth and
rapid growth in the number of private passenger vehicles.i In 1975, the HMA
had about 325,000, or 422 of a'l'l motor vehicles registered in the Philippines,
of which 70X were private passenger vehicles. The situation was exacerbated
by the inefficient use of existing road capacity. Public transportation was
mostly provided by the private sector, which had been reducing investments in
vehicle maintenance and fleet renewal because of deteriorating financial
conditions and uncertainty about Government policy.
1.05      Many of these problems were aggravated by the organization of local
governments in the MMA which was not conducive to effective metropolitan-wide
planning or administration. Municipal government was fragmented into 32
jurisdictions. However, in November 1975, the Metropolitan Manila Commission
(MMC) was established to control and coordinate 17 of these jurisdictions
including the four cities of Manila, Quezon City, Pasay and Caloocan.

1.06      The only previous Bank operation in an urban sub-sector (water) had
been a loan to the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority (NAWASA) in 1964
to expand and improve the water supply system serving Manila. Project
execution was slow and the financial cc7epants were not observed. That
project was comploted after considerabl delays in 1972.    In the eorly 1970s,
with guidance from USAID, the Covernuez: made progress in organizing the water
sector, dissolving NAWASA and creating :he Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewer-
age System (HWSS), which was responsibl* for water supply and sewerage in the
Manila area, and the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) for the
provincial cities. Four subsequent loans have been made for expanding
provincial water supply (Loans 1415 *nc 1710/Credit 920), and for Manila Water
Supply (Loan 1615) and Sewerage (Loan S19#).
S. Conditions Legsing to the Project
1.07      The largest slum in Metropoli:an Kanila and one of the largest and
most politically active in Asia was the Tondo Foreshore, the upgrading of
which was the centerpiece of this firsR urban project. It covered almost
180 ha and had a population of 180,000 persons (27,700 families in 17,500
structures). Median family income was about US$575 per year, about 602 of
median income in the KMA. Tondo's level of environmental sanitation was very
low because of the high population density, inadequate water and sewerage
facilities and poor drainage. Infant nortality was about 130 per 1,000 live
births per year, 802 of pre-school chi:dren were undernourished, and 301 of
the adult female population suffered from anemia. In 1974, there were about
500 hospital admissions for cholera in Tondo and 707 deaths attributed to
tuberculosis. Covernment's response t: the problem of slum and squatter areas
had been a series of ad hoc projects generally involving relocation to distant
areas with few employment opportunities and inadequate services, especially
transportation which was beyond the fi.ancial capabilities of the relocated
population.  The inherent defects of this approach led to the conception of
in-situ upgrading as an alternative/conplement to resettlement.

II. PROJECT IDEMTIFICATION, PREPARATION, AND APPRAISAL
A. Origin and Background
2.01      The project was first mentic:ed in the Dank's files in August 1972,
and in October/November of that year az urban sector mission visited Manila.
Project identification involved the re-iew of a long list of major infra-
structure projects. The Tondo Foreshc?q upgrading was selected as the point
of concentration because of its size a:d critical importance and also to
demonstrate an alternative to covernme:t's expensive and ineffective slum



105
relocation policies.  The 1974 aerial photo survey of the Tondo Foreshore
served as the basis for a feasibility study carried out by a Covernment task
force on housing and urbsn development established under the Office of the
President with technical personnel from several agencies. In July 1974, a
socio-economic and physical survey was undertaken which detailed the squalid
conditions of Tondo. By October, the Tondo Foreshore/Dagat Dagatan
Development Authority (TFDDA) was established under Presidential Decree (PD)
No. 570 to implemnt a comprehensive development plan for Tondo, including a
nearby self-sustaining resettlement site (Dagat-Dagatan). With the formal
creation of the National Housing Authority,(NHA) in 1975 to consolidate the
various offices and six agencies which were then responsibl* for housing and
resettlement issues, the TFDDA was absorbed into the newly organised agency
and was renamed Tondo Foreshore and Dagat-Dagatan Development Office (TFDDO).
2.02      The ensuing Project was the first effort at comprehensive slum
upgrading and sites and services by the Philippine Government and the first
upgrading project of the newly created NHA. It was also one of the first such
projects financed by the Bank. The upgrading approach included both in-situ
improvement and resettlement of families displaced by project works as well as
other public works noted below in para. 2.03. The relocatign site was Dagat-
Dagatan, a 400 ha site of reclaimed fishpondsA three kilometers away from the
upgrading area. Because this was an entirely new approach for Government, as
well as for the Bank, trial and error helped to identify areas of weakness
elaborated on in other sections of this report. Arrangements were made for
MWSS to provide assistance in improving water supply and sewerage for Tondo
Foreshore and Dagat-Dagatan. In executing these infrastructure works amidst
very high density and a politically sensitive population which was also very
skeptical, the NHA was aware of the delicate nature of its community develop-
ment work and took steps to ensure that residents of Tondo Foreshore, played a
reasonable role in planning and approving important details of the work par-
ticularly with regard to the realignment of streets, utilities and houses - an
exercise referred to as "reblocking" (see para 3.06(d)).
2.03      Considerable development was taking place in 1975/76 in the area
immediately adjoining Tondo Foreshore. As a result, resettlement needs were
high. The International Port to the southwest was being expanded by the
Philippine Port Authority (PPA) with German (KFW) assistance. The first phase
of port improvements required the urgent relocation of approximately 1,300
squatter families. Some 2,500 more families qould have to be relocated to
clear the entire International Port complex. I In addition, reclamation and
construction of a fisheries port at nearby Navotas was nearing completion and
would require the relocation of another several thousand squatters. It had
therefore become the responsibility of PPA to find suitable accommodation for
nearly 7,000 families affected by all these works. An arrangement was made
with the NHA to resettle at least the first 1,500 households from the
International Port expansion into the Dagat-Dagatan Phase I site, as well as
/1 Figures represent appraisal estimates.

*nother 700 *ffected by construction of the R-10 and C-2 roads, for which DPH
was responsible which were ultimately accommodated in the KFr-financed Phase
II area. Mfurther S00 families were expected to be displaced from Tondo
upgrading,- (about 3x), briefing the total households to be resettled under
this project to about 2,700,- or about 40X of the total required. The rest
were to be accommodated by the KWF's Phase II.
B. Preparation and Appraisal
2.04      Project preparation was carried out by the various Government
agencies - primarily EHA with assistance from MWSS, the Department of Highways
(DPH), and the Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communications
(DPWTC). Assistance was also rendered by various short-term consultants and
supplemented by guidance from frequent Bank ition.    The initial GOP devel-
opment plan in December 1974 would have reiicstpl 702 of the families in Tondo
to distant areas and would have required high Levels of subsidy.  After a
review by a Bank mission in February 1975, a eoapletely different approach was
taken. This involved minimal relocation and then only to a nearby site in
Dagat-Dagatan where low-cost sites and services were to be provided. More
appropriate levels of service and cost recovery were proposed. These were
reviewed with community groups who welcomed the new approach, particularly by
ZOTO and Ugnayan, two of the more politically active groups. The project was
appraised in July/August 1975 and negotiations took place in March 1976.
C. Project Objectives
2.05      The project was fundamentally a demonstration to establish the
viability of a new and alternative approach to demolition based on in-situ
upgrading and serviced sites. This was clearly the central objective for the
Bank. For NHA, upgrading the quality of life for Tondo residents was the
primary objective. Though slightly different, these objectives were
compatible. Both required addressing the Tondo's basic shelter, sanitation,
health, employment and infrastructure deficiencies. In addition, the urban
transport and institutional problems in Metro Manila described in paras. 1.01-
1.07 were to be dealt with. The project was highly ambitious, outlining
objectives in five distinct areas:
(a) Upgrading/Serviced Sites: To demonstrate that upgrading in situ was
an appropriate alternative to resettlement, and to provide squatters
with security of tenure and adequate urban services in such a way
that beneficiaries could pay for the full cost of on-site services
and some portion of the value of the land.
2/   About 2,000 lots were to be generated in Dagat-Dagatan and 1,000 infill
lots in Tondo, so that resettlement committments fully absorbed new site
development.

With respect to serviced sites, to provide a lover unit cost
solution for new housing by means of serviced lots with full cost
recovery;
(b) Traffic: To focus on low-cost, high-return investments in urban
transport with urgently needed traffic control measures and
equipment for the efficient use of existing infrastructure;
(c) Health: To integrate comprehensive health, nutrition and other
social services with physical improvements in water supply, sewerage
and drainage;
(d) Employment: To experiment with employment creation by means of
supervised credit programs; and
(e) Institutions: To strengthen two new institutions, the National
Housing Authority (NHA) and the Metropolitan Manila Commission
(PMC), by providing technical assistance and in particular to
increase significantly NHA's capacity to plan and implement similar
slum upgrading projects in other parts of the Philippines.
D. Project Description
2.06      The Project was to include:
(a) Tondo Foreshore Upgrading. iUpgrading a 180 ha area, with an expec-
ted pop9lation of about 180,000 persons living in 17,500 struc-
tures,!' by providing basic urban infrastructure and health,
education and other welfare services, materials for house improve-
ment and cottage industry loans, about 1,OOO new serviced lots and
core units on now vacant land, and about 15 ha of land for indus-
trial and commercial use;
(b) Dagat-Dagatan. Development of a 40 ha residential community near
Tondo for some 20,000 persons by providing basic infrastructure and
health, education and other services, materials for house
improvement and cottage industry loans. About 2,000 residential
lots would be developed with simple sanitary core units for lease
with options to purchase by families displaced from the Tondo
Foreshore, and about 3.5 ha of land for industrial/commercial use.
Offsite infrastructure related to the two preceeding components was
also included. This principally involved (a) rehabilitation of the
4/ The area was later reduced to 137 ha. Expected population after
improvement was 160,000 persons and 15,000 structures. This implies
demolition of 2,500 structures as opposed to the 500 units referenced in
other sections of the SAR (see para. 2.03).

existing Tondo Sewerage Pumping Station, (b) construction of a new
outfall sewer to replace the existing outfall, which had deterio-
rated to the point of being inadequate for the efficient and sani-
tary discharge of sewage flows from the Tondo Foreshore. and (e)
construction of stabilization ponds and temporary (above ground)
water mains at Dagat-Dagatan;
(c) Major Roads and Bridges.   Construction of 5.4 km of the R-10 road
between C-i and Dagat-Dagatan, construction of 1.7 km of circumfer-
ential roads C-2 and C-3 and construction of 0.4 km of an access
road to the Dagat-Dagatan resettlement site and two bridges related
to these works. This access road would'also facilitate traffic
movement out of the Internatioqmal Port Area;
(d) Traffic Improvement. Construction of junction improvements, road
markings and footpaths, bus shelters, city-wide signals, signal-
linking equipment and mobile radios to improve the use of existing
infrastructure; and
(e) Technical Assistance. Consultants (about 46 man-years) to be
retained for ten distinct tasks involving:
o    detailed design/engineering and coAstruction supervision of the
physical works in Tondo and Dagat-Dagatan by NHA and MWSS, for
major roads/bridges by DPH, and for the DPI traffic component;
o    organization, management and financial planning for the NRA;
o    feasibility studies to develop a second urban project;
o    a Metropolitan Manila transport/land-use study by the DPWTC;
o    studies and training to be carried out by DPWTC on behalf of
MMC involving:
-    a fiscal base study;
-    a cadastral survey for Metropolitan Manila to update the
existing survey which covered only half the area;
-    a municipal services study; and
-    design and implementation of an MNC staff training
program;
o    a national transportation investment plan for 1977-80 and a
national tranSport systems study by DPWTC; and
o    strengthening the planning capabilities of the various
Government transportation agencies.

III. MAJOR RESULTS
Tondo Foreshore Upgrading
3.01      The project successfully introduced an alternative to Government's
socially disruptive and expensive policy of wholesale slum clearance, demoli-
tion and wholesale relocation to distant resettlement areas. In situ slum
upgrading has been accepted and expanded through subsequent Bank and inter-
nally financed projects. In the early 80's fully 415 Areas for Priority
Development (APDs) in Metro Manila alone were identified for in-situ improve-
ment. The EHA's Ninth Anniversary Performance Review (1984) indicates it has
upgraded over 44,000 structures in slum comunities of Metro-Manila, Cagayan
de Oro, Cebu and Davao since 1975, of which Tondo represented only 13,000 or
about a third. Production peaked at over 9,000 units per year in 1980-1982.
3.02      Resettlement, however, ha3 not halted.   Simultaneously over 63,000
families have been relocated for a variety of reasons or 40X more than
received in-situ upgrading. The NHA indicates all resettlement constitutes
legitimate removal from dangerous esteros, embankments and immediate develop-
ment sites for Government-funded projects. Questions have been raised how-
ever, about how much may have been motivated by aesthetic or other purposes.
Thus, overt demolition appears to have been, replaced by a blend of both in
situ upgrading and continued resettlement.
3.03      Perhaps the most striking achievement of the Tondo project is the
successful demonstration of the viability of self-help and progressive
improvement. Secure tenure and provision of basic services did, in fact,
elicit significant private investment and dramatic improvements in existing
housing. Before and after photos of Tondo (see photographs) show the remark-
able transformation of the communities' physical appearance over a ten-year
period from a virtual slum to a middle income neighborhood. Project
improvements did not, however, seem to drive out the poor. Shanties and very
modest structures still stand beside elaborate and obviously expensive
homes. Predictably a proportion of original residents have cashed in their
windfall profits and sold out. Turnover, however, appears to be somewhat
lower than in other slums in Metro Manila (20X vs. 27%) with about a third of
those moving out also registering property sales. The extensive amount of
mixed development would seem to reinforce the conclusion that turnover has not
been excessive. Owners of improved houses frequently sublet, which can
enhance household income to the extent that it more than defrays mortgage
costs. Though costs including markups virtually tripled, incomes rose by
about the same amount from an estimated median of P435 in Tondo at project
completion, to P1,200. Over 90% of residents could therefore afford a minimum
30 m lot.
3.04      The success of the Tondo slum upgrading program validated some of
the basic assumptions of the Bank's approach to slum problems, specifically
that security of tenure and adequate infrastructure are much more important
responsibilities of Government than housing construction itself. When these

are provided, housing tends to follow as a private investment. In Tondo more
than 90Z of the structures were improved to some degree, of which 122 were
completely new houses.
3.05      The upgraded infrastructure in Tondo dramatically improved the
environment and health standards. This was, to IHA, a more prominent objec-
tive than the policy changes which attracted Bank support. Low areas of
standing water have been filled, homes enjoy individual sanitation facilities,
walkways and streets make the area far more accessible, and schools, clinics,
Barangay centers, markets, and livelihood (job) centers are readily avail-
able. Crisp before and after health statistics are not readily available, and
if they were it would be difficult to establish causality between the project
and any demonstrated improvements. Nonetheless, environmental and health
conditions have visibly improved as a result of the project in the vast majo-
rity of the area.
3.06      Community participation seems to have been relatively successful.
This was due in large measure to the politically active character of the Tondo
population and the pivotal role of the barangay (neighborhood) as a socio-
political unit. It was also attributable to the special concern NHA devoted
to Tondo, although that approach has been criticized by some as being too
paternalistic. Despite frequent tension and conflict, barangay leaders turned
out to be effective partners in NHA's efforts to establish good working rela-
tionships with Tondo residents. They proved less reliable allies, however, in
cost recovery. Some have used the onset of maintenance problems as a politi-
cal wedge to actively undermine collection effort.
3.07      The NHA has had great difficulty extracting itself from maintenapce
responsibilities in Tondo. General inadequacies in service maintenance levels
throughout the city have led the community to attempt to hold the Authority's
collections hostage to better service from line agencies, ministries and
municipalities. This remains an issue on which follow-up under subsequent
PCRs will be needed. Even at the time of writing several physical problems
still persist in selected segments of Tondo:
(a) water supply is still inadequate in sections of Tondo affecting the
functioning of sanitary cores, although 90X of house connections
have been made. Residents in these areas must still purchase water
in containers;
(b) the drainage system is much improved over pre 1975 levels. However,
serious flooding problems are occuring in this area as well as other
parts of Metro Manila as a result of a combination of factors;
tc) solid waste collection continues to be a major problem, as it is in
much of the rest of Metropolitan Manila.
Dagat-Dagatan Serviced Sites
3.08      From a physical and social perspective, Dagat-Dagatan, like Tondo,
was a striking success. Families rapidly progressed over a few years from
temporary shanties erected on site to substantial homes (see photos).   Comer-



114
cial areas sprung to life and a vibrant community has evolved. This first
effort at serviced sites clearly demonstrated the viability of the self-help
principal as well as its acceptability to a low-income population.
3.09      Dagat-Dagatan successfully introduced new low cost, self-help
alternatives into Government's housing programs. Affordable serviced sites
with expandable sanitary cores were a new concept and a viable alternative to
overdesigned, subsidized multistory concepts as an affordable method of
addressing the shelter needs of low income families. These serviced sites and
upgrading programs are now incorporated into the 1983-1987 National Shelter
Program, though they represent only about 17X of the units. These are the
only programs which have proven afforable to the lower two-thirds of the
population. This remains a disappointment and it is hoped that subsequent
plans will begin to better address the match between supply and demand. Bank
sector work has focussed on this topic.
3.10      The first phase of Dagat-Dagatan was a distinct disappointment from
the standpoint of cost recovery. Though physically completed and occupied in
1978/79, collections had still not begun by the end of 1984, due largely to
delays in obtaining clear land title. The NHA had promised residents collec-
tions would not begin until tenure was issued. Expropriation of the land and
related court settlements dragged the process out for six years. Disputes
over the charging of core units exacerbated these problems. Only in early
1984 was clear title to the land obtained by NBA, five years after residents
had occupied the site. Though advance payments had been solicited, few were
received (8% in 1982 and 5X in 1983). Though collections were expected to be
difficult in view of these events, recent figures show considerable
improvement.
Major Roads and Bridges
3.11      Though still under construction at the time of writing, this
component is expected to be completed by the end of 1985 and to have substan-
tively fulfilled its objectives. Costs were well in excess of those expected
and, in retrospect, preparation work should have been further advanced on this
component before appraisal. Nonetheless, the economic rate of return is
expected to be very close to that anticipated.
Traffic
3.12      The traffic component is considered highly successful.    Physical
facilities were built within a reasonable time frame and achieved the results
expected including a high economic rate of return. The creation and develop-
ment of a respected Traffic Engineering and Management (TEAM) unit within
Government, that could effectively demonstrate the value of traffic management
within the time frame of a single project, was a major accomplishment. The
traffic management component has convincingly established the merits and
replicability of traffic management to Government officials. The TEAM has
been funded with a second tranche of investments (with OECF assistance) which
will effectively double the number of modernized traffic signal systems in
Manila. Based on the success of traffic management measures in Manila,
traffic components have been included in the Regional Cites Development



115
Project (RCDP-Loan 2257-PH) and the Municipal Development Project (PREMIUMED-
Loan 2435-PH). Another traffic management unit has been established in Metro
Cebu, and a proposed Bank loan (Central VisJyas Regional Project II) would
further the development of this unit.
3.13      The TEAM unit is still a separate project office not fully
integrated into Government, which exacerbates problems with interagency coord-
ination, budgeting, and staffing. Staff turnover remains high. Government
acknowledges these lingering problems and is beginning to address them. The
Bank is assisting in conjunction with the prepavation of the proposed Metro
Manila Urban Transportation Project which will follow up on these longer-term
institutional issues.
Technical Assistance
3.14      The project's large technical assistance component (46 man years)
included seven studies and attempted to address the major problems confronting
Metropolitan Manila. Studies were carried out on Metro Manila's transport
services and land use; and on the MMC's fiscal base.   A cadastral survey was
conducted to complete an earlier survey which covered only half the
Metropolitan Manila area, and a National Transport Investment Plan prepared by
DPWTC. Two additional studies led to the preparation and subsequent implemen-
tation of projects for upgrading (MMINUTE) and for upgrading and serviced site
development in regional cities. The final study amalgamated the records and
data of the several agencies which were merged to form the NHA. Much of the
technical assistance was directed to strengthening project implementation.
The MMC staff training program did not materialize except for a number of ad-
hoc short courses. Annex C summarizes completed studies and the Borrower's
view of their usefulness.
Livelihood
3.15      In addition to the five major project components, a small sum of
US$700,000 (1% of total project costs) was earmarked at appraisal for NHA to
experiment with small business ("livelihood") loans to create employment and
increase incomes among the target population. This component had mixed
results. The DBP and PNB extended loans totalling only about 35% of the
initial allocation and were ineffective in collections. As of June 1983,
average collection rates were just over 55% with PNB loans performing much
better (73%) than DBP (53%). In early 1^84 NHA moved to take over the port-
folio from the initiating Banks, and has been extending similar loans from its
own funds. These loans appear to have effectively reached the very low income
groups and do seem to have stimulated some incremental economic activity.
However, they are still at an early stage in establishing any degree of finan-
cial viability, and results to date are disappointing. The NHA's records show
still lower collection levels than DBP and PNB, but are complicated by an
artificial assignment of payments received to the mortgage first, and business
loan last. Since many borrowers have taken mortgages, and home material loans
as well as business loans, accurate data on collections is not available. The
NHA acknowledges that the livelihood loans are not presently financially
viable, but that it is functioning under government directives to make such
loans. Questions have been raised as to whether these activities disperse
NHA's attention and ought to be discontinued to enable the Authority to better
focus on its mainstream functions. These questions will be addressed under

the PCRs on Urban  I and III, both of which continued and expanded the liveli-
hood effort, as well as under preparation activities for subsequent loans.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
A. Start-up
4.01      Start-up was delayed to about the same degree as most of the Bank's
first generation urban projects by a combination of institutional, technical
and political factors. Reasons for delay included squatter relocation and
contracting problems, due largely to the inherently difficult nature of the
task, and to the lack of experience among both IHA and Bank staff. This had
been flagged at appraisal as an expected risk. The project was based entirely
on preliminary designs which contributed to its slow start. Survey work began
on schedule, but the difficult nature of the site and the inexperience of
surveyors resulted in errors. These were corrected and the surveyors
replaced. This, in turn, delayed site planning and contract tendering.
4.02      Tondo's political volatility required careful community consultation
and relations - a task vastly underestimated at appraisal. Misunderstandings
which arose after appraisal and continued through 1976 regarding the nature
and objectives of the project required extensive community education by NHA
before project implementation could proceed. The sheer size and socio-poli-
tical complexity of the Tondo undertaking was unprecedented, and the Authority
virtually felt its way through this initial period, unaided by any truly
experienced guidance from either its consultants or the Bank.
B. Implementation Schedule
4.03      The project required seven years to substantial completion of
physical works rather than the four years envisioned at appraisal. Slippage
was thus about 75Z (Figure 1). The roads and bridges component lagged
substantially behind the overall project, requiring nine years to complete.
From actual start-up of this component, completion is expected to take six
years including design work. While project performance was significantly
behind appraisal estimates, it should be borne in mind that the original
schedule lacked the seasoning of actual experience with this type of project,
and was therefore rather unrealistic.
4.04      Roads and Bridges:  Delay in the roads and bridges component was
largely attributable to its slow start. Construction did not begin until mid-
1981 - the original project completion date. Loan extensions were therefore
twice granted to December 1983 and then December 1985. The reasons for delay
were (a) the lack of detailed design which was done following appraisal, (b)
delays in clearing squatters from the proposed road routes, which obstructed
survey work and design preparation, (c) the need to rebid the works due to
changes in Government's procurement rules at the time of award, and (d) the
decision to build a dual carriage-way which required substantial additional
counterpart funds.

4.05      Dagat-Daistan also got off to a late start, but was largely
physically complete by mid 1979 - about two years behind schedule. Civil
works took longer than expected becouse of low and varied soil bearing capaci-
ties, unanticipated subsurface conditions and obstructions, as well as NOl's
inexperience. "Software" features, however - principally the materials loans,
physical relocation and consolidation of new homes - were the principal cause
of delay. These tasks were expected to take 18 months but actually required
nearly four years. Such "human" factors were significantly underestimated and
explain much of the discrepancy between appraisal estimates and actual
performance.
4.06      In the case of Tondo Foreshore, delays were attributable to a number
of factors. First and foremost was the sheer magnitude and complexity of this
first upgrading effort, in combination with its experimental nature noted in
the preceeding section on project start-up. Many elements of the work were
simply not foreseen - or not adequately allowed for in the schedule. The
sequencing of work and orchestration of clearance and resettlement in such a
large area were not well understood. Thus the schedule itself was not a fully
suitable standard against which to measure performance. Seven other factors
proved major causes of delay:
(a) Survey Work: substantial errors and discrepancies were discovered
in the survey work carried out by contractors of NHA. These
involved missing structures, incorrect distances and errors in
elevations. Benchmarks for horizontal and vertical controls were
never tied in to one another and errors were generally so
significant as to render the exercise useless. The survey was
repeated, but while the quality improved somewhat, similar problems
arose and the second survey contract also had to be terminated.
Only in early 1978 - two years after Board approval, was a competent
survey team commissioned which satifactorily completed the work.
However, just as work by the third firm was getting underway, a
catastrophic fire swept Area 2 of Tondo, destroying 2,000 of the
Tondo's 17,000 structures, or about 12x. The physical, social and
political turmoil which followed slowed survey completion.
Throughout, survey monuments were lost or removed and workers
harrassed. Some were killed in a local brawl. Detailed design work
could not be started until the survey was complete. Inexperience of
local firms with this type of complicated survey in densely
populated zones obviously contributed to these problems.
(b) Subsoil Conditions and Obstructions: Tondo was physically an
exceptionally difficult area in which to work. As in Dagat-Dagatan,
Tondo was affected by poor soil conditions involving extreme differ-
ential settlements and saline groundwater levels less than a meter
below the surface, further complicated by extensive pockets of
rubbish, vegetation and scrap metal. Although soil boring samples
collected during preparation indicated that poor conditions could be
expected, actual conditions were far worse than anticipated. The
southern portion of Tondo was found to be underlaid by a maze of
uncharted buried utilities of such age and condition that breakage
and flooding of excavations seriously hampered work. Dense criss-



119
crossing in some areas of overhead telephone and electric lines
obstructed crone movements and restricted work clearances throughout
the very densely populated area and presented problems throughout
construction.
(c) Resettlement: Road and other rights-of-way had not been fully
cleared when construction started. This was particularly true where
only a portion of a dwelling obstructed work and had to be removed
by the owner who was inclined to procrastinate as long as possible
in the hope it might ultimately prove not necessary. Where entire
structures had to be demolished, residents resisted moving since the
Dagat-Dagatan site was not yet ready for occupancy. Work began in
late 1976, but the resettlement site was not ready for even prelim-
inary occupancy until 1978. Inadequate lead time had been allowed
for site development. Construction of major infrastructure com-
menced long in advance of "reblocking", and as a result, nearly all
work had to proceed in narrow, cramped lanes often little wider than
the excavation itself. A particularly vexing problem was the
constant danger of undermining foundations of structures in close
proximity to the work. The combination in Tondo of extremely poor
soil conditions, flat terrain and the absence of drainage rendered
work nearly impossible during the 3-4 month rains. This had not
been adequately anticipated.
(d)  Reblocking:  Regularization of plot layouts, referred to as
n-re-blocking", was envisioned at appraisal and began fairly early in
the project. It involved in-situ relocation of structures within
each block. Three alternatives were presented to the community
involving a range between quite modest adjustments to the existing
layout to fairly dramatic repositioning of nearly all dwellings.
After extensive discussion, the community opted for the most
regularized pattern involving tremendous disruption, effort and
expense. The extent to which this represented their own free choice
or an in-built bias of the planners themselves is not entirely
clear. The result was an amazing rejuggling of almost the entire
community. "Before "and "after" photos are shown in Chapter III.
Buildings were literally picked up and moved by community teams.
Others were demolished and rebuilt. The cost was estimated at P
2,000 per unit, which if applied to 80Z of the 14,000 eventual
dwellings added an unrecognized P22 million to the project cost, or
about a third of the expected unit development cost in Tondo.
Realization that these costs had to be fully covered by individual
families further slowed execution of this monumental undertaking.
Construction continued throughout the reblocking period. While some
of the reblocking followed road construction, civil works were
complicated and slowed by the exercise. (Under Urban IV (RCDP)
reblocking costs have been recognized and added to total project
costs. This expense is shared equally by all families as part of
the site development cost.)
(e) Work Quality and Contract Administration: Contract administration
was seriously deficient, especially at the beginning. Work quality



120
was poor and the pace of construction slow. Some works failed and
had to be repeated. Originally work was bid as one huge contract,
involving five major subcontractors. This gargantuan contract was
eveatully terminated for poor quality and general non-performance.
Work was broken up into smaller packages. Problems with quality
dogged civil works throughout project implementation.
(f) Community intervention: As noted under start-up difficulties, con-
siderable confusion existed in the initial 1974-76 period regarding
the project's nature and objectives. An intensive community educa-
tion campaign to dispel these concerns proved to be an ongoing
necessity throughout much of the project period. Even afte;. con-
struction began, all field personnel - regardless of their employer
(Em or contractor) or position   - were subjected to queries and
discussions with the community about the project generally and spe-
cific works immediately underway. Disruptions to residents' daily
activities were inevitable. Major conflicts between contractors,
NIA field staff and residents were surprisingly few under the cir-
cumstances, but instances of individuals intervening in construction
and confronting contractors with intensive grilling about the proj-
ect were widespread. Civil disorder, particularly violence among
youthful rival gangs in the vicinity of work in progress, occasion-
ally forced workmen to seek refuge from overt warfare. Resistance
from residents of one neighborhood resulted in a time consuming
court action also slowed work. Despite the extensive involvement of
comnunity leaders and groups, dealing with 180,000 individuals
proved extremely time-consuming.
(g) Coordination: The inter-dependence of various components of the
project demanded close sequencing, strict adherance to tight
schedules and constant coordination among implementing units and
line agencies. In the early years in particular, when agencies were
concentrating on their own area of responsibility with little
concern for its impact on the others, this coordination was
deficient and led to much delay. The establishment of an Inter-
agency Coordinating Comittee helped but did not resolve the problem
which remained a difficult feature throughout implementation.
(h) Materials Shortages: Scarcity of PVC pipes and cement following the
1978-79 petroleum price hikes also slowed work and resulted in the
loss of much of one building season.
C. Costs
4.07      Total project costs (Annex 8) were estimated at appraisal at P487.8
millio: ($65.0) based on preliminary engineering. Actual costs were P973.7
milliot or approximately US$91.8 million. This represents an overrun of 100%
in pescs and 41% in dollars. The differences between appraisal and final
estima:es to completion for the main categories of expenditure are as follows:

Cost Sharing               491                 461                 6x
4.08      The main cost increases occurred with respect to major roads and
bridges (2311), the sewer outfall (227%) and Tondo upgrading (1002). In
addition to the Bank and Borrower's general inexperience in estimating costs on
this type of undertaking, major reasons for the differences between appraisal
estimates and actual costs were:
(a) for Tondo, delays in start-up (para. 3.01), underestimated
quantities for land fill and reclamation work, where a variance of
more than 6001 occurred due to unforeseen subsurface conditions and
obstructions, hikes in land costs of 1502, and the generally higher
labor and materials costs resulting from the major 1978/79 petroleum
price increases;
(b) for the roads and bridges, major delays in start-up as well as the
price increases noted above. Designs here were preliminary and
should have been further along for reclaimed land such as this where
uncertainties can be high; and
(c) for the sewer outfall, four years delay in start-up, increased scope
of work for the interceptor and watermain across the C-2 highway, as
well as the cost increases noted in (a).
4.09      Savings were realized in the traffic component principally due to
the omission of the civil works element. Equipment costs only modestly
exceeded those expected (by 16%).



122
D. Disbursements
4.10      Disbursements on the original loan required nine years to complete -
with the project's profile very similar to the overall urban profile
(Annex C). Host first generation projects suffered similar start-up difficul-
ties because of the inexperience of both the Borrower and the Bank in these
types of operations, as well as the inherent difficulties of any demonstration
project which attempts major policy reform. Though start-up was quite slow,
depressing disbursements throughout the initial five years, momentum gathered
in the sixth and seventh years, when fully 402 of the total loan was drawn
down. If NHA were able to roll over its program on a continuing basis, this
would imply a drawdown capacity for a program type of loan of this size of
about five years. Disbursements followed a predictable "S" curve, though in
these early years, Bank staff were using a rather unrealistic straight line
method for appraisal projections (see Figure 2).
V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. Development Costs
5.01      The pricing structure described in the Staff Appraisal Report was
modelled on the "private developer" formula, under which costs normally allo-
cated to homeowners in a private subdivisioxi were to be borne by benefici-
aries, and off-site infrastructure, community facilities (except barangay
centers), studies and technical assistance were to be borne by Government.
Off-site water mains and stabilization ponds were partially allocated to
residents since they would also serve wider populations. One unified direct
charge to beneficiaries for lots is shown in the appraisal covering land,
reclamation, surveys, drainage, water, sewerage, electricity, core units and
barangay centers. The NlA's understanding, however, was that a split pricing
structure would be implemented with MWSS and MERALCO recovering associated
utility costs through normal tariff charges. This would differ from the priv-
ate developers' model under which buyers pay directly for all utility infra-
structure. Beneficiaries were also expected to pay for NHA's administration
and interest during construction. Based on this formula, gross development
costs (total costs net of community facilities, technical assiE -nce, home
material loans and small business loans) were expected to avera6 . 168 per m2
o saleable land. In the event, actual development costs were about P 620 per
m or an almost fourfold peso inj;ease. In dollars, this was roughly triple
that expected (US$58 vs. US$22).)' While land and construction costs doubled,
much of this increase can be attributed to the longer implementation period.

should be increased by another 452 representing three additional years infla-
tion, and an appropriate four-year construction period reflected.   ThIse two

US$37/r' on about two thirds of the US$58/a . Annex J and Table V-1 outline
development costs and units costs per square meter expected at appraisal and

B. Sale Prices/Affordability
5.02      Sale Prices.  Subsantial cross-subsidies were to be applied to
residential lots from the profits from commercial and industrial land (about
10 of the total area) which were expected to realize about P 100 (US$13.3)
million, and from payments to NHA by PPA and DPH for resettlement of squatters
obstructing their development projects (pare 2.03). Anticipated profits
totalled P 118 million. Under the single integrated charge outlined in the
appraisal report the average sale price for rfsidential lots was expected to
be P 52 per m or P 2,600 for an average 50 m lot. Actual costs were over
ten times this figure - and would have resulted in a sales price of P 577 per
m or P 28,850 per average 50 m lot.
5.03      Predictably actual costs rose and profits as well as saleable land
shrank. As noted above, cost increases were attributable to capital costs
which doubled from P 187 million to P 406 million and (b) administration and
interest during construction which far exceeded expectations due to delays,
adding 502 to development costs.   Profits on commercial/industrial areas were
about a third of that expeg;edq and payments from line agencies (PPA and DPH)
never materialized at all.- Finally, saleable land - which was frequently
overestimated in first generation projects - shrank by about 201 (Table
V-1). The combination of these factors drove up actual prices significantly
above appraisal estimates.
5.04      Cross-subsidies from comercial/industrial units were a disappoint-
ment.  In theory, these differential pricing arrangements were rational,
creative, and seemed achievable. In practice they proved less effective. The
Philippines' deteriorating economy left NBA with a huge demand for low-cost
subsidized residential units and a much reduced comercial/industrial
demand. Economic shifts led to deteriorating market prices, and uncertainty
as to whether to pre-sell lots (running the risk of underestimating final
6/   The appraisal report makes no mention of the Vitas area which figured
prominently in NHA's own calculations of commerical profits under the
project. The NHA has contended that the Vitas Industrial Area is an
integral part of the Tondo project, and that profits would be used for
cross-subsidy of the residential area. See Annex M for a fuller
discussion of the Vitas property.

costs and selling at a loss) or waiting until completion (creating inventory
problems and downside risks of weakening demand and lowered prices). As noted
above, payments expected from other Government agencies did not materialize,
and saleable area for commercial/industrial fell significantly short of
appraisal expectations by about 30X. Sales lagged. As of December 1984,
coummercial/industrial sales stood at about 57X of the total. Assuming sales
are consumated on completed lots, the P 118 million expected profit at
appraisal will drop to P 37 million, or about one third. The Authority is
seriously rethinking the practicability of cross-subsidies and contemplating a
policy change under which sale prices on all units would fully cover costs,
and com erciallindustrial units would garner whatever profit the market would
bear. Economic downturns would then leave NHA less exposed.
5.05      The P 577 appropriate sale price at project completion was not,
however, the price actually charged beneficiaries. Three events altered the
pricing formula presented in the SAR. First, the pricing formula reverted to
a split charge, with utility infrastructure costs recovered through tariffs.
The appraisal report anticipates one unified direct charge to beneficiaries
covering nearly all infrastructure, core units, and land costs. In the event,
all water and sewerage (off-site, on-site and on-plot up to the house) were
charged to HWSS to be recovered through normal utility charges, and all elec-
trical infrastructure was built by MERALCO and recovered in a similar
manner. Assuming these agencies remain financially healthy, these costs will
still be recovered from beneficiaries, through utility charges. Thus two
charges emerged, one for lot mortgages and one (or more) for utilities.
5.06      The shift to a split pricing structure (direct charge and utility
charge(s)) did not alter the basic cost allocation formula (Annex K).
Families still paid directly for land, reclamation, survey, local roads and
footpaths, drainage, core units, barangay centers, landscaping, commercial/
industrial buildings and design/supervision. They paid indirectly (through
utility tariffs) for water, sewerage and electical infrastructure. The net
effect was to cut costs allocable to the mortgage by about half, shifting the
burden of collection on this sum to MWSS and MERALCO. As noted above, NHA
indicated at completion that it had always understood a split price would be
applied and did not consider this a change in project design. The unified
price may have been a presentational simplification by the appraisal team.
5.07      The appropriate sale price on mortgages based on the split pricing
structure (net of utilitiesI and after applicatiog of cross-subsidies should
have been about P 300 per m   or P 15,000 per 592 n  average residential lot
(Annex J). The actual price was P 95.29 per m about a third of that
required.  At the mandated price, a 50m   lot would cost P 4,760.   This price,
implemented under PD1314 issued March 20, 1978, represented the second major
alteration of the pricing structure presented in the appraisal report. It was
far more significant than the first.
5.08      PD1314 materially eroded cost recovery.   The Bank concurred in this
decision, however, and even encouraged it because three years had passed since
project start-up and the commuity was anxious to know what price they were to
pay for their lots. By setting a price, the NHA established the understanding
that costs were to be recovered. The Authority was confident the allowances



127
for price escalation were sufficient, and that costs would not rise further, a
judgement in which the Bank also concurred. Events proved otherwise. Actual
completion occurred only four years later following significant yrther price
escalation, triggered in part by the 1978/79 oil price increase.-
5.09      Finally, no markups were ultimately charged on the P 95.20 capital
recovery factor established under PD1314. The 6% administrative fee and 12%
p.a. interest during construction was subsidized by NHl.
8/
5.10      Affordability.  The premature mandatings-  of the sale price in Tondo
under PD1314 damged the project's cost recovery but further improved its
already excellent affordability. At appraisal, a lot in Tordo or Dagat
Dagatan (both priced the same) was expected to be affordabLe to about 85X of
the residents, assuming families could pay 182 of household income for project
services. Using the same 182 assumption, by 1982 at the time of physical comr-
pletion in Tondi, the charges that should have resulted from the   lit pricing
formula (P300 m ) were affordable to over 95X of Tondo residents - a distinct
improvement over the appraisal estimate. Table V-2 summarizes sales prices
and affordability at appraisal and at project completion.
7/   The UEDA recommends beneficiaries be allowed to participate in the
determination of changes as part of intensive comonnity education
campaigns prior to project start-up in future upgrading projects.
8/   The NHA points out that as. noted in para. 5 08, the fecision on PD1314
was made after much deliberation and the P 500 per m land price was
actually suggested by the Bank in compliance with an earlier Presidential
directive on Tondo land sales (RA#1597).

5.11      Despite cost increases and protracted delay, it appears the project
would have met and even exceeded its affordability target of 852 based on
actual costs. The imposed subsidy under PD1314 was unnecessary. The reason
for this is simply that while development costs including markups tripled
(Table V-1) - so did incomes. Tondo's median income rose from the 435
projected for 1978 at expected completion to 1200 at actual completion in 1982
- a nearly threefold increase. Over 902 of Tondo residegts could afford the
P95 (US$9) appropriate monthly charge for a minimum 30 m lot. The further
reduction to P30 ($3) under PD1314 achieved little in terms of greater afford-
ability to residents, but placed a singificant financial burden on the NHA
totalling about P80 (US$7.5) million.



129
C. Cost Allocation
5.12      The major impact of the three pricing adjustments was to
dramatically reduce direct lot (mortgage) charges (from 822 to 37X of total
upgrading/serviced site costs) and double subsidy levels (from 182 to 35Z).
About 28Z of costs were passed on to the utility companies which are still
expected to recover these costs from beneficiaries. In total, beneficiaries
should have paid 80X of upgrading/serviced site costs and actually paid 65Z.
The NHA picked up the difference with its share of costs rising from nothing
at appraisal to 17Z, or P 88 (US$8) million. Table V-3 presents the cost
allocation anticipated at appraisal and actual (see Annex K for details).

D. Tenure, Sales and Collections
5.13      Tenure.  At appraisal the anticipated form of tenure was a leasehold
with option to purchase. The two advantages of this form of tenure were (a)
the ability to issue the lease against a writ of possession, before land
acquisition was complete, and (b) ease of eviction in the event of non-
payment. However, because the Tondo community had for years been promised
title by Government, political pressures rapidly mounted to :hift to deed of
sale (title) with mortgage (DSM). NHA eventually promised the community
individual land title. However, expropriation procedures resulted in
protracted land acquisition and at the time of writing, NHA possessed title to
only two thirds of the area. Some form of contract was required to initiate
collections, and in 1984 the Authority decided to revert to the CCS for
properties as yet untitled. Though this decision met with some resistance
from elements within the community, it represented the only practical
alternative.
5.14      Sales.  Partly because of land acquisition problems, as well as
other factors, sales (including mortgage documentation in upgraded areas)
lagged. At the time of writing three quarters of residential lots and only
57Z of commercial industrial units were sold/documented (Table V-4). Of the
remaining residential lots in Tondo, 28Z were affected by duplicate titling



130
*nd legal complexities, unresolved census cases, resales and encroachmaents.
Since virtually all new serviced sites were utilized for resettlement,
selection of beneficiaries did not feature in this first project. The
inability to clear squatters from commercial lots in both areas - including
one large contractor - also stalled operations. Heavy price escalation of 50-
601 in 1984 as well as lower than expected prices led to a temporary
suspension of marketing. However, activity was resumed in early 1985. Table
V-4 presents the December 1984 status of sales.
Table V-4: SALES

Total:           845,294       751            157,857            57Z
5.15      Collections.  Cost recovery has been singularly the weakest aspect
of project implementation. Start-up of collections was significantly delayed
among resettled families occupying Dagat-Dagatan, where occupancy occurred in
1978/79 and collections began only in January 1985, due to lack of title as
well as to a longstanding dispute regarding the charging of core units.
Compulsory collections began in Tondo Foreshore in mid-1973, about a year
after infrastructure completion (see Chart 27277). Though well behind SAR
estimates this was not unreasonably behind service delivery. Thus NEA's
project collection experience spans only about 18 months and reflects only the
initial stages of this phase of the project.
5.16      To date, the Authority has collected about 56Z of the amount due
(612 in Tondo and 491 in Dagat-Dagatan). Advance payments and full payoffs by
families with relatives employed abroad initially masked mounting arrears.
For example, for 1984 which was effectively the first full year of serious
collection effort, P22.19 million was due and actual collections were P27.34
for Tondo and Dagat-Dagatan - fully 1231 of that expected. Arrears, however,
rather than declining, mounted sharply during the first half of the year,
prior to rescheduling.
5.17      The low level of collections is partially attributable to the slow
start-up of initial collections in Tondo, where there was no previous history
of payment. The considerable sociological difficulty of attempting to
establish a habit of regular monthly payment among a large squatter population
accustomed to free occupancy must be acknowledged and constitutes a second
major factor. Third, more thorough preparation and advance work and greater
lead time would have done much to strengthen the critical start-up period. A
fourth factor has been that until recently, the NHA showed little real will to
collect. With the Bank and Government supplying the majority of its
investment needs, other pressing - usually engineering - matters took
priority. The Authority's perspective on this last factor differs from the
Bank's. They attribute delays in collection start-up principally to NEA's
verbal committment to the community that payment would begin only upon full



131
delivery of tenure and services. This comittment was made early in project
implementation to gain the confidence and cooperation of Tondo residents.
While tenure vas issued to many at earlier stages, services were not fully
functional before late 1983, water pressures as noted herein, are still
inadequate in several areas of Tondo, road maintenance is poor and serious
periodic flooding recurs. Doubtless these comunity commitments comprise a
fifth and important cause of low collections. Establishing a distinction in
the co munity's mind between "delivery" of a service (NHA's responsibility)
and its "maintenance" (the job of local govex-nment and utilities) has been
difficult. When maintenance is poor, people stop paying.
5.18      The Philippines' 1983/84 economic and financial crisis created new
incentives for cost recovery. Government funds were less forthcoming, and
Bank projects and thus disbursements slowed. As debt service mounted on NHA's
previous borrowings, cash grew short. Local borrowings became prohibitively
expensive. For these and other reasons, a major 1984 drive was mounted to
improve corporate collections.
5.19      The year brought three major changes.   Management information on
collections was sharpened and focussed on six basic indices and the scope of
regular reporting extended to all NHA's project areas, producing a complete
picture of collections for the first time. In June, PD1923 was issued, giving
beneficiaries a three month period in which to pay off arrears and/or
reschedule their payments. Penalties on delinquent payments were forgiven for
this period if delinquent accounts were paid in full or rescheduling arranged
by September 30, 1984, though no write-off of principal or interest was
granted. By September, P2 million of the P4 million total arrears in Tondo
had been paid in cash. Rescheduling gave both beneficiaries and NHA a clean
start. Finally, NHA issued public notice of its intent to foreclose on
seriously delinquent cases, though it has never before enforced cases of
repossession and resale on low-income lots since its 1975 inception.
5.20      The 1984 drive produced results.   Collection on the Bank's total
portfolio with ttO/Authority nearly tripled from P13 million in 1983 to P37
million in 1984,     A main drive also occurred to establish new accounts in
non-Bank sites, with 26,000 accounts added to the roster. Total collections
rose from P65 million in 1983 to P101 million in 1984 - a 55X increase. It
remains to be seen whether these measures will result in sustained improvement
in collection efficiency. Serious obstacles still exist in the farm of
mounting political opposition to tightened collections during an economic
downturn, and in the legal one-year redemption period during which NHA may not
resposses or sell off a unit. As a result the unit therefore remains a non-
performing asset for about two years. Subsequent PCRs on Urban II and III
will follow up on this aspect.
10/ New accounts increased by only 14X so do not explain the increase.



132
E. Infrastructure Turnover and Maintenance
5.21      Turnover of completed works to MWSS, MEIALCO and local governments
has proven a major headache. Completions have been significantly delayed,
with attendant cost increases. Despite an earlier Memorandum of Agreement in
principle (with MWSS only), negotiations over final asset values and
construction quality have led to protracted delays of up to five years for
some works. Meanwhile NRA must maintain completed infrastructure.
5.22      Of the P234 million total in completed works for handover, about 602
is attributable to MISS and 402 to MPWH. To date, the MWSS has accepted about
582 and the KPWH 1OOZ of these works under Deeds of Transfer (DOTs). Overall,
turnover stands at 76X. The DOTs formally transfer assets and responsibility
for payment of any commensurate IBRD debt. They also acknowledge the equity
investment of NHA as a debt. So far, however, no payment method or schedule
for repaying NHA equity has been set. The NHA plans to tackle this problem
after agreement has been reached on the total amount of the obligations under
Urban I. Alternately NHA may have to adjust paid-in capital for these
amounts. The City of Manila accepted all of its minor roads in January 1985.
5.23      Maintenance has been problematic.   Delays in turnover left NHA with
the formal responsibility and expense of maintenance. In addition, the
unavoidable immediate use of services (e.g. roads) in an occupied site like
Tondo results in the immediate onset of deterioration. As noted in para 4.17
inadequate maintenance and dysfunctional services (e.g. low water pressures)
have contributed to low payment levels. Hopefully the progress made in 1984
in turning over works will help to separate the concept of service maintenance
from mortgage payments responsibility in the community's mind. This will take
time, however, as well as an active community education campaign which was
launched in the spring of 1985. The NEDA has suggested means be explored in
future projects for involving the community itself in maintenance activities.
VI* INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
A. National Housing Authority (NHA)
6.01      The NHA's performance was strong in some respects and weak in
others. It should be borne in mind when assessing institutional performance
that this first project was essentially a physical demonstration of an
unprecedented approach - in situ upgrading and self-help housing - in a huge,
complez, and politically volatile community. Just building the physical works
represented a major challenge. Community relations introduced complexities
and NHA did much learning along the way, adjusting its approach as it



133
proceeded. The project's institutional objectivesUl. did not go such beyond
building NHA's production capacity - which was achieved, and a viable cost
recovery performance - which was not as of the date of this report. The
Authority has also had difficulty in handing over infrastructure and extracing
itself from maintenance responsibilities in completed sites. Intensive
efforts are evident by MHA to improve its performance in this regard, and the
PCR on the second and third Projects will reflect the results.
Product Delivery
6.02      The expansion of NHA's production capacity for low cost upgrading
and serviced sites represented a principal project objective and one of its
primary achievements. The Housing Authority at project inception had
virtually no track record in this type of operation. Through this first
project it has upgraded about 14,000 dwellings (vs. 15,000 estimated at
appraisal) and resettled another 2,500 (vs. 3,000 estimated), fundamentally
affecting the lives of roughly 180,000 people.
6.03      The Housing Authority is the only agency producing housing
affordable to the lowest two thirds of the population. The majority of its
production is targeted on lower income households through serviced sites,
upgrading and resettlement, though it also produces some completed housing,
condominiums and rental apartments. It is presently reassessing the merits of
its completed housing production program, and considering withdrawal.
6.04      As of 1981, five years after project start up, the NHA reported
annual production of over 18,000 units. Production slipped in 1982 to about
16,000 due in part to the deteriorating economy and in part to the normal
lumpiness of annual figur T17 This represented about half of total production
by the Government system.-
Financial Performance
6.05      The Authority's financial performance has significantly lagged its
physical performance.  Engineering and construction concerns dominated the
agency's attention for the first five years. Staff and management alike were
immersed in the extensive difficulties of such a major physical undertaking.
Insufficient attention and particularly lead time was devoted to "software"
project features such as land acquisition, titling, and cost recovery. At a
broader level, the NHA's management of its financial affairs was similarly
11/ Other objectives such as the projects demonstration effects are covered
elsewhere in this report (see paras. 2.05, 3.01, 6.02 and 6.04).

134
weak.13/ There was little evidence that the Authority intended - or desired
to establish itself as a financially viable housing corporation independent of
continuing government subsidy/equity contributions. In most respects it
behaved more like a government department, relying on direct government
infusions to supplement Bank loans, and devoting little serious effort to
establishing or improving its corporate receipts (collections) or internal
operating efficiency. Government, in turn, periodically directed the
Authority to perform tasks which it might not, of itself, have elected to
carry out. In this respect the Authority has not differed dramatically from
many - if not most - other publicly held corporations in the Philippines.
Centralized directives and laxity in corporate financial performance have been
pervasive problems and are only now being addressed by Government.
6.06      The Authority has recently begun to focus attention on improving its
financial position. In addition to the 1984 cost recovery drive, a new
pricing policy is under consideration which would begin to stem the leakage of
its capital through subsidies, and it has recently initiated moves to sell a
portion of its mortgage portfolio in order to revolve its capital. These are
all positive signs.
Institutional Maturation
6.07      Three distinct phases seem discernable in the NHA's gradual
maturation. In the early years of project design and start-up, social and
political factors featured heavily in the agency's operations. Housing was a
politically sensitive topic. As a result, policy change was difficult.
Upgrading and self-help site and service programs were poorly understood by
both government generally and the Tondo community in particular. The NHA
itself had little technical capacity in these areas - a factor acknowledged by
the appraisal report. The project's second phase which extended throughout
most of the execution period was therefore devoted predominantly to building
its technical and production capacity. Consultants employed to do detailed
design and supervision helped, but much of this learning came from trial and
error by the staff itself. As the agency gradually improved its grasp of the
physical side of its operation, attention began shifting to the financial
aspects of its business. As noted above, cost recovery and collections
performance have now become the principal focus of attention. The Philippine
financial and economic crisis of 1983/84 probably sharpened NHA's attention to
these matters by virtue of extensive cutbacks in Covernment funding in
combination with the growing debt service on Bank loans.
6.08      No doubt this process has taken far too long.   Fully a decade has
passed since project appraisal, and cost recovery performance is still not at
a satisfactory level. There is reason, however, to expect measurable improve-
ment under the third project, which focuses on broader aspects of NHA's
institutional performance. Just as it took NHA five years to build reasonably
13/ NHA indicates that while attention to and management of collections was
weak to begin with, they feel other aspects of their financial management
were satisfactory.



135
solid technical capacity, it will take several years of concentrated attention
to establish a satisfactory collections performance, and probably several more
to sharpen its financial management.
6.09      While some housing agencies in other countries have traversed these
stages more rapidly than the NHA, it is difficult to judge in the Philippine
context what a reasonable time frame might have been. The appraisal
expectation of four years was overly optimistic; the reality of a decade or
more probably too long. To judge institutional performance the project must
be placed in context.
Environment
6.10      All project agencies operated in a difficult environment,
particularly in the latter years of project implementation. Politically,
economically and administratively, the Filipino environment presents major
obstructions to effective performance. The politically sensitive nature of
housing and slum upgrading accentuates many of these problems for the NHA.
Local inflation over the project period was estimated at 10% per year for 3.5
years of active construction and in the event averaged 12.6Z over six years
(1977-82), skyrocketing in 1983 and 1984 to unprecedented levels of up to
50%. The four devaluations of the 1983/84 period only marginally affected
construction costs, but it, tandem with inflation severely eroded family
affordability just as cost recovery was getting off the ground. The heavy
1984 inflation created serious political problems with collections in Tondo.
Budget cuts, disruptions in flows of Government funds, very low civil service
salaries and highly politicized decisionmaking all make it extremely difficult
for Filipino institutions to perform well, both operationally and
financially. In addition, NHA serves a market segment that wields little
economic clout and constitutes a relatively powerless if vocal minority of a
highly stratified society. The creation of the Human Settlements Development
Corporation (HSDC) and its subsidiary Bliss Development Corporation (BDC)
under the MHS system initiated competitive activity and a merger attempt in
the late 1970s. As economic conditions deteriorated, competition for funds
became fierce. In this environment, the NHA's physical accomplishments are
indeed commendable, and their poor cost recovery performance though not
acceptable, is at least more understandable. A comparison of NHA's corporate
collections performance vis-a-vis other Philippine corporations as well as
other housing agencies in the region would better place performance in context
with other agencies of a similar nature and age, but is regrettably beyond the
scope of the present PCR.
Otganization/Staffing
6.11      The Authority's original organizational structure (Annex D) was
altered only slightly during implementation. The Relocation and Resettlement
Department took on the new upgrading function and a separate Commercial/
Industrial Estate Department was established by 1978 when the second project
was appraised. However, a major reorganization occurred in 1981 under which
the Metro Manila Projects Department (MHPD) was strengthened, and the
Financial Department was split into units focused on technical functions and a
unit to handle overall financial management.



136
6.12      Buildup of professional staff levels was a major achievement of the
first project. The Authority tripled in size from 1,100 staff in 1976 to a
peak of 2,900 in 1983. Staff turnover presented problems throughout implemen-
tation, but does not appear to be a significantly greater problem in NHA than
elsewhere. The Authority is seriously concerned about manpower development
and runs a number of well conceiTed programs for its managerial, professional
and support staff. Strength in :echnical skills still outweighs financial
capacities. However, the Author.ty has built a staff capability to keep the
environment under surveillance t3 do policy analysis, to think, plan, program,
monitor and evaluate. Such capa:ities exist only on paper in many institu-
tions. While ample scope exists for improvement, these functions at least
appear to be real and alive in Y3A.
Reporting
6.13      Information systems an! reporting were initially weak, particularly
on civil works and project costs and cost recovery but improved substantially
over the years. Financial information on actual collections remained poor
until 1984 when significant impr3vement occurred. In the ensuing year a
thorough monitoring system was established for NHA's entire portfolio - a
significant initial step towards improved collection performance. Financial
management indices are still no: closely monitored by eithe14 jhe Bank or NHA
and accounting practices are de-ficient in certain respects.   'Rectifying
both should constitute a principal focus of future loans.
Coordination and External Relations
6.14      The project required extensive coordination between Government
Ministries and agencies, a task wihich was assigned to NHA in addition to its
responsibilities as executing agency for the Tondo Foreshore and Dagat-Dagatan
components. This involved primarily six entities including the DPH - which
executed the major roads component, MWSS - which executed the sewage outfall
station, DPWTC for the traffic management component, and DBP/PNB for adminis-
tering the line of credit for cc:tage industry. Schools were built by NHA on
behalf of the Ministry of Education and health centers for the Ministry of
Health.  Other community facilities such as playgrounds and barangay centers
were also built for the community, a seventh and most complex entity with
which NHA required close liaiso:.
6.15      As forewarned in the appraisal under project risks, coordination
proved a major headache, and abssrbed unexpected quantities of staff time
particularly during project star--up. Though an Interagency Coordination
Comittee that was established sade some contribution, major problems still
arose. Frequently NHA had to take action to fund and execute critical off-
site works when a line agency cculd not carry out its responsibilities due
mainly to budget constraints. :his not only led to delays and excessive

137
demands on NRA management and staff, it also caused subsequent problems with
turnover of completed works. Agencies were reluctant to accept completed
components at the asset values shown as well as responsibility for maintenance
when they had not been directly involved with execution. Turnover and
maintenance problems are covered in paras 4.21 - 4.23. Though their impact
was financial, turnover delays were due in large measure to weak coordination
and construction delays which increased costs. Staff transitions in all
agencies and poor long-term institutional memory of previous agreements also
contributed. Under Urban II and III which continued development of the Dagat
Dagatan site and expanded both upgrading and serviced sites to regional
cities, NMA began to develop earlier and tighter liaison with line agencies
and utilities ultimately taking over works, as well as clearer contractual
covenants regarding the financial obligations of both parties. As a result,
lag time between completion of works and turnover is expected to drop
significantly under Urban III.
6.16      The Authority's role within the sector changed significantly over
the project period. At start-up it was the only national housing agency,
having been created through the amalgamation of several others, and bore sole
authority for policy, production, and regulatory functions, including land use
regulation. In 1978, however, the sector underwent major changes with the
creation of the Ministry of Human Settlements (MHS) and six other shelter
institutions. Sectoral policy and leadership was vested in MHS, and a major
new source of housing finance established through the "pag-IBIG" provident
fund, a mandatory savings plan similar to social security. The pag-IBIG funds
were utilised to establish a secondary mortgage market through the National
Home Mortgage Finance Corporation (NHMFC), in which NHA participation through
mortgage sales was negligible. The Authority was largely excluded from the
new source of housing finance. While serviced site and upgrading work do
figure prominently in the National Shelter Plan 1983-88 program by number of
units, by volume of total investment NHA plays only a modest role. It does
carry primary responsibility for serving the lowest income groups.
6.17      Perhaps in part because NHA predated the MHS system, the Authority
has never enjoyed particularly close coordination or working relations with
the Ministry or its agencies. The Authority has sold a few condominiums to
NHMFC, but has not until recently been able to tap the potential liquidity
from sales of its low income serviced site mortgage portfolio. A closer
working arrangement is now being undertaken to achieve this goal. As noted in
earlier sections of this report, competitive production functions have evolved
which have not contributed to the efficient use of resources. Establishment
of better, more effective relations between NHMFC and NBA has remained an
elusive goal, but one which the Government needs to rigorously pursue. There
are recent encouraging signs that together the two agencies can develop a
sound program of low income housing.
B. Ministry of Public Works and Highways (MPWH)
6.18      The traffic management component was well executed by the MPWH and
by their consultants. This component was implemented quickly, monitored well,
produced substantial operating cost and time savings, and has consequently
been well received by the public.



138
6.19      The Department of Highways and the Department of Public Works,
Transportation and Communications satisfactorily executed their responsi-
bilities for detailed design of roads/traffic engineering and a Metropolitan
Manila transport/land use study, respectively. Though large, the MPWH
functions reasonably efficiently in civil works design and construction.
Extensive delays and cost overruns encountered in the roads and bridges
component were not primarily due to institutional weaknesses, but to other
factors (para. 3.02). Detailed design, however, should have been further
along before appraisal.
C. Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (RWSS)
6.20      The MWSS' performance under the project was not entirely
satisfactory. The agency was several years behind schedule in supplying water
to Tondo and constructing the new outfall sewer. However, these problems have
now been resolved except for continuing low water pressure at Tondo and the
fact that the outfall sewer is not yet functional due to delays in completion
of a pumping station which is not Bank-financed. Pressure problems will be
remedied when MWS II is completed during 1986. Water and sewer systems have
been tested and formally transferred to fWSS under two Memoranda of Agreement
with NHA (see para. 4.22). However, MWSS is not yet able to take all of the
sewage flow from Tondo, and low water pressure has created blockages in the
sewerage system. Remedial works on the C-3 interceptor sewer and the pumping
station at Dagat-Dagatan were also delayed but have now been completed.
D. The Role of Tondo Community
6.21      One of the most noteworthy features of the project was the active
participation of the Tondo Community in the upgrading project. Community
consultation was initiated early in the project design stage. The Community
Relations and Information Office (CRIO) was one of the first organizational
units of the project office. Intensive efforts were devoted during the
start-up period to educating, involving and discussing proposed plans with
Tondo residents. The task was not easy. Tondo contains a large number of
diverse and politically active groups for which the project offered an
excellent target of debate. It became at times a political football. In
addition, fully 84 different barangays (local organizational units) existed in
the immediate and contiguous area, which were organized into a f"deration. A
Citizen's Committee with membership from the many different Tond, -rganiza-
tions was formed, and sectoral groups established to review particular
components. Information was disseminated through a monthly newsletter, a
speaker's bureau from among the community leaders, question/answer handouts,
as well as meetings and seminars. The NHA's General Manager and senior staff
actively participated in key grass roots meetings, especially in the early
years of 1974-76, during reblocking discussions, and during the 1984/85 cost
recovery drive.
6.22      Long years of neglect, indifference and unfulfilled promises had led
to considerable skepticism by residents about Government's credibility.
Meetings were often heated, but usually open and frank. The NHA's
relationship with the community over the years was and is complex: a mixture
of sincere desire for open consultation and trust, periodic coercion,



139
cooperation, affection, hostility, political maneuvering, fierce independence,
and patronage. To generalize about a ten year relationship with 180,000
people is difficult, but by and large the Authority appeared by 1983 to have
won the community's support. A 1983 move by MHS to take over more direct
jurisdiction of the Dagat-Dagatan and Tondo projects generated a fierce
defense of NHA by the community.
6.23      A new chapter in community relations with Tondo is just beginning as
collections get seriously underway. Some evidence is apparent of political
resistance to even the subsidized prices being charged, no doubt partly
attributable to the erosion in real income that must have resulted from the
50X inflation in 1984, and partly to the Authority's intense 1984 cost
recovery drive. These efforts should continue to be monitored closely as a
part of the suppervision of succeeding NIA projects (Urban II, III and IV).
E. Performance of Contractors and Consultants
6.24      Initially contractors did not perform well and NHA supervision was
inadequate. Poor contractor performance was a major contribution to delay in
the 1978-79 period. Infrastructure construction began to accelerate in 1980
as a result of the decision to terminate one large contractor, and to award
smaller contract packages to seven new contractors and also as the result of
increased efficiency in the design and reblocking procedures. The C-3
Interceptor Sewer in Dagat-Dagatan was delayed because the contractor
abandoned the contract and had to be replaced. Construction activity peaked
in both Tondo and Dagat-Dagatan in December 1980, slackening thereafter due in
part to lagging efforts by contractors who became discouraged by periodic
disruptions and obstructions by residents. In Old Tondo delays occurred in
the removal of structures obstructing street rights-of-way. The more serious
cases had to be taken to court and many were only settled in early 1982,
6.25      Principal causes of poor contractor performance included:
(a) inexperience on the part of contractors generally and especially in this
type of undertaking; (b) inappropriate packaging of some works which were too
large for effective management by local contractors; (c) community
disruptions; (d) resettlement delays, and (e) inexperienced contract
management and supervision by NHA. Toward the latter years, the Authority's
contract supervision improved relative to the initial years, and contractor
performance was adequate (see para. 4.06(e) for a discussion of NHA contract
supervision).
6.26      Both contractors and consultants performed well on the traffic
management component which was also well monitored. Consultants employed
under the other elements of the large rechnical assistance component performed
reasonably well, except for a few who had to be replaced. Consultants for
organization, management and financial planning at NBA performed adequately,
but the infusion of technical assistance did not achieve the degree of
advancement hoped for in NHA's overall financial performance and management.



140
F. Performance of the Bank
6.27      Appraisal of the project was thorough though somewhat naive, and
supervision was frequent, averaging 25 staff-weeks of field time per year from
1977 through 1984. This high coefficient is not unusual in first generation
urban projects. Total supervision was estimated at 56 staff-weeks at
appraisal and actually required 194, a significant increase of almost
fourfold. Reasons for this include the policy environment and the subject
matter itself - slum improvement, and self-help housing (sites and services)
which were difficult and new. The project began to modify Government's policy
of slum clearance and mass relocation to distant areas. It was also complex,
simultaneously addressing a range of problems of Metropolitan Manila, and
involving a large number of institutions.
6.28      Several features of Bank performance are noteworthy as lessons for
the future:
(a) Performance deficiencies: detailed design and engineering were not
completed prior to appraisal on any project component. For Tondo
this created particular problems with soil conditions, subsurface
conditions and landfill requirements. Though soil investigations
were carried out during preparation, they proved insufficiently
detailed. Bearing capacities in Tondo turned out to be as low as
200 psf. Excavation deeper than six feet required expensive sheet-
pile lining and extraordinary costs were incurred to stabilize
excavation bottoms. Implementation and supervision time increased
as a result. For the major roads and bridges component, the lack of
detailed designs proved a major contributing factor in subsequent
delays and cost overruns. These sorts of engineering deficiencies
are puzzling in an institution which has been financing civil works
for over 40 years;
(b) Bank staff turnover: from start-up in 1975 to 1979 a number of
different project officers were assigned to the project as well as a
variety of consultants. Inevitably each required a period of orien-
tation, and each brought a slightly different focus and emphasis to
the work. The consequently changing Bank signals to UHA did not
contribute to steady, focused implementation. Finally the Authority
requested greater stability in Bank staff assignments which were not
altered from 1979-1983;
(c) Inadequate briefing: the proliferation of project officers and
consultants noted above was usually combined with inadequate
preparation and briefing, forcing ERA to utilize time and staff
capacity to brief visitors, and to justify and explain past
decisions;
(d) Inexperience: the relative inexperience of Bank staff (and
consultants) in combination with the overall tendency toward
optimism led to some fairly naive expectations at appraisal about
implementation schedules in particular. Insufficient allowance was
made for unexpected glitches and for learning; and



141
(e) Imbalanced supervision: Bank supervision concentrated heavily for
many years on civil works with insufficient attention to "software"
features such as land acquisition, mortgage documentation, cost
recovery and financial management. Each of the latter proved a
difficult and complex task for which far more lead time should have
been allowed. With the exception of land acquisition, none of the
other critical software features were even reflected in the project
implementation schedule.
VII.  ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
7.01      Appraised and actual economic rates of return for project components
with quantifiable benefits are presented in Table VII-l below. The measure-
ment of economic benefits for the slum upgrading, residential sites and
services and commercial/industrial sites was based on the estimated increase
in property values brought about by the provision of infrastructure and other
services.
7.02      Tondo/Dagat-Dagatan.   At appraisal, the economic rate of return for
the Tondo upgrading and Dagat-Dagatan sites and services was estimated at
21%. In re-evaluating the benefits after completion, NHA calculated an
overall 172 return for this component using the same general methodology. For
the residential component, a 15X return was realized and for commercial/
industrial areas a 25% return (vs. 40% at appraisal). Appreciation in
property values has substantively kept pace with increasing costs. The
Authority's calculations were based on 1983 market values and reflect project
costs actually incurred, which were converted to 1983 prices by using actual
rates of inflation. Foreign costs have been shadow-priced at 1.2 and
unskilled labor at 0.8. Land for Tondo was priced at its opportunity cost.
(Details of the cost/benefit streams are on file.) The 17% return is somewhat
below the 21% expected at appraisal because the project took longer to
complete than expected, resulting in higher costs and a corresponding deferral
in benefits. In addition, the disposable areat particularly for comuercial/
industrial areas, declined. Appraisal land value estimates were also opti-
mistic, and economic fluctuations eroded eventual prices.
7.03      Major Roads and Bridges.   Benefits of the major roads component were
based on estimated savings in road transport costs of all diverted traffic
from heavily congested routes in the Central Business District to the project
roads. This component is not yet complete, and was the focal point of a
supplementary loan made in 1983. Although costs have increased from P 102
million at the time of appraisal to the present estimate of P 339 million, the
component is still expected to yield a satisfactory economic rate of return
(about the same as the appraisal estimate) when both the cost and benefit
escalations are taken into consideration. Traffic flows appear to be in line
with appraisal estimates, and increased costs would be offset by increased
benefits based on current prices of fuel and time savings at present wage
rates.



142
7.04      The weighted average rate of return for the Tondo Foreshore
Upgrading, Dagat-Dagatan serviced sites, and the major roads and bridges
components was estimated at appraisal to be 22X and at completion to be 18Z.
The factors of delay and consequent cost increases noted above largely explain
the 4% difference. Though slightly lower than expected, the 18S return is
fully satifactory.
7.05      Traffic (TEAM).  The traffic component produced an internal rate of
return of 29Z. None was calculated at appraisal. The traffic signal system
reduced traffic delays by 17% and increased peak hour travel speeds by 10,
while permitting traffic volumes to increase by 8X and 58% on various
routes. An estimated P35 million pesos per year are saved on fuel costs and a
roughly equivalent amount in travel time savings. Thus, about P70 (US$4)
million per annum is being realized in current savings. Thus, the traffic
component produced major benefits at low cost and, accordingly, is one of the
most successful traffic management components financed by the Bank to date.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
A. Achievement of Objectives
8.01      Virtually all the project's stated objectives (para 2.05) were
achieved except that of financial replicability. The upgrading of Tondo - one
of the largest and more turbulent slums in Asia - was a highly ambitious goal
that was successfully achieved in physical and social terms. The slum
community virtually transformed itself over ten years into an upwardly mobile
neighborhood without appearing to have evicted the truly poor. Tondo has
affirmed the assumption that if given security of tenure and basic services,



143
families will build their own housing, the quality of which has surpassed even
the most optimistic predictions. The new serviced sites/self help approach
has also been well received by households, and like upgrading, has proven
socially as well as physically successful.
8.02      Attitudinal changes seem to have also occurred, though they are more
difficult to measure objectively. Tondo residents have become property owners
with a stake in stability, and although still politically vocal, there is
evidence of a much higher level of civic consciousness and responsible
citizenship. Residents took an active role in upgrading and proved reliable
partnars. Internal resolution of conflicting neighborhood interests gave them
an opportunity to exert a degree of control over public decision making and
their own lives and coomunity that had never before occurred. The community
has accepted the concept that benefits should be paid for, and has accepted
long term financial obligations to do so. All this offers evidence of
fundamental, though subtle, changes in attitudes.
8.03      Both upgrading and serviced sites have proven more cost effective
than previous approaches. Even with substanial cost overruns, capital devel-
opment costs of P28,000 for an average lot (P20,000 net of administrative and
other markups) were still only one fourth of a typical contractor-built,
completed "low cost" house.
8.04      Pricing and cost recovery - the two key elements of financial
replicability - were the principal disappointments. The project's intention
was to demonstrate "full" cost recovery (meaning development costs net of
community facilities), in this case totalling about 82% of total development
costs. As noted in para 4.07, this objective was eroded by the premature
setting of the Tondo sale price several years before actual project comple-
tion, which reduced direct charges to one third of what they should have
been. Indirect charges under utility tarrifs as well as profits on commer-
cial/industrial units were not affected. Thus cost recovery was cut from 82%
at appraisal to 65%, of which only about half was direct.
8.05      Land in Tondo Foreshore was, in effect, given away at P5 per m2
making the replication of the Tondo model highly unlikely. Even in the Dagat-
Dagatan Phase I site, land prices were not reflective of real values, making
the replication of such a project infeasible without substantial downward
adjustments in infrastructure standards.
8.06      Collections have only been effectively underway for a year or two,
an insufficient period on which to base any significant conclusion. The
initial collection efficiency of 54% established in NHA's first year of
serious collection effort clearly requires improvement. The Authority has
formulated an action program to address this crucial issue.
8.07      Thus, even if priced right in subsequent projects, low income
mortgages have yet to be proven collectable and financially sound
investments. Until this occurs, there is little hope of attracting
significant private capital and scaling up into high volume production more
commensurate with need. However, the recent collection initiatives by NHA
give reason for optimism. Financial performance often lags physical



144
performance by substantial margins, and intensive follow-up is beginning to
yield improved performance in this vital aspect.
8.08      The project initiated Bank operations in the shelter sector in the
Philippines. Issues and objectives of subsequent Bank work in this sector
have expanded beyond the fairly specific objectives of this first
demonstration project.
B. Loan Covenants
8.09      Loan covenants were generally complied with (Annex D), with the
major exception of the pricing policy and cost recovery performance which
became highly politicized, and the failure to reimburse NHA for infrastructure
built on behalf of other Ministries.
C. Lessons
8.10      In addition to the observations noted in para 5.24 regarding Bank
performance, a number of lessons can be drawn from this first project which
should prove useful in future sectoral operations:
(a) Size of "demonstration" projects: As a demonstration, Tondo was
overly ambitious. A gargantuan and challenging project for even a
highly experienced agency, Tondo's upgrading quite overwhelmed the
NHA's fledgling capacities in this kind of new operation. Mistakes
were highly visible, politicized, large scale - and thus not easily
rectified. A smaller, less conepicuous target area would probably
not, however, have been politically acceptable. Pressures were
intense to "do something" about the living conditions in the
Foreshore and neither Government nor the NHA would have been
amenable to a less ambitious project;
(b) Land Acquisition: The protracted delays in expropriating land in
Tondo and Dagat Dagatan have cast serious doubts upon the viability
of any large scale, high volume housing program which must rely upon
expropriation as the primary vehicle of land acquisition. The
Authority is exploring the affordability impact of shifting to land
purchase at market values, limiting expropriation to only
exceptional cases of which upgrading would probably constitute the
majority. Higher land prices would have to be offsct by lower
infrastrucutre standards and costs. However, the standards utilized
for both Tondo and Dagat-Dagatan offer ample scope for reductions;
(c)  Premature Pricing:  The prices set in 1978 under PD1314 proved
premature though the decision was taken after much deliberation and
in collaboration with the Bank. Actual completion occurred only
four years later and at double the expected cost. The community
wanted and needed to know the approximate monthly charges they were
expected to pay. However, once set, these prices rigidified and
could not be adjusted to reflect final actual costs. As a result,
the NHA subsidized the project to the extent of about P-80 million
(US$7.5 million). This represented a fairly common quandary in the



145
Bank's first generation projects. The NHA is subsequently trying a
new approach to pricing by (i) indicatinS a tentative initial price
to the counity    (ii) jointly updating this price every few months
in collaboration with the community's representatives to establish
the flexibility of the price and explain reasons for price
adjustment; (iii) reducing completion time by tackling much smaller
sites (e.g. Zonal Improvement Program) which in turn should modify
price escalation, and, where this is not feasible (iv) pricing
larger sites in phases. With these measures the NHA hopes to avoid
the premature pricing problem;
(d) Pricing/Cross-subsidy: A number of charges which should have been
incorporated into sales prices were not, resulting in losses to VNI.
These costs will ultimately have to be either subsidized by govern-
ment grant infusions or written off from NHA's capital. The most
prominent among these include pre-development costs (feasibility
studies, survey, etc.), interest during construction, marketing and
sales documentation, general administration, maintenance of infra-
structure prior to turnover, and collections default allowances. A
revised pricing policy has been prepared by NHA identifying the full
range of costs incurred during project development - a proportion of
which were unexpected - and proposing recovery of most through l.t
sales.
A second major pricing lesson has been drawn from the disappointing
performance of cross-subsidies (para 4.04). Proposals are under
study for dropping cross-subsidy (though not differential pricing)
and pricing all units to at least fully cover actual development
costs;
(e)  Community Commitments:  Promises made by NHA to the Tondo community
to gain goodwill and cooperation proved expensive over the longer
haul. Specifically, the cotuitment that collections would not begin
until tenure (title) was delivered and all services were operational
in effect took the control of collection start-up out of NHA's own
hands and subjected it to the viscitudes of the court-dominated
expropriation process and to fluctuations in other agencies'
priorities. Though the Authority later regretted the practical
consequences of this promise, it would have been difficult to avoid
making this kind of statement under the conditions of hostility and
suspicion prevailing at the time of project startup;
(f) Contract Size/Supervision: Local contracting capabilities were
overestimated at appraisal, with all contracts grouped into one
overall package. The subsequent default of the contractor and
disaggregations of the package into smaller contracts was responsi-
ble for significant delays. Since then, contracts have been smaller
and better tailored to local capacities. Supervision was also
initially too loose, and there was laxity in the imposition of
penalties which resulted in unreasonable time extensions. While
numerous lessons have been learned and applied in tightening NHA's
contract supervision, scope still exists for further improvement;
(g) Turnover: The eventual difficulties NHA encountered in turning over
completed infrastructure point to inadequacies in interagency
coordination. The Memoranda of Agreement were signed well after the
completion of infrastructure (6/82 for KWSS and 12/84 for MPWH), and



146
did not prevent extensive dickering over asset values and ossociated
debt liabilities. Earlier and more explicit agreements were
needed. The legal agreements on Urban I were rather vague on the
subject of theme transfers. Under Urban III, loan covenants have
been tightened and are more explicit regarding the obligations of
MMC and MWSS in receiving the assets and debt obligation associated
with infrastructure developed by NHA and MPWH. These agreements my
not, however, prevent repeated difficulties, especially if costs
substantially exceed those anticipated at appraisal. Ideally the
parent ministry or agency should itself provide at least trunk
infrastructure. Practically, however, this may not be done in a
timely manner, and the lack of key infrastructure can obstruct the
sale/occupancy of a site. The price for NHA's independence in
infrastructure provision may turn out to be constant vigilance in
sustaining closer, more effective interagency cooperation;
(h) Core Units/Building Materials Loans: In contrast to initial
expectations, there was litle use of materials selvaged from
demolished shanties in constructing new dwellings in Dagat-
Dagatan. Most families purchased new materials. In addition,
households frequently tore down elements of the more complete core
units and altered the structure to better suit their personal
preferences. Toilets were frequently replaced as well. Thus
considerable initial savings could have been achieved by reducing
the core to an absolute minimum. This, in fact, has been done in
subsequent phases of both Dagat-Dagatan and the Pasig site. Build-
ing material loan amounts of P3,500 (US$330) were considered too
low, and the range and stock of materials supplied by NHA
inadequate. The length of time required to process a loan was also
considered by staff and borrowers to be excessive; and
(i)  Renter's Policy:  No policy was initially established regarding
renters, who turned out to constitute fully half of all Tondo
residents. Multiple occupancy of structures turned out to be much
higher than anticipated. The NHA came under considerable pressure
to treat renters eouitably by providing to them tenure opportuni-
ties. The Author.ty contemplated and rejected joint plot ownership
proposals, and ultimately ended up utilizingl5, large number of plots
in the Dagat-Dagatan site for Tondo renters.      These lots have
therefore not been available to meet new demand from growth and thus
to stem the spread of squatters. Instead they served to reduce
overcrowding in Tondo. An additional drawback is that room renters
are acknowledged to be poor affordability risks and thus more likely
to resell or default. There is also distinct likelihood of an
influx of "renters" prior to upgrading in order to jump the large
queue awaiting allocation of a serviced site. The NHA is now
formulating a policy on renters and contemplating the tradeoffs
between its desire to serve the total community and the urgent need
to meet demand from new growth, and recover costs.
15/ As of the time of writing, a total of 7,800 units in Dagat Dagatan have
been allocated, all of which have been for resettlement and a portion of
which have been for Tondo renters.



147
8.11      Many of the lessons of Urban I have already been incorporated into
lOA's procedures. Others raise complex issues involving difficult tradeoffs
and are under study. Overall, however, a great deal of learning has occurred
through this project which is relevant not just to lHA's future work, but to
that of other agencies involved in both the financing and production of
serviced sites and upgrading programs world-wide.

PROJECT COIMLETION REPORT
Traffic Ma "ae ent Co  one nt
1.            Project period                            1977-83
Total component cost including:             P 120 milllon
Civil works, equipment *nd                Bank financing:  P 50 milllon
Technical assistance:
Largest component                            Computer controlled traffic signal
system (104 intersections and
8 aid-block pedestrlan crossing)
including closed circuit TV and
spare parts at total coat of
P 52 milllon.
Principal conclusion                        The traffic signal system reduced
traffic delays by 171, increased
peak hour travel speeds by 102,
while allowing traffic volumes to
increase by 82 to 582 according to
route. Estimated annual fuel
savings are at least 4.7 million
liters. Total accidents have beeft
reduced 272 and casualty accidents
142.
2.        The subcomponent and their degree of effectiveness are given below:
Traffic Signal System                       very successful - about 302 IRn;
second phase being installed
Pedestrian barriers in median               very effective; crossings were
channeled for desired locations
Pedestrian barriers at curb                 effective to not effective;
dependent on enforcement and
public transit availability.
Radio network (for police deployment        very effective; deployment of
and traffic control)                      staff to critical areas is
successful.
Closed Circuit TV (CCTV)                    very effective; assisted in
visualizing problem areas In
traffic control system
8uc/PUJ lanes                               reasonably good self policing;
enforcement needs to be improved



Pase 2
156
Bus/Jeepney waiting sheds                    generally effective - too many
hawkers at a*os locations
No loading/unloading signs                   very unsuccessful - poor enforce-
ment
3. Traffic Enforcement Very Bad
(a) 2-32 of drivers violate Intersection rules; up to 242 at some inter-
sections.
(b) at signalized intersections 11.52 pedestrians ignore "redman" sig.
nal.
(c) at pedestrian only crossings, 752 of pedestrians ignored "redman"
signal (this design solution will no longer be used).
(d) "no loading/unloading" signs useless due to poor enforcement.
4.  Staff Develoment and Training of Traffic Nanagemt Unit (TEM)
(a) high turnover rate, engineers are in high demand
(b) long term consultant inputs paid off; cannot expect much payoff in
1-2 year inputs. TEAM still needs lilited specialized technical
assistance.
(c) consultant assisted on-the-job training was *ore useful than formal
training courses in foreign countries.

PROJECT COFLETIOW REPORT
Housins Agencies in the Ptilippines
A.   Financial Asoncies
(1)  Hoam  Develoment Mutural Fund:  ND   ot "PACIBIc" is a mandatory
provident fund (refundable payroll taz) for all forml sector
employes and employers. About 851 of stipulated 'contributions"
*re passed on to the National Rom Mortgage Finance Corporation
(NMUPC) which in turn purchases primary mortgages granted to HDKW's
members from loan-originating instituions. MEWMC currently pays 121
interest to HDOF for use of its funds. This covers EDW's operating
expenses oad dividend payments on members accounts, currently 102.
(2)  National Rome Mortpae IFinance Corporations MMC is a secondary
mortgage institution which purchases first mortgages from loan-
originating institutions. NMIMC invests HDfP trust funds in short-
term time deposits and government securities, and floats bonds to
raise additional resources. Bonds are currently offered at 151.
The mortgages it purchases yield 91 and 161, depending on lending
criteria.
(3) Moms Financing Corporation: HFC insures all residential mortgages
purchased by MIC and housing construction loans. Other mortgages
can also be insured by HEC, but these represent only a small percen-
tage (perhaps 101) of home loans originated in the Philippines.
B.   Production Agencies
(1) National Housing Authority: A currently is the only government
agency engaged in volume production of low-income housing projects,
largely with World Bank loans and government equity and subsidy
contributions. Serviced sites and slum upgrading constitute most of
Mil's program, with some resettlement, new construction and somll
business loan activity. The agency produces over 17,000 units per
year. NHA originates long-term mortgages which to date the NHMPC
has not yet purchased.
(2) Human Settlements Development Corporation: HSDC is primarily
involved in the shelter sector through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
the BLISS Development Corporation, which constructs about 2,000
subsidized apartments and high- to medium-cost units per year. The
BLISS program was established to demonstrate to the private sector
that moderate cost housing could be profitable. The private sector
has responded by starting to build both moderate cost and mixed



160
income housing, crrently putting BLSS in direct com    tition with
the private sector.
(3) lltional lousinA Corwratio:: INC produces and warehouses building
wtorisrol    hbieb it **IIl to go"enmt agencies and private
developers. Currntly, NBC's mjor udertaking is the production of
"flexibomes", prefabricated units wbich the Covernnt hopes to
produce at low cost for low-income failies. NRC's goal is mas
production to reduco materials costs.
C.   Reulatory &genc
(1)   uman Settlements  egulatory Comissiont IsaC implemets all laws
and regulations relatinsg to housing development and construction,
including soning, land use and subdivision requirements. Until
recently, the regulatory process for approval of housing projects
was lengthy, but ISRC has successfully eut the processing time from
siz months to as little as two weeks. BSRC's most important accom-
plisbmect has been to revise the building code and subdivision
standards to mko thm more compatible with sites and services
projects, eabling private developers to legally penetrate lower
cost markets.
In addition to the above agencies which are directi.y under the
authority of MHS, the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) and the
Social Security Systm (SS) offer mortgage loans to their members at low
interest rates and for smaller amounts than the RDHF-NHHC-HFC system. In
turn, they are reaching somewhat lower income groups than the [ES finance
system, though not as low as the beneficiaries of the National Housing
Authority's projects. The GSIS and SSS are not, however, major contributors
to shelter finance.

Mr. Yukinori Watanabe
Director
Operations Evaluation Department
World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20433
U. S. A.
Dear Mr. Watanabe:
This has reference to the final draft of the Project Completion
Report (PCR) on Tondo Foreshore Project. Once again, I would like
to express my appreciation for giving us the opportunity to comment
on the draft report.
We have reviewed the above-mentioned report and we noted that
certain statements in the report which we previously proposed to be
changed or deleted in the 6rlier drafts of the PCR, have been
retained in this final draft.
In particular, I would like to reiterate our concern over
certain items which as discussed in the report, may undermine the
shelter program for marginal and low income families as a whole.
We propose that the treatment of the item be presented as follows:
1. Cost Recovery.(p._12 para 3.10)
Iniitially, cost recovery wasone of 'the weakest
aspects of project implementation because of the slow
start-up of collections in Tondo. Recent figures,
however, show considerable impruvemeEnt
2.  Profits from C/I Areas (p.23 Para 5.03)
In the review of the performance of the comnercial/
industrial areas, the case of the Vitas should be
considered. Although the sale of lots from this area was
included in the computation of project financial perform-
ance, the revenues from commercial areas do not include
the Vitas Industrial area.

3.  Institutional Performance and DeveloMent (p.34 Para 6.17)
To dismiss the project's institutional objectives
as limited to building NHA's production capacity is
incorrect. The Tondo project was envisioned to be the
Model Project for the Authority's Slum Upgrading Program
throughout the country.
4. Cost Overruns (p. 19 Para 4.08)
The term cost overrun immediately implies poor
management on the part of the Authority but this is not
true in the case of the Tondo Foreshore Project. The
cost differential between actual project cost and esti-
mates in Staff Appraisal Report is due to several factors
identified as follows:
(a) for Tondo, delays in start-up, underestimated
quantiities for lan' fill and reclamation work
due to unforeseen jbsurface conditions and
obstructions; and the generally higher labor
and materials costs owing to major petroleum
increases.
(b) for Da at-Dagatan, land fOst was higher than
appraisal estimate; recima tion work was
higher and the construction of sewer system
increased from original estimates.
(c)  for roads and bridges, major delays in start-up.
(d) for several outfall increased -cope of work
for interceptor and watermain c ross the
C-2 highway.
EWe therefore, propose to substitute the term cost
variance for cost overrun. This term appropriately
describes the difference between the actual project
cost and the cost estimates in thn report s.nce these
two sets of figures (i.e., the actual cost and the
estimates) are not comparable.
The details of the above and some of our comments on other
matters are attached.
Thank you for your continuing support
Very 'ruly yours,
G. Vl TOBIAS

Recommend that this be added -
One reason for   "overruns'"   >
with reference to all project
components was the low level of
physical and pricecontingencies
applied by the World Bank in the
SAR. Cost differential has been
due to several factors among
which are the following:
a. for Tondo, delays in start-up
underestimated quantities for
land fill and reclamation work
where cost variance occured due
to unforeseen subsurface con-
ditions and obstructions, and
the generally higher labor and
materials costs resulting from X
the major petroleum price
increases of 1978/79;

b. for Dagat-Dagatan, land cost

reclamation cost was higher and
the construction of sewer sYstem

Dear Mr. Watanabe:
RE: Project Completion Report on Philippines - Manila tlrban
revelppment Project (1.oan 1282/1272 - W'-PH)
Thank you for sending us a copy of the abovemertioned report and for
allowing us to give our comments.
Overall, WF think that the teport is very comrprehensive and has correctlyJ
analyzed the critical factors behind the project's perforrnance, a first
of its kind in the Philippines and in the entire Rank operations. It
contains many useful informatioA, for future Bank assistance to the
Philippines as well as to other developing countries. We observed that
in addition to the project's overall implementation experience, a
substantial portion has been devoted to NHA's institutional maturation
and to the project's cost recovery problem. Tie report in effect appears
to be audit/assessment Of the project as a whole. We would like,
ho6ever, to touch further on the following areas:
1. Project Preparatlon and ]7esirn
1'le recornize the ur'-ent need for the project especially during
the period of its inception.  In retrospect, hoever, we note that
the project's basic weakness appears to have been its inadequate
preparation which led to substantial time overruns. Many elements
of the work were not simply foreseen or were not adequately allowed
for in the schedule. The sequencing of work and orchestration of
clearance and settlerment wlere noz well ur.derstood (par. 406). Road
and other rights-of-way had not been fully cleared when construction
started. The poor soil conditions, flat terrain and absence of
drainage have not been adequately anticipated (par. 406 (c)) which
would later have a bearing on drainage conditions in adjacent towns.

The experimental nature of the project, as w11 as the sen-
sitive issues involved, e.g., relocation of squatters, necessitates
a mow thorough understandihg of local situations and culture.
Start-up difficulties and the considerable confusion which existed
duri:.:- inlitial years of implementation (par. 406 (f))could have been
avoided had there been adequate lead timw for intensive counity
camraign for the necessity of the project. It was reported that
dela-.-s wre encomtered because residents refused to be relocated.
Rela:edly, the beneficiaries could have been informed if not
allowed to participate in the determination of charges they were
supp:sed to pay prior to project start-up. This could have pre-
vente I the anxiety on the part of the community to know what price
they were supposed to pay for their lots (par. 5.08) which necessi-
tate_ the issuance of PD 1314. Also the problems on collection and
cost recovery being encountered by the proponent could have been
avoi;ed had there been enougb community campaign.
2. Maintenance of Project Assets
We recognize the nece3sity of adequate maintenance in order to
achieve the desired level of benefits and to avoid wastage in
fina.:iaJl resources. The problem should be given its proper  focus,
i.e., how this requirement of maintenance could be met. Participation
of beneficiaries should also be encouraged.
3. Project Delays
It would be worthwhile to know whether the project suffered
delays in the delivery of project benefits and to what extent if
ever, as a consequence of delayed project completion and turn-over.
Relatedly, the matter of disappointing cross-subsidy (par. 5.04)
can partly be attributed to the delayed completion. It would be like-
wise informative if time overrun per component could be documented.
4. Selection of Project Beneficiaries
The screening process and Friteria adopted in the selection of
pro,ect beneficiaries as well ai a profile of existing beneficiaries
cou'- be discussed. The criteria for priority allocation could be
usef-:' reference for similar projects in the future. Moreover, the
infcriation would be useful in determining whether the project has
real'y reached the poor squatter families.
5. Stat- .s of Awarding of Titles
The report could make mention of the latest status of awarding
of titles to beneficiaries.

6. Monitorinrg of Project Outcome
The experimental chRracter of the project also suggests the
need for careful mor.itoring and evaluation of results.
We hope that our cc*ments will be helpful in the finalization of the PCR.
Best regards.
Very truly yours,
ANTONIO M. LOCSIN

SUGGESTED MODIXFCATIONS
page 14 CHAPTER UII MJOR RESULTS
3.11 To render this component more effective and responsive
to the traffic needs of the area, supplemntal works
were authorized to be undortaken. At the time of wri-
ting. the original works have been completed while the
said supplemental works are expected to be completed
mid 1986. Although costs exc*ded the estimates during
appraisal, project impacts indicate that the roads and
bridges component have substantively fulfilled its
objectives. Original implementation scheduloe should
have been timed to allow relocation/res*ttl*ment of
*ffected improvements/dwellings. In retrospect. the
process of cl*aring the right-of-way could have in-
cluded measures to secure cleared areas before con-
struction could really take off.
page 14 CHAPTER IV PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
B. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
4.03 With the delay in project implementation attributed
mainly to right-of-way problems. unrealistic encalation
cost projections which led to the termination of origi-
nal construction contracts and considering that the
original scope of work has increased by about 110%. the
roads and bridges component lagged substantially behind
the overall project, requiring nine years to complete.
While project performance was significantly behind app-
raisal estimates, ultimately the needed major roads and
bridge facilities became operational in time to provide
the needed access and relief to the worsening traffic
congestion in the area.
4.04 Roads and Bridges: Delay in the roads and bridge com-
ponent was largely traceable to lack of working area
and delayed implementation. The extended implement-
ation period for the roads and bridges component
could summarily be attributed to the following factors:
1. Termination of the original contracts bid in 7
December 1978 and finally approved March 20.
193S. Unrealistic escalation cost projections
and delayed implementation led to the termina-
tion of the contracts.
2. Lack of working area due to non-availability of
right-of-way. The social problem of resettling/
relocation of affected families hampered the
clearing of the right-of-way due to issuance of
numerous courtiinjunctions and restraining orders.
3. Expanded scope of work to include connecting roads
and bridges and other facilities to render the

project more effective and responsive to traffic
needs.
It may be recalled that inter-agency efforts were
involved in this undertaking, i.e.. substantial portion
of the right-of-way had to be secured through NMA before
road construction could take off.

4.08 (b) for the roads and bridges major delays in start-up
of actual construction due to termination of original
contracts, non-available right-of-way and increased
construction costs resulting from the energy crisis.
Field conditions also warranted substantial   changes
in quantity take-off not anticipated during detailed
engineering.
