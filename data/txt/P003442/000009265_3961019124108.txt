MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:         Project Completion Report on China
Fourth Industrial Credit Project (Loan 2783-CHA/Credit 1763-CHA)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the China Fourth Industrial Credit project
(Loan 2783/Credit 1763-CHA, approved FY87) prepared by the East Asia and Pacific, Regional Office
with Part II of the report contributed by the Borrower.
The project was the fourth line-of-credit to the China Investment Bank (CIB), a state-owned
development finance institution providing finance for the restructuring and technological upgrading of
industrial enterprises. Its main objectives were to increase the productivity and efficiency of
small- and medium-scale industries and strengthen the institutional capabilities of CIB. The project was
implemented successfully, although with some delays due to a slow down in investment activity
following the Tiannanmen Square incident of June 1989.
The line-of-credit supported 228 subloans for the modernization and expansion of mainly state-
owned enterprises.  An ex-post evaluation of the financial and technical performance of these
subprojects has not be carried out. But the low, albeit increasing, level of CIB's arrears suggests that
the financial performance of most is satisfactory. The technical assistance component helped improve
the CIB's project appraisal capabilities, but was less effective in strengthening its monitoring activities.
The project outcome is rated as marginally satisfactory. Institutional development is rated as modest
and sustainability as uncertain.
The PCR is satisfactory. However, it does not provide an adequate sectoral background against
which issues of project relevance and efficacy can be carefully judged. At the time the PCR was
prepared, the future status of the CIB was uncertain. The CIB had proposed that it be converted into
a commercial bank, whereas the Government's idea was to consolidate CIB into the operations of the
People's Construction Bank of China. More recently, the decision was taken to establish the CIB as
a fully-owned subsidiary of the People's Construction Bank of China, but the corporate structure and
degree of autonomy that CIB will have under the new arrangement is not yet known.
A cluster audit of this and the follow-on project - the Fifth Industrial Credit Project (Loan 3075-
CHA, approved in FY89) is planned. The audit would attempt to analyze the performance of
subprojects and the sustainability and performance of CIB under its new organizational set-up.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
FOURTH INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT (CIB IV)
(LOAN 2783-CHA/CREDIT 1763-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth Industrial Credit
Project in China for which Loan 2783-CHA for $250 million and Credit 1763-CHA for
SDR 40.9 million were approved on March 3, 1987. The Project was closed on June 30,
1993, 12 months behind schedule. The Loan and Credit were fully disbursed and the last
disbursement was on October 13, 1993.
The PCR (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) was prepared by
the Industry and Energy Operations Division, China and Mongolia Department. The Bank
received Part II from the Borrower in January 1994 for inclusion in the PCR.
Preparation of the PCR was started during a supervision mission of the
Project in March 1993 and followed by a PCR mission in April 1994. The PCR is based
the President's Report, Staff Appraisal Report, Loan Credit and Project Agreements,
Supervision Reports, Bank's Disbursement Summaries, and draft PCR prepared by the
Borrower as well as progress reports and audited financial statement of the China
Investment Bank.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
FOURTH INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT (CIB IV)
(LOAN 2783-CHA/CREDIT 1763-CHA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.          Objectives. The Fourth Industrial Credit Project (CIB IV) was the fourth
of a series of five credit projects to the China Investment Bank (CIB). It was intended to
continue to assist the Government of China (GOC) to promote technology upgrading and
modernization of the light industry sector as well as the further institutional development
of CIB; CIB was also expected to initiate diversification of its sources of funds and
products/services and develop into an autonomous, efficient and viable financial
intermediary in industrial finance. The Project had two components: a credit line to CIB
of $299.3 million and a technical assistance component of $0.7 million. The Project was
approved on March 3, 1987, the legal documents signed on March 16, 1987 and became
effective on June 22, 1987 within the scheduled date.
2.          Implementation Experience. The Project was implemented successfully
despite some difficulties and both Loan and Credit were fully disbursed. The Closing Date
was extended by one year which was necessitated mainly by the slack in investment
activities following the Tiananmen Square incident of June 1989. Under the Project,
improvement in CIB's efforts to diversify its sources of funds and products/services was
notable in terms of local currency deposit base and working capital financing; in terms of
long-term operations, the improvement was marginal. CIB's arrears have been a growing
concern and needs to be tackled as early as possible to prevent a financially unsustainable
situation. The issue of the future role of CIB within the changing environment in the
financial sector in China remains important. CIB has itself proposed to become a full-
fledged commercial bank, but this has remained unresolved for sometime. On the
contrary, it has been proposed recently that CIB be consolidated into PCBC. In line with
GOC's reform policies for the financial sector which promote competition and market-
oriented operations, the Bank believes that the original objective of establishing a relatively
small but efficient and viable CIB is still valid and achievable but only with adequate
support and commitment from GOC, PBC and other related agencies as well as strong
leadership and competent management. Attainment of the objectives under the Project (as
well as previous Bank industrial credit projects) and the sustainability of CIB now depends
on the resolution of its future role and indeed, on its very existence as a separate and
independent financial institution.
3.          Findings and Lessons. Together with GOC and PCBC, the Bank was
instrumental in the establishment of CIB which was the first of many new financial



- iv -
institutions to emerge in China during the early 1980s. Bank's financing through CIB has
made available foreign exchange resources for the much needed technical renovation
projects in the light industry sector. Under the Project, the Bark has helped CIB towards
achieving its objectives: (a) the Bank contributed significantly in developing CIB's project
appraisal capacity not only through CIB's appraisal manual which is now extensively used
throughout China but also in terms of continuing training and feedback advice during
supervision and subproject reviews; (b) with encouragement from the Bank to diversify its
sources of funds, CIB has developed a reasonably successful deposit base for short-term
local currency resources; (c) CIB has developed a sizable branch network, albeit with the
support and assistance from PCBC and with the Bank's urging, most of these branches now
have full-time presidents; and (d) under the Bank's guidance and technical assistance
funding, CIB has developed a core staff which are well-trained and experienced in project
finance. At the same time, there are still a number of aspects in which the Bank should
continue to assist CIB's improvement, e.g., project/loan supervision and collection,
corporate and financial planning, mobilization of long-term resources, And overall assets
and liabilities management.
4.           Under the CIB IV and other Bank projects with CIB, some of the lessons
which may be learned would include the following. First, in establishing new financial
institutions, there needs to be not only full commitment, support and clear ownership from
the GOC as implementing agency but also a clear understanding and agreement on the
long-term objectives of such institutions. In retrospect, there really was no full agreement
on the long-term objectives for CIB. CIB was always considered by GOC merely as a way
to channel Bank funds through the leadership of PCBC, thus the apparent lack of support
for its development as an independent financial institution. The Bank could have accepted
this much earlier in its relationship with CIB and pursued more aggressively a clear
agreement and a more permanent solution to CIB's independence and long-term role.
5.           Second, although the Bank has consistently emphasized the importance of
project supervision and collection, there were perhaps inadequate programs for training and
project requirements for appropriate organization and procedures for the activities under
the Bank project. Furthermore, it was only after the fifth CIB Project (Loan 3075-CHA)
that specific performance indicators such as collection ratios, were included in the design
of CIB projects. These indicators would have been useful, effective tools and an incentive
for the Bank to monitor and for CIB to develop its project supervision and financial
performance which are key to its long-term viability. For example, under CIB V, without
the specific targets agreed for the provisions for doubtful debts, CIB would not have been
allowed to build such reserves.
6.           Third, CIB's diversification of resources should have been pursued more
aggressively. Specific targets as adopted under CIB V could have been initiated earlier
under the Project. Furthermore, the slow implementation and unclear direction of reforms
in the financial sector during the Project implementation greatly influenced CIB's overall
development and performance. For sometime, CIB had virtually no competition for Bank
funds and other suitable financial institutions could have been involved earlier in Bank
projects.

Background
2.          In December 1981, the China Investment Bank (CIB) was established
through a special charter approved by the State Council and was one of the first new
institutions in what was expected to be an increasingly competitive and efficient financial
system in China. At the time the CIB IV was approved in early 1987, the Bank had
already provided $345.6 million in three credit lines to CIB. These three industrial credit
projects I/ were to basically assist in the institutional development of CIB as it provided
assistance, mainly foreign exchange financing, for the restructuring and technical upgrading
of light industrial enterprises. CIB IV (the subject of this PCR) for $300 million and CIB
V for another $300 million,2/ were to follow in 1987 and 1989, respectively, to continue
on the development of CIB as an autonomous, efficient, viable and sound financial
intermediary in industry finance. Because of the expertise it has acquired in project
financing and appraisal, CIB also became an active participant (as financial intermediary
or financial agent) in relending Bank funds in several provincial and sector projects, e.g.,
two projects in Tianjin in 1989 and 1993, Shanghai Industrial Development Project in
1991, Rural Industrial Technology Project (SPARK) in 1990, Beijing Environment Project

in 1992, Medium Cities Project in 1992, Southern Jiangsu Environment Project in 1993
and more recently in ODS II Project in 1993.   These projects involve Bank funds
amounting to $2,070 million; loans in which CIB would absorb the full credit risks amount
to about $1,215 million or 60 percent, the balance would be on a financial agency basis,
i.e., no credit risk to CIB.
3.          This PCR covers CIB IV (the Project).  It describes the objectives,
components, and main features of the Project and Bank Loan/ Credit, reviews CIB's
performance on project implementation and provides institutional, financial, and
operational background on CIB as well as the results of project specific analyses, and
highlights some of the conclusions and lessons learned from the Project.
Project Objectives and Description
4.           The basic objective 3! of the Project was to assist the Government of
China (GOC) to promote and implement technology upgrading and modernization in
industry, to build up sound procedures and competent staff for project appraisal and
investment financing, and to improve financial intermediation practices. The project would
also further strengthen the influence of CIB in the decision making process of concerned
government agencies and industrial enterprises relating to industrial investment.
Specifically, the Project was to continue financing high priority industrial investments
through CIB and assistance to the institutional development of CIB so that it could operate
efficiently and become a model and catalyst in the ongoing reforms of the investment
design and selection system in China. CIB was also expected to diversify its sources of
financing by raising resources from international and domestic capital markets. The
Project had two major components: a credit line of $299.3 million and $0.7 million in
technical assistance to support the training of CIB staff.
5.          Main Features of the Bank Loan/IDA Credit. Similar to previoul projects
with CIB, the People's Republic of China (PRC) was the borrower of the Bank Loan and
IDA Credit. The proceeds were relent to CIB for 20 yeai s including a grace period of five
years with CIB being allowed to rollover the funds. CIB's subloans would normally not
extend beyond seven years but the longest maturity should in no case exceed twelve years.
Similar to CIB I through III, the GOC will charge CIB a fixed interest rate 7 percent and
GOC will absorb the variable interest rate risks. CIB's obligations to GOC and CIB's
subloans will be denominated in US Dollars with GOC absorbing the foreign exchange
risks between the US Dollar and Bank's currency pool index for the Bank Loan and SDR
for the IDA Credit. For its subloans, CIB will charge an interest rate of no less than
8.5 percent (similar to CIB III but up from 8.0 percent for CIB I and II).

6.          Eligibility Criteria of Subloans.4/ All the subprojects to be financed out
of the Bank Loan/Credit were to meet the following eligibility criteria: (a) subprojects
would be in the manufacturing sector and have a minimum financial and economic rate of
return of 12 percent; (b) projects in the heavy industries would be eligible only for
modernization or energy/material savings; (c) aggregate subloan to a single enterprise
should not exceed $15 million equivalent; and (d) borrowing enterprises/companies should
have satisfactory projected financial operations and position. Initial CIB "free-limits"
under the Project were as follows: $2.5 million on subloans from its branches in
Shanghai, Tianjin and Jiangsu, $1.5 million for branches in Hebei, Hubei, Fujian,
Lioaning, Anhui and Zhejiang, and $1.0 million for its other 10 branches. To encourage
more delegation of decision making responsibility and with the improving appraisal
capabilities of the branches, the Bank's free-limits to CIB were to be twice CIB's own free-
limits to its individual branches (under CIB V). CIB's current free-limits with the Bank
are: $4.0 million for its branches in Shanghai, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hebei, $2.0
million for Hubei, Fujian, Lioaning, Anhui, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Beijing, Hunan,
Jilin, Guangdong, Shenyang, Dalian, Qingdao, and Guangzhou, and $1.0 million for the
other 12 branches.
Project Implementation
7.          Loan Effectiveness and Implementation Schedule.  The Project was
approved by the Bank on March 3, 1987; the Loan, Credit, and Project Agreements were
signed on March 16, 1987 and became effective on June 22, 1987 within the scheduled
date. The original Closing Date was June 30, 1992 but was extended by one year to June
30, 1993 and the Loan Account was actually closed on October 13, 1993. The delay was
due mainly to the general slow down in investment activity resulting from the Tiannanmen
Square incident in June 1989. In fact, CIB had no additional commitments under the
Project in the 1990/91 period. However, two other factors contributed to the slow
utilization. The Bank had held processing and approval of several subprojects until CIB
provided satisfactory clarifications on its interest rate policies, e.g., CIB was charging
interest rates of lower than 8.5 percent which is the minimum agreed under the Project.
It was also only at the latter end of 1992 that CIB initiated cancellations of subloans with
no amounts disbursed and subloans with some undisbursed balances which were no longer
required by the subproject. This created a large unallocated portion under the Loan and
Credit for which CIB had to present other eligible subprojects. This caused further delays
since many of the subprojects presented could not be authorized under the Loan/ Credit
due to the short disbursement period remaining (six months) and due to grounds of
eligibility, e.g., the subloans were to be provided to CIB's clients who in turn, would use
the proceeds to finance their equity investments in separate joint venture companies.
Despite these difficulties, both Loan and Credit were fully disbursed with no cancellations.

Institutional Aspects
8.          CIB's Role. During the Project, the future role of CIB within the changing
environment in the financial sector surfaced as the important issue for CIB, GOC, and the
Bank. It became apparent that CIB showed limited progress in diversifying its fund
sourcing and its products and services. It continued to show dependence on Bank funds
with its access to the market subject to GOC approval which was limited and at times not
available . Indeed, a development strategy for CIB agreed between GOC and the Bank
was crucial for the future development of CIB into an autonomous and viable financial
institution in China. This strategy was developed during the preparation of CIB V which
was approved in 1989. It spelled out the need for CIB to function more independently as
a banking institution, to provide a wider range of products and services and to mobilize
foreign and local resources from varied sources including the capital markets through
issuance of long-term bonds. This strategy had some but limited successes. CIB was able
to raise funds from the Asian Development Bank, KfW of Germany, and some token
amounts in commercial credits from Japan, Hongkong, and Europe. With local currency
funds no longer available from GOC, CIB expanded fairly successfully its deposit
mobilization and working capital loans despite limitations to enterprise deposits only. By
1993, CIB had significant international operations in terms of foreign exchange settlements
and transactions and under CIB V, initiated a small number of equity investments and lease
financings. By this time, CIB's major operations were closer to those of a commercial
bank. However, CIB was still not fully under the jurisdiction or supervision of the
People's Bank of China (PBC) and thus, could not avail of borrowings from PBC.
9.          In 1992, and to settle the issue of its role in the financial sector, CIB had
proposed to become a full-fledged commercial bank subject to the approval of GOC. PBC,
and PCBC. The Bank had no objection to this proposal provided a satisfactory strategy
including appointment of qualified management, was implemented with the appropriate
technical assistance.  In January 1994, however, the Bank was informed t. GOC's
intention to consolidate CIB into PCBC. The Bank's position5/ was that the original
objective of establishing a relatively small but efficieitt and viable CIB is still valid
particularly in line with GOC's reform policies for the financial sector which promote
competition and market-oriented operations. One of the major objectives of the ongoing
reforms in the financial sector in China is to "enhance competition within the framework
of a sound and transparent institutional and regulatory infrastructure." New banks are
being licensed including joint-venture and foreign banks. Under this environment, CIB's
proposal would seem feasible. However, the success of an institution such as CIB would
depend on the support and commitment of GOC, PBC, and other agencies to ensure
adequate autonomy, strong leadership and competent management. Another aspect is the
need to corporatize the "new" CIB and transform it into a limited liability shareholding
company. The shareholders would include the GOC, financial institutions/banks and
eventually individuals. To attain improved access to the international markets and know-

how in modem banking, foreign equity participation in the new CIB should seriously be
considered.
10.         Policies and Strategies. CIB's Policy and Development Strategy Statements
which were revised in September 1986 as part of the appraisal of CIB IV, are the basic
guidelines for its operations. Under the Project, it remained a specialized bank designated
by the GOC to raise foreign exchange resources and provide investment loans to the
enterprises in the industrial sector. The Project initiated the desired shift to diversify the
sources and uses of its funds and attain more management autonomy.  A specific
operational plan for CIB was agreed which covered (a) raising capital market loans of $130
million in 1987 and 1988; (b) appointment of full-time presidents in its branches;
(c) delegation of approval authority to branches according to capability; (d) appointment
of a technical advisor, and recruitment and training of other additional staff; and (e)
creation of an economic and research unit to undertake market and economic analysis of
subprojects, subsector studies and analysis, and monitoring of economic developments in
China and abroad. These were essentially achieved and implemented under the Project
although as of December 31, 1993 full-time presidents were appointed in 27 branches out
of its total 31 branches.
11.         Organization, Management and Staff. Annex A shows the organization
chart of CIB as of December 31, 1993. The main differences from that during the
appraisal of CIB IV are as follows:

Note: Branches without full-time presidents: Ningbo, Hebei, Guangdong, Qingdao.
Prior to 1986, CIB's staff were transfers from PCBC and its presidents both at the head
office and branches were concurrently vice-presidents of the PCBC branches; it was only



- 6 -
in August 1986 that the head office president was appointed on a full time basis as chief
executive officer (CEO). To help attain administrative independence from PCBC, an
emphasis under the Project (included in its agreed operational plan) was the appointment
of full time presidents in all branches by the end of 1988. In 1987, staff recruitment from
the market and outside PCBC was initiated. The issue of autonomy from PCBC remains
an issue to date with four branches still without a full-time president with staff housing and
branch location still provided and determined by PCBC. Under the Project, delegation of
subloan approval authority to the branches was initiated with each branch given a "free
limit" which became the bench mark for CIB's own free limits with the Bank (para. 6).
Operational/Financial Performance of CIB
12.         Loan Operations. Annex B contains CIB's comparative statement of actual
and projected loan operations for 1987-92. CIB's actual and cumulative loan operations
as compared to projections during appraisal were as follows:

13.        In 1985, CIB had an exceptional increase in its loan operations with total
loan approvals reaching Y 973 million or three times that of 1984. The loan demand
continued to increase and led to the Bank's third industrial credit (CIB III) which was
approved in 1986 as "bridging" loan. Due to the developing resource constraints, 1986
approvals decreased slightly. Starting in 1987, CIB's operations reached a new high level
which were about twice the level of 1985 and 1986. This level continued until the first
half of 1989 and the full impact of the political incident of June 1989 was evident in 1990



with foreign currency loan approvals down to less than half of 1989 levels; local currency
loan approvals were minimal in 1990 and showed a negative figure due to cancellations in
1991. As indicated in Table 2, overall loan approvals were about 47 percent of projection
made during appraisals. As shown in Appendix B, actual performance was above
projections prior to 1989 but way below projection after 1989. Besides the political
turmoil in June 1989, the austerity program of GOC during the early 1990s and slow down
in the growth of its resources particularly foreign currency had contributed to the lower
level of operations compared to projections.
14.         Financial/Operational Performance.  A comparative summary of CIB's
financial and operational performance from 1987-92 is shown as Annex C. In terms of
profitability, actual performance was disappointing compared to projections in terms of a
declining trend and much lower level net income. However, actual expansion of its assets
was much higher than projected; e.g., CIB deposits accumulated to Y 6.0 billion which
were not shown in the projection and this lead to a substantial volume of short-term
working capital loans which were about 5 times the projections by the end of 1992. Actual
long-term borrowings in local currency were about 4 times the projected amounts.
Consequently, at the end of 1992, CIB's total assets of Y 23.9 billion ($4.2 billion
equivalent) were almost twice the projected levels; CIB's equity did not increase as much
as projected and its debt/equity ratio exceeded the agreed level (5 times) at about 5.22
times at the end of 1992. In brief, CIB's actual operations and performance are quite
different than projected (para. 9). The actual importance of deposits, working capital
loans, and local currency borrowings to its operations was not fully reflected in the
projections although these operations were not then expected to be major CIB operations.
15.         Quality of Loan Portfolio and Loan Collection Performance. Annex D
contains the breakdown of CIB's arrears as of December 31, 1992. CIB's total arrears
amounted Y 334.47 million and were equivalent to 4.6 percent of total long-term portfolio
(3 percent in  1991) which  is still reasonably  low.   However, the trend  is
worsening-arrears in 1992 increased by 53 percent over those of 1991. The ageing of its
arrears is also deteriorating, e.g., arrears over three months were 93 percent of total in
1992 compared to 59 percent in 1991 and arrears over two years were 43 percent of the
total in 1992 versus 22 percent in 1991. Its collection performance in 1992 was also lower
than in 1991 with collection ratios as follows: 73.4 percent and 78.8 percent for foreign
and local currency long-term loans, respectively; working capital loans had ratios of
96.2 percent for foreign currency and 97.4 percent for local currency.  During the
implementation of the Project, arrears and collection problems became major issues for
CIB. Consequently, starting 1993 and as required under the Bank's Tianjin Industrial
Development Project (TIDP), CIB adopted collection targets as shown in Table 3.
16.         To achieve these collection rates, CIB has adopted several measures to
improve collections including (a) to prepare monthly reports from branches on overdue
accounts for head office analysis and supportive actions; (b) to establish working groups
for collections in branches headed by their presidents; (c) to set up a special fund to
provide short-term loans to overdue accounts experiencing temporary shortage in working
capital; (d) to reschedule repayment terms of selected clients; and (e) to pursue collections

from guarantors. Additional measures which the Bank has recommended are: to examine
CIB's policy on the maturity of its subloans, e.g., there may be a need to provide a longer
repayment period than currently provided which is normally within five years; to undertake
studies in sectors where a substantial portion of arrears is concentrated; to concentrate its
efforts on larger arrears which are overdue for longer periods, i.e., over two years. To
be effective, the above strategies should result in specific actions to be taken within
specific timeframe.
Loan Utilization and Subproject Implementation
17.         Actual Utilization and Disbursements. The Loan and Credit udder the
Project amount to $250 million and SDR 40.9 million respectively, equivalent to
$300 million of which $0.7 million was for technical assistance and the balance of
$299.3 million was for a credit line for onlending to light industry. The number of
subloans and amounts disbursed under the Loan and Credit of the Project are shown in
Table 4. Annex E lists the individual subprojects and amounts disbursed under Bank's
Loan 2783 and Credit 1763-CHA.
18.         As noted in Table 4, the Project provided a total of 228 subloans (net of
cancellations). Seventy-six subloans amounting to $180 million equivalent were above
CIB's free-limit and were reviewed by the Bank; these represented 33 percent of total
subloans by number and 60 percent by amount which is about what was expected during
appraisal. The "above free limit" subloans would have been larger except for the higher
free-limits which were implemented to be consistent with those under CIB V. The average
subloan size was $1.3 million (ranging from about $0.147 to $5.5 million) which is similar
to the average subloan size under CIB II and III and typifies the size and type of
subprojects which CIB normally covers.

Note:  The amounts of SDR 1.407 million under Credit 1763-CHA and $4,173 under
Loan 2783-CHA were disbursed to cover foreign exchange fluctuations.
19.         Subproject Review.6/ Based on the Bank's review, some of the major
characteristics and recommendations to improve CIB's appraisal reports included the
following.  CIB has introduced the use of a computerized program  in its financial
projections which should facilitate report preparation and provide more time for analysis.
The major assumptions used for projections should have been included in its reports as
standard information. However, CIB's appraisal could still be improved in the area of
market analysis; its analysis should be supported more with market data and information,
detailed information on marketing arrangements such as pricing, terms of payment, legal
agreements, etc. There is also a need for better monitoring and feedback on projects; for
example, appraisal of identical or similar projects should be compared and analyzed for
consistency. CIB's head office needs to continuously monitor adherence to approved
lending policies. In some cases, CIB submitted subloans to the Bank which were found
ineligible for financing under the Project; also, some projects were approved which were
not within its approved scope of operations (e.g., outside the industrial sector). There is
also the need to improve quality control on its appraisal reports to ensure accuracy of
figures (even typos) and information and avoid outdated reports.
6/    The Project Appraisal Manual is currently being updated to reflect the new accounting standards and
tax regulations and ex-post analysis of subprojects.

20.         Technical Assistance Component. Under the Credit 1763-CHA, SDR
0.575 million was earmarked for technical assistance component for CIB staff training.
Actual amount disbursed was SDR 574,818.98 (from 1989 to 1993) and involved 131 CIB
staff, about 7 percent of its total staff as of June 30, 1993. The training courses under the
TA were mostly short term (below three months) with the following major breakdown:

Note:  The category "Others" included training in major areas such as development and
commercial bank management, securities and financial markets, administrative and
personnel management. Of the 132 staff, 177 have remained with CIB: 79 at
head office and 38 at its branches.
21.         Subprojects Financed under the Project. As shown in Table 6, there were
228 subloans under the Project for new and balancing, modernizing, rehabilitation and
expansion (BMRE) subprojects. Like previous credit lines, the subloans were mostly for
BMRE. These subloans were spread over 28 provinces and municipalities. Unlike
previous credits, the subloans under the project were spread more evenly among CIB's
branches with no one branch accounting for more than 9 percent. The active branches
such as Jiangsu, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Liaoning continue to have the larger share of the
subloans but at much lower level. Other branches such as Shandong, Shenyang and
Guangdong showed more active use of the Bank funds under the Project.
22.         Sectoral Distribution.   Textile continued to account for a substantial
portion of the subloans under the Project with 55 subloans (24 percent of total) amounting
to $82.8 million equivalent to 27 percent of total subloans. Light industry group and

machinery group accounted for 17 percent each and 16 percent each by number and
amount of subloans respectively. These three groups together accounted for 60 percent of
the total amount of subloans. Diversification of its portfolio is one of CIB's objectives and
under CIB V, it adopted a exposure ceiling of 25 percent for any sector and exposure to
textiles was about 23 percent of total portfolio as of the end of 1992.
23.         Type of Enterprises. State-owned enterprises dominated the use of subloans
which numbered 208 out of 228 or 92 percent and $280 million out of $302 million or
93 percent. The balance of about 7 percent was accounted for by collectives and other
nonstate enterprises (mostly joint ventures) which was slightly lower than the target of
10 percent of total approvals. This target was agreed under CIB V.
24.         Subproject Costs and Financing. No data was provided in the estimates
of subproject costs although based on experience on previous credit lines, the CIB's portion
of the total investment cost averaged about 65 percent. Based on a limited sample of
subprojects, the average percentage of CIB financing to total investments was
62-52 percent in foreign exchange and 10 percent in local currency with the enterprises
providing most of the local currency funds averaging 38 percent of total investments (these
could also be in the form of other local currency loans). Total investments were about
equally divided between foreign and local currency requirements. Using these averages,
the estimated actual total investments of the subprojects under CIB IV are shown in Table
7. The sample also indicates that there were usually no overruns in the foreign currency
portion (in fact a slight underrun) but an average overrun of 5 percent in the local currency
component.

25.         Subproject hnplementation. Implementation of the subprojects under the
Project was basically satisfactory. As of June 30, 1993 there were 197 (86 percent)
subprojects in operations and 31 (14 percent) were still under construction. Out of the
total subprojects in operation, 124 (63 percent) were completed on schedule, 41



- 13 -
(21 percent) were delayed for up to six months, 26 (13 percent) were delayed for six
months to 12 months, and 6 (3 percent) were delayed for more than one year to two years.
By comparison, the on-time completion of subprojects for CIB II was 72 percent and
42 percent for CIB III. Some of the common and major causes of delays included:
shortage of and delay in the provision of counterpart funds arising mainly to increased
local currency costs, change in project design to implement project within the budget which
proved to be lower than actual costs during procurement, delayed delivery and installation
difficulties of some imported equipment. In terms of capacity utilization, the performance
of the subprojects in operation is shown in Table 8.

26.         Compared to CIB II and III, the operating performance of subprojects under
CIB IV indicates a deteriorating trend although the reasons for the low performance are
much the same and included (a) inadequate working capital due higher prices of inputs;
(b) operational difficulties with new and imported equipment; and (c) low and ucclining
domestic market demand. Based on the above figures, it can be estimated that at least
40 percent of the subprojects (those operating at 70 percent of capacity and below) would
be incurring losses or at best break-even. This performance is also reflected in the overall
deterioration of CIB's arrears situation (paras. 16 and 17) and repayment experience of the
subprojects under CIB IV (para. 27).
27.         Repayment Experience. Table 9 summarizes the collection and arrears
situation of 197 subprojects under CIB IV. Repayment experience under the Project
indicates a reasonably high overall collection ratio of 87 percent although the "on-time"
collection is at 75 percent which reflects the average experience of CIB's total portfolio
of long-term loans. However, the cumulative arrears under the Project amount to Y 155
million equivalent or 45 percent of the total arrears ending 1992 representing only 35
companies or only 4 percent of the total number of companies in CIB's portfolio.
Furthermore, the ten companies with the largest arrears account for Y 95 million or
61 percent of total arrears under the Project (ranging from Y 1.0 million to Y 28 million
in arrears). As indicated in para. 16, CIB will continue to face arrears problems given that
the problems of its clients do not seem to have been addressed early enough and are fast

becoming hard core issues and are more difficult to resolve, e.g., evidenced by the
increasing arrears which are over one year.
28.         Furthermore, CIB's accumulated provisions for doubtful debts need to be
reviewed. As the end of 1992, CIB's provisions accumulated to Y 227.99 million
equivalent of 1.46 percent of its gross portfolio (3.1 percent of long-term portfolio). In
addition to CIB's collection strategies and efforts, it would require additional and larger
provisions which in turn, will result in the need for larger additional equity contributions
to maintain a strong capital structure. As it is, CIB's long-term debt equity ratio is above
the agreed maximum level of 5 times which is still considered prudent for its type of
operations. The debt-equity issue is still outstanding under CIB V for which the Bank is
awaiting for CIB's strategy and action plan to achieve such ratio as agreed under all the
agreements with the Bank.
29.         Economic and Financial Rates of Return. Similar to CIB II and III, the
ex-ante financial (FRR) and economic (ERR) rates of return for the Project were within
a wide range: 15 percent to 74 percent for FRR and 14 percent to 86 percent for ERR.
The average FRR and ERR were 45 percent and 38 percent respectively. Based on a
sample of ten subprojects, the ex-post calculations show the following results: (a) the ex-
post FRR were lower than the ex-ante estimates with an average of 21 percent (ranging



- 15 -
from 12 percent to 29 percent) compared to an average ex-ante FRR of 27 percent (ranging
from 18 percent to 42 percent). However, the ex-post rates were satisfactory in that all
except for one project had FRRs of over 17 percent. (b) the ex-post ERR were also
generally lower that ex-ante estimates; the average ex-post ERR was 28 percent (ranging
from 17 percent to 79 percent) compared to an average ex-ante ERR of 34 percent (ranging
from 18 percent to 47 percent). Based on the implementation and arrears situations for the
subprojects, the results of the sample may not be representative. For example, about
40 percent or 91 enterprises were operating below 70 percent of capacity which indicates
losses or about at the break-even level (paras. 25 and 26). Furthermore, there were 35
companies (18 percent of those in operation) which had arrears with CIB; 31 companies
(14 percent of total) were still under construction and not operating.
30.         Other Economic Benefits.  It is estimated that the operations of 197
completed projects generated incremental revenues of about Y 2,950 million ($550 million)
and Y 200 million in taxes, and an equivalent of $260 million in foreign exchange earnings
(about 50 percent of revenues) indicating the export orientation of CIB clients. The 197
subprojects also created incremental employment for close to 14,000 or an average of 71
jobs per project. The incremental jobs for the 228 subproject should amount to about
16,000 at estimated average cost of $35,000 per job which is reasonably low.
31.         Project Sustainability. The benefits derived from the project could only
be assured with continuing achievement of CIB's long-term objective-to become an
independent, efficient and viable financial institution. This, in turn, is dependent on the
commitment and support of GOC and other related agencies. CIB needs to evolve with
the changing environment particularly in the financial sector.  In reviewing CIB's
operations and implementation of the Project as well as CIB V during the seven-year
period (1987-93), CIB's role in the financial sector in China has been the focus of the
Bank and GOC dialogue (paras. 8-10). It became evident that despite the Bank's concerted
efforts, GOC has not been fully committed to the same long-term objective for ClIB. It has
become clearer that to GOC, CIB under the leadership of PCBC, is still limited to a
convenient channel for Bank funds. Thus, the proposal to consolidate CIB into PCBC.
If this is implemented, the main objective of the various Bank projects for CIB would be
lost, i.e., to develop CIB as an independent and sound financial institution providing
meaningful competitive services in the financial sector.
Bank Performance
32.         Together with GOC and PCBC, the Bank was instrumental in the
establishment of CIB which was the first of many new financial institutions emerging in
China. Bank's financing through CIB has made available foreign exchange resources for
the much needed technical renovation projects in the light industry sector. Under the
Project, the Bank's performance has helped CIB towards achieving its objectives: (a) the
Bank contributed significantly in developing CIB's project appraisal capacity not only
through CIB's appraisal manual which is now extensively used in China but also in terms
of continuing training and feedback advice during supervision and subproject reviews;
(b) with encouragement from the Bank to diversify its sources of funds, CIB has developed



- 16 -
a reasonably successful deposit base for short-term local currency resources; (c) CIB has
developed a sizable branch network, albeit with the support and assistance from PCBC and
with the Bank's urging, most of these branches now have full-time presidents; and (d)
under the Bank's guidance and technical assistance funding, CIB has developed a core staff
which are well-trained and experienced in project finance. At the same time, there are still
a number of aspects in which the Bank should continue to assist CIB's improvement, e.g.,
project/loan supervision and collection, corporate and financial planning, mobilization of
long-term resources, and overall assets and liabilities management.
33.          Under the CIB IV and other Bank projects with CIB, some of the lessons
which may be learned would include the following. First, in establishing new financial
institutions, there needs to be not only full commitment, support and clear ownership from
the GOC as implementing agency but also a clear understanding and agreement on the
long-term objectives of such institutions. In retrospect, there really was no full agreement
on the long-term objectives for CIB. CIB was always considered by GOC merely as a way
to channel Bank funds through the leadership of PCBC, thus the apparent lack of support
for its development as an independent financial institution. The Bank could have accepted
this much earlier in its relationship with CIB and pursued more aggressively a clear
agreement and a more permanent solution to CIB's independence and long-term role.
34.          Second, although the Bank has consistently emphasized the importance of
project supervision and collection, there were perhaps inadequate programs for training and
project requirements for appropriate organization and procedures for this activity under the
Bank projects.  Furthermore, it was only after the fifth CIB project that specific
performance indicators such as collection ratios, were included in the design of Bank
project for CIB (paras. 15 and 16). These indicators would have been useful, effective
tools and an incentive for the Bank to monitor and for CIB to develop its project
supervision and financial performance which are key to its long-term viability. For
example, under CIB V, without the specific targets agreed for the provisions for doubtful
debts, CIB would not have been allowed to build such reserves (para. 16).
35.          Third, CIB's diversification of resources should have been pursued more
aggressively. Specific targets as adopted under CIB V could have been initiated earlier
under the Project. Furthermore, the slow implementation and unclear direction of reforms
in the financial sector during the Project implementation had greatly influenced CIB's
overall development and performance. For sometime, CIB had virtually no competition
for Bank funds and other suitable financial institutions could have been involved earlier in
Bank projects.
Borrower Performance
36.          Under difficult circumstances, CIB was able to implement the project
satisfactorily. The Loan and Credit under the Project were fully disbursed although the
Closing Date had to be extended by one year. Its progress reporting were delayed and
lately has not been adequate. However, submission of its annual long-form financial audit
reports has been satisfactory and on time. For its existing operations, CIB needs to focus



- 17 -
in implementing its strategy to improve project supervision and loan collections which are
key to its long-term viability. At the same time, CIB needs to vigorously pursue a clear
and firm resolution on its future role in the financial sector and prepare a feasible plan for
its transformation into a full-fledged commercial bank. In this effort and as indicated to
CIB and GOC, the Bank is prepared to consider providing technical assistance to ensure
a smooth transition and operations of the "new" CIB.
37.         Project Documentation and Data.  The Loan, Credit, and Project
Agreements with GOC and CIB for the Project were adequate for achieving the Project
objectives; they were also in reasonable detail and served as useful guide during
implementation. Likewise, the Appraisal Report was well-prepared and also was a useful
reference for the Bank, CIB and GOC. CIB also provided progress reports and annual
long-form financial audit reports which were valuable supervision and monitoring data.
Part II of this PCR contains a completion report for the Project prepared by CIB.

II. Economic Setting



- 38 -
1.14  In the eignties, tne main task of China ras Deen focusing on economic
construction. Economic aeveloPment and reforms went nana in hand. Economic
and social developments could only be fosterec tnrough reforms and opening to
the outside world. One decade-long reforms ana oDening policy have created a
new era of modernization of the economy. and accomPi shea eye-catching
achievements whicn manifested in the average amnual growth rate of 9% of GNP
over the past decade. During this period, the growth of inaustrial production
in China was the fastest in the world. Modernization of industrial sectors
strengthened China's competitiveness in the international markets. Within a
couple of years, export volume increased three times. China's share in the
volume of world trade increased from 0.97% to 1.70%. The past mono-state-
ownership was gradually replaced by a new framework in which state ownership
played a dominant role, with supplementation of other kinds of ownership. The
highly centralized plaMning system was in the Drocess of being sLverseded by a
new setup in which economic planning took into serious consideration market
forces; Prior to the reforms, the state managea economic activity through
direct control. The practice was progressively succeeded by combination of
direct and indirect measures, with indirect means playing an increasingly
central role. The closed and partially closed economy was gradually shifted to
a mucn more oPened one with increased involvement in internationa I exchange
and cooperation. The overall economic situation continued on the path of
continued, steady and coordinated development.
1.15  While accomplishing some achievements in reforms, we are also aware that
some problems, such as inappropriate production structure and low efficiency,
will not be completely eliminated within short period of time. Thus, some
difficulties will remain in the economy. These include
(1) inflation emerging in the latter part of the eighties: and
(2) negative effects of the political disturbance in 1989 on Chinese
economy; and
(3) no fundamental improvements in market sluggishness: and
(4) uneven recovery in the industrial proauction, and mismanagement and
low efficiency of some enterprises.
1.16 The Chinese government has been fully aware of these difficulties and
taken a series of measures to address them. In curtailing inflation, the
Government took measures to contain investment anm tighten money supoly.
Inflationary pressure was eased in the first Quarter of 1990. Although the
political disturbance in 1989 did have some negative effects on Chinese
economy, the sLbsequent positive phenomenon --reflecting in new interests of
foreign investors in China, enhanced national economic integrity, lifting of
embargo by EuroPe Community and renewal of preferential loans by Japanese
government -- indicates that these consequences are only temporary. The
Chinese government also took necessary measures to address market
sluggishness, uneven industrial recovery and widespread low economic
efficiency. Following reduction in interest rates on two occasions and gradual
price correctness, the consumer market began to revive.  Enterprises began to
pay increased attention to product auality dunring the course of "Year of
Quality, Variety and Efficiency Campaign" in 1991. At the same time, the
policy of the centra I government on reinvigorating large- and medium-sized
enterprises was conducive to making these enterDrises more dynamic.
1.17 Reform measures, above all, are successfu;. The negative effects
resulting from the austerity have to a larger extent been mitigated. In the
early nineties. China will focus on maintaining tne economy in a sustained,



- 39 -
steaay ana coordinated way. with the purDose cf attaining the objectives set
out fcr the second stage of strategic develooment of modernization ana,
correcting the weaknesses in the macroeconomic controi and price reform in the
past decade.
III. Objectives of Loan/Credit lV
1.18  The main objectives of Industrial Loan/Credit IV for CIB approved by the
World Banr  (the Bank) are as follows:
(1) to helip CIB finance the productive facilities ana resources which
are conducive to domestic economic ana social developments: and
(2) to improve the institutional arrangement, project evaluation and
resource financing, and to ameliorate the financial intermediaries.
1.19 During the implementation under Loan/Credit IV, the Bank put emphasis on
enhancing quality of CIB staff, especially through overseas training in the
industrial, operational, financial and managerial aspects. In addition, the
Bank was expected to provide assistance and guidance to CIB with regard to
project assortment and review.
1.20  The imp I ementation of these oijectives will be elaborated in the
remainder of this report.
Part II. Basic Facts on Subprojects underr Loan/Credit IV
1. Sumuary on the Lses of Loan/Credit I-l1l
2.01 As of June 1987, CIB had provided 306 suborojects with loans of an
amount of USD 340 million under the Bank Loan/Credit I-ill, and an amount of
Y590 million. Each sLbproject, on average, received USD1.11 million and Y1.94
million. The share of foreign and Rervninbi within the loans was 1:1.7.
2.02  As of June 1987. Disbursements under Loan/Credit I-IlIl had been
completed. The pace of disbursements, which was slow from 1983 through 1984.
definitely sped up during 1985-86. By the end of June 1986, cumu I ative
disbursements reached to USD157 million, accounting for 60% of Loan/Credit I
and 45% of the second, respectively. It was felt that the pace of
disbursements under Loan/Credit I-l1l were broadly satisfactory. Disbursement
under Loan/Credit II was terminated twelve months ahead of schedule.  And
disbursement under Loan/Credit III was concluded as scheduled.
2.03  The maturity of Loan/Credit I-IllI was on average three to five years.
with varying grace periods of one to three years. Borrowers were mainly state-
owned enterprises (SOEs). Unkder Loan/Credit I-1II, 219 subprojects were SOEs
and 87 were collectively-owned, accounting for 70% and 28% of the total,
respectively. Most of subProjects were characterized by technological
transformation. Of the total, 275 were technical transformation, accounting
for 90%. The expected rate of financial return was between 12%-45%. rate of
economic return 18%-35%, which would have attained the envisaged objectives.
II. Performance of Subprojects under LoarVCredit IV
2.04 Al location of the Financing: the Forth Industrial Loan/Credit Project
came into effect in June 1987. As of June 30, 1993, 228 suborojects had
been approved. As a matter of fact. 242 haa been permittea, Dut 14 had been



- 40 -
istea under otner CIB Loan/Credit. The tota  amount was loan 2782-CHA USD
250.73 mil lion, with each subproject on average receiving USY 1.33 mill ion.
Meanwnile. CIB provided Y280.77 million, with eacn suvProject averagely ob-
taining RMB Y1.23 million. The share of foreign currency and Renminri within
the loans was 1:0.9.(see Table 2.1, 2.2)
2.05 Commitments: From June 1987 when f irst suLoroject was committed by the
World Bank, until June 30 1993, total 228 subProjects had been committed as
the elements of the Forth Industrial loan/credit projects. Total amount of
commitments under Loan 2783-CHA was USD 250.73 million and Credit 1763-CHA
SDR39.2 miIlion, respectively. On table 2.3: 1)The fastest pace of commitment
was during 1987-1988, the committed amount accounted for 84 of the Loan and
77% of the Credit, respectively. It was in conformation with the Pace of
domestically economic develoPment on that days: 2) During 1990-1991, the datum
of conmitted amount was zero, because: (A) CIB had made adjustment to these
subprojects which were identified in the period (see 2.08); (B) The cost of
the Forth World Bank Loan was a little bit higher; (C) The Influence came
from the "political disturbance" in 1989: (D) Since contents of 5 year
financial forecast must be placed into project appraisal report, so as to slow
down project-evaluating speed: (E) The caoital of tne Fifth World Bank Loan in
1989 had been poured in.
2.06  Loan/credit Disbursements: From the trird quarter in 1987 when first
suboroject was disbursed, to June 30 1993, the account-closing day, total
301.297,932.01 USD had been withrcawn consisting of Loan 2783-CHA
247,075,626.30 dollars and Credit 1763-CHA 54,222.305.71 dollars. Tab I e 2.4
points: 1) During 1987-1989, the Forth World Bank's reimbursement was a
little bit faster, the amount accounted for 66% of the total reimbursements.
It was in keeping with the progress of suLprojects' commitment and expenditure
in these years: and 91.6%. 2) In 1992, the figLre of disbursement
on SDR was negative, because in the year, 150,000,000 us dollars were returned
back from the accounts for special purposes. and the actual disbLrsements were
1,920,000.00 dollars. 3) From 1990-1992, the Forth World Bank reimbursement
were honoured a little bit slower, the amount was 6% of the total
reimbursements. During 1987-1992, the total amount of reimiDursement actual ly
honourea made up 72% of the due. The account could not been closea according
to tne reauirements of the loan agreement.
2.07  Reasons for reimbursement unfinishing by the end of 1992: 1) Because
of the influence from "*June 4" politica I turmoil, tne imp I ementation of
commercial contracts were encountered great difficulties, and equipments
deliveries were also delayed, so as to affect the regularly financing
disbursement to these projects: 2) After 1987, a bidding system that
equipments needed must be called for domestic tenders prior to applying
importation, in China, was initiated, wnich increasea the Droceoures for
approval of equipment importation. In turn, it to some extent affected Dace
of disbursements. 3) The cost of the World Bank capital IV was 8.5%, one
percent point higher than costs of domestic caDital in same term: 4) During
disbursing proceoure of tne loan I-IV, unaertaken by CIB, some weaknesses
still existed. Due to these reasons, the account of tne loan/credit IV
project couldn't be closed on June 30 1992.
2.08  Vigorous measures: For changing the situation, CIB nad apoIied for
one year's grace to postpone the closing aeadline and took vigorous
measures: One was that CIB adjusted the ooerational distribution among
No. 1 Project Department, No.2 Project Department and Credit DeDartments



- 41 -
in NovemDer 1991 (see 4.03). After adjustment, the operational distribution
was more Deneficial to managing Payment to constructing suoProjects. Tne
other was that for the suoProjects with a Dayment slower or a unpaid
balance, the due disbursing balance which CIB decided not to Pay any more
was transferred into the undistributed balance on the World Bank's accounts.
in order to make uo needs of new suborojects witn a faster Pace of payment.
In the period of Nov. 1992 to Jun. 1993, total subprojects cancelled or with
a cancelled balance were 142: the amount cf cancellation maae respectively
up loan 2783-CHA 27.99 million aollars ana credit 1763-CHA 4.89 million
dollars. In the meantime, 35 new subprojects were approved; the amount of
approval accounted for USD50.82 million. 3) Persons with special duty were
authorized to be responsible for reimbursement of the Loan/Credit IV
expenditure. Since utilizing these measures, from Nov. 1992 to Jun. 1993,
the amount reimbursed by the World Bank was 2783-CHA USD77.8 million and
1763-CHA SDR2.85 million, respectively. Ana on JuLne 30 1993, in the grace
term greeted by WB. the account was closed on time.
Ill. Subproject Profile under Loan/Credit IV
2.09 Ownership: Most of subprojects under Loan/Credit IV were state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), which accounted for 92% of the total number of suDpro-
jects and 93% of the total approved amount. The primary reasons for SOES'
great portion were as follows:
(1) SOEs continue to be the principal k inds of ownership in Chirna.  In
addition, they possess good underpinnings for developments, which mitigate the
risk of making investment there. With the advent of reforms and opening to the
oxutside world, SOEs have become more cautious of selecting projects, and the
possibility of their successful comDletion of projects was higher tnan
enterprises of other k inds of ownership. and
(2) While implementing Loan/Credit IV, CIB experimented with financing a
small number of joint-ventures and township and village enterprises (TVEs). As
these were new areas for it. CIB used its own funds to finance these projects
in order to reduce the risks of failing to repay foreign currency loans. That
is why not many of enterprises of these two kinds were financed by Loan/Credit
IV. As recommended by the Bank, CIB therefore increased the financing ,I
non-state enterprises under Loan/Credit V.(see Table 2.5)
2.10  Subproject Character: Under Loan/Credit I-Ill, technical transformation
subprojects accounted on average for 90% of the total. Under Loan/Credit IV,
however, its share declined to 86%. It shows that while emphasizing on
technical transformation, CIB also paid due attention to helP with the
restructuring and extension of enterprises, with the aim of make the share of
restructuring and technica I transformation suboprojects becoming more
balanced. (see Table 2.6)
2.11 Subproject Scale: In the suborojects approved, CIB has been emphasizing
on small- and medium-sized industrial projects which needed small amount of
financing, but Yielded returns quickly and had definite potentials for
repayments. Under Loan/Credit IV, foreign currency financing for each
subproject generally did not exceed the uPPer ceiling. SuDprojects with an
amount of less than USD1 million accounted for 52% of the total, those less
tnan USD,-2.5 million 35% and those more tran USD5 million only 1.(see Table
2.7)
2.12  Regional Distribution: Geographical distribution became more oalancea:
The areas located by suDProjects uncer Loan/Credit 'V were extended from



- 42 -
concentrating on JiangSu Province and such cities as ShangHai. TianJing and
ShenYang under Loan/Credit l-ll to 21 provinces, cities ana autonomous
regions. This reflected This due to the expansion of CIB's Drancn network
which laid down the institutional structure in this regard. On top of that, it
was also the result of increased demand for financing from open areas, Special
Economic Zones(SEZs) and cities under seParate planning within the State
DevelIopment Plan, due to continued pursuit of opening to the outside world.
And third, this could disperse finances, so as to reduce the risks of loan
investment.  (see table 2.8)
2.13 Industries: Sector distribution became more diversified. Under Loan/
Credit IV, subprojects lied mainly in 14 industries, including textiles,
light industry, machinery, electronics, petrochemicals and sewing
industry, etc. Except that textile industry secured more than 25% of the total
under Loan/ Credit IV, other industry each accommodated less than 25%. thus
reducing the risks of financlng. (see Table 2.9)
Part ll. SubproJect Implementation under Loan/Credit IV
I. Selection, Appralsal and Supervision
3.01 Selection: Under Loan/Credit IV, CIB had considered uP to 694 projects.
According to the principle of "Selecting the best of the possible proJects".
CIB project managers had chosen a number of projects to be financed by
Loan/Credit IV. In the process of selection, project managers made analysis on
the feasibility of each suborojects from both micro and macro perspectives.
First, they determined whether a subproject could be financed on the condition
that it complied with the requirements in the national industrial policy.
Second, they examined the management, profitability, marketability.
construction conditions and expected financia I and economic returms of the
envisaged subproject. Only could be filed for submissIon to the Bank for
approval those subprojects which had complied with the envisaged criteria.
Preliminary information shows that project managers spent on average seven
business days making an in-depth evaluation on each envisaged subproject. This
step laid sound foundation for better completion of the subsequent pro.:ct
appraisal.
3.02 Appraisal: After selected subprojects were filed for appraisal, CIB
project managers started preparing project appraisal reports. First, CIB,
together with admInistrative author -ties- f borrowing enterprises and project
planners, made feasibility studies. Second, project managers tried to collect
information as complete as possible of product marketability and technical
characteristics of envisaged imported equipment. Third. they made
comprehensive eval uation with regard to enterprises's management, financial
position and construction conditions, with the aim of finalizing the appraisal
reports. Under Loan/Credtit IV, CIB had assessed 300 selected subprojects and
completed 270 appraisal reports. CIB then chose 242 as subprojects under
Loan/Credit IV to submit to the Bank for review. All subprojects submitted to
the Bank had been approved.
3.03  Experience regarding appraisal activities under Loan/Credit II -IV shows
that CIB has established relatively comprehensive project appraisal and
approval procedures, and had a number of project managers who nave competently
commanded the method of project appraisal. Quality and efficiency of CIB's
project evaluation increased remarkably. For further enhancing work in this
regard, CIB developed "CIB Software on Project Evaluation" with the assistance



- 43 -
of both computer experts and project managers. Experiment indicated that tne
software was useful and effective.
3.04 Supervision: After suIxrojects were apProved by the Bank, CIB project
managers helped enterprises with price inquiries and business negotiations. At
the same time. they coordinated the relations between borrowing enterprises,
project contractors and entities responsible for procurement, with a view to
speeding up project construction. In addition. they oversaw the disbursements
and helped solve the problems as long as they emerged. They also reviewed
subproject budget. After the putting into oPeration of subprojects, they
helPed enterprises promptly address difficulties in the production process, in
order to facilitate the projects to become operational and make repayments as
scheduled. When a subproject closed its account, CIB project managers began
preparing project post-evaluation report.
3.05 Under Loan/Credit IV, CIB held a series of training courses and project
management seminar participated by project managers from its branches.
International trade and project management experts were invited from abroad.
The emphasis of the training was on the procedures and techniques of
procu.rement, Project financial management and implementation management. In
addition, the Bank experts came to provide assistance and advice on project
supervision during the implementation of Loan/Credit IV, and made lots of
worthwhile suggestions. All these were extremely conducive to strengthening
project management.
II. Constructing Progress
3.06 Construction: BY the end of June 1993. of 228 subprojects under Loan/
Credit IV, 197 had been put into operation, accounting for 86% of total
subprojects. 45 had been cleared their accounts , making up 20%. The
constructing sLbprojects were 31, 14% of the total. (details in Table 3.1)
3.07 Table 3.1 indicates that most subprojects under Loan/Credit IV can be
put into operation on time and even ahead of schedule. A few, however, are
delayed to varying degree. The main reasons are as follows:
(1) As offer prices of procurement differed 3ignificantly from expected
ones, enterprises were compelled to change their original plans, thus
affecting the procurement and the pace of project implementation. and
(2) Some preparatory work was not compIeted as scheduled. Thus, the
period of project construction was delayed. and
(3) With price increases In building materials and domestically
purchased equipment, there existed shortfall in Rerminbi financing which could
not be fHied up immediately. and
(4) Delivery time of some imported equiDment was incomparable with that
of domestic accessory apparatus, thus delaying the putting into operation of
the project. and
(5) As a result of postponed delivery or noncompliance with the
contracts by foreign suppliers, a number of imported equipment was not
delivered on time. and
(6) Work was delayed on making equipment operational by foreign experts.
And loss claims took longer time than expected.
3.08 As examples: Mudanjiang General Vulcanized Fiber Paper Plant (A12 CIB
credit USD5.35 million, RMB 6.73 million yuan), its foreign equiDments were
not reached the standards while they were debugged by foreign business men.
so its operational time nad to be delayed by tne repeated modulation for



- 44 -
these equipments later. Guangaong Jiangmen PaPer Mill (A68 CIB credit USD
3.88 mil ion, RMB 3.63 mil ion yuan), it needea to increase RMB investment
1.09 mill ion yuan due to price inflation of raw materials, but the funds
still were not available for a long time, as the result, its operation time
was delayed. AnHui ChuZhou Main Factory of Electric Fan (A21, CIB credit
USD2.33 million. RMBY1.35 million) also Postponed its operational term,
because of equipments' delivery getting some troubles.
Ill. Analysis of SLtprojects' Economic Efficiency
3.09 Table 3.2 shows: As of the end of June 1993, of 197 operating
subprojects under Loan/Credit IV, actual productivities of 99 had been reached
90-100% of designed capacities. 20's at 70-90% of designed capacities, and
27's at 50-70% of the capacities; the remained 51 subprojects were operating
less than 50% of designed ones. Main reasons for these sLbprojects operating
below designed capacity were as follows:
(1) The putting into operation of sLbprojects were delayed. and
(2) Working capital fell short as a result of increases in prices of raw
materials. and
(3) The delivery of imported equipment and domestic accessories was
delayed. In addition, installment and adjustment of equipment were suspended.
and
(4) Weak domestic markets made products difficult to be sold.
3.10  197 subprojects under Loan/Credit IV had newly increased-sales revenue
Y2.95 billion in the year when they became operational. The realized profits,
taxes and exchange earnings were Y230 million, Y200 million and USD260
million, respectively. Subprojects total ly created 13.967 employment
opportunity. Each subproject on average had realized arnual ly profits of Y1. 16
million, taxes of Y1.01 million and exchange earnings of USD1.2 million.
Therefore, economic efficiency of subproject was satisfactory. (Details in
Table 3.3)
3.11 Table 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3. 3.4.4, 3.4.5 show a data comparison between
anpraisaIs of ten a sort st.bprojects and their successive evaluation after
account-closing. These data mean: general productivity, date of putting into
operation and date of operating at ful I capacity If these ten tallied with the
appra i sed ones. And new I y- i ncreased prof It, rate of I ntema I revenue, and
investment profit ratIo of them were a litt I e bit I ower than the appraised
data. But from total parameters, it might concluded that the requirements of
project appraisal put forward by CIB had been achieved. For instance, ratio of
intemal f inancial revenue and internal economic income of these projects were
respectively reached 16% and 19%: and investment profit ratio was on average
21%. Furthermore, 1092 new employees were hired to the ten subprojects. But
from repayment, just subproject A068 and A017 did not paid back its loan on
time, and postponed their repayment term.
IV. Subproject Repayments
3.12 As of June 1993, of 228 subprojects under Loan/Credit IV. 197 had
begun repayments. Among them, 45 had completely repaid their loans. The
cumu I ative amount of loans for 197 sLbprojects was USD190.38 miIIion.  Actual
repayments had reached to USD165.63 million, accounting for 87% of loans
receivable. Among them. 35 had arrears with an amount of USD24.75 million,
accounting for 13% of foreign currency loans receivable. Renminbi loans
accumu I ative falling due was Y162.37 million. Actua I repayments were Y141.26



- 45 -
million, accounting for 87% of loans receivable. Among them, 19 were in
arrears with an amount of Y21.11 million. accounting for 13% of Renrminbi loans
receivable. (See Table 3.5)
._
3.13 Table 3.6 lists ten suborojects with tne most great arrears among 19
sub-projects which have overdue loans. Their accumulative arrears were
USD15.16 million and 13.24 million Yuan, accounting for 61% and 63% of the
total amounts of overdue foreign exchange loans and Rerminbi loans
respectively. In addition, 6 of the ten had a longer overdue term for 12
months. From the regional distribution, the suborojects with an arrears of
loan were mostly located in the interior of China.
3.14 Main reasons causing arrears are as follows:
(1) Construction delays made these subDrojects unable to become
productive. and
(2) Production costs increased and profits reduced. and
(3) Market conditions changed, affecting the marketability of products.
and
(4) Working capital fell short and undercapacity occurred. and
(5) The overall low efficiency of enterprises affected the repayments of
subprojects.
(6) Since the rate of foreign exchange to Renminbi fluctuated rapidly
within a wide range, it added a heavier burden on subproject enterprises to
repay their loans on market floating exchange rate.
V. Persomel Training under Loan/Credit IV
3.15 In accordance with provisions in the Agreement on the World Bank's Loan/
Credit IV, SDRO.575 million was set aside for personnel training (with an
equivalent to USD 0.75 million). CIB began exercising the resources in 1989.
As of June 30 1993, CIB had sent 131 staff to attend various training programs
abroad. UP to June 30 1993, total SDR574,818.98 had been disbursed.
(equivalent to 801,978.29 us dollars) Details on Table 3.7.
Part IV. Institutional Arrangement.s
I. Institutional Structure (see Table 4.1)
4.01 Management: Before 1986, there were no full-time presidents at either
headoffice or branches of CIB. CIB presidents at that time were concurrent
presidents of the People's Construction Bark of China (PCBC). Based on the
suggestions by the Bank, CIB in 1986 began appointing its full-time
presidents. As of end-June 1993, within its 31 branches. CIB had appointed 24
presidents. At the same time, in order to streamline the operations and
increase efficiency of CIB. members in the Board of Directors were reduced
from 33 to 17. All directors were from various ministries and/or agencies. At
end-1991, CIB headoff ice added another vice president who was in charge of
Comprehensive Planning Division, Research Division, Financing Division, and
Computer Center. As a result, there-were four staff in the headoffice of CIB
at presidential level. It, therefore. strengtnened the management of CIB. From
1987 trrough 1991, CIB also appointed a numDer of divisional heads, result ing'
in Improved management and laying the foundation for operational developments.
4.02  Organization (See Table 4.1): At the early stage of CIB. its volume of
business was small. The headoffice then haC only five divisions and/or



- 46 -
offices. As a result of expanded businesses, five divisions could never meet
the increasea workload. After 1987, therefore, CIB reorganized its headoffice.
(1) The Research Division was resuLed. and
(2) The Project Implementation & Supervision Division was changed into
Credit Management Division. and
(3) Established were Personnel Division, Computer Center, International
Settlement Division, Financing Division, Audit Office and Administration
Division.
4.03 In addition, the previous two Project Divisions were reorganized in
1991. delegating different responsibilities according to industries in order
to make operations more appropriate. After the reorganization, term loan -
activities were granted to Project Division I. Leasing, equity investment and
guarantee operations were the responsibilities of Project Division II.
Project Division I took over the responsibilities for managing projects under
construction, which were previously preserved by Credit Management Division.
According to new work division, Project Division I was responsible for project
implementation until the project put into operation. Credit Management
Division was responsible for working capital financing and deposit-taking
activities and designated to supervise the operational situation of projects
which had already become operational, with emphasis attached mainly on
facilitating repayments and preparing ex post evaluation.
4.04 Branch's Organization: During the early years of CIB, it had only three
branches. With the help of relevant agencies and the development of CIB's own
business, its branches increased markedly. The chronicle can be grouped into
two stages. From 1984 to 1985, the Government had established reforms and
opening policies. In response, the emphasis was then given to economic
construction. Economic development needed badly financing to update the
equipment of enterprises, and needed to address the imbalance between light
and heavy industrles. At that time, China lacked foreign exchanges. Thus, the
Government put great emphasis on financial sector development, with the
purpose of making full use of financial intermediaries. Uses of external
financing, in particular loans from international financial organizations.
were considered effective means of addressing deficiency in financial
resources in China. Against this background, CIB branches expanded remarkably
for the first time, totaling nineteen. From 1987 to 1988, CIB branches
witnessed another period of rapid expansion as a result of extended business
scope. Financial resources from the Bark and ADB gradually increased.  In
addition. CIB started external commercial borrowing. Lending activities also
expanded remarkably. At the same time, the Goverment set up separate plans
for a number of large- and medium-sized cities within the State Social and
Economic Development Plan and gave them authorities comparable to provinces,
with a view to Providing increased incentives for these cities to make the
economy more dynamic. In order to help these measures and to meet Its
increased business requirements, CIB had been establishing branches in these
cities ever since. These branches were under direct auspices of CIB
headoffice. As of June 1988. CIB had 31 branches and 28 sub-branches around
the nation. Thus. CIB maintained branches in twenty-two provinces, municipal
cities. autonomous regions.
4.05  Relationships between headoffice and its branches: Headoffice has
guiding and supervisory authorities over branches with regard to operations.
Each branch conducts activities in accordance with guiding principles and
policies set out by headoffice. In 1986, on project management, branches and
sub-branches made comprenensive reviews. Appraisal reports for all projects



- 47 -
should be submitted by oranches to headoff ice for aQproval.  Under necessary
conditions, staff from neadoffice helped branches review project appraisal
reports, and made comments and suggestions accordingly. After loans were
approved, branches supervised implementation of projects according to
guidelines of headoffice and submitted reports regularly to headoffice.  In
order to ease the pressures on neadoffice with regard to project approval and
grant some branches with great experience more autonomy, CIB headoffice in
1987 delegated a few branches authorities to approve projects within upper
limits set out by headoffice. The annual limits for each brancn had to be
reviewea by headoffice each year.
4.06 Staff: CIB had 56 staff in its early years. At end-1987, it had 975
staff. At the end of 1987, it had 975 staff. Up to June 30 1993, staff number
increased to 2150. Especially, in 1987, 1988, 1992 and 1993, staff numner of
CIB had increased more quickly. It was mainly adapted to the both requirement
for expansion of CIB's business and number of branches. (see Table 4.2)
4.07 With staffing number increasing, CIB paid attention to recruiting more
professionals, with the aim of enhancing the quality of staff and laying the
foundation for further development of business. In recent years. professionals
stood at some 86% of total staff. Senior and medium-level staff were 723,
accou.nting for 34%. Among them. 93 were senior staff, accounting for 4%. while
medium-level were 630. accounting for 29%. Economists accounted for 49.5%,
financial analysts 17.9%, engineers 12.2% and other professionals 6.5%. The
composition of staff became more reasonable. It should be noted that number of
professionals in 1987 and 1988 increased markedly, respectively, compared with
each preceding year. During this time, increases in rumber of financial
analysts and engineers were significant, with an increase of 33% and 47%,
respectively. This mainly resulted from growth of international settlement
operations, establishment of computer center and needs of more project
managers. (See Table 4.3)
4.08 Recruitment: Before 1986, most of staff were from PCBC. as CIB needed
staff who were familiar with banking operations at its early stage of
development. After 1987, CIB changed its dependance on PCBC with more aiannels
for recruitment. In addition to accepting graduates from universities and
vocational scnools who were assigned by the Government, CIB also recruited
professionals with strong educational background and long working experience
from other agencies, with a view to meeting the work requirements. The
establishment of the Personnel Division laid the ground for better
recruitment, as it set up a recruitment examination scheme. After 1987. most
of new recruits therefore were newly-graduated students and professionals from
other agencies. The diversified sources of staff facilitated the potential
operational developments of CIB. On the other hand, CIB faced immediate
pressures, as it would take some time to make newly-graduated students
familiarize themselves with and adapt themselves to CIB activities.
II. Training
4.09 Since its establishment, CIB continued putting empnasis on staff
training. Training programs were considered fundamentals to operation
developments and improved management. ClB training programs took different
forms in order to meet different needs. In recent Years, CIB held forty-nine-.
training courses in China, and EDI held five seminars, with a combined
cumulative audience of 2655. Each year, about 25% of staff in CIB participated
in such training programs. To date, 253 staff have been sent to particioate in



- 48 -
training programs offered by international financial organizations and foreign
banks; to study in universities aDroad and to receive on-the-job training in
some foreign banks. Fifty-six Chinese and foreign experts have been invited to
work and/or lecture in CIB. Branches conducted different kinds of off-the-job
or on-the-job training programs by taking into account their own work load and
prospective needs. In order to increase the quality of training programs, CIB
had Trepared a great number of training materials. Through tnese training
programs. CIB had heId a nunber of staff who could do satisfactorily project
evaluation work and internationa I financial operations.  Overall quaIity of
CIB staff had been improved remarkably. (See Table 4.4.)
4.10  Manual on Industrial Project Appraisal (the Manual): The Manual was
prepared by taking into account both industr I a I project appraisal practice in
China and experience of the Bank in this regard. It played an extremely
important role in enhancing the abilities of CIB staff with regard to project
evaluation. The preparation of the Manual was a process of perfection.  In
addition, the publication of the Manual was supported by the Bank. When the
Manual was revised, CIB received a lot of worthwhile advice from the Bank
experts. In 1990 when the third edition was published, its coverage was
enlarged further. It added a few chapters on Shadow Price Methods, Five-Year
Financial Projections, Conversion Value in Sensitivity Analysis and Joint-
Venture Project Evaluation. In October 1991. CIB made another revision on the
third edition based on the suggestions made by the Bank with regard to
Calculation of Contingency Costs. Calculation of Internal Financial and
Economic Returns, Projections on Working Capital Requirements, Economic
Analysis, Enterprise Repayments Projections and Five-Year Financial
Projections. It is our convictions that the perfection and application of the
Manual will make project evaluation work of CIB reach another new step in the
future, and extend the current emphasis on project appraisal further to
assessments on the overall abi I ities of borrowing enterprises to iimplement and
repay the project loans.
4.11 As soon as the Manual was published. CIB started making it used In
project evaluation. (1) In 1982. at its first project evaluation workshop. CIB
began making its staff familiarize themselves with the Manual. By 1989.
thirteen project evaluation workshops had been held, with an audience of 650.
in addition, CIB made a campaign to encourage its staff to study the Manual by
themselves, with a view to making each project manager within CIB know
comIpletely the thirust of the Manual and use it ski I Ifully.  (2) After its
publication, the Manual had been selected by a nunber of universities as
textbooks. (3) CIB staff were invited by other agencies to lecture on the
method of project evaluation and to hold seminars on project evaluation for
units in localities. As a result of these efforts, CIB had made the Manual
used in its own work and known to other agencies as well.  Therefore. CIB
became the pioneer financial institution to introduce the internationally-
recognized methods on project evaluation into China.
Part V. Operational Development and Financial Performance
I. Out Line Of CIB'S Operation Development
5.01  In the early day of CIB's establishaent. CIB mainly undertook on-lending
industrial credits proved by World Bank.  Starting from 1986, in order to
adapt the Chinese developing-direction of a stepped up ' open to the outside'
and the need of utilizing foreign funds, CIB's charnels of raising foreign



- 49 -
funds and business scope has been successively exploited wider and wider, and
its diverse operations nas developed more quickly tnan before.
5.02 In raising funds from overseas, besides continuously getting loans from
Wor I d Bank, CI B had yet borrowed Loans from ADB, commerc i a I banks and fore i gn
governments. Its business has exPanded from concentrating on relending World
Bank's loan to handling deposit, loan, loan in foreign exchange, international
settlements, foreign exchange dealing and banking guarantee, issuing and
issuing as agent of securities in foreign currency, and international
financial leasing, etc. 15 kinds of foreign excnange operations. It has had
strong capacity of handling foreign exchange operations in all-round.
5.03  Owing to drawing on the World Bank's useful experience in project
management , CIB conducted scientific evaluation and strict management to the
Loan subprojects: ensured projects' successful implementation: Strongly
improved enterprises' technical progress: enhanced their capacities in
exportation and foreign exchange earning and also achieved remarkably economic
and social benef its. I n recent years. its short term loan oPerat ion has a I so
developed so speed up that has well improved CIB's Assets gearing and has
increased the benefits of Fixed Assets Loan.
II. CIB'S Debt And Asset Operation
5.04 BorrowIng:
After establisnment, CIB undertook on-lending industrial loan of World
Bank: from the year, 1982, it borrowed 945 million dollars one after another
from World Bank, Including 'hard loan' USD 770 million and 'soft loan' 175
million dollars. In 1986, the state council appointed CIB as one of the
windows for financing funds from overseas. It has speared its business in this
aspect steadily. Every year. in accordance with the planning target of raising
overseas' funds approved by the State Planning Commission. CIB has borrowed
medimn and long-term loans from commercial banks abroad. The currency sort,
the interest rate and pay back term of these loans are different respectively.
By the end of 1992. the Loans borrowed by CIB from foreign commercial barks
were accumulated to 415 million dollars. In 1988, it borrowed ADB loan 100
miIIion US dollars, furthermore, in 1990, C0B negotiated yet with German
government for borrowing a loan with amount of 2.7 million Deutsche Marks
through a Germany bank.  By di verse channe I s and measures, such as b i I atera I
borrowing, joint-lending, banking group's loan, loan of international finance
organization, government's loan, and buyer's credits, C0B raised foreign
exchange 1.496 billion dollars. Among them, World Bank's loan was 63.1%; ADB
loan made up 6.68%; govermment's loan accounted for 1.06%: buyer's loan hold
33%. and commercial Bank's loan held 27.74% of the total. On 23 JUIy 1993, in
first time. CI8 successfully Issued floating rate bonds of 100 million dollars
at the Asian capital market. Hong Kong. It not only perfected the CIB's
measures of raising funds, but also won a good reoutation among coLunterParts
in the capital markets, Nowadays, when the international caDital market has
been tending to securitiesation consistently.
5.05 Deposits:
Before 1990, the CIB's financial measures was mainly to borrow from
international banking organizations and f-inance markets. A long with the deeP
development of the financial and Banking system reform,' financial
diversification and debt gearing multi lateralism nas become the operative
strategy of various vocational banks . Commencing from 1991, the aeoosit
operation has been put into CIB's important vocational plan.  And by the end



-50 -
of 1992. the ooeration naa gainea great progress. RMB and foreign currency
aeposits were reached 3.73 billion Yuan and 420 millions ao IIars.
respectively.
5.06 Medium and long term loan.
According to the requirements of the state's industrial policies, CIB
selected loan projects actively but cautiously. Until the end of 1992, tne
fixed asset loan projects approved by CIB were accumulated to 1339 ones; for
them, foreign excnange was approved as 1.8 billion dot tars and counterpart RMB
was 2.0 billion Yuan. In 1339 projects, 1056 had finished and had been
operating: and nearly 300 of them had paid off the entire amount of the loan
they borrowed. The establishments and operations of these projects have
forceful ly improved these enterprises' tecrnological progress, enhanced their
capacities in exportation and foreign exchange earning, and attained
remarkably economic and social benefits. CIB took a series of strict and
serious project estimation and selection, in the meantime, strengthened
management and implementation for these projects. It helped enterprises to
solve loan problems, and difficulties encountered during project constructive
and operative stages. It not only improve the enterprises' economic benefits,
but also guaranteed CIB needs of repaying principals and interests to
overseas: at meantime, sPed up fund's turnover and made credit fi.nds flow in a
sound circles.
5.07 Short term loan:
In current years, CIB's short term credit developed very quickly. UP to 31
Dec.,1992, the balance of short term loan was foreign exchange 270 million
dollars. and Y5.1 billions RMB. It means great significance to perfecting
CIB's operation, functions and to transforming its operative mechanism. The
development of short term credit has changed the unitary composition of CIB's
assists; made the proportion between long and short term I oan tending
rationally day oy day, and raised the fluidity of its credit assets. Not only
investing direction of capitals has become further flexible, and credit risk
has been reduced, but other operations has been improvea as well, such as tne
developments of absorbing deposits and settlement operation. Especially
lending short term loan to CIB's fixed assets loan clients, it has set uD long
term credit relationship with tnem; besides perfecting CIB's credit assets
gearing, increasing investment benefits, and ensiring loan recovery , so as to
stabilize basic clients and to exploit operative realm.
5.08. International settlement : For perfecting banking functions further and
offering full-scale services to clients, from the ena of 1987, CIB formally
started to handle international settlement. Over 5 years, this operation
developed speed up from only handling importation clearing under the amount of
CIB loan at the beginning, to conducting exportation settlement, and further
developed to handle nontrade clearing. So the service scale for clients has
been successively exPanding . LUnti I May 1993. State Foreign Exchange
Management Agency, authorized CIB's 28 branches to conduct trade settlement.
The 26 of Them nas formally handled internationa I settlement to overseas. At
banking operation aspects, these brancnes aealing with international clearing
have Kept up good and cooperative relationship with PeoPle's Bank, China Bank,
Constructive Bank. Commercial Bank, Agricultural Bank ana otner financial
institutions, consistently. As yet, CIB has set up agent Dank relationsnio
witn 140 banks in 24 countries; and has signea cooDerative agreements witn
1946 banks: so that an international settlement service network nas Deen
formea by CIB all over tne Asia. Europe, Oceanic and America. ,see Table 5.2)



-51-
5.09  Foreign Exchange Dealing.
From'1989, CIB began to handle foreign excnange dealing and set uo foreign
excnange dealing house. In current years. the operation has not only been
developed sharply but also has offered perfectly service to clients and
satisfied the demands of CIB's banking settlement and fund managements. The
CIB's foreign exchange dealing house installed a relatively full range capital
message communicative and dealing eouipment which are necessary for capital
market, as same as the capital message communicating, dealing and
technological analyzing system which used by Renter and American Federal News
Agency for capital market need. By several years' development, CIB has
fostered a group of experiential dealers and capital managers. Nowadays. CIB
has had wide business relation-ship with several tens grant banks and finance
institutions in major world finance markets, and has handled on spot, future.
swap and option dealings for more than ten sorts of foreign currencies. In
1992. CIB totally conducted foreign exchange dealing several more than 2400
times; the amount of these dealings in various currencies, was equivalent to
6.5 billion US dollars. And did capital dealings reached about 600 times, the
amount of capital dealings was reached equivalent value USD uP to 200
billions. In meantime, capital dealing showed very vigorous. and has brought
nice benefits. Besides these. CIB has yet cone a party of securities'
dealing, such as Japanese National Debt Commodities. In the day to come CIB
will continuously speed up its development in the operation scale, variety of
currencies dealing and client services, and so on.
5.10 Investment: CIB's directly participating and investing objects are
domestic industrial firms, and Sino-Overseas joint-venture which participated
by CIB. The investing-capitals are mainly as foreign exchanges. By the end of
May 1993. CIB invested 12 million dollars in 18 projects. One out of the 18
projects,in 1992. the Shanghai International Leasing Corporation Limited, a
joint venture of which CIB as a share holder signed agreements with an amount
of 140 million USD. and the received rents were 40.73 million dollars. net
profits 488 million RMB Yuan. It gained better operative achievement.
5.11 Leasing:
Since 1992 starting financial leasing, to the end of May 1993. CIB had
undertaken 8 leasing projects and financed 33 million dollars under loan. It
put its operative emphasis on financing leasing for advanced foreign
technology and equipments imported by domestic enterprises; in above amount.
CIB financed 13.39 million USD for Shan Xi province to import movable
telephone communicative installations, in order to support the development of
local communication. It also raised or financed 11.23 million dollars for a
firm of the state Aviation Department to help the project to import screw
press with 800 screws, so as to improve the large-sized precise forging
level of Chinese Aviation Industry.
5.12 Ratio of CIB's Assets and Debts:
Table 5.1 shows: (1) Capital ratio ( Total Capital/Total Assets ), From 1988
to 1992, CIB's operation got a full-scale development, Assets increased so
quickly, that improved its capital ratio's state which had been too high. The
rate was rationally descended year by year, until the end of 1992. still was
kept on the level of international common standards. (2) Loan Ratio (total
Loan/ total Assets) The ration of CIB's total loan to total Assets was
controlled on the level of 65-70% . during recent 5 years. Just in 1989, it
was reached 76.5%; but latter, by adjustment, it was returned to the



- 52 -
controlled level afore mentionea. (3) Long term  jiability -capital ratio (Long
term liability/ total capital), According to tne ADB's requirements and
suggestions of divers channels and resources to solve fund reauired, and the
development strategy that CIB formulated, curing 5 years. long term funds
raised directly by CIB from finance marKet haa been increased more quickly:
untii 1992, tne ratio was basically reached tne upper ceiling on the
reQuirements wnich was indicated by tne Worlc Bank and ADB. (4) Liability -
Capital Ratio (Total liability/ Total capital). In oace with the development
of CIB's operations, in debt operation. deposits absorbed and fund raised
directly by CIB had greatly increased, so that tne CIB's liability - caoital
ratio had been improved from 3.44 in 1988 to 10.69 in 1992, 2 times more than
the 1988's figure. (5) Benefit ratio (Assets -Profit Ratio. total profit /
Total Assets ), (Capital - Profit Ratio. Total profit / Total Capital) 1988 to
1992 was a key period of Chinese economic system turning from planning
management to market mechanism. All economic factors such as resource
allocation, market suoply and demand, price, measures of financing, basic
income environment, and economic entity's ownersnip gearing, and so on. had
happened tremendous changes. Economic management system had yet been pushed
into reforming. Under these atmosphere, CIB's benefit state also had some
waves, and its capital-profit rate and Assets-Profit rate had relevantly
cropDed, too.

tnousand RMB . t snows CIB's ooeration state nas been very well and its
reserve nave increased year after year.
5.18.Especially the specific reserve expense. before 1998, it was lower tnari
4100 tnousand Yuan. but each Year. but in 1988.,t snarDly increasea to 11.777



-53 -
thousana Yuan. From 1989 to 1992. it haa a consistent increase witn the
resoective aata of 8,443; 86.192; 109,282: and 28.476 thousana yuan. The ratio
of reserves for bad debts rose respectively as 0.4%. o.4%.1.2%. 1.2%, 2%
auring-1988-1992.  It ensurea that CIB's caoacity to oear loan repayment had
expanded successively.
5.19. Net income, in 1988. was 61.086 thousand Yuan. and in 1992 it was
48.797 tnousand yuan. !t means, CIB's net income nas Dasically kept a higher
