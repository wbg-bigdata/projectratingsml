3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
3.1.1.        The project's objectives were to (i) improve sector efficiency and minimize the long-term
cost of electricity supply in Benin and Togo; (ii) strengthen the management and operations of
Communaute Electrique du Benin - CEB, the wholesale supplier of electricity to the power utilities in Benin



and Togo, through technical assistance and training; and (iii) encourage regional cooperation and
integration.
3.1.2.       Benin and Togo created CEB in 1968 as a bi-national joint power generation and
transmission company. Its role was largely that of a wholesale supplier of electricity for sale to the
national power utilities of Benin (Societe Beninoise d'Electricite et d'Eau - SBEE) and Togo (Compagnie
Energie Electrique du Togo - CEET). At the time of project preparation, CEB purchased electricity from
the Volta River Authority (VRA) in Ghana at a low price (US cents 5/kWh). It also generated electricity
from the 65 MW Nangbeto Hydroelectric Power plant, which was built with Bank support on the Mono
river, and became operational in late 1987. The average cost of generation at Nangbeto was CFAF
24/kWh (about US cents 9.2/kWh at the prevailing exchange rate). As VRA supplied about 68 percent of
CEB's requirements, the average cost was US cents 6/kWh. CEB's average revenue was US cents 8/kWh,
leaving a comfortable margin of US cents 2/kWh, half of which was set aside for future investrnent.
3.1.3.       IDA's involvement in the power sector of Benin and Togo dates back to 1978, when it
agreed to be the executing agency f or a UNDP-financed project. IDA financed the Nangbeto project,
together with several donors, and extended two credits to Benin and Togo for power rehabilitation in
August 1990 and June 1991, respectively. When the Engineering and Technical Assistance Project was
approved in May 1992, an interconnection scheme from Nigeria to C6te d'Ivoire, through Benin,Togo and
Ghana was being studied under Nordic financing, with the African Development Bank (AfDB) as executing
agency. The Bank granted a PPF in June 1991 to finance the feasibility study for the extension of the
transmission network to North-Togo/North-Benin.
3.1.4.       The objectives of the Engineering and Technical Assistance Project were not consistent
with its expected outputs. It was not realistic to expect that a project, which basically included feasibility
and tariff studies, would have an impact on the efficiency of the sector and the long-term cost of electricity
supply without any follow up investment. The Project was prepared during a period of political turmnoil in
Togo. It was designed to give CEB and the Bank an instrument that would prepare the ground for future
investment in the sector after the return to normalcy in Togo. It was an appropriate instrument given the
circumstances, still it could not deliver more than what it was designed to achieve.
3.2 Revised Objective.
3.2.1.       The objectives of the Project should have been revised to bring them in line with its
components, but this was not done.
3.3 Original Components:
3.3.1.       The project included seven components: (i) updating the two countries' least-cost
generation, transmission and distribution master plans; (ii) evaluation of CEB's short-term supply
requirements, including a review of existing thermal plants, and definition of a model for regional power
interchange; (iii) detailed engineering and bidding documents of the northern interconnections; (iv) the
design of standard models for substations, towers and conductors for the 161 kV system expansion; (v)
tariff studies for CEB, SBEE, and CEET, including an analysis of long run marginal costs as a guide to
tariff structure and of revenue requirements to set the rates; (vi) updating supply options, including
intemational connections and environmental assessment; and (vii) institutional strengthening of CEB,
including training, legal, planning anid computerization. The total cost of the project was estimated at US$
6.1 million.
-2 -



3.3.2.        The centerpiece of the project was the preparation of the Adjarala Hydroelectric Scheme,
and interconnection investments for North of Togo and North of Benin with the Southern system. The
proposed Adjarala hydropower plant is expected to generate 325 GWh, compared to 160 GWh for
Nangbeto. It is expected that the plant would (i) benefit from water regulation already achieved by
Nangbeto, and as a result produce energy at a lower unit cost; and (ii) reduce Benin's and Togo's
dependency on imported energy.
3.3.3.        CEB was a well-managed utility, and was expected to play a larger role in the Region. It
had the capacity to implement the Project. Two main lessons were taken into account in designing the
Project. First, to ensure that CEB becomes self reliant, it was important to emphasize the transfer of know
how and the training of local staff during the implementation of the different studies. Second, to establish
regional cooperation on a sound basis, it was important to review carefully the incentives for each partner,
and clarify institutional relationships and responsibilities.
3.4 Revised Components:
Not Applicable.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
3.5.1.        The quality at entry of the project is rated unsatisfactory because of the disconnect
between its objectives and its components. Ignoring this aspect of the project quality, however, would
make the rating satisfactory. The project was fully consistent with the two country assistance strategies.
The project was an appropriate instrument in view of the unsettled political conditions prevailing in Togo;
and it was well prepared. Terms of reference were available. As an engineering and TA project, it was
not expected to have any impact on the environment. Bank's safeguard policies were adhered to. The
deteriorating political situation in Togo was mentioned as a significant risk, but CEB, as a successful
bi-national institution, was considered relatively immune to that risk.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
4.1.1.        The achievement of the project's objectives has to be assessed in the narrow context of
CEB's operations, as well as in the broader context of the two power rehabilitation projects which were
implemented simultaneously in Benin and Togo. As indicated above, the objectives of the project were not
achievable, and have not been achieved. The efficiency of the power sector in Benin and Togo will improve
with follow-up investments and with some form of private sector participation in CEET and SBEE.
4.1.2.        CEET experienced a steep deterioration in its performance in 1993-96. In 1997, it was
put under private management, and its performance has recovered, but only up to the low level achieved in
1989-90. Losses, which reached an all time high of 32 percent of supply in 1996, were reduced to 24
percent in 1998, and 20 percent in 2000, compared to 23 percent in 1990. No progress was made on
payment by the Government of its bills. SBEE's performance is improving.
-3 -



4.1.3.       The Engineering and Technical Assistance Project has been instrumental in helping GOB
and GOT realize that the efficiency ,of their utilities would not significantly improve as long as they
remained in the public sector. Accordingly, both countries have initiated a process of privatization. A
concession contract is expected to be signed for CEET in June 2000. The privatization studies for SBEE
are underway.
4.1.4.       The efficiency of CEB and its management have not improved. It was a well run utility
before the project was approved. In the early years of project implementation, however, its performance
was affected by the inability of CEET and other Togolese clients to pay for services delivered during the
period of political upheaval in Togo in 1991-93.
4.1.5.       CEB's financial situation deteriorated over past years. Its operating ratio, which was on
average 73 percent in the years 1988-90, increased to about 98 percent in 1997-98. In the 1980s CEB
accumulated cash reserves as a conbtibution to future investment (close to 20 percent of fixed assets in
1990). These cash reserves have dwindled, however, due to the accumulation of arrears during the project
implementation period. In 1998, they represented 6.7 percent of fixed assets only. CEB has failed to meet
the financial covenants set forth in the project agreement -- minimum debt service coverage of 1.5 and rate
of return on net current fixed assets of 6 percent.
4.1.6.       The rehabilitation of the thermal power plant in Benin and of a unit in Togo has been the
only step taken during project implementation to increase the supply of energy to the combined system.
Options for supplying power to the combined system have been reviewed, and two new projects, Togo
Power V and Benin Power VII are being prepared to implement the recommendations of the studies
financed under the project, as well as to promote economic growth and to make electricity accessible to a
larger segment of the population. Tlte objective is to minimize the long term cost of electricity supply in
Togo and Benin.
4.1.7.       The project has prornoted regional cooperation and integration. The Benin/Togo power
system is in the process of being increasingly integrated into a broad system encompassing the coastal
countries from CMte d'Ivoire to Nigeria. CEB has taken a number of initiatives to promote regional
cooperation. For instance, during the drought of 1998, CEB put its generating facilities under the authority
of VRA's dispatch center to maximize efficiency.
4.1.8.       Overall, the project's outcome is rated unsatisfactory. Its objectives were not achievable,
even if the situation in Togo had not contributed to a weakening of the local and regional power utilities.
4.2 Outputs by components:
4.2.1.       Updating the electricity master plans for Benin and Togo. Achieved. The two master
plans have been updated by two different consultants, who have been subsequently asked to join forces to
prepare an integrated master plan for the two countries. The output is fully satisfactory.
4.2.2.       Evaluation of CEB's, short term supply requirements. including a review of existing
thermal plants. and definition of a model for regional power interchange. Achieved. The two thermal
plants in Benin and Togo have been audited. The Benin plant has been rehabilitated with financing from
the power rehabilitation project. It provides power to the grid at a cost lower than the price paid by CEB to
purchase power from VRA. The Togo plant has been partially rehabilitated, with financing provided by
the French bilateral cooperation. A Rehabilitate, Own, Operate and Transfer (ROOT) approach is in the
- 4 -



process of being developed for the Togo Power Plant. A model for regional power interchange has been
developed. All power plants in Ghana, Benin and Togo were managed under a pool arrangement during the
energy crisis in the Region in 1998. A feasibility study for the interconnection between Ikeja West in
Nigeria and Sakete in Benin has been completed outside of the project. This interconnection is being
considered under Benin Power VII and Togo Power V.
4.2.3.       Detailed engineering and bidding documents of the northern interconnection (between the
northem systems in Benin and Togo). Achieved.
4.2.4.       Design of standard models for substations, towers and conductors for the 161 kV
expansion. Achieved.
4.2.5.       Tariff studies for CEB. SBEE and CEET. including an analysis of long run marginal costs
. Achieved. The study was completed in May 1999. The recommendations will be examined in the light
of increased efficiencies in the three utilities resulting from privatization of the two national utilities.
4.2.6.       Updating supply options, including hydroelectric schemes, interconnections with
neighboring countries and environmental assessments. Achieved. The power purchase contract with VRA
was set to expire in 1997. In August 1994, VRA informed CEB that it would cut power export to CEB by
20 percent because of poor rainfall. Options for the short term and medium term were reviewed. For the
short terrn, the rehabilitation of the two thermal plants in Benin and Togo was found to be the best option.
4.2.7.       For the medium term, five options were reviewed, these included: (i) the development and
utilization of gas from the Seme oil field in Benin; (ii) the construction of a pipeline to import gas from
Nigeria to Benin; (iii) the building of a 161 kV line interconnecting NEPA with the Benin-Togo system; (iv)
the building of thermal plants; and (v) the building of the Adjarala hydroelectric plant downstream frorn
Nangbeto. The least-cost solution was the import of gas from Nigeria, but this option was tied-up with the
West Africa Gas Pipeline. The gas from Seme field could not materialize as no serious developer showed
interest in Seme field. The interconnection with Nigeria is being pursued by CEB. Of all the options, CEB
preferred to pursue the Adjarala hydroelectric plant option.
4.2.8.       A BOOT approach has been tried but preliminary results of the study to implement the
Adjarala project under a BOOT scheme are not very encouraging. A classical public approach to project
financing is recommended by Benin and Togo.
4.2.9.       Institutional strengthening of CEB, including training, legal, planning and computerization.
Achieved. A major effort was made to computerize CEB. Studies were carried out and equipment was
bought. It has recently been installed. Training local staff has been a consistent feature in all contracts for
studies. Institutional relations between CEB, SBEE, CEET and VRA have been reviewed, and a draft
contract between CEB and VRA was prepared.
4.2.10.      Overall the achievement of project outputs is rated satisfactory.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:

4.4 Financial rate of return:

4.5 Institutional development impact:
4.5.1.        The project had a substantial impact on institutional development. The studies carried out
under the project with the active participation of CEB staff, gave them an opportunity to review the merits
of a number of options for the supply of power to the Benin/Togo system, and to deepen their
understanding of tariff issues. CEB has taken an active role in promoting regional cooperation, and its
staff has developed good negotiation skills.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
5.1.1.       Three major factors have affected project implementation and outcome: (i) the political
turmoil in Togo in the early 1990s and again in 1998-99; (ii) the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994, and
(iii) VRA's recurrent problems in supplying CEB up to the contractual amount of power.
5.1.2.       The political turmoil in Togo in the early 1990s brought modem sector activities to a
standstill and made it impossible for CEET to pay its bills to CEB. In 1994 however, the devaluation of
the CFA franc, and the return of the political situation to normalcy, triggered a strong economic recovery
which lasted until mid- 1998. Risingr political tensions following charges of electoral fraud in the June 1998
presidential elections compromised the recovery, and created an atmosphere of high uncertainty for private
sector activities.
5.1.3.       The devaluation of the CFA franc had a positive impact on economic growth in Benin and
Togo, but also had the immediate effect of doubling the price of electricity sold by VRA to CEB. CEB
was able to raise its tarifs by 65 percent in 1994, but the two national utilities were not allowed to follow
suit immediately, with detrimental e:ffects on their earnings. CEET was particularly affected.
5.1.4.       In several instances, during project implementation, VRA proved unable to supply the
agreed amount of electricity to CEE,. In May 1992, VRA informed CEB that the rehabilitation of its
power plants might reduce power available for sale. In August 1994, VRA informed CEB that it would cut
power export to CEB by 20 percent due to poor rainfall in Ghana. In 1998, because of a severe drought,
VIRA severely curtailed power supply to CEB for more than three months, creating a major problem in the
Region.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
5.2.1.       The poor handling by the Togolese authorities of the political transition to a more
democratic rule, which swept across Africa in the early 1990s, has been a major factor in the poor
macroeconomic performance of the country during the past decade.
5.2.2.       The reluctance of both GOB and GOT to increase electricity tariffs to the extent required
following the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994, and especially their persistent inability to pay their
electricity bills on time, have severely weakened their national utilities. Delays in the payment of
Government bills have been eliminated in Benin but not in Togo.
-6 -



5.2.3.       During project implementation, CEB, in addition to the Adjarala project, has undertaken
actions for the implementation of the interconnection CEB-NEPA. These actions have resulted in the
signing in 1996, of a contract for an exchange of electric power between CEB and NEPA, and the
completion of the detailed design and bidding documents.
5.2.4.       The level of the Akosombo lake was running dangerously low in 1996-97; the energy crisis
of 1998 was foreseable. Neither Government acted quickly enough to prevent the crisis or its
consequences, but when the crisis hit, both GOB and GOT rushed to acquire power generating units.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
5.3.1.       CEB invested considerable effort in the preparation of the Adjarala hydroelectric project.
Other options were available at a lower unit cost and shorter implementation time. Faced with a dramatic
cut in its supply CEB bought two 20 MW gas turbines with relatively high operating costs.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
5.4.1.       There were no significant cost changes in the project, neither was there a reallocation of
financial resources. The overall budget remained the same.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
6.1.1.       The institutional development achieved with project assistance is expected to be a lasting
improvement. The sustainability of the project is therefore likely. In spite of a weakened financial
situation, CEB has a competent and dedicated staff with the skills necessary to manage the required studies
for the development and management of the power sector, and operate the generation and transmission
assets in Benin and Togo.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
6.2.1.       The environment in the Region is fast changing and the role of CEB is in the process of
being redefined. It has a dual mandate and is a public utility with a monopoly in generation and
transmission throughout Benin and Togo (with the exception of facilities in service before 1968 and captive
plants of less than 100kVA). It is also a regulatory agency, with extensive powers delegated to it by the
two Governments concerned, including: (i) regulating generation and transmission of electricity; (ii)
interconnection with neighboring countries; (iii) planning and implementing electrification in the two
countries; and (iv) tariff setting.
6.2.2.       CEB's dual mandate may no longer be relevant or justified, as CEET and SBEE are being
privatized, and each country is establishing a separate national regulatory authority for its power sector.
6.2.3.       GOB and GOT decided that CEB would be the single buyer of electricity in the two
countries, and would continue to be responsible for the hydropower plants on the Mono river. CEB would
no longer have a monopoly on power generation. It is a solid company which could become a key player in
the Region.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7. 1 Lending:
7.1.1.        Despite an inadequate definition of objectives for an engineering credit, the performance
of the Bank in the identification, preparation and appraisal of the project is rated satisfactory. The Bank
has had a long involvement in the power sector in Benin and Togo, including the implementation of the
Nangbeto hydroelectric scheme. In the 1 980s, the performance of the two national utilities deteriorated,
due to a poor macroeconomic environment and inadequate policies. In 1990 and 1991, the Bank extended
credits to Benin and Togo for the rehabilitation of their power companies. In this context, the Bank's
continued association with CEB, to further strengthen CEB's management and encourage regional
cooperation was important to complement efforts at the national level.
7.1.2.       The project was well prepared. Terms of reference were available for all the studies, and
GOB and GOT were fully committed to giving CEB a broad mandate in the power sector. Also CEB had
a good track record as an implementing agency and was appropriately staffed to take responsibility for
project execution. The risk analysis was, however, weak. The risks of delays in project execution due to
the political situation prevailing in Togo were high, and should have been better recognized and discussed.
There was a good justification for providing assistance to CEB during this difficult period, as showed
during project implementation, and this should have been discussed openly. Eventually, the project helped
the power sector in the Region recover lost ground when the political situation in Togo improved. The
project was also instrumental in helping both Governments realize that privatization of their utilities was an
essential step for improving services and lowering costs.
7.2 Supervision:
7.2.1.       Overall, project supervision is rated satisfactory. There was a remarkable continuity in
Bank staff assigned to the project. Bank missions jointly supervised the three ongoing projects in the
Region, which was an efficient use of resources. These missions were most helpful in building up regional
cooperation mechanisms. Together Avith representatives of CEB, SBEE and CEET, Bank missions had
frequent contacts, with utilities in neighboring Ghana and Nigeria, and during the energy crisis of 1998
they helped CEB find alternative sources of energy in C6te d'Ivoire. The Bank (i) contributed to building
up a consensus on the need to privatize the power sector in Benin and Togo; and (ii) helped officials in
Benin, Togo, CEB, and the donor community focus on the resettlement and environment issues of the
Nangbeto and Adjarala hydropower projects. These issues had not been for example, thoroughly
addressed when the Nangbeto Project was prepared and implemented.
7.2.2.       Reporting on progress in achieving development objectives was not adequate. Supervision
missions should have recognized that the objectives of the project, as stated in the Memorandum of the
President, could not be achieved. The objectives should have been formally revised. As was expected at
project inception there was a mid-tenm review on 6/10/96.
7.3 Overall Bank performance.
7.3.1.       The Bank performance is rated satisfactory in spite of the disconnect between the
objectives and the components of the project.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
7.4.1.        The performance of GOB and GOT was satisfactory during preparation of the project.
Both Governments were committed to promoting CEB as a public utility, and as a sector regulatory
authority. They were fully aware of the advantages of regional cooperation in the sector.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
7.5.1.        GOB's performance is rated partially satisfactory. It was fully supportive of the project
and provided assistance to CEB to achieve its objectives. On the other hand, it took almost one full year
for the Government to meet the conditions of credit effectiveness for the Power Rehabilitation Project,
which was a critical element for the success of the project under review. GOB was also slow in taking
appropriate steps to avoid the severe energy crisis in 1998, but spared no efforts to purchase generators
when the supply of electricity from Ghana dried up. Towards the end of the extended project
implementation period, the Government realized that the privatization of its power utility would be
beneficial for ensuring improved services at a lower cost and took steps in that direction.
7.5.2.        In the early years of project implementation, GOTs performance was unsatisfactory. It
steadily improved after the political situation returned to normal, and the implementation of an economic
reform program, following the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994. GOT failed, however, to settle its
arrears, making it difficult for CEET to recover.
7.5.3.        In 1996-97, GOT decided to privatize its power company. The privatization process was
initiated in spite of renewed political tensions following the presidential elections in 1998. Overall, the
performance of GOT is rated unsatisfactory. It has weakened its local and regional utilities through large
accumulation of arrears throughout the 1 990s.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
7.6.1.        The performance of the implementing agency is rated satisfactory. It implemented the
project with due diligence and did its best to overcome the difficulties created by the political situation in
Togo. It further built up its reputation as a reliable partner in the Region. It complied with most project
conditionalities, with the notable exceptions, however, of regular reporting on project implementation, and
more importantly the financial covenants. Its focus on the Adjarala hydropower scheme - a long term
project - prevented it, from being more proactive in finding appropriate solutions to the chronic problem of
inadequate power supply from VRA.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
7.7.1.        Overall, GOB's performance is rated partially satisfactory. GOT's performnance is rated
unsatisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
8.1.1.        An engineering project by itself cannot be expected to bring about improved performance
in a sector or in the institution in charge of its implementation. The failure to recognize the disconnect
between the objectives and the components of the project throughout its life has led to a disconnect in the
ratings between the last supervision report and the completion report.
-9-



8.1.2.       An engineering cnrdit may be an appropriate instrument for maintaining a Bank presence
in a sector despite a difficult political environment. In this case, through the preparation of the Adjarala
project, which was a top priority for Benin and Togo, the Bank helped GOB and GOT realize that
continued public sector management and ownership of utilities would fail to result in improved
performance. The Bank's presence also raised awareness for more and better focused attention on
resettlement and environmental issues.
8.1.3.       Regional cooperation in the power sector is important to improve service reliability and
lower cost in the five coastal countries stretching from Cote d'Ivoire to Nigeria. It is vital for the two
smaller economies of Benin and Togo. These two countries could play a key role in regional schemes,
being located between Nigeria, which has large reserves of gas, and Ghana, which needs to increase its
supply of power, thus making it less dependent on hydraulic variations. To enhance the Bank's role in
fostering regional cooperation, all tasks related to the power sector in the sub-region should be part of one
cluster, and all team members should be directly or indirectly involved in all tasks.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB)
9.1.1.       The Engineering and Technical Assistance Project provided to a financially weakened
CEB the resources necessary to pursue the preparation of its power development program. Despite the
fact that there may have been a disconnect between components and objectives, the project accomplished
its intended purpose to provide engineering and technical assistance to CEB.
9.1.2.       Bank supervision missions were effective in coordinating power sector objectives in Togo
and Benin. The project and Bank missions were an opportunity for interactions and coordination between
CEB, CEET and SBEE to promote regional cooperation in the power sector.
9.1.3.       In contrast to both logo and Benin, the Bank did not see the Adjarala project as a priority
development in the sector. This position negatively influenced other donors and stopped its implementation.
The detailed engineering design of the Adjarala hydroelectric scheme was ready since 1990 and the results
of the economic study were approvecl by all donors in their December 1996 meeting in Cotonou. To date,
however, nothing has taken place. Benin and Togo would still like to see this project come to fruition to
reduce, if only slightly, their overwhelming dependence on outside sources of supply.
9.1.4.       To diversify its sources of supply, CEB has, in parallel with the implementation of the
Engineering and Technical Assistance Project, deployed efforts to advance the preparation of the
interconnection between CEB and NEPA. In 1996, these efforts resulted in the signing Agreement by
Togo, Benin and Nigeria of the International Interconnection. In 1997, CEB and NEPA signed an
electricity exchange contract. Furthermore, from 1997 to 1999, CEB autofinanced the updating of the
design studies, and the prequalification and bidding documents, following FIDIC guidelines.
9.1.5.       A proposal was made by an American firmn to implement the interconnection CEB-NEPA
under a BOOT scheme. The proposal, was found to be too expensive by the three countries concerned and
not consistent with their policy of regional cooperation.
