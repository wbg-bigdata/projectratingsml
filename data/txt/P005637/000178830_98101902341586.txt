THIRD PORT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:        Office des Ports Nationaux Tunisiens (OPNT)
Guarantor:       Republic of Tunisia
Amount:          US$42.5 million
Terms:           17 years, including 3.5 years of grace, at 7.95 percent per
annum.
Project
Description:  The proposed project would enable the ports of La Goulette and
Sfax to cope with changing shipping technology (roll-on/roll-
off), accommodate future traffic up to the year 2000, improve
efficiency of port operations, and decrease urban traffic
congestion. It would consist of: (i) at La Goulette -
construction of about 350 m of quays and of jetties for
roll-on/roll-off vessels at a new site on the south bank of
the Tunis/La Goulette canal and related dredging and reclama-
tion; dredging of access channel; open storage areas; transit
sheds; port access road; port administration and ancillary
buildings; provision of utility services; and purchase of
cargo-handling and workshop equipment and material for manu-
facture of pallets; (ii) at Sfax - construction of about 515 m
of quays including one roll-on/roll-off berth; transit and
customs sheds; open storage and parking areas; port access
road; provision of utility services; purchase of cargo-handling
and workshop equipment; and (iii) technical assistance through
provision of 220 man-months of expatriate consulting services
at an average cost of $7800 per man-month, and 370 man-months
of local services at an average cost of $2600 per man-month to
(a) supervise civil works at both ports; (b) assist OPNT and
STAM in reorganizing port workshops and maintenance proce-
dures; and (c) develop and implement training programs for
port workers.
Project benefits in the form of reduced ship-waiting and
turnaround time, lower cargo-handling costs, avoidance of
diversion costs and reclaimed land are expected to accrue to
OPNT and the Tunisian economy. The project is free from any
major risk.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR REC` '`R 2TION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO OFFICE DES PORTS NATIONAUX TUNISIENS FOR A
THIRD PORT PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan for the equivalent of US$42.5 million to the Office des Ports Nationaux
Tunisiens (OPNT), with the guarantee of the Republic of Tunisia, to help fi-
nance a Third Port Project. The loan would have a term of 17 years, including
3.5 years of grace, with an interest rate of 7.95 percent per annum. Financ-
ing for the remaining foreign exchange cost of $20.3 million has been partly
secured in the form of export credits in an amount of $16.3 million, the
balance ($4 million) to be provided as financial credits or by the Government.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.         An economic mission visited Tunisia in June 1978. Its report
entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of Tunisia" (No. 2201-TITN) was
issued on November 16, 1978. This part reflects its findings and those of an
updating mission which visited Tunisia in July 1979. Country Data sheets are
attached in Annex I.
3.         Tunisia is rather poorly endowed with agricultural resources.  Much
of the country is arid or semiarid. Agricultural activity is concentrated
along the coast in the North but corntinues to play an important role in
Tunisia's economic structure. The mnain crops are wheat and olives. These
crops are subject to sharp annual outfut fluctuations because of irregular
rainfall in the case of wheat and a natural production cycle for olives.
Tunisia's most important raw materi tls are phosphates and petroleum. The
large phosphate deposits are of low quality. Known oil reserves are rela-
tively small. Industrial developmenat, although rapid, has been hampered by
shortages of industrial entrepreneurs, the small domestic market and difficul-
ties in marketing Tunisian products abroad. The most important sector is
services; during 1970-78 it generated about half of GDP, a quarter of that
sector's contribution consisting of government services. Tourism has developed
rapidly during the 1970s. Workers' remittances have become a significant item
in the balance of payments, generating about 12 percent of current account
receipts during 1970-78.
4.         Tunisia's economy has performed remarkably well during 1970-78.
Real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 8.1 percent, nearly twice as fast
as during the 1960s. Per capita GNP in 1978 reached $998, which in real terms
is some 67 percent above its level of 1969. Tunisia was one of the few
countries in the world whose per capita GNP during 1970-76 increased at an
average annual rate of 6 percent or more.
1/ Part I is updated froma President's Report No. P-2592-TUN of June 18, 1979
for a Second Fisheries Project.



5.        This performance was partly attributable to improved economic man-
agement, and partly to fortuitous factors. In 1969, Tunisia changed its
inward-oriented investment strategy dominated by state activities. The new
policy orientations, announced during the 1970s, resulted in a change towards
a more open and export-oriented economy in which private initiative could play
an increasing role. A number of decontrol measures were introduced, albeit
slowly. Overall, the new policy orientation proved beneficial for the country.
In addition, the economy benefited from favorable weather conditions resultin2
in good agricultural crops while the change in world market prices during
1973/74 brought sizeable windfalls as the terms of trade improved sharply.
This allowed domestic savings to increase to 21 percent of GDP during 1970-78,
compared with 15 percent during the 1960s.  Tunisia's dependence on external
financing declined from about 32 percent of investment in 1969 to 29 percent
in 1978; the share was as low as 15 percent during 1973-76, when gains from
the terms of trade were at their peak.  The balance of payments had been in
continuous overall surplus since 1967.  But after 1975, this was no longer the
case as the terms of trade began to deteriorate while imports continued to
increase rapidly.  In 1978 there was another turnaround and reserves increased
in the wake of heavy capital inflows. However, Tunisia's debt service payments
in relation to exports of goods and non-factor services (debt service ratio)
in 1978 were still a low 10.9 percent, compared with 20 percent in 1970.
6.         Rapid economic growth allowed Tunisia to make substantial social
gains during the 1970s. By 1976, primary school enrollment had reached 100
percent and secondary enrollment 20 percent of the relevant age groups. Educa-
tion is free through university. Public health services have been expanded,
with many services provided free. A family planning program has been intro-
duced and since 1973 has met with substantial success. The birth rate declined
from 43.8 per thousand in 1966 to 32.0 per thousand in 1978 while the rate of
natural growth declined from 3.0 to 2.6 percent in the same period. Attempts
have been made to reduce regional imbalances and to improve the lot of the
poor. The share of the population living in absolute poverty declined from 30
percent in 1966 to 18 percent in 1975. However, important disparities remain
between income levels among individuals and regions. In coping with the social
aspects of development, Tunisia faces strongly increased aspirations of its
population in the face of limited natural and financial resources.
7.        The most important problem for the Tunisian economy is widespread
open and hidden unemployment. In 1978, about 13 percent of the labor force--
some 231,000 people--were unemployed and the unemployment rate has been rising.
In addition, there is considerable hidden unemployment in agriculture which
provided 39 percent of employment in 1978. If one considers that about
40 percent of this labor force does not have full time jobs, the effective
overall unemployment rate is more like 25 percent. An increasing number of
young people born during the high birth rate years are reaching working age
and a growing number of women are joining the labor force. About half of the
registered unemployed are young people seeking their first employment. These
are mostly relatively educated people whose job aspirations cannot be met.
8.         During 1970-78, agriculture provided more than 40 percent of total
employment, 25 percent of merchandise exports and 17 percent of GDP. Food
processing accounted for another 4 percent of GDP and comprised 35 percent



-3 -
of value added in manufacturing.  Agricultural prodtuction rose substantially,
largely as a result of favorable weather. Current policy, which emphasizes
proJects that make a rapid and direct contribution to production, iecognizes
various constraints on agricultural development: insecurity of land tenure;
inadequate access to agricultural credit; inadequate extension services;
insufficient agricultural education; and underutilization of irrigation
investments. Under the Fourth Plan (1973-76) about $140 million was allocated
to a rural development fund executed by the provincial administrations. These
rural development efforts are being continued under the current Plan (1977-81).
9.        During the 1960s, manufacturing production in Tunisia increased by 8
percent annually. This growth rate accelerated during 1970-78 to 10 percent
annually, due partly to record years for the olive oil processing industry and
to favorable developments in the textile and chemical industries. The early
thrust of industrialization came from large import substitution projects.
These suffered, however, from the small domestic market and shortages of
experienced staff and management. Since 1970, more emphasis has been put on
export-oriented private industries, particularly in food processing, textiles
and mechanical and electrical industries. Foreign and domestic private invest-
ment is now stimulated by a comprehensive incentive framework and facilitated
by streamlined approval procedures of the investment promotion agency. Apart
from finance, foreign investors are expected to contribute know-how and over-
seas marketing capability. Although an agreement between Tunisia and the
European Economic Community signed in April 1976 provided for duty free entry
into the Community of nearly all Tunisian industrial products, import restric-
tions on some of them were imposed in 1977 and 1978. The Government has estab-
lished a special fund to encourage growth of small industries and industrial
decentralization, and it has started a program to establish industrial estates.
10.       The development of tourism In Tunisia is relatively recent.  Foreign-
visitor arrivals reached 1.1 million in 1978, with an average annual rate
of growth during 1970-1978 of 13 percent -- sharply higher than that of the
Mediterranean tourism market as a whole. Since 1970, tourism has become 2
major source of foreign exchange earnings, reaching $412 million in 1978; this
was slightly more than earnings from all manufacturing exports and was exceeded
only by petroleum exports. The rapid development of tourism in Tunisia has
created new demands on infrastructure (particularly recreational facilities),
trained manpower, and related services, which have been met only partly. The
Government is endeavoring to alleviate these constraints through a variety
of measures including revised investment incentives, increased marketing and
training efforts, codes to enforce quality standards, more stringent zoning
laws, and development of recreational facilities.
11.       The main objectives of the current Five-Year Plan (1977-81) are:
(i) full employment of the additions to the labor force; (ii) self-sufficiency
in major foodstuffs (defined as a balanced trade account for agricultural
goods); (iii) increases in the standard of living; and (iv) social stability
through incomes policies and wage and price harmonization. The Plan foresees
an average annual rate of real GDP growth of 7.3 percent. This is somewhat



- 4 -
below the 9.2 percent achieved during 1970-7b, mainly because the fortuitous
factors prevalent during the early 1970s were not expected to continue.
Investment is projected at TD 4.2 billion ($9.8 billion) in current prices
during the Plan. In real terms, average annual investment would be 54 percent
greater during 1977-81 than during the preceding Plan. Nonetheless, the
targeted average annual rate of growth of real investment during the Fifth
Plan is only 4.1 percent, as this rate is influenced by the very high invest-
ment level achieved in the base year, 1976.
12.       The Fifth Plan's strategy emphasizes in particular export-oriented
industrial development and agricultural growth. Special attention is given to
employment creation and to balance of payments considerations. Substantial
investments are to be made in hydrocarbons, manufacturing, water development,
transport and housing. The Plan prescribes increased domestic production and
processing of Tunisia's mineral resources (phosphates, petroleum) to raise the
value-added component of exports as much as possible. Private sector initia-
tive is expected to dominate investment in textiles, mechanical and electrical
industries, and tourism. It is in these activities that the authorities
expect most employment creation to take place. Employability of the labor
force is to be increased through education and training programs. Efforts
towards regional development are to be pursued through establishing regional
planning structures, strengthening regional administration and developing
incentives for the decentralization of productive activities. The strategy
proposed for the Fifth Plan does not represent any major departure from the
strategy pursued successfully during the preceding Plan.
13.       Tunisia's existing resource base, its institutional and infrastruc-
tural framework, its good performance in the earlier part of this decade,
and the desire of the authorities to support further development with appro-
priate policy measures and institutions are fundamental factors pointing
towards continuing rapid economic growth during the Fifth Plan. The 7.3
percent growth target is in line with the possibilities of the economy. The
investment priorities formulated in the Plan are considered necessary to
support the sectoral strategies. There are, however, some less favorable
signs. Tunisia will have to rely increasingly on its own resources since
the fortuitous circumstances of the early 1970's are unlikely to be repeated.
As the resource base is relatively narrow, available resources need to be
more efficiently deployed. Achieving the Plan targets presupposes the timely
introduction and successful execution of measures to: (i) strengthen the
absorptive capacity for investment, especially for labor intensive projects;
(ii) promote exports; (iii) base economic management on an efficient price and
incentive system and improve productivity; and (iv) mobilize the resources
needed to realize the comprehensive social development targets while maintain-
ing domestic and external financial stability. The Tunisian authorities have
begun to introduce measures in these respects. To increase the absorptive
capacity for investment, institutions like the Investment Promotion Agency
(API) and the National Center for Industrial studies (CNEI) were strengthened.
The activities of the Export Promotion Center (CEPEX) were widened to include
investigations on non-traditional markets, especially in the Middle East and
Japan.



-5-
14.       Substantial efforts in domestic and external resource mobilization
in particular will be of crucial importance to finance the planned level of
investment. On the domestic side, there is a need for increased savings
and improved financial intermediation. The Government sector, in particular,
will again be called upon to contribute substantially to the savings effort.
The Plan suggests that this should be done by prudent expenditure policies and
increased revenue collections (selective tax increases and better tax collec-
tion). Measures to this end have been taken by curtailing the growth of
budgetary expenditures, increasing taxes on real estate and luxury consumer
goods and making payment of taxes a pre-condition for obtaining administra-
tive licences of all kinds. In addition, the public enterprise sector will
have to increase substantially its contribution to public savings through
better management and especially through cost-related increases in the sale
prices of selected enterprises. Steps in this direction have been initiated
through tariff raises on water, power and port services. Externally, Tunisia
would have total financing requirements (disbursement basis) of some $3.1
billion during the Fifth Plan, of which $1.3 billion have already been obtained
during 1977-78. Given the country's creditworthiness, Tunisia should be able
to mobilize the remaining $1.8 billion of such financing without straining the
country's debt servicing capacity (para. 16).
15.       Since the early 1960s, Tunisia has obtained large amounts of offi-
cial aid. A Consultative Group chaired by the Bank provided a forum for aid-
coordination among major donors in the past. During 1970-78, annual loan
commitments from public sources averaged $395 million, or about $47 per
capita. About 50 percent of these commitments came from bilateral public
sources, chiefly from France, Canada, and the Federal Republic of Germany.
About 15 percent of the bilateral aid came from oil-producing countries, whose
share increased rapidly from 8 percent in 1970 to 29 percent in 1978. Commit-
ments from the Bank Group during 1970-78 accounted for 20 percent of total
public commitments. Most aid has been obtained on relatively soft terms; in
1978 the average terms of borrowing were 5.4 percent interest and 20 years
maturity, including 5 years of grace. During 1970-78, Tunisia also received
annually some $40 million in grants. Loan commitments from private sources
averaged $125 million a year. While direct foreign private investment has
been comparatively small, it has gained momentum since 1974 following incre-
ased activity in the petroleum sector and new incentives offered to foreign
investors in manufacturing. Net direct foreign investment increased from $19
million in 1969 to $96 million in 1978, with most of it going to the petroleum
sector.
16.       At the end of 1978, total foreign debt (disbursed and outstanding)
was estimated at about $2.4 billion, or 41 percent of GDP. The debt service
ratio in 1978 was 10.9 percent, compared with 20 percent in 1970. This sig-
nificant decline in the debt service ratio was mainly due to the sharp increase
in export earnings following the changes in world market prices in 1973/74.
External borrowing at the rate projected for 1977-81 (para. 14) would increase
debt service obligations to around 14 percent of exports of goods and non-
factor services by 1981 and 15 percent by 1986, according to current Bank
projections. At these levels, the debt service burden would be manageable,
particularly when seen in the light of Tunisia's long record of prudent and



-6-
skillful balance of payments and external debt management. Tunisia is there-
fore considered creditworthy for further Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TUNISIA
17.       Since 1962, Tunisia has received a total of thirty-six loans and
eleven credits amounting respectively to $569.2 million and $70.1 million,
net of cancellations. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of November 30, 1979, and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects. While disbursements of some loans and credits
have been slower than foreseen at appraisal, on the whole project execution
has been satisfactory. In a number of sectors, important institutional
improvements have been achieved and autonomous agencies have been created or
strengthened.
18.       The Bank's lending strategy in Tunisia aims at supporting Government
efforts to (a) increase employment, (b) encourage more balanced growth and
distribution of income among regions and income groups, (c) promote export-
oriented policies and investments, and (d) provide selective support for the
development of infrastructure and for institution building in key public
services. The main supporting feature of this lending strategy is to support
the Tunisian authorities in timely and well-coordinated preparation of proj-
ects, with emphasis on technical assistance. The Bank is also cooperating
with the Government in its efforts to increase the mobilization of domestic
and foreign resources, in part through encouraging project cofinancing; the
latter is particularly important in view of the extent of Tunisia's external
resource needs, the large size of many priority projects and the limited
availability of Bank resources relative to the country's needs.
19.       Within this broad framework, past lending emphasized support for
long-term investments in infrastructure and social development. Lending for
urban and social development, including water supply, sewerage, education,
family planning, urban low-cost housing, and the Tunis planning and public
transport project has accounted for 33 percent of Bank/IDA commitments in
Tunisia since 1971. Lending for transport, power and tourism infrastructure
has accounted for 28 percent. Agriculture and fisheries have received 20
percent of total commitments.  Industrial and hotel financing, through the
Banque de Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET), has accounted for 15
percent, and the Gafsa phosphate development project for 4 percent.
20.       An irrigation project is being presented to the Board simultaneously
with the proposed project. In addition to these, loans for highways, agricul-
tural credit to small and medium farmers and agroindustries, and gas distribu-
tion projects are also expected to be presented to the Executive Directors in
this fiscal year. Projects being prepared for subsequent consideration include
those for agricultural development in the Northwest, a second population
project, vocational training, textile rehabilitation, assistance for small-
scale industrial development, and other priority urban and rural social
development projects.



7 -
T'he bank Group accounted for about i3 percent ot total public com-
mcirents to Tunisia during 1970-78.  The Bank Group's share of total debt
outstanding and disbursed at the end of 1978 (including loans from private
sources) was 11 percent and of debt service during 1978 was 14 percent. The
Bank Group's share in Tunisia's disbursed external debt by 1986 is expected
to remain unchanged at about 11 percent, but its share in debt service would
decline to about 12 percent.
22.       IFC has invested in NPK Engrais (a fertilizer plant), in BDET, in
Compagnie Financiere et Touristique (COFIT, a company to promote and invest
in tourism projects), in Societe Touristique et Hoteliere RYM (a large hotel
development) and in Industries Chimiques du Fluor, which will produce alumi-
nium fluoride from local fluorspar for export, and in the Sousse-Nord inte-
grated tourism development project. IFC's net commitments in Tunisia total
$15.0 million.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SYSTEM AND THE PORT SUBSECTOR
The Transport System
23.       At independence in 1956, Tunisia inherited a relatively well-
developed transport system. No major improvements were undertaken until after
a Transport Survey was conducted in 1968. During the Fourth Economic Develop-
ment Plan (1973-1976), major infrastructure investments brought capacity
closer to demand. However, urban transport development could not keep pace
with the rapidly expanding centers of Greater Tunis and Sfax. In the current
Plan (1977-1981), $1,250 million are allocated for transport investments and
about $500 million were actually spent during the first two years. The Fifth
Plan emphasizes the development of rural roads and urban transportation, and
increased efficiency of the system. Maritime investments account for almost
25 percent of the Plan total. In preparation of the Sixth Plan (1982-86), the
government has engaged consultants to review the overall coordination in the
sector and draft subsectoral development plans.
24.       The transport system now consists of 17,600 km of classified roads;
2,000 km of standard and narrow-gauge railways; five commercial sea ports;
and four airports. The railways continue to lose traffic to roads. In 1976,
they accounted for 34 percent of freight traffic (other than phosphates and
iron ore) and 23 percent of passenger traffic, compared with 45 percent and
30 percent in 1967. However, air passenger traffic increased at an annual
average rate of 29 percent from 1970 to 1977 and total cargo handled by the
five major sea ports by about 4 percent annually from 1972 to 1978.
The Port Subsector
25.       Most international cargo traffic is handled through the commercial
sea ports: Tunis/La Goulette, Sfax, Bizerte, Sousse, and Gabes. This traffic,
mostly with Southern Europe, accounted for 85 percent of the 11.0 million
metric tons of cargo handled in 1978. Most of the remaining 15 percent coastal



traffic is shipment of petroleum products from Bizerte to Sfax and La Goulette.
The ports of Bizerte and Gabes handle essentially bulk cargo traffic such as
crude oil, refined products and fertilizer materials. Sousse and Bizerte
handle some general cargo of construction materials for local use. Thus,
although Sfax and, to a lesser extent, La Goulette handle bulk cargo, they are
Tunisia's major general cargo ports and the centers of the country-wide rail
and road distribution system. In addition to the commercial ports, there are
approximately forty-five fishing ports of varying sizes.
26.       A recent but rapidly growing phenomenon in the Mediterranean is the
conversion of general cargo shipments from conventional to roll-on/roll-off
vessels.  They are best suited to the short distance and commodity trade
characteristics of the region. Between 1978 and 1985, roll-on/roll-off
traffic is expected to increase from 200,000 tons to 770,000 tons, or by about
20 percent per year, at La Goulette and from 27,000 tons to 160,000 tons, or
by close to 30 percent per year, at Sfax. To take advantage of this trend
specialized berths and facilities (including adequate back-up areas) are
required to increase the productivity of the ports.
27.       The Tunis/La Goulette port complex is the largest, accounting for 30
percent of all port traffic of the country. It is also the main port of call
for cruise ships and passenger car ferries. La Goulette now has five general
cargo berths, and one berth each for roll-on/roll-off vessels, cruise ships
and car ferries. The older Tunis port has only general cargo berths; in
1978 it handled 19 percent of the 3.2 million tons which passed through the
port complex. The total number of commercial vessels calling at La Goulette
in 1978 was 1,547: 524 general cargo liners; 289 roll-on/roll-off vessels;
319 car ferries; 317 bulk carriers; and 98 cruise ships. Only conventional
vessels, including small bulk carriers, call at Tunis.
28.       Sfax, located 240 km south of Tunis, is the second largest port and
serves as the gateway to the southern region. With five general cargo and
three specialized bulk berths, the latter owned by user companies, Sfax
handles the largest volume of dry bulk cargo (mainly phosphate rock for
export). It also serves for general cargo and some liquid bulk and as the
supply depot and home port for vessels supporting offshore oil exploration.
Its traffic consists mostly of conventional vessels, although 4.8 percent of
the 1978 cargo volume was carried by roll-on/roll-off vessels despite the lack
of specialized berths. Commercial vessels calling at Sfax totaled 1,392: 527
general cargo vessels and 865 bulk carriers.
29.       Subsector Management.  Commercial port facilities in Tunisia are
owned and operated by the Office des Ports Nationaux Tunisiens (OPNT), with
the exception of Gabes which OPNT manages on behalf of the Ministry of Trans-
port and Communications (MTC). MTC is responsible for the coordination of all
transport modes, the administration of regulation and tariffs and the sectoral
planning and development. The broad overall responsibility for transport
development in the context of national economic development rests with the
Ministry of Planning. The Sectoral Commission for Transport (Commission
Sectorielle des Transports) representing the administration, transport agencies
and other users, advises the above two Ministries from the point of view of



business and user interests. OPNT is an independent public authority under
the Minister of Public Works. The Ministry of Public Works through its Harbor
Department has the main responsibility for developing and managing fishing
ports. Separate companies are in charge of cargo handling in the port areas.
The most important cargo-handling company is the Societe Tunisienne d'Acconage
et de Manutention (STAM)) a limited liability company majority-owned by the
state shipping corporation, Compagnie Tunisienne de Navigation (COTUNAV).
Previous Bank Involvement
30.       Since 1964, the Bank Group has been extensively involved in the
development and strengthening of the Tunisian transport sector. To date
eight projects have been financed through eight loans and a credit for the
development of ports, highways, railways, rural roads, and a gas pipeline.
Two projects have been completed in the ports subsector. The first loan (Loan
No. 380-TUN) for $7.0 million, signed in 1964, financed the development
of the initial infrastructure for a modern port at La Goulette. OPNT was set
up in the context of this first lending operation and received technical
assistance in accounting and financial management. A second loan (Loan No.
573-TUN) of $8.5 million, signed in 1968, was a continuation and expansion of
the first. Components of this project were: capital dredging at Bizerte,
Sfax and La Goulette; reconstruction of a breakwater at Bizerte; provision of
a new bulk grain facility at La Goulette; and provision of cargo-handling
equipment. A port subsector Master Plan was also partially financed by this
loan (para. 32).
31.       The Project Performance Audit Report on the first two projects
(Report No. 1049 of February 26, 1979) described them as a successful attempt
to develop a modern port infrastructure in Tunisia and found the institution-
building and technical assistance to have resulted in a financially viable
OPNT, capable of playing a major role in future development. However, the
report notes that despite substantial investments in equipment, correspond-
ing improvements in productivity failed to materialize. The proposed project
addresses this problem (para. 38).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
32.       A master plan study for long-term port planning was undertaken in
1974 by the Government, partially financed by the second Bank loan (Loan No.
573-TUN). Based on the needs thus outlined, OPNT retained consultants to
prepare engineering plans for the expansion of La Goulette and Sfax for the
period 1979-90. Appraisal took place in September 1978. However, questions
remained concerning the timing of the project, appropriateness of the La
Goulette expansion at a new site, and the selection of specific proposals for
technical assistance to improve operations. Therefore, following discussions
in Washington and Tunis, including a decision to request bids in order to have
accurate cost estimates, a mission visited Tunis and finalized appraisal of
the project in June 1979. Negotiations were held in Washington and completed
on December 17, 1979; the Tunisian negotiating team was led by Mr. Mestiri of



- 10 -
the Ministry of Plan. A report entitled "Sta!f Appraisal Report Third Port
Project Tunisia" (No. 2641a-TUN) is being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors. The main features of the loan are mentioned in the
Project Summary and in Annex III. A map showing the location of Project
facilities is also attached.
Project Objectives
33.       The project has three major objectives:  (i) to enable the project
ports to adapt to changes in shipping technology, (ii) to increase the opera-
tional efficiency of OPNT and the cargo-handling companies, and (iii) to
increase port capacity for future traffic needs. Changing technology in sea
transport, specifically the advent of roll-on/roll-off vessels in the Mediter-
ranean, has had a significant impact on reducing transport costs. Tunisia
will be able to take advantage of this development with the provision of
specialized berths.
34.       Operational efficiency in the port areas has been a concern of the
Bank since the design of the first port project. In the proposed project,
construction of additional storage areas and transit sheds, provision of
additional cargo-handling equipment, and upgrading of equipment repair and
maintenance facilities will allow OPNT in conjunction with STAM and the other
cargo-handling companies to institute more efficient operating procedures.
Special attention will therefore be given in the project to training of the
port workers themselves in the use of more efficient cargo-handling methods,
such as pallets, and in more orderly storage of cargo in the open areas and
transit sheds (para. 38). The training program will be carried out with
training personnel whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions
of employment shall be satisfactory to OPNT and the Bank (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 3.02).
35.       The third major objective, to increase port capacity, will enable La
Goulette and Sfax to cope with future traffic by installing berths capable
of handling innovations in shipping technology. The specialized berths for
roll-on/roll-off vessels will also allow these ports to increase their through-
put. At La Goulette, the 1978 average daily throughput was 385 tons for
general cargo and 600 tons for roll-on/roll-off. With the new facilities,
equipment and training provided in the proposed project, throughput is expected
to increase to 450 tons for general cargo and 710 tons for roll-on/roll-off by
1985. Similarly at Sfax, throughput is estimated to increase by 1984 from 395
tons to 500 tons for general cargo and from negligible to 700 tons for roll-on/
roll-off.
Project Description
36.       The Bank has reviewed and agreed with OPNT on the selected port
layouts and development schemes which are least-cost solutions compared with
alternatives analyzed during the preparation of the Master Plan for ports. At
La Goulette, the project is the first major step in the development of a new
port area on the south bank of the Tunis/La Goulette canal. The deepening and
widening of the canal and dredging of a new deep-water basin will facilitate



- 1 ! '
the construction. of about 350 m of quays for six new berths and back-up areas
on the south bank while also providing OPNT with the potential for further
expansion, when required, at a relatively low cost. Four of the new berths
would be roll-on/roll-off and two multipurpose.  Transit sheds, storage
areas, and utilities are also included.
37.       At Sfax, further expansion of the existing port area, particularly
the back-up and storage areas, is impractical because of the proximity to the
old city. Existing access roads, which pass through the city, also contribute
to congested city traffic. Thus, the construction of new port facilities on
the south bank of the basin constitute the physical project components at
Sfax. The civil works consist of about 515 m of quays for one roll-on/roll-
off and two general cargo berths, a port access road, storage and parking
areas, transit sheds, and provision of port utilities.
38.       The potential for increased operational efficiency at both ports
increases with the use of more roll-on/roll-off cargo-handling. But actual
improvements in operating efficiency depend upon optimal use of the physical
equipment, better methods of cargo-handling, and improved procedures for
handling and storage, such as the removal of unclaimed or customs-detained
cargo to warehouses. To accomplish these objectives, the project includes
provision for additional cargo-handling and repair workshop equipment, mate-
rials for the manufacture of 20,000 pallets, and technical assistance. The
last includes three components: (i) consulting services to assist in the
supervision of civil works construction, (ii) consulting services to assist
in reorganizing the repair workshops and maintenance procedures, and (iii)
developing and implementing training programs for port workers (para. 34).
Cargo-handling improvements, such as sorting, storage, and the introduction of
pallets, have begun at La Goulette following an initial reorganization of STAM
in August 1978 that included a start to introducing palletization, developing
a training program and constructing separate warehouses for long-term storage.
Further actions under the project will be carried out according to an agreed
plan which is expected to result in a productivity increase in handling
operations (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.04).
39.       The proposed project accounts for 86 percent of OPNT's 1980-84
investment program of $145.9 million. Of the remaining investments, the main
items are the ongoing construction of warehouses at La Goulette, and upgrading
of facilities at all ports. As presently constituted, OPNT's investment plan
is considered feasible and justifiable. Assurances have been obtained that,
until completion of the project, OPNT shall not undertake investments in
excess of $2.5 million per year, which are not included in the agreed invest-
ment program (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.05).
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
40.       Total project cost is estimated at TD 50.4 million ($125.8 million),
including physical and price contingencies, with a foreign exchange component
of TD 23.1 million ($62.8 million). Duties and taxes account for TD 8.7
million ($21.6 million) of the TD 25,2 million ($63.0 million) local component.



- 12 -
Physical contingencies of 10 percent for civil works and 5 percent for equip-
ment are included as well as price contingencips T  9 percent in 1980, 8 per-
cent in 1981 and 7 percent per year thereafter f. c;vil works, equipment, and
technical assistance regardless of foreign or anca. origin. Cost estimates
for civil works reflect the availability of local construction materials and
labor. Although the main works will be undertaken by foreign contractors,
local contractors are likely to participate as subcontractors. Manpower
requirements for technical assistance are split into expatriate and local.
Two hundred and twenty man-months of expatriate consultants include 150 man-
months for supervision of civil works construction; 5 man-months, organization
of repair workshops and services; and 65 man-months, training of port workers.
Moreover, for supervision of civil works, 370 man-months of local manpower is
estimated: 110 man-months of consultants and 260 man-months of technicians.
Cost per man-month for expatriates have been estimated at $7,800; for local
experts, $4,000; and for local technicians, $2,000.
41.        Cost estimates for civil works are based on the ICB bids received in
June 1979, and for equipment and technical assistance on manufacturers' and
consultants' current prices. For some components of the civil works, the bids
have been lower than costs prevailing in recent years. For example, the
prices quoted for dredging were about 35 percent below such costs adjusted for
inflation. Without these favorable market conditions, which are not expected
to persist, overall costs would have been about 12 percent higher than were
actually obtained.
42.        The Bank loan of $42.5 million would cover 68 percent of the foreign
exchange cost, or 34 percent of the total project cost, and would finance the
foreign exchange cost of civil works at La Goulette, as well as of the tech-
nical assistance required under the project. The Tunisians have secured
export credits for 80 percent of the foreign exchange cost of civil works at
Sfax and for equipment in an amount of $16.3 million. The balance of $4.0
million will be provided in the form of financial credits or by the Government
out of its general borrowing. The export credits for the civil works at Sfax
($9.5 million) would be at 8.5 percent for 12 years, and the various export
credits for equipment are on satisfactory terms. The financing plan is shown in the
Project Summary.  OPNT would be the borrower of the Bank loan and carry the
foreign exchange risk. It has the authority to secure loans from any source
with the approval of the Government. Estimated local currency costs, includ-
ing taxes and duties, will be financed from OPNT's internally generated funds.
Provision has been made for cross-effectiveness between the Bank loan and the
other external credits (draft Loan Agreement, Sections 7.01 and 7.02).
Project Implementation
43.        OPNT would execute the project with the help of consultants.  The
Authority was established in 1965 in the context of the first loan and was the
borrower of the second loan (para. 30).  Over the years, -t has developed into
a mature organization with competent and efficient management and staff.  It
is managed and acts through a Board of twelve members, ap ->c-ed by the
Minister of Public Works.  A financial controller, appointef- ? y the Minister
of Planning, and a technical controller, appointed by the Minfistter ^  Duillic
Works, attend Board meetings in an advisory and surp-visory capLcciy. A



- 13 -
r es4den: Director-General (PDG) chairs the Board and is res7cns.-'e for
-n.'_Memnting Board decisions and day-to-day management.  He is s-ynacrted by
an Assistant Director General and five department directors  a.mffi½.stration,
f.:ance, planning and development, technical operations and new works.  Each
port is managed by a port director who reports directly to the PDG.
4k.       Bids for civil works were received in June 1979. Award of the civil
workcs contracts at La Goulette and Sfax is imminent. Construction would
begin at both project ports in early 1980 on land already owned by OPNT. At
Sfax, construction would be completed by April 1983 while the additional
dredging and land reclamation necessary at La Goulette would postpone final
completion of the project to June 1984. Tendering for new equipment is
scheduled for early 1981 with supply and delivery during 1983 and 1984.
The consultants for supervision of civil works construction, equipment
maintenance/repair, and the training programs will be recruited no later than
mid-1980. Their qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of
employment shall be satisfactory to OPNT and the Bank (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 3.02).
45.        Special arrangements have been made for cargo handling.  OPNT will
lease equipment procured under the project to cargo hand'ling companies on
terms acceptable to the Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.06). Materials
required for construction of pallets (para. 38) will be procured by OPNT and
transferred to STAM under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank, and on terms
ensuring full recovery of costs (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.07).
Procurement and Disbursements
46.       The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against (i) 48 percent of
the total expenditures for civil works at La Goulette, contracted after
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines, and
(ii) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for technical assistance. Disburse-
ments would take place over six years, 1980-1985. The closing date of the
loan would be June 30, 1985.
F4nancial Covenants
47.       OPNT has good quality financial management; it is a profit-making
organization. Cash flow projections indicate that OPNT will be able to
finance the project's local costs from internally generated funds while
maintaining satisfactory operating ratios. Also, OPNT will have sufficient
f'unds to adequately cover its debt service charges.  To safeguard its finan-
cial position, OPNT has agreed to (i) not incur any further debt, without the
agreement of the Bank, if its net revenues for the fiscal year preceding the
date of such incurrence are less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service
requirements for any succeeding year (draft Loan Agreement, Secti-on 5.08);
(ii) maintain its revenues at a level which will enable it to generate a
retu:rn on average revalued net fixed assets of not less then 7 percent (draft
Loan Agreerent, Section 5.07). This would require that, by December 31, 1980,
OPN7 revalue its assets as of December 31, 1979 and update th e valuation
7e'riodicall->' 'n.ereafter. Preliminary Bank staff calculations indicate that,



- 14 -
as from 1980 up to 1983, OPNT's financial rate of return, based on revalued
assets, is likely to exceed 7 percent at present tariff rates.
48.        It is important that the tariff structure be revised from time to
time so that the appropriate share of the investment's benefits return to the
investor, OPNT, and the Tunisian economy. The tariff structure has been
revised recently and is expected to increase revenues by 30 percent in a year.
Furthermore, OPNT will, in consultation with the Bank, accordirgly review
again the tariff structure not later than December 31, 1981, an.n put the new
tariff into effect not later than December 31, 1982, (6rstt Loan Agreement,
Section 5.06).
Monitoring and Audit
49.       OPNT will submit to the Bank and at regular intervals reports on the
progress in the project implementation (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.04).
Also, OPNT will have its accounts audited by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank and submit to the Bank audited accounts with the reports not later
than six months after the end of each fiscal year (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 5.02).
Project Benefits and Risks
50.       Up to now, ship-waiting time has not posed a problem at either proj-
ect port. However, without the project, La Goulette would only be able to
handle about 500,000 tons per year of the faster and more efficient roll-on/
roll-off traffic due to berth limitations. Leaving the growing cargo volume
to be handled as break-bulk would result in more ship-time for cargo-handling,
higher berth utilization levels, and longer ship-waiting lines.  At Sfax,
without the project, the shortage of general cargo berths and back-up storage
areas hinders efficient operations now and would not allow for either the
expected increase in cargo volume or shift to roll-on/rol1--Cf vessels.  Both
the expanded and improved ports' layouts and additional cs-n ' andling equip-
ment will improve productivity.  At La Goulette, apart from 'he land reclaimed
for port use, an additional 30 ha of adjacent land will be available fer com-
mercial or industrial uses.  Thus, project benef ts co->sist of:  (a) reduced
ship-service or turnaround time, (b) reduced ship-waiting time, (c) lower
cargo-handling costs, (d) avoidance of diversion costs, and (e) reclaimed
land. Total project-related benefits at La Goulette are projected to 4ncrease
from $8.9 million in 1984 to $32.3 million in 1909; at Sfax, from $0S8 mil-
lion to $13.7 million in 2005, when optimal capacity u-ilization would be
attained.
51.       The proposed project will improve the existing environment a. La
Goulette and Sfax by reducing traffic volumes passing through the citles'
centers and by reducing pollution in the port areas. Any notentially adverse
effect on fishing at La Goulette, occasioned by changes .i ;Ee hydraulic
patterns, will be avoided by providing a new connecting c-mannn1 to tbe south
lake.



- 15 -
52.       The economic rate of return (ERR) for the project at La Goulette
is estimated at 16.5 percent; at Sfax, at 16.5 percent, and, for the whole
project at 16.5 percent. Lower benefits are likely if traffic grows at less
than the projected rates, which are conservative. Sensitivity to 10 percent
higher project costs and 10 percent lower benefits would, together, reduce the
basic ERR to 14.4 percent for both ports.
53.       The project provides sufficient port facilities to cope with fore-
casted traffic through the year 2000. It has been designed so that the ports
will be able to handle foreseeable changes in shipping modes, such as from
roll-on/roll-off to container vessels. The project is free from any major
risk. Project benefits would have to be reduced 36 percent or costs increased
by 57 percent to yield a rate of return less than 12 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and OPNT, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Tunisia and the Bank, and the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement are being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors.
55.       Special features of the draft Loan Agreement are referred to in the
text and listed in Section III of Annex III. Special conditions of effective-
ness are discussed in para. 42 of this Report and set forth in Sections 7.01
and 7.02 of the draft Loan Agreement. These conditions specify that (i) OPNT
shall have obtained loans in an aggregate amount of not less than $20.3
million equivalent, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank; and (ii)
conditions of effectiveness of the loans shall have been fulfilled.
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I/
Cr. 238:    Population Project; US$4.8 million credit of April 5, 1971; Date
of Effectiveness: December 29, 1971; Closing Date: (Original)
June 30, 1976; (Current) December 31, 1979.
Cr. 238-1:  Population Project:  USS4.8 million Supplemental Credit of
October 13, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: March 21, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Progress in the physical implementation of the project has been slow
since November 1977, and new delays have occurred in equipping of project
facilities. The construction of the maternity hospitals in Sousse, Tunis and
Sfax is complete; the one in Bizerte will be completed in early 1980. Twenty-
five of the 29 maternal and child health/family planning centers have been com-
pleted; three will be completed early in 1980. The center at La Hafsia may
have to be deleted because the Government has been unable to obtain a suitable
site. The closing date will be extended to December 31, 1980.
Cr. 270:    Fisheries Project; US$2 million credit of September 24, 1971; Date
of Effectiveness: May 24, 1972; Closing Date: (Original) December
31, 1976; (Current) December 31, 1979.
All the 190 boats ordered have been constructed and the remainder
of the credit has been used to finance fishing gear. About 98 percent of the
credit funds are disbursed, the balance is committed, and the project will
close on schedule. The recovery of loans provided under the project to the
fishermen remains a matter of concern as the recovery rate has been low and
measures to improve the situation are only slowly succeeding. In May 1979,
agreement was reached with the Tunisian Government and BNT on a program to
bring the rates up to 80 percent by 1983.
Ln. 858:  Tourism Infrastructure Project; US$14 million loan  of September 28,
1972; Date of Effectiveness: June 29, 1973; Closing Date:
(Original) December 31, 1977; (Current) June 30, 1980.
The project has entered its final implementation stage. About 90-95
percent of project work is completed. The remainder is expected to be com-
pleted by the end of 1979/beginning of 1980. Total project cost, including
price escalation allowances, is still estimated at TD 31.5 million. Of the
total Bank financing of $24 million (including the fully disbursed credit
329-TUN of $10 million), 83 percent, or $20.0 million, has been disbursed.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them.  They should be read in this sense, and with the onderstandin£ig
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. 937:  Tunis District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project; US$11
Cr. 432: million loan and US$7 million credit, both of October 5, 1973; Date
of Effectiveness: September 24, 1974; Closing Date: (Original)
December 31, 1976; (Current) December 31, 1980.
The project has been completed except for construction of a bus
depot which is expected to be ready by June 1981. The project helped estab-
lish and strengthen the Tunis District, the first regional planning authority
in Tunisia. Work carried out by the District in the housing and transport
sectors has been instrumental in bringing about substantial changes in public
programs and policies, such as the adoption of measures to encourage the use
of buses and restrain the use of private cars. The project also assisted the
public transport company Societe Nationale des Transport (SNT) in renewing its
bus fleet and railway rolling stock, improving its organization and finance,
and upgrading the maintenance of its vehicles with the construction of a new
bus depot. In parallel, the city of Tunis adopted a new traffic plan with
a one-way street system, reserved bus lanes and restricted parking zones,
which contributed substantially to the improvement of bus services in Greater
Tunis. This, combined with an increase in the SNT bus fleet, and improved bus
maintenance has led to an increase in the use of SNT transport facilities
by about 27 percent above the level which would have been achieved in the
absence of the project.
Ln 989:   Third Water Supply Project; US$23 million loan of May 29, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: September 24, 1974; Closing Date: (Original)
June 30, 1979, (Current) June 30, 1980.
Ln. 1445: Fourth Water Supply Project; US$21 million loan of July 5, 1977;
Date of Effectiveness: January 30, 1978; Closing Date: December
31, 1982.
All the water production facilities programmed under the third
project are now in operation. As a result of this major increase in water
production for Greater Sfax, water supply services have substantially improved
in the city. The remaining loan amount will be disbursed for works in the
city's distribution network, which are expected to be completed by March 1980.
Good progress has also been achieved in the execution of the works included in
the fourth project. Procurement under this project is now expected to be
completed by mid-1980. Having increased the average water rates last year by
about 44 percent, the borrower's financial situation is expected to remain
good for the next two years.
Ln. 1029: Hotel Training Project; US$5.6 million loan of July 17, 1974; Date
of Effectiveness: November 4, 1975; Closing Date: (Original)
October 31, 1978; (Current) October 31, 1980.
The first hotel school at Hammamet is now open and the Sousse Nord
school is to open on January 1, 1980. The practice hotels attached to the
schools are both to open in early 1980. Requests for disbursements of the
remaining funds should be received by March 1980.

Ln. 1042: Gafsa Phosphate Project; US$23.3 million loan of October 1, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: March 14, 1975; Closing Date: (Original)
June 30, 1979; (Current) December 31, 1980.
Underground mining operations using the longwall method were in-
tended to supply phosphate rock to the Sehib beneficiation plant to be commis-
sioned by the end of 1979. Following the failure of the related underground
mining tests to reach satisfactory production levels, a partial reformulation
of the project is being carried out with the assistance of experienced consul-
tants whose services are financed by the unused portion of the Bank loan.
The services include: (i) 6 months' technical assistance in further testing
the longwall method, (ii) a feasibility study for open pit mining of an
alternative deposit from which the supply of rock to the washing plant could
be supplemented, and (iii) a review of Gafsa's five-year investment program
and the design and implementation of an improved cost control system. Mean-
while, the Company is experiencing financial difficulties due mainly to high
operating costs coupled with a large investment program which has not yet
succeeded in raising production levels or reducing costs, and the accompanying
heavy debt load.
Ln. 1068: Irrigation Rehabilitation Project; US$12.2 million loan of
December 31, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: September 18, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
Progress in construction and rehabilitation work in the Medjerda
sub-project area continues to be satisfactory, except for water supply to
farmers on which a common decision is expected by SONEDE and OMVVM, regard-
ing the latter's contribution to the investment costs. Enforcement of the
Agrarian Reform is progressing slowly, especially in the Medjerda area.
In Nebhana, the land consolidation program is developing well and farmers have
been settled on nearly 60 percent of the total area. OMVVM continues to
encourage large owners to improve cultivation of land and marked progress has
been reported in the distribution of medium- and short-term credit. Progress
in construction and rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage and road networks
continues to be satisfactory.
Ln. 1088: First Urban Sewerage Project; US$28 million loan of February 18,
1975; Date of Effectiveness: August 15, 1975; Closing Date:
(Original) December 15, 1979; (Current) December 15, 1981.
The project suffered considerable delay as a result of a number
of factors, some beyond the control of the project entity, ONAS. As a result,
considerable cost escalation has occurred, chiefly in local cost components.
However, bids for most of the works have now been received and construction is
under way on all major components. The project is expected to be completed in
mid-1982. One of its major benefits will be release of lard for development
around the Lake of Tunis, which until now has been impossible becaus:e o; the
pollution of the lake waters by untreated sewage. Consultants financed under
the project have produced a land-use plan for the area, and acquisition of the
land has begun by Government.

Ln. 1155: Third Education Project; US$8.9 million loan of August 13, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: March 1, 1976; Closing Date: (Original)
June 30, 1980; (Amended Project) March 31, 1983.
Implementation of this project was delayed following a change in
education priorities in Tunisia. The project was subsequently amended to
reduce the number of ITM centers to be equipped under the project, increase
the facilities to train teachers for ITM, and increase technical assistance.
The total cost of the amended project is estimated at $11.3 million and the
Bank loan has been decreased by $0.3 million to $8.6 million, representing
the full foreign exchange cost of the amended project. Implementation of
the project is proceeding satisfactorily; construction of extensions to one
teachers' college has commenced and the four other extensions are under
design. Equipment procurement for the teachers' colleges and the ITM centers
is proceeding satisfactorily.
Ln. 1188: Second Highways Project; US$28 million loan of January 26, 1976;
Date of Effectiveness: June 16, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1979.
Civil works of Lot 10 of the Tunis-Bizerte highway are complete and
in progress on Lot 9 on the same route. Works are behind schedule although
quality is generally satisfactory. Construction is in progress on Lot 6 in
Nabeul. Construction works of Lots 5, 7 and 11 have not started yet due to
lack of local financing and problems with expropriation. The Sfax bypass has
been deleted. The local financing issue has been discussed with the Ministries
of Public Works and Planning and the remaining items will be undertaken in
1980. The final report of the transport coordination study is behind schedule,
since the Government is still discussing some of the draft recommendations
with the consultants. The closing date will be extended shortly.
Ln. 1189: Sixth Development Finance Company Project; US$20 million loan of
January 26, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: June 7, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1980.
Disbursements are about 6 months ahead of the schedule projected in
the appraisal report. BDET has shown consistent improvements over the past
three years in the key areas of management effectiveness, arrears recovery,
financial practices and resource mobilization. The institution plays an
increasingly important role in financing industrial development, extending
about one-third of all term credit available to the industrial sector in
Tunisia.
Ln 1340:  Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$12 million loan of
November 23, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: July 19, 1977; Closing
Date: December 31, 1980.
About 33 percent of the loan amount is disbursed and about 55 per-
cent is committed. Subloans for small farmers are being made at an accelerated
pace. Under this small farmer category, lending to production cooperatives
which meet the revenue criteria applied to small farmers will be taken up very



- 26 -                        ANNEX II
Page 6 of 7
soon. Prospects are good for the commitment of funds for service cooperatives
whose members are small and medium size farmers. Commitments of funds to
commercial farmers and agro-industries are progressing satisfactorily but
subloan applications of farmer associations for the establishment of date palm
plantations have not yet been processed.
Ln. 1355: Second Power Project; US$14.5 million loan of January 12, 1977;
Date of Effectiveness: May 4, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The Project has been completed and the seven gas-turbines are in
industrial operation. The consultants for the energy pricing study have been
selected. It is expected that the study will be ready by the end of 1980.
Ln. 1431: Sidi Salem Multi-purpose Project; US$42 million loan of July 5, 1977;
Date of Effectiveness: July 31, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
For the project as a whole, progress in implementation continues to
be satisfactory. Implementation of the diversion scheme of the Medjerda river
during construction of the Sidi Salem dam was completed on schedule, as was
the cofferdam. Progress in implementation of the railroad substructure is
slightly behind schedule. The land reform and consolidation program is
underway.
Ln. 1504/1505: Industrial Finance Project consisting of Seventh Loan to
Banque de Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET) and a Pilot
project for assistance to SSI; Loans of $30.0 milflion to -BDET and
of $5.0 million to the Government, of January 25, 1978; Date of
Effectiveness: October 13, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The start up of the project suffered from difficulties in finalizing
legal arrangements concerning the SSI Pilot Project component, which delayed
effectiveness by about six months. Nevertheless, commitments under the loan
to BDET have built up rapidly after effectiveness and disbursements are
in line with appraisal estimates. Under the project, BDET is giving priority
in its financing to projects which are located in the least developed regions,
sponsored by new entrepreneurs, characterized by high labor intensity or
export-orientation. Although with some delay, commitments have also begun
under the SSI pilot project showing that the commercial banks' initial reluc-
tance to utilize Bank funds for SSI financing is being overcome. Considerable
progress has been made by the Tunisian authorities toward setting up a network
of Tunisian and foreign technical assistance experts, specifically catering to
the needs of SSI, as agreed under the project.
Ln. 1601: Rural Roads Projects; US$32.0 million loan of July 24, 1978;
Date of Effectiveness: April 30, 1978; Closing Date: June 30,
1984.
The loan's effectiveness was delayed because of delayed finalizing
of the subsidiary loan agreement between Government and BNT. This has,
however, not held up project implementation. Preparation of project works in

the first three of the provinces to be covered under the project is pro-
gressing satisfactorily, and tenders have been called for road works in a
fourth province (Nabeul).
Ln. 1675: Second Urban Sewerage Project; US$26.5 million loan of April 13,
1979; Date of Effectiveness:  August 31, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1984.
Consultants have been contracted and detailed design is progressing
as planned.
Ln. 1702: Fifth Water Supply Project; US$25.0 million loan of May 31, 1979;
Date of Effectiveness: October 19, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982.
The physical execution of the project is progressing well and
according to schedule. SONEDE has already prepared 9 sub-projects for a
total investment cost of US$5.3 million.
Ln. 1705: Second Urban Development Project; US$19.0 million loan of May 31,
1979; Date of Effectiveness: Not yet effective; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
Staffing requirements and preparation of tender documents is pro-
gressing satisfactorily.  Effectiveness is pending receipt of land acquisi-
tion rights in three areas.
Ln. 1746: Second Fisheries Project; US$28.5 million loan of July 20, 1979;
Date of Effectiveness: Not yet effective; Closing Date: June 30,
1985.
Loan effectiveness is pending signature of the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement on behalf of the Borrower and BNT. Preparation of tender documents
for port infrastructure and boat engines has begun.
