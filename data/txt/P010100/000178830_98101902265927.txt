INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PAKISTAN INDUSTRIAL CREDIT AND INVESTMENT
CORPORATION LIMITED WITH THE GUARANTEE OF PAKISTAN
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation Limited (PICIC)
with the Guarantee of Pakistan for the equivalent of US$25 million to help
finance PICIC's operations through September 1978. The loan would bear in-
terest at 8.9% per annum and would be repayable according to a composite
schedule reflecting the amortization terms of the sub-projects financed,
which would not exceed 15 years. Up to $0.2 million of the loan would finance
the foreign exchange cost of a study of Pakistan's textile industry.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report "Recent Trends and Development
Propects" (1023-PAK, dated March 1, 1976) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on March 10, 1976. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        The current economic situation of Pakistan represents a reversal
of the previous record of rapid growth of output and exports of the 1960's.
Starting with the war with India and the separation of Bangladesh, there
followed a series of poor monsoons and floods, and consequently poor harvests.
Added to this were the twin effects of deteriorating terms of trade and world
recession. The magnitude of the problem was intensified by the loss of momen-
tum of the "green revolution" which had been one of the mainstays of the
favorable economic period of the late 1960's. Similarly, industrial develop-
ment was discouraged by changed attitudes toward the private sector as re-
flected in the nationalization of a large part of private industry in 1972.
4.        After a decline in agricultural production in FY75, an increase of
about 4%-5% is estimated in FY76. Good rains in the summer of 1975 helped
produce large harvests of rice, maize, wheat and sugarcane, but cotton pro-
duction suffered from heavy insect infestation. Serious floods in August,
1976 are likely to reduce the output of some of the major crops in the cur-
rent year. The slow growth of the past few years is in marked contrast to the
record of the 1960's, which benefitted from the introduction of high yielding
varieties (HYV's) and rapid expansion of tubewell irrigation. Over the next
few years some increase in agricultural production can be expected as a result
of the additional water from the Tarbela Dam and further groundwater develop-
ment, increased use of fertilizer, improved seeds and pesticides and improved
water use and watercourse maintenance. However, exploitation of this poten-
tial will require that price policies are such that farmers have adequate
incentives, that inputs are available in adequate quantities and in timely
fashion, and that agricultural agencies are strengthened with respect to
their finances, their personnel and their organization.



- 2 -
5.        After experiencing a revival in 1973, exports declined in FY74 due
to poor agricultural harvests and have remained depressed because of the inter-
national recession. In addition, import prices increased 36% in FY74 and 27%
in FY75, although in FY74, the rise in import prices was offset by increases
of major export prices, particularly cotton and rice. In FY75, however, the
full effect of the petroleum price increase, combined with falling export
prices for most products, produced an 18% decline in the terms of trade. A
further deterioration of 12% is estimated to have taken place in FY76. While
exports have stagnated, imports have increased at over 20% per year, partly
reflecting the higher investment program of the Government. As a consequence,
the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments increased from
$130 million in FY73, an exceptionally good year, to $1,200 million in FY75
and FY76. It is expected to remain at the level of about $1.2 billion for
FY76 and FY77. These large deficits have been financed by expanded borrowings
from foreign sources, particularly the OPEC countries and the IMF. Domestic
resource mobilization, on the other hand, has declined markedly, with the
overall savings rate falling from about 13% of GDP in 1973 to 5.6% in 1976,
and public savings turning negative. Part of the decline in private savings
can be traced to the lag of interest rates behind the rate of inflation.
6.        The Government has recognized that the situation of the past few
years is not a satisfactory basis for long term growth. In recent months,
a number of steps have been taken to improve public sector resource mobi-
lization, including substantially higher prices of electric power, cement,
petroleum products, railway and air fares, and import tariffs. Steps have
also been taken to simplify the income tax and improve its enforcement.
Subsidies of various types which amounted to Rs 3 billion in FY75, or about
15% of current government expenditures, are estimated to have been reduced
to Rs 1.5 billion in FY76. There has been a sharp decline in the rate of
inflation since April 1975; during FY76, the inflation rate was about 11%.
7.        For the longer term, the Government has drafted a new Plan for
1976-81 which calls for substantially higher levels of output, exports and
domestic savings. Investment levels will be kept at about 18% of GDP. With
an expected decline in foreign capital available from OPEC sources, however,
this target can be reached only by sharply increasing the rate of domestic
savings to 16% of GDP by 1981. Large investments are contemplated in steel,
power, fertilizers and petro-chemicals aimed at reducing imports and encourag-
ing a greater reliance on domestic raw materials. A substantial increase in
exports will depend largely on a rapid growth of agricultural output, partic-
ularly rice and cotton. The agricultural strategy focuses largely on in-
creased use of fertilizer and expanded irrigation useage, both from surface
and groundwater sources.
8.         Even if this long run strategy is successful, the balance of pay-
ments and debt management position will be difficult for the next few years.
By the end of FY76, the total debt outstanding, including undisbursed amounts,
was about $7 billion. The ratio of debt payments to export earnings and
worker's remittances was only about 15%, a figure which reflects $650 million
of debt relief which is being given by the Consortium countries for the years



- 3 -
1975-78. The debt service ratio can be expected to rise to 20% or more after
1978 since the end of the debt relief arrangement coincides with a sharp
increase in repayments owed to the OPEC countries and the IMF. It is there-
fore important that borrowing on conventional terms should be held to the
minimum.   For this reason the major part of Bank Group operations in Pakistan
consists of IDA credits. Including undisbursed amounts, Pakistan's debt to
the Bank and IDA now represents about 16% of its external public indebtedness;
by 1980 this ratio is likely to fall to about 13%. The share of the Bank
Group in total debt service (after taking account of the debt relief which
Pakistan will receive from other creditors) is now about 23%, but is expected
to decrease to about 9% in 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
9.        The cumulative total of Bank/IDA commitments to Pakistan (exclusive
of loans and credits or portions thereof which were disbursed in the former
East Pakistan) now amounts to approximately US$1.3 billion. During its long
association with Pakistan, the Bank Group has been involved in almost all
sectors of the economy. Through FY76, 43% of total commitments were for
public services, 24% for agriculture, 32% for industry, of which 12% was for
industrial imports, and 1% for education. Lending for public services has
amounted to more than $600 million and has included loans and credits for
railways, electric power, gas pipelines, Karachi Port, highways, telecommunic-
ations and water supplies. A large part of past lending for agriculture was
for Indus Basin projects. The lending for industry has been mainly through the
Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC). For most proj-
ects for which loans and credits are being disbursed, construction is now going
ahead satisfactorily. The principal problems being encountered are the rates
charged by some of the public services that have not kept pace with inflation
and, hence, some utilities are not earning the return which they need. Annex
II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of July 31,
1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
10.       Lending operations in Pakistan have three main objectives.     One of
these is to support the directly productive sectors of the economy, and, in
particular, to increase production of import substitutes such as foodgrains,
edible oils, fertilizer and engineering and capital goods and to sustain
export growth in cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other
industrial and agricultural products. The main part of Bank Group assistance
for industry will continue to be through financial intermediaries, such as
PICIC, which finances the medium and large-scale private sector and will
thus contribute to exports and industrial growth, the Industrial Development
Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) for the small and medium scale industrial sector,
with possible participation by commercial banks, and the National Development
Finance Corporation (NDFC) for industries in the public sector. The most
important part of future lending for agriculture is expected to be for the
Government's new program to increase productivity in the Indus Basin by con-
trolling salinity and improving the utilization of surface irrigation and
groundwater. The Bank is the Executing Agency for a UNDP technical assist-
ance grant for improving agriculture and water planning in the Indus Basin.



-4-
11.       Another objective is to support the necessary expansion and to
improve the institutions which' are responsible for the principal public
services which have benefitted from Bank Group lending in the past, namely,
the Telegraph and Telephone Department, Karachi Port, Water and Power
Development Authority, Pakistan Railways, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Company
and the Lahore Water and Sanitation Agency. In most of these, institutional
improvements are being made with technical assistance financed by the Bank
Group.
l?.       A third objective is to expand lending operations in other fields,
:artLcularly those which reflect the Government's efforts to bring economic
' velopment to the poorest strata of the population.    This shift, which
unoIes in.reased lending for agriculture and rural development, will involve
-gnificant lending for projects complementary to the Indus/Tarbela works.
urther in support of this objective, and at the Government's request, Bank
missions have been working with municipal authorities on the plans for the
urban development of Karachi, whose population now exceeds 4 million.     A
-karachi master plan was completed in 1974 with the assistance of consultants
financed by UNDP, and urban projects are being developed within the framework
of this plan. In view of the preparatory work which has already been done on
urbanization problems of Karachi, there are good prospects for worthwhile
participation by the Bank Group in this area, beginning with a project in the
Lvari section of the city. The Government has also asked the Bank to study
Lrbanization problems in Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city. Planning in
Lahore Ls at a much earlier stage than i Karachi and the immediate need is
for techinical assistance. A mission to examine problems of urbanization and
regional development of smaller cities on a country-wide basis visited Paki-
stan in March 1975.
13.       Among the projects now being prepared for your consideration are
the Lyari Urban Improvement Project, referred to in the previous paragraph,
a livestock projecL and a third education project. All of these have already
been appraised. Preparatory work is also proceeding on a further irrigation
and drainage project, a fertilizer project and projects involving agri-
cultural extension and rural development.
14.       IFC has made investments in nine Pakistani enterprises for a total
of US$30.2 million, of which US$22.9 million was by way of loans and US$7.3
million by equity participations (these are shown in Annex II). About US$12
million remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three in
the field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one each in steel,
cement and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.
PART III - INDUSTRY IN PAKISTAN
15.       In terms of its contribution to the gross domestic product, manu-
facturing is the second largest sector of the Pakistan economy, contributing
about 15% to GDP and 50% to 60% to the country's total exports.     About 80% of



industrial output is estimated to originate from medium and large scale in-
dustry. Since 1973, the major change in the structure of the industrial
sector has been the expansion of the public sector, from about 10% to about
30% of industrial assets. In November 1973, the Government officially took
over ownership of the 31 private companies in 10 basic industrial categories
that it had managed since January 1972. In addition, the vegetable ghee
industry was nationalized in September 1973, the shipping industry and com-
mercial banks in January 1974, and cotton ginning and rice and wheat flour
milling in July, 1976. During FY73-75, about 60% of total industrial invest-
ment was made by the private sector, compared with about 90% in the 1960's.
Excluding one large public project (the Karachi Steel Mill), private indus-
trial investment over the next five years is expected to be around 50% of
the total.
16.       After growing by 9.7% in FY1973, industry grew by 6.5% in FY74,
and experienced a 0.6% decline in production during FY75. Industrial growth
is estimated at 1%-2% in FY76. The slow industrial growth was caused by the
slow growth of agricultural production, as raw materials were not sufficiently
available and became more costly. The international recession also slowed
industrial activity. The textile industry, which employs over 35% of the
industrial labor force and usually accounts for about 30% of industrial value
added, and over 50% of manufactured exports, was particularly affected.
17.       A draft of the Fifth Five Year Plan FY77-81, indicates that the
Government's industrial policy is likely to emphasize: (i) basic industries
to achieve self-sufficiency in the not too distant future; (ii) industries
using local raw materials and machinery; (iii) export-oriented and import
substitution industries to improve the balance of payments; and (iv) expan-
sion of the supply of agricultural raw materials for agro-industries. The
government also plans to continue encouraging small industries by improved
credit facilities, marketing, and quality control services. Private industry,
which will be assisted by the proposed loan, would continue to develop mainly
export-oriented industries and those processing indigenous raw materials.
The Government expects some 36% of private sector investment to be in textiles,
16% in other agro-industries, 18% in fertilizers, 5% in chemicals and 5% in
engineering. This sub-sectoral allocation is roughly in line with PICIC's
commitment program over the next two years. The public sector would con-
centrate largely on import substitution (basic industries and capital goods
sector).
18.       The revival in private investment in 1973 was slowed by the 1974
nationalization of commercial banks. Some improvement took place during
FY75 as a result of the promulgation of a set of guidelines for compensation
to be paid for nationalized industries. However, the improvement was limited
as there was still some uncertainty among private industrialists over the
extent of Government support for their activities. The Government emphasized
that the decision to take over cotton ginning and rice and flour milling
enterprises in July, 1976 did not represent a reversal of its desire for an
active private sector, but reflected its concern with equity in the agricul-
tural sector. Nevertheless this can hardly fail to have a deterrent effect
on private investment. GOP is considering a clarification of the borderline



- 6 -
areas where both the private and public sector can operate (such as engineer-
ing and chemicals) in order to induce the the private sector to invest more
in these areas. Further, GOP is also considering the possibility of joint
ventures between the private and public sectors. However, the role of the
private sector in industrial development is likely to continue to be mainly
for export-oriented industries and those processing indigenous raw materials,
an important role that deserves the fullest support, particularly because the
low level of private investment is affecting prospects for industrial growth.
PICIC's foreign currency commitments for 1976-78 have been cautiously pro-
jected at about the same level as actual results for the last two years; the
projection is based on the applications in PICIC's pipeline.
Industrial Finance
19.       The principal sources of long-term finance for industry are PICIC,
the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) and the National Development
Finance Corporation (NDFC) (para. 10). Securities and capital market activi-
ties are undertaken mainly by the Investment Corporation of Pakistan (ICP), a
Government-owned institution established in 1966 and the National Investment
Trust (NIT), an open-end mutual fund owned by 12 institutional shareholders,
including PICIC and IDBP.
20.       Prior to 1974 there were 22 scheduled commercial banks in Pakistan
(of which 8 were foreign). The Pakistani banks were nationalized in January
1974, and were subsequently consolidated into five. A six-member Banking
Council, which reports to the Government, was established to monitor their
activities, although the distribution of credit is still guided by a National
Credit Consultative Council sponsored by the State Bank of Pakistan (the
Central Bank). Commercial banks are the main source of finance for small
industries.
21.       Apart from commercial banks and IDBP, the Provincial Small Indust-
ries Corporations Board, the People's Finance Corporation, and the Equity
Participation Fund (EPF), which is owned by the Government and administered
by IDBP, also provide finance for small industries.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's tenth loan to PICIC and
would bring the total amount of lending by the Bank to PICIC to $233 million
(net of cancellations but including funds used in Bangladesh). PICIC was
established in 1957 with active World Bank Group assistance. By 1970, it
had become a strong and financially sound development institution and had
contributed significantly to Pakistan's industrial development. However,
over the last five years, PICIC has been through a period of quite except-
ional difficulty. Initially the problems resulted from the 1972 devaluation
which more than doubled the debt service burden of PICIC's foreign exchange
borrowers and from the economic distortions consequent upon the separation



- 7 -
of Bangladesh. Further, PICIC had retained the liabilities for projects fi-
nanced in the former East Pakistan, while it had lost control of the related
assets. This was the main reason why IBRD's ninth and latest loan to PICIC
(961-PAK) was made (in 1973) to the Government of Pakistan and administered
by PICIC, rather than directly to PICIG which was not then considered credit-
worthy. PICIC was in the process of coping with these problems when, in 1974,
the impact of the world recession seriously affected its activities, particu-
larly loan collections. There has been some recent improvement in PICIC's
financial position although serious problems remain, particularly the large
volume of arrears in its portfolio. These problems, although difficult, are
under control and given reasonable assistance and cooperation from the Govern-
ment, should be overcome. The measures PICIC has taken and is taking to deal
with these problems, are described below. They have been discussed at length
with IBRD and, in effect, constitute the justification for proceeding with the
proposed loan. The present project was appraised in January/February 1976. A
report entitled "Appraisal of the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation Limited" No. 1145a-PAK, is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. Negotiations were held in Washington in August 1976.
The Pakistan delegation was led by Mr. N.M. Uquaili, Chairman of PICIC. A
loan and project summary is attached as Annex III.
23.       The proposed loan of US$25.0 million would account for about 39%
of PICIC's foreign currency commitments between September 1976 and September
1978 and is expected to finance some 20 to 30 projects. The objectives of
the proposed loan would be: (a) to help finance economically viable private
industrial projects; and (b) to continue efforts to reestablish PICIC's past
institutional and financial strength as a promoter of industry and a mobilizer
of resources. Up to US$0.2 million would be allocated by PICIC to the Govern-
ment to finance the foreign exchange cost of a study of the textile industry;
the objective of the study would be to determine the strategy to develop
Pakistan's textile industry in order to meet national requirements and improve
export performance. Agreement by the Bank and the Government on the terms of
reference and arrangements for the study would be a condition of effectiveness
(Section 6.01(b) of the draft Loan Agreement). About US$24.8 million would be
onlent by PICIC to meet the foreign cost of capital goods and services of
sub-projects sponsored by private enterprises. PICIC would onlend at no less
than 11.0% for periods not exceeding 15 years and with the sub-borrowers
bearing the exchange risk. The loan would be repaid according to a composite
amortization schedule which would reflect the repayment terms of the sub-loans
and which would not exceed 18 years including three years of grace. The free
limit would be (i) $2.5 million for the amount of any single loan to a project;
or (ii) $4 million for the amount of any loan together with outstanding
commitments for the same project. An estimated 40% by amount and 25% by
number of the project financed by the proposed loan would be reviewed for
prior approval.
Role, Ownership and Resources
24.        PICIC's role is to promote and assist private industrial enter-
prises. It is, as intended, the main source of long-term finance for med-
ium and large-scale private industry.    As a result of nationaliza ions, tie
Government now controls some 45% of PICIC's share capital ot Rs hh.4 ml ton.



- 8 -
Foreign private institutions hold 33% of the shares, Pakistani private in-
vestors 18% and IFC nearly 4%.
25.       At current exchange rates, foreign currency loans account for about
90% of PICIC's outstanding portfolio, and rupee loans and investments for
about 10%. Of PICIC's cumulative foreign currency borrowings, past Bank loans
account for 43%, untied loans (ADB and KfW) for 17%, other bilateral sources
for 23% and supplier credits for 17%. About 1% of PICIC's foreign resources
comes from share capital paid in foreign currency. Of the rupee resources,
share capital and reserves account for 35%, State Bank lines of credit for
38%, a USAID loan for 4%, Government loans for 3% and PICIC's own debentures
for 20%. At present the prospects for obtaining further funds in the domestic
market are limited as private savings are low and savers are reluctant to take
up longer term obligations. PICIC will therefore have to depend on the Govern-
ment for local currency funds. During January 1976 - September 1978, PICIC's
foreign currency commitments are expected to be $85 million. Its uncommitted
foreign currency resources were $18 million (mostly tied funds) as of December
1975, and PICIC has borrowed in 1976 US$25 million from the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) and should obtain about US$15 million from bilateral sources. An
IBRD Loan of US$25 million would meet the balance of the estimated requirements
until September 1978.
Management and Staff
26.       PICIC's Board of Directors is competent and experienced.     The
Managing Directorship has been vacant since November 1975 when Mr. S. Osman
Ali became Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan. Mr. N. M. Uquaili, an
ex-Managing Director of PICIC and an ex-Finance Minister, was appointed
Chairman of the Board in December 1975. He has assumed responsibility for
PICIC's day to day operations while a new Managing Director is being sought;
this appointment will be made in consultation with IBRD (Section 3.05(c) of
the draft Loan Agreement). Mr. Uquaili has brought about improvements in the
organization, in its procedures and standards, and has also been effective in
improving its financial condition.
27.       PICIC's staff is generally of high quality, although it has suffered
over the past two years from the loss of about 20 professionals, including
several senior officers, who left for better opportunities locally and over-
seas. PICIC is considering measures to continue to attract and to retain
capable staff.
Operating Policies and Procedures
28.       PICIC continues to assist medium and large-scale private industries.
At the Bank's suggestion, PICIC has prepared a statement outlining its de-
velopment strategy and financing priorities over the next few years. Approval
by PICIC's Board of a strategy statement acceptable to the Bank would be a
condition of effectiveness (Section 6.01(b) of the draft Loan Agreement). In
line with Government priorities, PICIC plans to encourage projects based on
domestic raw materials and local equipment, export oriented projects, and
projects that will help raise agricultural productivity. PICIC will also give
preference to projects for balancing, modernization and replacement of existing



-9-
units and their expansion in appropriate cases so as to improve capacity
utilization and quality of product for export.
29.       While recent developments have adversely affected PICIC's operations,
its standards of project appraisal and follow-up continue to be satisfactory.
Its economic analysis of projects has improved. Follow-up work has been re-
organized, and PICIC intends to oversee projects more closely and to increase
the number of supervision visits. Procurement and disbursement procedures
remain adequate. PICIC generally requires that procurement under its foreign
currency loans be based on at least three quotations from foreign suppliers.
To ensure that the best prices are obtained, PICIC plans to require interna-
tional competitive bidding for the larger projects.
30.       In line with rising interest rates in Pakistan, PICIC's local cur-
rency lending rates have gone up to 13% and 12.5% for projects located in
developed and less developed areas respectively. Under a refinance facility
provided by the State Bank of Pakistan, PICIC also makes loans for purchasing
locally fabricated machinery at 9.5% p.a. The rates for foreign currency
loans on which the borrower carries the exchange risk have also been increased
to 10.5 - 11.0%. This implies real rates of interest to PICIC's borrowers of
between 2 and 5 percent assuming a rate of inflation in the long-term, of
approximately 8%.
Past Operations
31.       PICIC has not yet regained the level of operations of 1970 when
approvals exceeded Rs 500 million (at the current exchange rate). Gross loan
approvals were Rs 41 million in 1972, Rs 494 million in 1973, Rs 489 million
in 1974 and Rs 315 million in 1975. Commitments and disbursements lagged
behind approvals due mainly to the unfavorable investment climate although
they have improved recently. Underwriting and equity operations were only Rs
7.7 million during 1973-1975. PICIC's disbursements in the period 1973-75
accounted for about 21% of private investment in the large and medium scale
industrial sector, compared with about 17% previously.
32.       PICIC's outstanding portfolio is heavily concentrated in textiles
(45%) and sugar (17%). Cotton and other textiles accounted for 69% of ap-
provals during 1973 but only 36% during 1974 and 1975. The decreased share
of textiles reflected increases in lending for hotels, ceramics, glass, and
leather and rubber projects promoted by PICIC in an effort to diversify its
portfolio. The average size of loans has been about $1.3 million. There
has been some improvement in the geographical diversification of lending,
with more activity in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), and PICIC has
further diversified its clientele, and assisted newcomers to industry. The
projects recently financed should make a useful contribution to the economy
(para 39). While PICIC's past promotional efforts are creditable, PICIC in-
tends to put greater effort on promoting projects which would help diversify
its portfolio from textiles and sugar, including joint venture projects in
which foreign firms provide management and technical expertise. PICIC has
also contributed a number of industrial studies over the last two years.

Financial Results
33.       Overall, there has been an improvement in PICIC's financial con-
dition since the last IBRD loan was made.    The uncertainty regarding PICIC's
foreign currency liabilities relating to Bangladesh has been removed; the
Government has agreed, as long as necessary, to continue servicing on behalf
of PICIC those liabilities which are still outstanding. Also, the Govern-
ment will not require PICIC to repay the amounts advanced in its behalf in-
less PICIC recovers its assets in Bangladesh, and if so, only to the extent
of such a recovery. Further, PICIC's local currency assets in Bangladesh, for
which the Government had disclaimed any responsibility previously, are now
deemed to have been financed from Government loans which PICIC will not be
required to repay unless it recovers its assets in Bangladesh and if so only
to the extent of such a recovery. In effect, PICIC will not have to bear any
loss for the loans and investments it made in what is now Bangladesh.
34.       At present, PICIC's main problem is the extent of arrears on its
loans. Principal and interest in arrears for more than 3 months totalled
Rs 457 million on December 1975, compared with Rs 308 million in 1973, and
Rs 4 million in 1969. The total principal outstanding on these loans was
about Rs 1 billion or 55% of the outstanding loan portfolio in 1975, com-
pared with 60% in 1973, and 2% in 1969. Less than 50% of PICIC's equity
investment portfolio was paying dividends. PICIC's arrears problem started
after the 1971 war and the economic disruption following the separation of
Bangladesh, and was further aggravated by the rupee devaluation of May 1972
(which more than doubled the debt service burden of PICIC's foreign exchange
borrowers). The gap between collections and amounts falling due began to
narrow during 1973 and early 1974 as firms adjusted to changed circumstances.
With the impact of the oil crisis the situation deteriorated again. The dif-
ficulties experienced by the textile industry became acute owing to the
depressed demand in foreign markets. Commercial banks did not honor their
guarantees to PICIC and some nationalized enterprises fell into arrears. In
addition there were a number of defaults, particularly after the national-
ization of commercial banks in 1974, by companies which apparently had the
capability to pay.
35.       During the first seven months of 1976, PICIC again succeeded in
narrowing the gap between collections and amounts falling due. Moreover, the
Government has taken certain measures which will help reduce PICIC's arrears
problem. It has arranged for the payment of amounts due to PICIC on guarantees
by commercial banks. It has also helped to arrange the settlement of overdues
by nationalized companies and has undertaken to ensure payments of any future
arrears by public enterprises. In addition, the Government has indicated to
IBRD that PICIC will be able to pursue its claims under a proposed new law
intended to speed up court action in cases of default. PICIC also plans to
introduce a number of measures, including improved follow-up work, to reduce
the arrears and eliminate willful defaults. It has prepared, on a project by
project basis, a study of the rescheduling needs of its clients and a plan of
action which provides specific targets for future collections. However, the
improvement in collections will continue to be gradual and it is unlikely that
the gap between collections and amounts falling due will be eliminated before
1978.



- 11 -
36.       An analysis of PICIC's portfolio indicates that the long run pros-
pects for collections are good, although the large volume of overdues creates
some uncertainty. After a review by its auditors, PICIC has increased the
provisions for possible portfolio losses and the auditors are satisfied that
the level of provisions is now adequate. PICIC's future performance will be
greatly influenced by the speed with which industrial expansion proceeds and
in particular on developments in the textile industry, which will be subject of
a study partly financed by the proposed loan.
37.       The accumulation of arrears had a serious effect on PICIC's liquidity.
As a result, PICIC has had to borrow from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to
service its debt. Borrowings from SBP totalled Rs 129 million as of December
31, 1975. Rs 125 million of this amount fell due during 1976 but has been
rescheduled. Additional borrowings of about Rs 150 million will be needed to
cover expected collection short-falls through 1980. Thereafter, collections
should be sufficient to meet all debt service. The SBP has rescheduled its
existing credits to PICIC and will make available any additional funds as
needed.
38.       In 1975 PICIC's net profits after tax were Rs 29.4 million, com-
pared with Rs 38.0 million in 1974 and Rs 36.1 million in 1973. The profits
were lower in 1975 because PICIC did not accrue income on a number of relative-
ly large problem accounts. However, after tax profits as a percentage of av-
erage total assets should remain adequate at 1.3% compared with 1.7% in 1974.
PICIC's capital structure has improved as a result of a capital increase and
of the removal of the Bangladesh assets problem; its long-term debt/ equity
ratio should remain at about 7:1 over the next 5 years. Its debt/equity
ratio including subordinated loans as equity should remain at about 6.6:1 or
below the 7:1 contractual limit, which is the same as in the previous two
loans. However, the Government has indicated that for as long as PICIC is not
in a position to raise share capital, it will provide subordinated loans if
needed to keep PICIC's contractual debt/equity ratio below 7:1.
Development Impact
39.        PICIC is the principal institution providing long-term finance to
private industry and, particularly because of its export orientation, can
play a significant role in assisting industry to meet the objectives of the
new draft Five Year Plan. PICIC's disbursements over the last three years,
accounted for about 20% of private investment in the large and medium scale
industrial sector. From January 1973 to September 30, 1975 PICIC approved
loans and acquired shares and debentures amounting to Rs 1.1 billion which
accounted for 59% of the total fixed investment in the projects concerned.
PICIC has estimated the net annual foreign exchange earnings/savings of these
projects will be about $80 million and the contribution to net value added
will be about Rs 630 million. The estimated additional direct employment
generated by these projects is about 15,500. The average cost of fixed
investment per job created is therefore $12,000. Out of the 64 projects
financed between July 1973 and September 1975, ex-ante financial rates of
return ranged from 11% to 33% (average 17%). For 41 of these, the economic
return was also calculated and ranged from 10% to 50% (average 22%). PICIC

has also continued to make qualitative contributions to industrial develop-
ment, such as its assistance in project preparation (particularly for new-
comers), its industrial studies and other promotional activities and its
contribution to industrial policy formulation.
Project Risks
40.       PICIC is now emerging from an unusually difficult period in its
history during which it has had to cope with serious financial problems,
including those arising from the separation of Bangladesh and the large accum-
ulation of arrears. However, measures have been taken to overcome these prob-
lems; some have already been solved, such as the Bangladesh assets problem,
while others, such as the arrears, will take some time before a wholly
satisfactory situation is reached. The prospects that PICIC's position will
improve are now good but much will depend on economic circumstances, both
in the world economy and within Pakistan and particularly in the Government's
policy towards the private sector.
41.       For the past several years the private sector in Pakistan has suf-
fered a number of setbacks, most recently with the nationalisations of July,
1976. This inevitably creates some uncertainty regarding PICIC's future role
including the demand for its loans. On the other hand, the Government's stated
policy is that the private sector should play an important role in industrial
development. Moreover, the private sector in Pakistan has a proven entrepre-
neurial capability and the proposed loan would ensure that, at a time when
economic conditions in Pakistan and in the world economy are improving,
private investment is not hampered by a shortage of foreign exchange.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Pakistan
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation Limited, the draft Guarantee
Agreement between Pakistan and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement,
and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.
43.       Approval and issue by PICIC's Board of a strategy statement accept-
able to the Bank pertaining to PICIC's planned operations over the next two
years, and agreement by the Government and the Bank on the terms of reference
and arrangements for the proposed study of the textile sector would be con-
ditions of effectiveness (Section 6.01 of the draft Loan Agreement). Other-
wise, the draft legal documents conform to the normal pattern for loans to
development finance companies.
44.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 548         Tarbela Dam:  US$25.0 Million Loan of July 10, 1968;
Effective Date: August 2, 1968; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and disbursements
began in March 1975. On September 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted
through tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage -- the construction
of the closure section of the dam -- to be undertaken. By June 30, 1974,
the main embankment had been completed to full height, and the first
impoundment began on schedule in July 1974. In early August, difficulties
were encountered in the operation of the tunnel gates and damage to one
of the tunnels necessitated the emptying of the reservoir, in the course
of which further damage was incurred. A program of remedial works is
nearing completion. Agreement was reached with the parties to the Indus
Basin and Tarbela Development Fund Agreements whereby special contributions
were made by a number of the parties and IDA (Credit 581-PAK) to help meet
the costs of the repairs and additional remedial works. Meanwhile, the
reservoir was filled to within 20 ft. of the maximum pool level in the sum-
mer of 1975 and irrigation releases have been made through the Service and
Auxiliary Spillways. In the course of tests to the stilling basins further
damage was incurred in April 1976. Investigations of the causes of the dam-
age and a program of remedial measures are being prepared. Plans for begin-
ning generation of power in December 1976 and filling the reservoir to maxi-
mum operating level during the summer of 1976 have not been affected by this
latest damage.
Loan No. 590         Development Finance Company - PICIC:    US$40.0 Million
Loan of March 21, 1969; Effective Date: May 21, 1969;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
This Loan has been fully committed. The original Closing Date
of March 31, 1974 was postponed first to September 30, 1975 and then to
September 30, 1976, the current date, to enable disbursements to be made
for the last sub-project. Less than $1 million remains to be disbursed.
Loan No. 621         Railways:   US$14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969; Effect-
ive Date: August 28, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
About 80% of the Loan has been committed, and it is anticipated
that the project will be virtually complete by June 1977. To provide for
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

reimbursement of commissioning expenses during the following year, however,
the Closing Date, formerly December 31, 1975, has been extended to June 30,
1978. The main outstanding item is construction of the first stage of a
new marshalling yard at Pipri, near Karachi. The location of this yard
was changed twice following protracted investigations and negotiations bet-
ween various agencies and planning authorities. Consultants have modified
the design of the yard for the new location, selected to reconcile urban
planning and railway marshalling objectives, and construction is underway.
While progress on improvements to the main line, which will permit removal
of speed restrictions has been rather slow, a new timetable for passenger
and goods trains was introduced in November 1975. This should help to
improve utilization of motive power and rolling stock, especially freight
wagons, eventually producing large cost savings.
Credit No. 177       Development Finance Company - IDBP:    US$20.0 Million
Credit of February 11, 1970; Effective Date: June 25,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Amendments to the Credit Documents became effective on April 25,
1974. These enabled IDBP to resume utilizing IDA funds to finance Pakistan
industry without bearing the financial risk, pending settlement of its lia-
bilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh. The original
Closing Date of December 31, 1974 was then postponed to December 31, 1977.
The Credit has been fully allocated by IDA and only $1.1 million remained
undisbursed as of August 13, 1976. The Bangladesh liabilities issue is no
longer a problem. The major problem remaining is the large arrears in IDBP's
portfolio and its consequent effect on liquidity. The liquidity problem has
been eased with Government assistance but the long-term portfolio prospects
will depend mainly on developments in the textile sector which accounts for
a large portion of IDBP's outstandings.
Credit No. 206       Engineering Education:   US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Effective Date: July 14, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
The project is now about 24 months behind schedule. The physical
facilities of the project are expected to be complete by the Closing Date
(December 1976), except for about 15% of the equipment purchases, which are
linked to the Technical Assistance program.    This program will require at
least two years extension of the Closing Date because of delayed recruitment
of experts. Progress in staff development is unsatisfactory, mainly because
of low staff salaries, but these have recently been improved. Suggestions
for improvement have been made to the Borrower. Project costs on civil works
are expected to exceed the appraisal estimates by 85% in rupee terms, but
total project cosvs are unlikely to exceed the appraisal estimate of US$6.3
million due to the 1972 devaluation of the rupee. Disbursement remains slow
but is expected to improve in FY76 with the completion of the physical
facilities.

Credit No. 213      Power Transmission and Distribution:   US$23.0 Million
Credit of August 13, 1970; Effective Date: December 11,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Since the extension of the Closing Date to June 30, 1977, project
implementation has been improving. As consultant services will terminate on
September 30, 1976, WAPDA will continue supervision of construction until the
project is completed.
Credit No. 422-PAK Third Karachi Port: US$18.0 Million Credit of July 19,
1973; Effective Date: December 14, 1973; Closing
Date: June 30, 1979
Work has commenced on both the Juna Bunder shipping berths and
Napier Mole Bridge sites. Some contractor organizational and technical prob-
lems have delayed commencement of the permanent works at Juna Bunder.
Work is now due to start on the south abutment of the new bridge. Per-
manent way materials and water pipes and fittings are being supplied and
50% have been received to date. Supervisory and study arrangements are
being finalized. Over 90% of the Credit allocation has been committed and
59% of the Credit disbursed.
Credit No. 492-PAK Fourth Karachi Port: US$16.0 Million Credit of July 8,
1974; Effective Date: September 18, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The two lowest bids for construction of the oil berth were reviewed
in detail by KPT and, since the lowest bidder refused to delete numerous
conditions from the bid, an acceptable contract was negotiated with the
next lowest and signed by KPT in June 1976. The foreign exchange component
of the bid was twice that included in the appraisal estimates. Consultants
have not yet been formally appointed by KPT for preparing contract documents
for dredging works and dredger procurement. The implementation of oil berth
construction is now some 23 months behind the program prepared at the time
of appraisal. No disbursement from the Credit has been made to date.
Loan No. 961         Industrial Investment:  US$25.0 Million Loan of
January 31, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Loan was made to the Government to be administered by PICIC
rather than directly to PICIC pending settlement of PICIC's foreign cur-
rency liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh.
This problem has been solved. PICIC's major problem is a substantial volume
of arrears which has accummulated as a result of the difficulties of the
private sector over the last few years, particularly textiles. PICIC, in
cooperation with GOP, have undertaken a number of remedial measures and the
situation is now improving. The loan has been fully committed and disburse-
ments amounted to $15.8 million on August 13, 1976. A new loan is under
consideration.

January 31, 1974; Effective Date: April 3, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The general imports and civil works categories of this credit have
been fully disbursed. The original Closing Date of June 30, 1975 has been
further postponed to December 31, 1976, to permit completion of procurement
of specialized spare parts for the repair of construction and farm machinery.
Loan No. 988        Multan Fertilizer:   US$35.0 Million Loan of May 24,
1974; Effective Date: July 30, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977
The project is proceeding satisfactorily. Work on major offsites
such as roads, railroad tracks and utilities is complete and plant construc-
tion is proceeding vigorously. Staff recruitment and training is increasing
steadily. The most likely potential problem appears to be the late delivery
of a few critical items such as heat exchangers and boilers, which could delay
startup by several months.
Credit No. 510      Third Telecommunications:   US$36.0 Million Credit of
September 12, 1974; Effective Date: October 25, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project covered by this Credit is proceeding satisfactorily
though somewhat behind schedule. Procurement action for all the main equip-
ment items is well advanced. T&T was required under Credit Agreements of
145-PAK and of 510-PAK to be reorganized to function more effectively along
commercial lines and to be given a greater degree of autonomy. This
reorganization has not yet been effected. However, a Government-appointed
Committee recently made suitable recommendations which if accepted will meet
the Association's requirements. Government approval at Cabinet level is
expected shortly.
Credit No. 546       National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC):   US$30.0
Million Credit of May 15, 1975: Effective Date: July 17,
1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1979
During 1975, the National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC)
rapidly expanded its level of business with cumulative loan approvals total-
ling Rs 670 million and has forecast further expansion during the calendar
year 1976. To meet the new levels of business, NDFC has substantially in-
creased both its domestic currency resource position and its professional
staffing. NDFC forecast that the IDA credit will be fully allocated by mid
1977 and disbursed by December 1978. As at August 13, 1976, US$20.3 million
of the credit had been committed and US$2.5 million disbursed.

Date: December 31, 1979
Pipeline construction work is proceeding on schedule but installa-
tion of the two purification and dehydration banks will be delayed beyond
the planned date of June 1977 because of delays in preparing tender docu-
ments and evaluating bids. One of the banks should be installed by
December 1977 and contingency plans have been made for the winter season
1977/78. Costs of pipe and other equipment have been less than estimated
in the appraisal report.
