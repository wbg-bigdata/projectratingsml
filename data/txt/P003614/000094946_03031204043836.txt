Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
1.0 Introduction
1.1   Project Background
Guangzhou's inner ring road and the affiliated roads development are a key project in the
Guangzhou Urban Center Traffic Improvement Plan (the Plan) to alleviate the highly
congested urban center area. The project is to meet the demands of the rapid economic
development in Guangzhou and will serve as a part of the traffic congestion solution for
the downtown area by providing an undisrupted, high capacity flow for the through
traffic. Together with the outer ring road, the inner ring road will effectively detour the
pass-through motor vehicles from entering and going through the city center.
According to the Plan, the outer ring road is to connect Guangzhou with cities in the
surrounding area and long distance inter-city traffic, while inner ring road is to provide
pathways for the through traffic within the city of Guangzhou. The outer and inner ring
roads are to be connected via seven "radial" roads in different directions to form an
integrated fast road transport network surrounding the city. Following the completion of
the two ring roads in 2001, the connecting roads between the ring roads become high
priority projects in completing the road network and significant to implementing the Plan
and achieving the Plan objectives.
The proposed Guangzhou to Foshan (Guangfo) road is one of the seven radial roads
connecting the inner and outer ring roads and connecting urban Guangzhou area with
Foshan to the west. Located west of the city toward the west ring road, the proposed
Guangfo road will be one of the major trunk roads in the high speed road network in the
Guangzhou area and Pearl River delta. The locationis of the inner and outer ring roads and
the seven radial roads including Guangfo, are shown in Figure 2-1.
Guangzhou's west side is one of the most economically active areas in the Pearl River
delta. The west bound traffic is among the busiest with average daily traffic exceeding
50,000 motor vehicles and the higher traffic volume is expected to continue in the future.
Under such a traffic pressure, coupled with limited road capacity and poor road
conditions, the existing roads in this area have become a transportation bottleneck. As a
result, serious traffic congestion occurs frequently affecting the economic and social
activities in western Guangzhou and cities of Foshan and Nanhai to the west. Guangfo
road will provide an important connection between the inner and outer ring roads,
alleviating the transport botfleneck and traffic congestion.
Guangfo road consists of two mostly parallel carriage ways about 5.2-5.6 km long (3-3.4
km in the Guangzhou city and 2.2 km in the Nanhai city) starting from Zhongshan Balu
interchange on the west inner ring road, extends west bound in parallel with an existing
railway line, intersecting with planned Datansha road, Fangcun boulevard west (Fangcun
Dadaoxi), and ends at the Huangqi interchange on the west outer ring road. When
complete, it will form a quick speed connection mostly on an elevated viaduct between
two ring roads.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental limpact Assessment
The preparation for all seven radial roads was completed in 1998. During that process, an
environmental impact assessment (EIA) for all componenit roads including Guangfo road
had been finished as a single project by Guangzhou Environmental Research Institute
(GESRI), in accordance with the "Environmental Impact Assessment Technical Guide"
(HJ/T2.1-2.3-93). The EIA had been reviewed and approved by Guangzhou
Environmental Protection Bureau (GEPB) in 1998. Over the past four years, three out of
the seven radial roads have been constructed and opened for traffic. Guangfo road,
however has not been ready for construction until now. The project proponept,
Guangzhou City Center Transport Project Office, is now seeking World Bank financing to
start the construction of the Guangzhou section of the Guangfo road as soon as possible.
Clearly, many of the data in the 1998 EIA report may now be out-dated. In addition, the
EIA must comply and satisfy with relevant World Bank requirements, in particular,
OP4.01 which took effective in 1999 and other safeguards policies. As such, the previous
report will require an extensive update and revision and a separate, stand alone
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) will also be prepared. The original Terms of
Reference (TOR) for EA, prepared by Guangzhou Environmental Scientific Research
Institute GESRI and approved by GEPB in July 1998, was updated to reflect the GEPB's
comments as and World Bank safeguards requirements. The English version of the TOR
was submitted to the World Bank in April, 2002.
According to the revised TOR, additional EA tasks have been conducted since 2001,
including the following:
* Field investigation along the project area to understand changes since the last EIA,
particularly changes of sensitive receptors;
* Additional environmental baseline monitoring for ambient air, noise and water at
selected representative sites along the project area to update the baseline information;
* Collection and review of baseline and forecast data including traffic counts and
forecast, motor vehicle fleet, etc.;
* Re-run the emission, dispersion and noise models using the updated data;
o Conduct public consultation; and
* Revise the EIA report and creation of an EMP.
This EIA report is prepared based on the original report as well as the findings of the
above tasks with updated information and assessment for Guangfo road. While the World
Bank finances only part of the Guangfo road (the Guangzhou section), this EIA covers
the entire Guangfo road with the same assessment standards and mitigation requirements.
When the Nanhai section is built, mitigation proposed in the EIA and EMP will apply.
The Nanhai government has accepted the EIA findings and mitigation measures
according to local government officials during public consultation.
The English version EIA is the translation of the Chinese report which has been re-
submitted to GEPB for reference (no approval is necessary as it has been approved in
1998). The author of the EIA report certifies that there is no discrepancy of substance

1.4   Function Zoning
The environmental zoning is based on the functions of the project as determined by the
Guangzhou Municipal Government, based on relevant state and local environmental
regulations. The functional zoning, which will be the basis for selection environmental
standards for this assessment, is as follows:
o The project area will be Class II zone for ambient air quality;
*  The project area is located in Guangzhou's drinking water protection area which will
be the basis for surface water quality standard;
o  With regard to noise zoning, areas with schools will be regarded in this EA as
Category I noise zone, and residential areas will be classified as Category II noise
zone (mixed residential/commercial zone); other areas which are essentially industrial
and commercial facilities located immediately adjacent to a busy railway line, is
classified as Category IV noise zone (urban trunk road side zone), which is defined as
30 m from the railway and trunk roads.
The functional zoning of the project area applied in this EA, is summarized in Table I - I.

Noise
Based on Zoning of Guangzhou Urban Area According to 'Standard of Environmental
Noise in Urban Area' the project area includes both Class IV and Class 11 zones.
Basically, areas immediately adjacent to trunk roads and railways are zoned as Class IV
while the mixed residential, education and commercial areas are zoned as Class II, and
the corresponding noise standards will be applied to this zones accordingly. Earlier
environmental assessment has identified seven sensitive receptors including schools and
residential areas some of which are located on the trunk road and railway side. However,
to better protect the sensitive receptors, all schools and residential facilities, regardless
their zoning, will all apply Class I noise standards, which are the most stringent standards
within the noise regulatory standard framework. These standards and corresponding
applicable zones are listed in Table 1-4. The construction site noise standards are listed in
Table 1-5.

Guangfo Coninecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
1.6   Primary Environmental Protection Target
The primary protection targets are facilities sensitive to environmental impacts, or known
as sensitive receptors. Typically in urban or suburb areas, sensitive receptors include
schools, hospitals, kindergartens, residential areas, government and professional
institutions, drinking water sources, scenery ancl cultural relics or historical sites.
In this EA, all sensitive receptors along the project will first be identified through site
investigation and determined as to the nature of these facilities and what types of impacts
they are sensitive to and when they are sensitive. These sensitive receptors will then be
the focus throughout the environmental baseline evaluation and impact assessment.
Furthermore, the sensitive receptors will also be the primary targets for which preventive
and mitigation measures will be developed. An objective of the EA is to protect these
sensitive receptors from unacceptable adverse impacts from project activities in both the
construction and operation phases.
1.7   Scope of Assessment and Pollution Parameters
The scope of environmental impact assessment is determined primarily according to
"Environmental Impact Assessment Guides for Road Construction Projects" (JTJ005-96)
from the Ministry of Communications (MOC). The scope for this project is:
* Ambient air: 300 m on both sides of the road;
*  Water: upstream from the Pearl River bridge to the water intake of the Xicun Water
Plant and 200 m downstream from the bridge;
* Noise: 50 m on both sides of the road;
* Ecological and visual impacts: 200 m on both sides of the road.
Based on the nature of the project (motor vehicle noise and emission, large scale elevated
viaduct, etc.) and site conditions (river crossing, urban area, etc), the focuses of EA will
be placed on acoustic environment, ambient air quality, water environment, and scenery
or visual impacts. The assessment will first focus on preventive measures through
altemative analysis and design changes, before mitigation and compensation measures.
The assessment itself will utilize the existing environmental monitoring and assessment
information in the archives or historical data, as well as investigation and data collection
in this EA process.
The key pollutant parameters to be covered in this EA are:
* Air: NO2, CO, TSP and PM1o for monitoring and NO2 and CO for impact projection;
*  Water: SS, COD, petroleum oil, lead, zinc, chromium for monitoring and COD and
petroleum oil for impact projection; and
* Noise: ambient noise as measured as dB(A).

Guanlgfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
2.0 Project Description and Engineering Analysis
2.1   Project Alignment and Orientation
Guangfo connecting road starts from Zhongshan Balu interchange on the west section of
the inner ring road. The road will then extend westbound, cross Pearl river east channel,
on the Datansha island in the middle of Pearl river, then turn southwest bound crossing
Pearl river west channel into Fangcun district and then entering into Nanhai city of
Foshan Municipality after the Fangcun boulevard west (Fangcun Dadaoxi), and finally
end at the Huangqi interchange on the outer ring road. Guangfo road consists of two
elevated viaduct (Line A and B each with three motor vehicle lanes in one direction) in
parallel and close distance on both sides to the operating Guangsan railway, and then
merges into a single elevated viaduct structure at Guocun residential areas within the
Nanhai city. The total length of Guangfo road is about 5.2 km (Line A) to 5.6 km (Line
B), of which approximately 3.2 km is in the Guangzhou and 2-2.6 km in Nanhai,
approximately 5-5.4 km is bridges and elevated viaduct and 0.2 km is surface road
(Figure 2-1).
Guangfo road will intersect the inner ring road, proposed Datansha road, Fangcun
boulevard west (Fangcun Dadaoxi), and the outer ring road, with two/three layer
interchanges. The two Pearl river bridges will have the identical design in span and
navigation clearance with the existing rail/road bridges. Both bridges will be 600 m long.

The Zhongshan Balu interchange on the inner ring road and Huangqiao interchange on
the outer ring road have mostly constructed except the connections with Guangfo road
and are current in operation. The proposed World Bank loan will finance the Guangzhou
part of the road, up to the Fangcun interchange while the financing and construction for
the section in Nanhai/Foshan city section is to be determined later. However, this EA
covers the entire Guangfo road with the same standards for assessment and mitigation
design, despite the road may be financed differently and constructed in two stages.
2.3   Drainage Systems
According to "Guangzhou Urban Area Wastewater Management Master Plan", which
indicates that the newly developed districts will adopt separate wastewater and storm
water systems while the old urban area will gradually be converted to the separate system.
Considering also the needs for flood control, the following principles and standards are
applied in the design of drainage system in Guangfo road:
* New storm water sewers will be built and located as close to the evaluated viaduct as
possible but not to affect the locations of the viaduct columns along the entire
Guangfo road; and wastewater sewers will be located close to the pedestrian roads;
ESRI                           September, 2002                           9



Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
*  Catch basins will be installed evenly along the entire Guangfo road, including the
ramps. On the ramps, the catch basins will be located at the bottoms;
*  Vertical PVC pipes with 150 mm diameter will be used to drain storm water on the
elevated viaduct to the ground, connecting directly to the underground storm sewers;
*  Sewer systems in the demolition areas will be re-built, connecting to the trunk sewer
systems in that area; and
*  The catchment area will be defined basically as 150 m from the central line on both
sides of Guangfo road.
The Datansha area currently has two sewer lines, the Fangcun area has only one
combined sewer line while the Huangqi interchange area on the outer ring road area has
no sewer system as this is close to the rural area. The project will include construction of
one storm sewer line in the Fangcun area (to create a separate sewer system) and one
storm sewer line in the Huangqi area, both to be built simultaneously with the Guangfo
road main structure itself. As described in the above bullets, the storm water will be first
collected via the catch basins on the viaduct, and then drained via the vertical pipes
mounted on the supporting columns to the underground storm sewer along the entire
Guangfo road, either existing or newly built. Finally, all the storm sewer will be directly
discharged to the closest surface water bodies in the area.
2.4   Landscaping
Guangfo project will contain a landscaping component. Basically, trees will be planted
along the pedestrian lanes at the space of 8-10 meter. Bushes and lawns will be planted at
the both ends of bridges. In the open space of interchanges, there will be low bushes,
flowers and lawns.
2.5   Traffic Volume Forecast
Traffic on Guangfo road is forecasted for years 2005, 2010 and 2020 which will also be
the key years for environmental impact assessment, based on the methodology from
"Methods for Feasibility Study for Road and Water Aviation Projects" by the Ministry of
Communications (MOC). Motor vehicle fleet composition and traffic volume on
Guangfo road are forecasted based existing survey as well as the changes and growth
with the regional economic development in the future. The forecast results are presented
in Table 2-3 and Table 2-4.

2.7   Major Pollutants
The Guangfo connecting road project construction and operation will generate pollutants
to be discharged to the environment. Main such pollutants are:
Motor Vehicle Emission
The motor vehicle emission comes primarily from incomplete engine combustion (about
60% of the emission), crankcase leak gas (20%) and carburetor emission (20%).
Typically, there are approximately 120-200 kinds of organic compounds in the motor
vehicle emission, but the primary contaminants are CO, NO2, HC and lead containing
particulate. These contaminants emission changes with the distance driven, speed, type of
vehicles, fuels, and vehicle maintenance conditions. For most of the vehicles in
Guangzhou motor vehicle fleet, NO2 and CO emissions increase as the motor vehicle
speed, but HC emission decreases with motor vehicle speed. For motor cycles, NO2 and
HC emissions all increase with the driving speeds.
Motor vehicle emission coefficients for different types of motor vehicles under different
conditions will be determined using MOBILE5, which is a motor vehicle emission
coefficient model developed by the US Environmental Protection Administration (US
EPA). MOBILES considers various factors related to motor vehicle emissions and have
been widely and successfully applied in different countries under different conditions.
This model was modified and applied in 1995 in the environmental impact assessment for
the World Bank financed Guangzhou Inner Ring Road project by GESRI, and has been
proven to be accurate and fit with the local conditions. MOBILE5 requires the following
data in running the modeling:
* Guangzhou motor vehicle fleet size over the years;
* Existing motor vehicle inspection standards and new vehicle emission standards in
Guangzhou;
* Motor vehicle emission control plan, inspection and maintenance programs in the
future, and emission standards to be adopted for new motor vehicles in Guangzhou;
*  Import and domestic motor vehicle ratio and trend for changes and emissions from
import motor vehicles;
* Average speeds of motor vehicles using Guangfo road; and
*  Climate data for January and July in Guangzhou including maximum, minimum and
average temperatures.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
For the above data, the motor vehicle fleet size uses the 1978-1998 data as the base data.
The new vehicle emission standards are based on the "Light motor vehicle pollutant
emission standards (GWPBI-1999)" and "Motor cycle pollutant emission standards
(GB14621-93)". The average motor vehicle speeds are assumed to be 60 km/hr. on the
project road and 40 km/hr. on the ramps. Using these data and assumptions, the model
predicts the motor vehicle emission coefficient for different types of motor vehicles
which will use the Guangfo road. The modeling results are presented in Table 2-5.

The above table does not include motorcycles because motorcycles are banned on the
inner ring and radial road network including Guangfo road. Furthermore, the government
of Guangzhou has already stopped issuing new licenses to motorcycles and plans to
gradually phase out motorcycles from urban/suburb Guangzhou within the next few years
when existing motorcycles are retired. Therefore, this EA does not consider the impacts
from motorcycles.
Based on the motor vehicle emission coefficients listed in the above table for various
types of vehicles and traffic volume forecasted for this project, the peak hour motor
vehicle emissions can be calculated using the following formula:
E,jk(y) = C,k (y) N, Lj

Noise
Noise during the construction phase will come primarily from construction machinery,
with noise intensity ranged between 80-90 dB(A).
At the operational phase, the noise sources will be motor vehicles on the road, including
engine noise, emission noise, vibration noise, transmission noise, brake noise, tire and
road surface friction noise, etc. The engine noise is the dominant source of motor vehicle
noise.
According to "Environmental Impact Assessment Guide for Road Construction Projects
(JTJO05-96), the motor vehicle noise intensity is proportional to the motor vehicle speed,
as defined in Table 2-5. Also presented in this table is the projected noise level at the
designed speeds for Guangfo road.

Note: V is motor vehicle speed and the formula are applicable for 20-100 km/hr. speeds
Wastewater
During the construction phase, the wastewater will primarily be domestic wastewater
from construction camps. For the Guangfo road project, it is estimated that there will be
about 200 workers at the site during construction. At 315 L/person/day, the wastewater
generation will be approximately 63 m3/day, with the characteristics shown in Table 2.6.
ESRI                            September, 2002                           13

In addition, there will also be small amount of machinery washing effluent during the-
construction phase which contains primarily oil and grease and suspended solids.
During operation phase, the contaminated water will mainly be the first period of storm
water as surface runoff from the road. According to the method recommended by a paper
entitled "Environmental Impact Assessment of Road Surface Polluted Storm Water"
published in Environmental Protection in Transportation Sector (2-3, 1994), the first two
hours of storm water volume may be determined using the following formula:
Qm=CxlxA, I=Q/D
Where:       Qm,   first 2 hours of storm water volume from road surface;
C:    catchment area runoff coefficient;
1:    average precipitation intensity within the collection period;
A:    road surface area;
Q:    project area average annual precipitation; and
D:    project area average number of days of precipitation per year.
According to the last 58 years of historical climate data in Guangzhou, the annual
precipitation in the project area is estimated to be 1699.8 mm and the average total
number of days of precipitation (defined as precipitation larger than 0.1 mm per day) per
year is 151 days. The surface runoff coefficient is 0.9 for concrete, asphalt and other type
of paved surface according Interior Design Codes of China. The total area of Guangfo
road is approximately 150,000 mi2. Thus, the first two hours of storm water is 759.8 m3/hr.
or 0.21 m /s.
Because of the dripping oil, dust and other contaminants which may be present on the
road surface, the "first flush" of the storm water will be contaminated. The contaminant
concentrations of the surface runoff from the road are affected by many factors and are
difficult to estimate. This EA will use data from another operation expressway in south
China, which made measurements on the pollutant strength in the surface runoff from
highways, which is generated within the first hour of precipitation. The data are presented
in Table 2.7.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
3.0    Environmental and Socio-Economic Baseline
3.1   Physical Setting
3.1.1 Land Form and Geology
The landform of the project area may, be divided into the five sections along the road
alignment and each has distinct landform and soil.
Zhongshan Balu section has a Quaternary sediment layer of 19.8 - 52.5 m thick. The soil
is mainly backfill (sand), silt, power sand, coarse sand and powdering clay. The bed rock
is cretaceous sandy rock. The weathered rock surface is about 21.5-52.5 m, with
substantial fluctuation.
Pearl River East Bridge has a Quaternary sediment layer of 3.7-44.8 m thick. The soil is
mainly backfill, medium to coarse sand, silt, and powering clay. The bed rock is
cretaceous sandy rock. Weathered rock surface is about 3.7-54.1 m with substantial
fluctuation.
Datansha section has a Quaternary sediment layer of 20.0-44.0 m thick. The soil is
mainly backfill, silt, fine sand, medium to coarse sand and sandy clay. The bed rock is
cretaceous silty rock, sandy rock and limestone rock with complex natures. The
weathered rock layer measured from the existing ground is 20.0-59.2 m.
Pearl River West Bridge has a Quaternary sediment layer of 6.5-9.4 m thick. The soil is
mainly medium to coarse sand and powering clay and the bed rock is cretaceous sandy
rock. The weathered rock layer is 9.8-23.7 m with some fluctuation.
Fangcun section has a Quaternary sediment layer of 3.7-44.8 m thick. The soil is mixed
backfill silt, medium to coarse sand and silty clay. The bed rock is cretaceous sandy rock
and weathered rock layer is about 17.5-29.4 m.
The alluvium layers on the site contains water. There are abundant groundwvater resources
in the project area. The drilling investigation showvs that the groundwater table in this area
is about 1.3-1.5 m on average.
3.1.2 Meteorology and Climate
Guangzhou is located in the sub-tropical monsoonl climate zone with abundant
precipitation and moist air. Based on the long term climate records from meteorological
stations near the project area, the yearly average temperature is 21.9 C, with extreme
high of 37.5 C and extreme low of 0.4 'C. The average relative humidity is 81% and
average yearly precipitation of 1700 mm. Tlic summer has the highest precipitation,
about 44%  of the yearly total while the wiinter, only 6%. The wind direction is

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
predominantly north while prevailing wind in the summer is froin southeast. The
prevailing wind direction in a year is north, with an about 16% frequency. The yearly
average wind speed is2.3 m/s and the frequency of calm is 29.3% in a year.
3.1.3 Hydrology
The project impacted area is located amongst a river network. Flows in the surface water
bodies are mainly affected by surface runoff in the rain season and by tide in the dry
season. The tides are irregular half day tides, namely, two high and two ebb tides per day.
The average high tide elevation is 0.77 m while the ebb tide is -0.61 m. The river
network hydrology is very-complex as the surface water system is affected by multiple
sources of runoff and tides from multiple river mouths.
The project area is part of the Shangyuan river-Liuxi river basin at the Guangzhou section
of Pearl river. The project site is within the sub protection area of the protective zones for
water intake sources for Xicun, Shimen, Jiangcun water purification plants of Guangzhou.
The locations of the rivers, and the surface water network are shown in Figure 2-1.
Liuxi river originates from Xifeng county and flows through Conghua city, Huadu city,
Beiyun district and enters into Pearl river at Yangang of the Guangzhou section. The total
length of the river is 171 km with a total catchment area of 2300 km2. There are nine
dams along the main river, well controlled hydraulically. Following series of divisions,
the flow at downstream section of Huadu and Beiyun sections has an average of 25.7
m3/s, with a high at the rain season of 51.64 m3/s and low at the dry season of 13.29 m3/s.
Pearl river west section, defined as Yangang to Beiertan with a total length of 18 km, is
upstream from Guangzhou. The river at this section has an average width of 368 m, depth
2
of 4.56 m and total catchment area of 390 km . Within this section, there are two water
purification plants providing water supply to Guangzhou at Shimen and Xicun, both of
which are over 10 km upstream (north) from the site. The river section and the
surrounding areas are designated water sources protective zones. Together with Jiangcun
water purification downstream from Liuxi river, the three plants provide 73% of water
supply to Guangzhou city.
There are several other small creeks in the project area, which are not hydraulically
connected with Liuxi or Pearl rivers.
3.1.4 Aquatic Life
Based on the site investigation of the project area water bodies, the aquatic life found can
be divided into the following categories:
Algae. A total of 7 species and 83 genus of algae have been observed in the project area
water bodies during a survey between June-December 2001. Of these algae, there are 46
genus of chlorophyta, 17 genus of bacillariophyta, 10 genus of cyanophyla, I genus of
pyrophyta, 2 genus of ciyptophyta, 2 genus of chiysophyta and 5 genus of euglenophyta.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
The dominant species are Scenedesmus quadricanda, selenasfrum sp., cryptomonas ovata,
chloamydonzonas sp. and euglena sp. Based on the year 2001 observation, the algae
population was about 0.9 to 1.5 million per liter, between semi- to full eutraphication.
Plankton A total of 48 species and 66 genus of plankton observed in the project area
during the 2001 survey, include shelled plankton (arcella and vorticella), rotifers
(pompholyx and diurella), carragheen (ceriodaphnia and hosminopsii), and copepod
(eucyclops and phyllodiaptomus)
Hvdrophyte. There are substantial floating lotus in the Pearl river section near the project
area, primarily Eichhoruia orassipes. During the flood season, there are often large
amounts of such lotus on the river surface, which are the main waste materials in the
Pearl river Guangzhou section requiring clean. Similar aquatic plants include Pistia
stratiotes, Azolla imbricata, Lemna minor, Alternatnthera philoxroides, Jussiaea linifolia,
and polygonaceae hydropipers.
Benthos The June 2001 investigation showed there were 36 species of benthos in Pearl
river west Guangzhou section. Main species observed in the project area include
Nemalycasis aibima, limnodrilus, branchirurs, rhyacodrilus, mendipertinae, odonata,
cipangopa sp. and anodenta sp. In Jiaobiao creek, there are large number of snail in the
sediments. In the ditches within the Jiaobiao flower nursery, there is a large amount of
the nails in the sediment.
Fish. Fish observed are mostly pollutant resistant species, including clarias bathrchus,
gambubusia affinis, oryzias tatipe, ctenogobius duospilas, and monopterus albus. The
June-December 2001 survey showed that Pearl river Guangzhou section has about 63
species of fish, including fresh water fish (Cyprims carpio, Carassius auratus, Culter
pseudobreuicauda, Ctenoharygodon idellus, Hypophthalmichthy smolitrix, etc.) and semi
fresh water fish (Clupanodon thrissa, Clupanodon punctatus, Trypauchen rubicundns,
etc.). Relative large fish population was observed in the Pearl river near the project area
(Beiertan near the White Swan hotel slightly upstream from the project area) in the
summer of 201, indicating the improvement in Pearl river water quality and also relates
to the fact that there was high precipitation in 2001.
The small creeks near the south side of Guangfo road, such as Jiaobiao creek and
Shawbian ditch are so seriously polluted that the water is black in color with stink odors.
No fish is found in these water bodies. The ditches within the Jiaobiao flower nursery is
however, relatively clean with Gambusia affinis, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, and other
sallow water species.
There is no valuable aquatic life species or important habitats for such species in the
project area. The aquatic life including the fish does not have significant fisheries or
economic values in the immediate project area. There is no commercial fishing in any
rivers in the project area.
3.1.5 Groundwater

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
The project area's alluvial sand layer contain water, which is the main groundwater
aquifer with abundant water supply. Site drilling showed that the average groundwater
table is about 1.3-1.5 m below grade. The groundwater is not corrosive to concrete.
3.1.6 Vegetation
A site investigation was conducted to determine the vegetation baseline. The
investigation covered area on both sides of the existing roads which are divided into four
zones with similar characteristics in vegetation population:
*  Pearl river bridge zone which starts from Pearl river east bridge to Fangeun
interchange with a total length of 2.4 km;
*  Park zone, including the Liwanhu lake park southeast of Zhongshan Balu interchange,
Qingnian (Youth) park northwest of Zhongshan Balu interchange and Shuangqiao
park south side of the existing road on Datansha island (see Figure 2-1);
*  Guangsan railway base zone which is from Fangeun boulevard west (Fangcun
Dadaoxi) to Jiaobaio village; and
*  Jiaobiao village zone which is from Jiaobiao village to the Huangqi interchange on
the outer ring road.
The investigation team walked through the entire project alignment to identify vegetation
species. In addition, a lOxlO m2 sampling spot in each zone was selected in the site
investigation to estimate the vegetation biomass.
Within the Pearl river bridge zone, there are less trees on the road side as there road sides
are mostly occupied by office and residential buildings. The plants found there have less
diversity in species and grow poorly, including mainly Casuarina equisetifolia,
Broussonelia papyrifera, and Mallotus apelea. The park zone is well landscaped. Except
water surface and limited pavement for roads and parking, the entire park zone is covered
with greens. The plants are diversified with many different species and parks have large
areas of lawn, which provide mini urban ecological systems. The parks are well used by
the local residents and visitors/tourists and major attractions in the area because of,
among other features, their well designed and maintained landscape and vegetation. In
the railway base zone, the vegetation is primary for the protection of railway base, which
are less diversified. In the Jiaobiao village zone towards the outer ring road interchange,
there are 600 m of agricultural land/a flower nursery on both sides of the proposed road
alignment. The main plants at these farm lands are pot flowers with different species such
as roses, lilies, and others depending on market demands. Like other agricultural land, the
,land in this zone is harvested periodically.

3.1.7 Existing Roads
For the most part of the project alignment, there is an existing road which goes from
Zhongshan Balu interchange through two Pearl river bridges and the Datansha area and
then to Fangcun boulevard (Fangcun Dadaoxi). This road ends at Jiaobiao village of
Nanhai city and slightly short of reaching the outer ring road. The existing road is divided
into two carriage ways basically on the both sides of Guangsan railway line which goes
beyond the outer ring road. The proposed Guangfo road is to a certain extent an
expansion of the existing roads, through elevated viaduct to be basically built
immediately adjacent to the existing ones. Most of the existing surface road will be
operational following Guangfo road construction, providing additional transport capacity.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
The project is mostly located in the Fangcun district which has very fertile lands and is
well served with road and water transportation with over 30 wharves in the district.
Fangcun is the most well-known homeland of flowers, with over 1000 species of flowers.
It is also well known for its pleasure fish, miniscape, and pot flowers which exported to
over 20 cities in China and 10 overseas such as Hong Kong, Macau, Europe and North
America, approximately 80% of the total export from Guangzhou. There are 1400
harmladn in Fungcun and besides flowers, the farm land is also used for fish ponds,
vegetables, fruits, including peach, orange, grape, olive fruits, etc. Fangcun is one of the
most important vegetable, fruits and farming fish bases for Guangzhou.
3.1.9 Visual Aesthetics
The project is located in busy urban built up area in its north part and suburb in the
southwest part. The main aesthetic views along the alignment may be divided into three
distinct areas: the Pearl river area, the railway line corridor, and the countryside in the
Jiaobiao area. The Pearl river is located in the urban area with landscape along the
existing road and near the Pearl river bridges, including many manual trees up to 30-40 m
tall. There are two community parks, Qingnian park and Shuangqiao park, and one city
park the Liwanhu lake park. All are well landscaped, providing beautiful views as well as
space for leisure and relaxation for residents in the neighborhood and visitors from
elsewhere. These parks consist of the most important and valuable visual aesthetics
resources in the project area.
Within the railway corridor, the slope of railway base is covered lawn and off the base
there are trees. On the both sides, there are some residential developments, and
commercial operations including a flower market.
The southwest part of the project is typical south China countryside, with rural housing,
agricultural land mostly for flowers and some vegetables. There is also a nursery with
hundreds of thousands of saplings. The Li's Family Shrine is a traditional Chinese
architect, providing a unique view in the area. Together, with an octagonal pavilion and
Jiaobiao creek, as well as abundant southem area vegetation, the area forms a beautiful
mini country scenery full of tradition and culture.
3.2   Social and Economic Baseline
3.2.1 District Population and Economy
The city of Guangzhou has a population of 7.126 million (2001) with a total GDP of
RMB268.48 billion and average per capita GDP of RMB38,000 which is among the
highest in China. The urban transportation in Guangzhou is well developed with a total
freight valued at RMB249 million and passenger of 2.1 billion person-times (2001). The
infrastructure investment last year was RMB 14.27 billion focusing mostly on urban roads
and other transportation infrastructure. The urban road network has been rapidly
developing with a total road area of 42.7 million m2 by year 2001.
ESRI                           September, 2002                          21



Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
Fangcun district is a suburb district in southwest part of Guangzhou, with a total area of
42.6 km2. The permanent residents in the district was 171,900 in 1998 including 36,000
rural residents. The district has five townships and urban neighborhood zones, 17 villages
and 75 urban resident committees. The 1998's GDP in the Fangcun was RMB1.74 billion,
average of RMB17,179 per captia, of which RMB612 million were from industry and
RMB 152 million from agriculture. The total export from the district in 1998 was US$114
million. Flowers, miniscape and pleasure fish are major export commodities, about 80%
of total export of these commodities for Guangzhou. The district has always been the
major supply base for flowers, vegetable and fish for Guangzhou.
3.3.2 Cultural Property
During the construction of Guangsan railway and the existing along the project alignment,
there was no report of any findings of cultural or archaeological properties. The site
survey by the EA team during the project EA also shows no known cultural properties in
the project area except the Li's Family Shrine (description below). Consultation with
local cultural authority indicates no other particular concerns for cultural property
protection for the area, including no known archaeological concern in the project area.
The site investigation during the environmental baseline study also showed that the
groundwater level at the areas is about 1-1.5 m below grade. It is unlikely to have
archaeological sites in the area.
The Li's Family Shrine is located at entrance area of the Jiaobiao village, very close to
the proposed Guangfo road alignment. In the nearby area within the Jiaobiao primary
school campus, there are an octagonal pavilion, and bronze stature and monument of Mr.
Li. The Shrine was built in 1921 with unique architectural features and has been listed as
a cultural property protection structure by the Nanhai city Cultural Bureau. The stature,
monument and pavilion were built in 1924, in memorial of Mr. Li Yong Shu, an oversea
Chinese who had invested heavily in education and public utilities, infrastructure and
services in the village and the nearby region. Mr. Li's generosity and almsdeed to the
public have been well respected by the local people and their descendants. The stature,
monument and pavilion, which together with the Li's Family Shrine form a well
harmonized group of traditional Chinese architects, have been well protected and highly
valued by the residents as part of the history. During the public consultation (Chapter 7
for more details), residents are highly concerned of the impacts of Guangfo road which
will be directly above the monument and stature and have demanded relocation.
3.2.3 Sensitive Receptors
The primary protection targets in the project area are environmentally sensitive receptors,
which in this projects include schools, institution, water bodies and residential areas. The
preliminary site investigation showed the following major sensitive receptors within the
project impacted area. The sensitive receptors are summarized in Table 3-2.
ESRI                           September, 2002                          22

The locations of these sensitive receptors and their relations to proposed Guangfo road
are shown in Figure 3-3. In addition, there are two community parks, one city park, tree
nursery, and commercial outlets which may not be as sensitive as those in the above table
but nevertheless covered by the EA as appropriate.
Figures 3-4 and 3-5 are pictures of some of the sensitive receptors.
3.3   Existing Ambient Air Quality
To determine the existing air quality baseline, air quality monitoring was conducted in
three locations during this EA: Al at Zhangshan Balu Interchange (Guangfo road starting
point), A2 at Dantansha, and A3 at Jiaobiao Primary School. The monitoring locations are
shown as A1-A3 in Figure 3-6 which also shows the water quality monitoring sites WI-
W4. The monitored parameters include NO2, CO, TSP and PM1o and monitoring period
was August 2-7, 2001 for five consecutive days. For NO2 and CO, samples were
collected four times a day at 07:00, 10:00, 14:00 and 18:00 and one hour each time. For
the other two parameters, one sample was collected per day for 24 hours continuously.
The monitoring results are shown in Table 3-3.
ESRI                            September, 2002                          23

TSP         Daily average      0.30       0.326       0.174       0.151
The monitoring results show that the ambient air quality is generally good as most of the
monitored parameters comply with the applicable ambient air quality standards for the
project area. Only NO2 partially exceeded the standard and PM,o exceeded standards in
all monitoring locations. It is also noted that for almost all parameters monitored along
the Guangfo road during the this EA, concentrations at Zhangshan Balu interchange were
the highest (e.g., 0.037-0.342 mg/mi3 for NO2), decreased at Datansha (0.020-0.168
mg/m3 for NO2) and the lowest at Jiaobiao Primary School (0.038-0.126 mg/m3 for NO2).
This indicates that air quality was poorest in the urban area and gradually improved
towards the outside of the city for the Guangfo road project area. This corresponds to the
fact that there are more activities with air emissions in urban areas than suburb area.
In Guangzhou, motor vehicle emissions have become a primary source of air pollution
particularly for NO2 and CO. The city has limited stationary sources of air emissions as it
basically has no coal fired boilers and most cooking, hot water, etc. are fueled mostly by
natural gas and electricity. Over the last few years, most industrial operations have
moved out of the urban area and to areas substantially farther outside the outer ring road,
except one power station, one steel mill and a cement kiln which are to be moved soon.
These industrial operations are not located in the Guangfo road project area and as a
result, the project area air quality is primary affected by motor vehicle emissions. The EA
team did not obtain SO2 for the Guangfo road area.
3.4   Noise Baseline
The noise baseline at the project area was established through a monitoring program
conducted between June 15-16, 2001 as par of this EA. Nine monitoring locations were
selected, at sensitive receptors identified. At each monitoring locations, noise was
recorded for two consecutive days and recording time each day was 14:00 (representing
normal day time noise), 17:00 (representing rush or peak traffic hour noise) and 22:30
(representing night time noise), respectively. The noise monitoring results are presented
in Table 3-4.

According to "Guangzhou Applicable Noise Zoning for Urban Area Environmental
Noise Standards", the monitoring locations are all belong to Class II Noise Zone, except
Jiaobiao Primary School which is located in a Class IV zone. The monitoring results
show that except monitoring results at Shuangqiao Middle School, Jiangzhou Primary
School and Guangdong Commerce School, which slightly exceeded the day time noise
standard, in all other locations the noise was within the standard. This indicates that the
project area has in general a good acoustic environment. However, the train within the
project area has significant noise impacts to the surrounding environment. For example,
the noise level at Jiaobiao primary school reached 87.4 dB(A) when a train is passing and
even to 91.4 dB(A) if the train whistles.
The noise monitoring locations are shown in Figure 3-3.
3.5   Water Quality Monitoring
Based on the relevant requirements and principles of "Technical Guidelines for
Environmental Impact Assessment (HJ/T2.3-93)", four locations along the Pearl River
were selected for water monitoring cross section during project EA. The four cross
sections, at Huaqiao Sugar Plant (WI), Pearl River East Bridge (W2), Pearl River West
Bridge (W3) and Huangsha (W4) are shown in Figure 3-6. At each cross section, three
sampling points were selected from left, middle and right for collecting the surface water
samples. Water quality parameters monitored include SS, COD, oil & grease, lead, zinc,
and chromium. The water monitoring results are shown in Table 3-5.

The monitoring results show that within the monitoring period, several parameters
exceeded the applicable standards (Class III) for the monitored area, such as oil and COD,
indicating that the existing surface water quality cannot meet the functional requirements
designated for this area. The monitoring results also indicate that water quality upstream
is apparently better than that downstream, implying pollution sources from the network
of rivers discharging into the Pearl river in downstream area. Surface water quality did
not change significantly with the tidal influence.
3.6   Impacts of Other Major Urban Road Projects
Within the urban Guangzhou area, there have been three major road development
projects: outer ring road, inner ring road, and seven radial roads (of which the Guangfo
road is a part). The ELAs for the three major urban roads, completed in 1992, 1997 and
1998, respectively, have reached similar conclusions, as summarized below:
*  The developments will result in degradation of air quality, particularly NOx within
the immediately vicinity of the alignment (about 200 m and in some cases 300 m);
* Noise levels in the project road corridors will increase significantly, particularly the
outer ring road and part of the radial roads which are located in the suburb areas with
low background noise;
*  Impacts to surface water quality will be primarily from the first flush of storm water
collected and drained from the road surface and generally modest as the receiving
water bodies in the area have generally high assimilative and dilution capacities;
*  All three projects will involve significant land acquisition and resettlement and
relocation;
*  The road development will also make positive impacts to the natural and socio-
economic environment Besides the greatly improvement urban transportation
infrastructure and thus quality of life, the most significant positive impacts is the air
quality improvement in the overall urban area especially in the city center.

* All three ElAs found their respective urban road developments feasible
environmentally if the proposed mitigation measures are implemented effectively.
These projects will also allow for the opportunity to enhance the environment in the
city center through longer term solutions such as traffic management, urban planning
and zoning, and development and implementation of motor vehicle emission control
strategies.
Implemented mitigation measures
Clearly, air quality degradation and noise are the most significant impacts by the road
development projects. In the previous ElAs and EMPs, various mitigation measures have
been designed to minimize potential adverse impacts and these mitigation measures have
been implemented over the last few years. More specifically, the following measures,
some of which are partially financed by the World Bank through the inner ring road
project, have been taken:
*  An I/M program has been created. By 2001, 44 motor vehicle emission inspection
check points had been in operation. These check points are located in the motor
vehicle safety inspection stations run by Guangzhou Public Security Bureau (traffic
police) and are currently adopting the idle test. In 2001, approximately 88% (about
800,000 units) of the registered motor vehicles had been inspected. The test is
mandatory and run annually at the time when the license is up for renewal. According
to the observation by Guangzhou Environmental Monitoring Station which run the
motor vehicle emission test program, most of the un-inspected motor vehicles are
motor cycles and those which may not be in use or may be operating in another city.
*  A more elaborated inspection program adopting the loaded transient driving cycle test
is under preparation. At the time this EA was prepared, a test building is under design
and testing equipment is under bid. Guangzhou is soon to adopt the more
sophisticated l/M program. At the same time, a study is underway to determine how
many testing lines/stations are required for the city, testing fees, and other operating
details for establishing and operating the I/M program.
*  On the maintenance component in the l/M program, Class II maintenance is required
annually prior to the emission testing. This maintenance work is carried by the regular
motor vehicle maintenance garages.
*  The I/M program also includes a road side random inspection program in which 16
stations were in operation in 2001. Unlike the annual testing where most vehicles
tested meet the national standards, the road side random test shows that only 80% of
the gasoline and 60% of diesel vehicles pass the applicable national standards.
* Mandatory vehicle requirement program in which motor vehicles of 20 years old and
motor cycles of 10 years old will be forced to retire. In addition, Guangzhou has
suspended issuing of any new license to motor cycles in 1997; so by 2007 motor
cycles are expected to phased out from urban Guangzhou.
* As part of a national program, leaded gasoline has been banned since 1999. In another
clean fuel program in the city, 500 ppm sulfur diesel will soon replace 2000 ppm
sulfur diesel.
ESRI                            September, 2002                          27



Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
*  Fuel conversion program is partially implemented in which city buses and taxi are
converted to LPG or the dual fuel system. According to Guangzhou's experience,
conversion on the old buses sometime create vehicle operating program. The city now
requires all new buses and taxis on LPG and is still evaluating and piloting old
vehicle fuel system conversion.
*  For noise mitigation, about 11.7 km of noise barriers on both sides of the roads have
been erected along the ring road, much more than the 3.66 km planned from the
original EIA and EMP. However, some of the noise barriers are not installed as
originally designed and in some location there is no apparent sensitive receptor to
protect.
* As another noise mitigation, double glazed windows are about to be installed in key
sensitive receptors. Currently, as a pilot double glazed windows have been installed
Municipal Vocational School and the effectiveness of the double glazed windows for
noise attenuation is under evaluation.
Monitored air quality
The actual impacts, as well as the result of the mitigation measures, may be evaluated
through monitoring of ambient air quality and noise levels along the project area. GESRI
has conducted a specific monitoring program for air quality and noise on the 10 sensitive
receptors (four schools, three hospitals, an office, a hotel, and a zoo) along the inner ring
road from 1999 to 2002, which is also part of the project EMP. During the this period,
motor vehicle traffic near these sensitive receptors have increased significantly, by as
much as five times in 2002 (Guangzhou Normal College Primary School section) from
early 1999 prior to the construction of the ring road. The monitoring results are presented
in Tables 3-6 through 3-8. Also presented in these tables are 1999 data which represents
the baseline and predicted data by models during the project EA for year 2000 which is
the first year when the inner ring road open for traffic (officially opened on January 28,
2000).

*No forecast values
The above data show that except one location, NO2 increased significantly following the
opening of inner ring road. For CO, there were both increases and decreases, whereas
TSP was mostly decreased in 2000 compared with 1999. The improvement of TSP may
be partially attributed to the fact 1999 was the busy construction year for the inner ring
road and heavy construction activities resulted in the high TSP levels in the air.
The modeled results for 2000 for NOx and CO are also presented in the above tables for
reference. Any direct comparison between modeling results and actually measured can be
a complex matter as there are many factors affecting the actually monitored
concentrations, which may be or could be included in the 1997 model such as traffic
volume difference, various air pollution control programs, climate conditions at the time
of the measurement, etc. This comparison can only serve as a reference.
Table 3-6 shows that if a factor of 0.6 is used for NO2/NOx ratio, modeled NOx values
are significantly and consistently higher than the actually measured NO2 data. The
predicted CO values on the other hand are generally very close to the actually measured.
This indicates the model used (CALINE4) appears in general to be good for CO
prediction and tends to over estimate NO2.
In addition to the GESRI monitoring program which focused on the ring road area,
Guangzhou Environmental Monitoring Station (GEMS) conducted its routine air quality
monitoring in the city which shows the improvement of air quality on a city wide basis.

Table 3-9 is the average concentrations of air pollutants based on monitoring data from
six monitoring stations across the city, which represent the city wide ambient air quality.
Table 3-9 City Wide Ambient Air Quali  (mg/m3)
Pollutant                  1996                      2000

Lead                       0.50                      0.28
The above average concentrations of key air pollutants show that ambient air quality has
been improved in Guangzhou, from 1996 which was a year the ring roads and radial
roads had not been constructed to 2000 which was a year two ring roads and five out of
seven radial roads were in operation. Despite the fact that the motor vehicle fleet has
increased significantly, city wide air quality still improves at least partially because
benefits and positive impacts from the urban road developments which improve the
motor vehicle speeds. The improvement in air quality has been correctly forecasted by
the project EIA.
Monitored Noise
Noise levels at the selected sensitive receptors were also monitored following the opening
of the inner ring road. These are the same sensitive receptors monitored and modeled
during the project EA in 1996, although the actually monitoring sites may slightly
different in some of the locations.
Table 3-10 presents these prior inner ring road noise (1996), after inner ring road noise
(2000) and modeled noise. The second quarter noise monitoring data for 2000 are used as
the 1996 data were also obtained in the second quarter.

The modeled data (modeling year: 2000) are higher than the actually measured noise.
This is because the modeled noise did not consider the effect of noise barriers whereas in
ESRI                             September, 2002                           30

some of the sensitive receptors monitored, noise barriers are installed. In the above
sensitive receptors, Sheli hotel section of the inner ring road has no noise barrier, Hengfu
middle school, Normal College primary school, and No. 42 middle school sections have
noise barriers only on the upper deck but not on the lower deck. The remaining sections
have full noise barriers. The above table shows that the predicted noise levels are higher
than the actually measured for the same modeling/monitoring year, indicating at least
partially the effect of the noise barrier in noise attenuation and protection of the sensitive
receptors. Even for 2001 and 2002 when noise levels increased significantly due to the
substantial increase in traffic volumes in those sections, model predicted values are still
mostly higher than the actual monitored.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
Chapter 4 Construction Impact Assessment and Mitigation
4.1   Soil Erosion
The main cause for soil erosion during the construction phase is road base leveling
(excavation or backfill), which will damage the soil structure and surface vegetation. The
Guangfo road area is Pearl river plain criss-crossed by a network of waterways. It is
b'asically in urban area and except the Pearl river bank areas, the project area is virtually
all paved with asphalt or concrete. Therefore, the most likely area for soil erosion will be
foundation for elevated viaduct and interchanges. However excavation for foundations of
interchange and elevated viaduct columns will be limited to the columns area only. Large
area excavation will be avoided in this project. Therefore, soil erosion during
construction will be very limited.
However, there will be soil and vegetation disturbance, demolition, and limited
excavation which will result in slurry and surface runoff during rains. In particular, the
project area is intersected by several large and small waterways and surface runoff, once
formed, could be discharged into waterbodies very quickly, especially during the raining
season, especially heavy storms. To minimize the soil erosion, certain construction
activities such as excavation, leveling, etc. will be scheduled to avoid heavy raining
season as much as possible.
4.2   Community Impacts
During construction, a large amount of houses, offices and small workshops will be
demolished and land occupied. Together with the demolition, road side vegetation
including lawns and trees will be damaged or removed. This will affect the community
appearance and causing adverse visual impacts. In addition, construction machines,
materials storage, and construction waste will also have a negative visual impacts to the
communities in the project area.
Guangfo road will basically be built on elevated viaducts. For most part of Guangfo road,
the structural columns for elevated viaducts will be not be on the existing roads. However,
construction activities particularly increased traffic of from construction vehicles, storage
of construction materials and debris, loading/unloading, and structural beams lifting and
installation requiring truck-mounted cranes could occupy the existing road spaces and
worsening the already congested traffic on the roads. The most impacted roads will be
those on Datansha and near the Fangcun boulevard (Fangcun Dadaoxi).
To mitigate such impacts, construction activities will be well planned in consultation with
the local traffic police. The specific measures to be taken include the following:
* The most traffic affecting activities such as loading/unloading, beam lifting, and bulk
materials transportation will be scheduled for the time when the traffic on the roads

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
will be the lightest such as weekends, holidays mid-day around the noon time or
evenings.
* No traffic affecting construction activities will be allowed during the rush hours in the
morning and early evening;
* Public notices in the form of public boards at the construction sties will be provided
to inform the road users of the time, length and type of traffic affecting construction
activities and possible congestion.
* The public notice will also advise the road users of possible detoured roads identified
by the traffic police as alternative routes to avoid the congestion on the roads affected
by the project; -
* No construction materials and debris will be allowed to store and pile on the roads or
the pedestrian areas;
* Construction vehicles parking on the roahds will not be allowed unless it is absolutely
necessary. Such parking will be kept to the minimum and be removed as soon as it is
possible; and
* During the loading/unloading, viaduct structural lifting and installation, the
contractors will be requested to contact the traffic police to either have the police on
site or have their own staff on-site to help direct the traffic, to minimize the traffic
congestion and to ensure the safety.
4.3   Construction Noise Impact and Mitigation
4.3.1 Scope and standards of assessment
According to requirements of environmental impact assessment guidelines of
construction projects, the scope of noise impact assessment during construction is 50 m
from the construction site. Guangfo road is in the urban built-up area and many sensitive
receptors are located within this scope of assessment. The standards applied in the
assessment is "Construction Site Boundary Noise Standards" (GB12523-90) which are
presented in Table 4-1.
Table 4-1 Construction Site Boundary Noise Standards unit dB(A)

4.3.2 Construction Machinery Noise Intensity
Road construction will employ many different kinds of machinery. According to the
provisions of "Guangzhou Environment Noise Prevention" and "Notice on the Use of
Concrete Mixer along Urban Road Side and Designated Areas" of 1995, Guangfo road
construction site, except west navigation channel, will be not allowed to use piling
machines and concrete mixer, which will be located off site in a centralized location

away from noise sensitive areas. Based on the understanding of construction activities,
the main machinery to be used for Guangfo road construction will include excavator,
bulldozer, land leveler, pavement roller, dredger, pile drivers, power generator, concrete
mixing/transportation trucks, compactor, loader, and asphalt spreader. Table 4-2 lists the
noise levels from commonly used road construction machinery, as measured 5 m from
these sources.

4.3.3 Predicted Noise Levels and Impact
The noise of the project site can be represented by a point source and the noise as a
function of distance from the site is calculated by the following formula:
Lp = Lpo - 20 log r
rO
where        Lp--the prediction noise r meters from the source dB(A)
LpO--the reference noise ro meter from the source dB(A)
The prediction result is as following:

From Table 4-3, the daytime noise contribution of most individual pieces of equipment
will meet the day time construction site perimeter standards (70 dB(A) for day time and
55 dB(A) for night) if they are located at least 50 m from the construction site. But power
generator, crane and hammer would exceed the standards by 3-9 dB(A) at the 50 m from
the sources. If construction proceeds at night, the noise will exceed the limits
significantly, by 5 - 37 dB(A).
Within the 50 m of the noise sources which the road area in most of the cases, except
power generator and trucks which could be outside the road area, there are some sensitive
receptors including Jiaobiao and Hengjiao villages (about 50 households) and Jiaobiao
primary school. The first row of the houses from these sensitive receptors will be as close
as 10 m, where noise from all equipment will exceed the applicable standards, which are
55 to 60 dB(A) for day time and 50 to 55 dB(A) for the night. The impacts will be serious
as the predicted noise levels will significantly exceed the standards in these areas. At the
primary school, the construction noise will disrupt class activities and students
particularly those in the back of the classrooms will not be able to listen the class.
The construction period is one year so the impact period is also one year.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
4.3.3 Construction Noise Impact Mitigation
Construction noise cannot be avoided and will be generated whenever there are
construction activities. However, it should be mitigated according to relevant regulations
and requirements.
The construction boundary noise levels, as stipulated in the "Noise Limits at Construction
Site Boundary" GB 12523-90, will be enforced to minimize the impacts to the
surrounding area. According to Article 23 of "Gaungzhou Environment Noise Pollution
Prevention" of 1994, the operations of construction machinery used in the urban area
which cause noise pollution to the surrounding environment will be limited to 7:00-12:00
and 14:00-22:00, which is the period for a after lunch nap for most residents in
Guangzhou. Any operations extended beyond these timeframe as may be required by the
construction needs must apply and receive approval from relevant authority. This
requirement will be strictly enforced in the Guangfo road construction which will
basically eliminate the noise impacts at night, as well as the after lunch nap time, when
the standards exceedance would be worst.
According to the above assessment, Jiaobiao and Hengjiao villages and Jiaobiao primary
will be the most seriously impacted sensitive receptors during construction. In fact, the
later section of this report will show they are also the most significantly impacted by
noise and motor vehicle exhaust emissions during the operation period of Guangfo road.
Specific mitigation measures have been designed and will be taken at these locations for
reduce or avoid the long term impacts during operation phase. These include relocating
Jiaobiao primary school to an area not to be impacted by the project and install double-
glazed windows to the first row of the residential housing in Jiaobiao and Hengjiao
villages. To mitigate the noise impacts from construction activities, these measures will
be implemented at the beginning of the construction phase. For example, Jiaobiao
primary school will be relocate prior to the construction to completely avoid the impact.
Double-glazed windows at the mostly affected houses will also be installed at the
beginning of the construction for noise impact mitigation.
In addition, the following measures will be taken to further avoid or mitigate the
construction noise impacts:
*  Structural elements for bridges and elevated viaducts will be made in factories to
avoid on-site concrete mixing and compacting;
*  Low noise machinery will be selected where possible. High noise machinery such as
power generators will not be allowed to sue at the site; but if they are necessary for
construction work, noise temporary barriers or silencer will be installed;
*  Appropriately schedule the construction activities to avoid sensitive time and/or
sensitive locations where possible;
*  Noise and vibratory activities will be arranged to be completed within the quickest
time possible to reduce the impact length;
*  Construction trucks movement will be arranged to avoid residential areas where
possible;
ESRI                           September, 2002                          36



Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
According to relevant laws and regulations, if the construction noise still exceeds
applicable standards, especially night time construction, the contractors will
apologize and compensate the affected residents, students in classrooms and
dormitory, or others affected.
The past practices in Guangzhou urban road construction including inner ring road
construction show that night time construction are in-avoidable because the government
wishes to complete the construction in the shortest time possible in the busy and
congested urban areas. In fact, some activities such as materials transportation will likely
take place mostly at the,;night time to avoid the heavy traffic during the day time. Besides
the. general mitigation measures outlined above, the following mitigation measures will
be taken specifically for night time construction:
*  Public, particularly residents, in areas immediately adjacent to the construction sites
will be consulted prior to the start of night time construction, to alert them the noisy
activities at the night time, to explain the reasoning for night construction to obtain
public understanding, and to solicit specific public concerns and suggestions for
mitigation;
*  Public billboards will be erected at the construction sites, listing construction
activities, contact persons and telephone numbers for receiving public concerns.,
complaints, and suggestions on a constant basis;
*  The most noisy activities such as piling will not conducted at night where possible;
*  Temporary noise barriers may be erected at the most sensitive areas; Some of the
stationary noise machinery such as generators will be located away from sensitive
receptors and in enclosed structure for noise control;
*  Dedicated and trained staff from contractors and construction supervision will be on
site for traffic management and public safety during night time construction;
*  Proper signage, fencing and lighting will be used to divert the traffic, alert the motor
vehicle and pedestrian traffic of the safety hazards, particularly during the night
construction; and
*  Night time supervision by the environmental monitoring teams will be enhanced
including on-site noise measurement and prompt incidents response.
4.4   Air Impact and Mitigation During Construction
4.4.1 Air Impact Assessment
The main air emission sources during the construction phase include air borne dust from
excavation, truck and construction machinery movement, and construction materials
(cement, lime, sand and gravel, etc.) loading/unloading, transportation and storage; and
engine air emissions from machinery and trucks. Air-borne would affect the health of
construction workers and residents if inhaled, causing potentially respiratory systems
diseases as well as diseases caused potentially by pathogens carried by the air-borne dust.
The Roads Institute of MOC has monitored air-borne dust on Beijing-Tianjing-Tangshan
expressway while it was under construction. The TSP concentration 1-50 meters leeward
of the dust source was measured to be 5.093 mg/m3 (see Table 4-4), which exceeds Class
ESRI                            September, 2002                           37



Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
11 standard of GB 3095-1996. As the wind becomes stronger, the affected area will be
larger.
Table 4-4 Dust Concentrations near Construction Sites
Sites       Dust origins     Distance to site (m)     TSP (mg/m)
Constructio  Concrete pouring          50                   11.652
n road side  dust from vehicles       100                   19.694
150                   5.093
Clearly, a large area near the construction sites could potentially affected. Any sensitive
receptors, such as schools, residential housing, etc. within the influenced area will be
affected by the construction dust.
Air emission from pug mills (asphalt plants) can impacted their surrounding area air
quality. A previous study in Guangzhou indicates that the impacted area can be 500-800
m in leeward direction from the source, depending on the emission control facilities
applied at the pug mills, the atmospheric conditions such as wind speed and atmospheric
stability.
While the pug mill sites cannot be determined at the time of this assessment as the
contractors for the road pavement is yet to be determined through competitive bid during
project implementation, Guangzhou government has strict requirement on the location of
pug mills. Such facilities cannot be set up in the urban area according to relevant
Guangzhou by-laws. The potential impacts would be to suburb areas likely close to the
project site.
4.4.2 Air Emission Mitigation
The following measures will be taken during construction phase to mitigate the impact of
air-borne dust and other air emissions:
*  Excavation and demolition site will be water sprayed to maintain certain moisture
levels, loosed earth and dry backfill materials will also be water sprayed to prevent or
minimize dust from air borne; On dry days, water will be sprayed at least twice a day,
once in the morning and once in the afternoon right after the noon break.
*  Materials will be stored in appropriated places and will be compacted where possible;
for bulk materials which cannot be compacted well, water spray or cover will be
applied to minimize dust;
*  All construction waste will be promptly removed from the sites, daily if possible;
*  Earth and bulk materials transportation will be loaded in such a way they will not leak
during transportation and will be covered.
*  Before leaving construction sites, trucks wheels will be washed to clean the dirt
which would otherwise be carried away to the streets;
*  Strictly prohibit burning of construction waste at the sites; and
*  Asphalt and concrete mixing plants will be located in the area at least 500 m leeward
from the nearest residential or other sensitive receptors to ensure that the emission

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmiental Impact Assessment
from these facilities will impact the sensitive receptors. The asphalt plants will be
required to equipped with effective emission control facilities to meet the emission
standards in relevant state and provincial air emission standards. All these location
and emission requirements will be included in the tendering documents distributed to
the bidders for the pavement work and eventually in their contracts to become
contractual obligations for the contractors working the Guangfo road project.
4.5   Water Impact and Mitigation during Construction
4.5.1 Impact Assessment
The main source of wastewater during construction during the construction phase is from
contaminated surface runoff, construction wastewater and domestic wastewater from
construction camps. Surface runoff contain mainly suspended solids if contacted with
disturbed land or construction materials. Construction wastewater is primary slurry from
excavation and drilling, contact cooling water for certain machinery, wash water,
wastewater generated during construction machinery maintenance. These wastewater
could contain high suspended solid and oil and grease. Domestic wastewater includes
those from washrooms and cafeteria of construction camps. In addition, groundwater
during pumped out from foundation sites could also contain suspended solids. The main
impacts of these streams of wastewater will be the increase in the suspended solids in the
receiving water, such as two channels of Pearl River, particularly from in-water
construction activities for bridges or those which are near the water bodies.
In water construction activities for bridges pose potential risk of river contamination. In
particular, any oil leaking or spills from construction boats or other in-water construction
machinery would oil contamination of the river in the bridge and the surrounding areas.
Other safety accidents such as collision and fire could also result in serious pollution in
the bridge areas.
4.5.2 Water Impact Mitigation
The following measures will be taken during construction for water impact mitigation:
e. The contaminated surface runoff and construction wastewater will not be allowed to
discharge to the receiving water directly. Simple and temporary settling ponds will be
constructed near the site to intercept the contaminated runoff or wastewater and
remove suspended solid before allowing the wastewater to discharge;
*  Where possible, domestic wastewater from construction comps will be discharged to
municipal sanitary sewers. The construction sites will be in urban built area, well
served by the municipal utilities throughout the area. Connecting to the municipal
sewer should not limit locating construction camps for Guangfo road;
* Contractors, particularly those for in-water construction, will be trained for
construction safety, leak/spill prevention and emergency response procedures in case
of leaks and spills. In addition, environmental emergency response kits will be

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
prepared in the in-water construction sites, wvhich include perrns for contain spilled oil,
suction pumps, absorbent, etc., for use in emergency situations;
*  All waste oil from construction machinery will be collected and stored properly and
recycled via qualified vendors;
*  Slurry from bridge construction sites will be treated through settling and filtration
before discharge. Slurry drainage system, and temporary treatment facilities will be
built near the river banks. It is a standard practice to install temporary settling ponds
at the bridge site. Slurry from the bridge foundation will be pumped into the ponds
first to allow separation of solids from liquids through sedimentation, before the
supernatant will be allowed to discharge to the river. This practice will be re-enforced
as contractual requirements to the contractors.
*  Municipal and construction solid waste will be collected and disposed in designated
disposal sites and dumping in waterways of any waste will be strictly prohibited;
*  All river banks, dams and other flood control facilities will be well protected and any
construction at these places must be reviewed and approved by hydrology and flood
control authorities before construction.
4.6   Solid Waste Impact and Mitigation during Construction
4.6.1 Solid Waste Impact
A large amount of solid waste will be generated during construction, including
housing/structure demolition waste, excessive spoil soils from foundation excavation and
other construction waste. The storage of these waste on the construction site could
inference with traffic, pollute the environment, and cause visual impacts as well to the
communities around the construction sites. The impacts could be significant in Gouangfo
road as the construction site are mostly in busy urban area with heavy traffic and densely
situated industrial shops, residential houses and commercial facilities. Spills during waste-
transportation could also contaminated roads and neighborhoods along the transportation
routes.
The storage of the waste could contaminate surface runoff. Guangzhou has a 1700 mm
annual precipitation, often with heavy and frequent rain storm during the raining season.
The volume of surface runoff could be substantial, which after contact with the waste,
could carry high suspended solids, waste debris and potentially other contaminants. Such
surface runoff when drained to storm sewer or other municipal system, could clog the
sewer and drainage ditches. That which discharged to the surface water bodies directly
could result in surface water contamination.
There are many large and small waterways adjacent to or intersected by Guangfo road.
Inappropriate storage of construction waste could block the waterways reducing their
flood discharge capacity especially to small waterways.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
4.6.2 Solid Waste Impact Mitigation
The following measures will be taken during construction to mitigate the impacts of solid
waste to the environment:
*  Contractors will be requested to comply strictly with "Interim Management Guides
for Guangzhou Waste Spoil Storage and Disposal" and apply first to Guangzhou
Waste Spoil Storage and Disposal Department, receive appropriate approval and
permits and dispose the waste in designated areas;
*  "Guangzhou Urban Appearance and Environmental Sanitation Administration
Methods" stipulate that trucks loaded with bulk and loose materials and waste must
be loaded properly, covered and washed of their exterior before allowed on the roads.
Such trucks are not allowed to leak or cause air-borne of the materials loaded during
transportation and the transportation can only be made within the designated time
and along the designated routes.
*  Waste materials which can be used again will be recycled;
*  Temporary waste storage areas at the construction sites will be carefully selected to
avoid water front or causing traffic congestion, inconvenience to the pedestrians,
residents, and others in the nearby communities; and
*  Transportation of construction waste will avoid peak hours, avoid sensitive areas, and
will use approved routes.
4.7   Ecological Impacts and Mitigation
The Goangfo road construction will require removal of trees, lawns and some farmland
along the project road. A total of 500 Casuarina equsetifolia (about 56% of the total
number of this species of trees in this area), 100 metasequoia (77% of the total), and
about 90 other trees will be cut during construction. These are mostly mature trees up to
30 m tall, providing excellent urban vegetation and visual scenery. In total, the vegetated
land (bushes, lawns, trees, etc.) lost to the project will be 65,981 M2. In addition, a total of
91,951 flower farming land will also be occupied by the project during construction, most
which will be located in the Jiaobiao and Hengjiao village area toward the suburb.
Although the number of trees cut will be a small fraction of the total amount of trees and
other plants (less than 15% of the trees in the area) in the project area, they will be
visually significant, particularly in the area immediately adjacent to the Guangfo road
alignment and construction site.
The following measures will be taken to minimize the impacts:
a  Where possible, plants including trees, flowers, and bushes will be relocated to other
places or back to the project area following the completion of the construction,
instead cut and wasted;
*  The construction activities will be limited within the red line area and not to occupy
farmland;
ESR!                            September, 2002                          41



Guangfo Connecting Road Environmilental Impact Assessment
*  Buildings under demolition will be surrounded with nylon cloth or metal sheets or
wood boards to minimize the visual impacts to the communities as well as for dust
and safety control;
*  The project area will be landscaped  and planted following the construction. The
green area will be no less than 20% of the total project area. The landscaping plan
will result in a net increase in green space in the project area.
4.8   Public Access to the Parks
There are three parks closely located to the proposed project roads, providing the
communities recreation facilities and leisure spaces. The parks are used by the local
residents as well as visitors to the areas and the city.
Liwanhu park, located near the Zhongshan Balu interchange will not be affected as the
interchange has completed and in operation. The main gate to the park is east of the
interchange facing Zhongshan Balu (Zhongshan Lu) to the north and there are other gates
on the south and east.
The Youth park is also located near the completed Zhongshan Balu interchange and has
no fence. There will be no impact to access to Youth park.
The other park, Shuangqiao park is located in Datansha island and the proposed elevated
viaducts will pass both sides of the park. Shuangqiao park is in fact an open community
green area with no fence or gate. The construction of viaduct columns and Guangfo road
operation will not block the access to the park although the construction will create safety
concern and disturb part of the park areas.
As mitigation measure, the contractors will be required to place and stockpile materials
only in dedicated area. Unless absolutely necessary, the construction activities and
materials will not occupy park/green space. Any occupation of access paths to the park
will be strictly prohibited. Furthermore, the contractors will be required to provide over
head safety structures on pedestrian paths to the park area and safety signs will be erected
in key positions to alert the public of potential safety hazards. These requirements will be
included in the contractor's contract as a contractual obligations and enforced through
close supervision by the environmental monitoring team and construction supervision
companies.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
Chapter 5 Operation Impact Assessment and Mitigation
5.1   Air Quality Impact
5.1.1 Assessment Factors and Emission Intensity
Based on the emission characteristics of the Goangfo road project, existing ambient air
quality in the project area, and the requirements from "Environmental Impact Assessment
Guidelines for Road Construction Projects" JTJ 005-96, this EA selects CO and NO2 as
the air pollution factors.
The emission source intensity, as determined by the motor vehicle emission coefficient
for various types of motor vehicles which will use Guangfo road, is predicted by US EPA
model MOBILE5. As discussed in Section 2.11 of this report, the model following
modifications to fit the local conditions has been successfully applied in Guangzhou in
the previous Inner Ring Road project. The emission coefficients for major types of motor
vehicles in the motor vehicle fleet have been predicted for the control years of 2005, 2010
and 2020 for the above mentioned air quality pollution factors. The result of the modeling
is presented in Table 2-4.
Based on the emission coefficients, traffic volumes in different sections and different
directions of proposed Guangfo road, and driving distance within each sections, the total
emissions from motor vehicles on the Guangfo road in the control year can be calculated.
5.1.2 Climate Characteristics
Wind
Guangfo road project is located in west side of Guangzhou. Based on the 1992-1996
climate data for this district, the frequency of wind directions for each year and annual
average are presented in Table 5-1. These data show that north and southeast winds occur
wi'th the highest frequencies, at 9.4% and 9.5%, respectively. Calm (zero wind speed)
occurs very frequently at 29.3% in a year. Particularly in December and January when
calm condition frequency can reach up to 36.8%. Dominant wind directions change with
seasons. North wind (N) dominates in winter, followed by northwest (NW) and northeast
(NE). South East (SE) wind dominates in spring, south south east (SSE) in summer, and
north (N) wind in autumn. The frequency of wind directions based on 1992-1996 climate
data for the project area is presented in Table 5-1.

Table 5-1 shows wind frequencies at the ground levels, 300 m and 600 m from ground.
As shown in this table, the wind directions change clockwise with height. Such changes
help expand air pollutant dispersion area and reduce the ground level concentrations.
Wind speed is another key factors in air pollutant dispersion. Based on the 1994-96
climate data for winder (January) and summer (July), wind speeds at the project area are
shown in Table 5-2.
Table 5-2 Wind Speeds Frequency of Occurrence in Winter and Summer (%)

The above table shows that winter time is dominated with low speed winds at the project.
For example, the frequency of occurrence of winds with speeds less than 2.0 m/s is
76.7%. While in the summer, the highest frequency of wind speeds is 2.0-4.0 m/s at
44.3%, indicating air pollutant dispersion conditions are better in summer than in winter.
Temperature
Based on 30 years ground level temperature records, Guangzhou's annual average
temperature is 21.80C. The highest temperature occurs in July and August each year at
about 38.70C, while the lowest occurs in December or January at about 0C. The monthly
average temperatures in Guangzhou are all above 15C throughout the year with a
difference of about 10C between winter and summer months. The relatively smaller
seasonal temperature difference than Northern cities is because Guangzhou is located in
Pearl river basin with strong influence from South China Sea.

Temperature inversion, another important factor for air pollutant dispersion, can be
divided as ground level inversion, lower layer inversion and upper layer inversion. The
ground level inversion is mostly formed at night, caused by radiation changes, while the
upper lawyer inversion is caused by the large scale climate system, which occurs with
low regularity. Characteristics of temperature inversions are shown in Table 5-3.

Mixing height
The mixing height characterizes the vertical dispersion of air pollutant, which will be
dispersed within this height. According to Guangzhou area climate data, the annual
average mixing height is 693 m with the highest occurring in summer at 789 m and
lowest in spring at 579 m.
Pollution index
Pollution index is defined as wind direction frequency divided by average wind speed. It
indicates that the leeward direction air pollution will be proportional to the frequency of
occurrence of wind towards that direction and inverse proportional to wind speeds. Table
5-4 is pollution index for the Guangzhou area, based on wind data from Guangzhou
climate stations.

The above table shows that the highest ground level pollution index occurs at the north
(mostly in winter time), followed by southeast (mostly in summer time), indicating that
areas these directions in relation to air pollution sources are the most vulnerable to
pollution episodes.
Atmosphere stability
According to the recent year climate data, the atmosphere stability at the project area is
presented in Table 5-5.

The above table shows that the project area is dominated with the neutral D stability, at
annual frequency of occurrence of 65.%. The extremely instability (A and B) and weak
instability (C) occurs relatively less, collectively at 13.3%. This indicates that the project
area air is mostly in stable or neutral situation.
5.1.3 Air Quality Impact Assessment Prediction
Dispersion model
For a busy road, motor vehicle emissions may be regarded as a linear pollution source.
The dispersion of pollutants and pollutant concentration distribution from such a source
may be predicted with Gauss model in the statistics theory. Since 1970's, the U.S. and
other countries have developed a series theoretical models for this purpose such as the
CALINE series, HIWAY series and ROADWAY series. Based on the fact the project
area of Guangfo road is relatively flat within the urban built up area, liner model
CALINE4 is applied to predict motor vehicle emissions (CO and NO2) dispersion. In the
Guangzhou inner ring road project, CALINE4 was successfully used during the impact
assessment and proven to be fairly accurate for CO although it tends to over estimate
NO2 as discussed in Section 3.6.
The model is defined by the following formula:
N                              6
C = -;L EZ{ - [exp(<-2') ) + exp( (z/'l) )] x E(WT, x Q, x PD,,)}

Where:
C: pollutant concentrations at coordinators (x,y,z) in leeward direction, mg/m3;

N: the total number of linear sources.

CALINE4 uses initial mixing to simulate the effect of motor vehicle movement to motor
vehicle emission dispersion. The initial mixing zone is the road width plus 3 m on each
side. The added width represents the influence of tail tracks from moving vehicles to
horizontal dispersion. Within this initial mixing zone, the dispersion will be primarily
driven by mechanical vortex resulting from moving vehicles and thermal vortex of from
the residual heat of motor vehicle emissions. It can be assumed that motor vehicle
emissions are uniformly mixed within the initial mixing zone.
The height of the initial mixing zone depends on the retention time of air emission
pollutants within the initial mixing zone (T):
T=2u sWn      (0>450)
T =   w1xtn5       (0<45 )
2uxsin4(545
Where:
W: width of the mixing zone,
u: wind speed at the ground level;
0: angle between the road and the wind direction;
The initial mixing zone height can be determined by:
azo (m) = 1.5 + 0.1 x T
Dispersion Coefficient
CALINE4 adopts the modified Pasquill-Smith (P-S) vertical air dispersion coefficient as
the Gauss model dispersion coefficients. Within the initial mixing zone, vertical
dispersion coefficient equals to initial mixing zone height azo. Beyond the initial mixing
zone, vertical dispersion coefficient is estimated with the following formula:
af =Cr +aOxb
Where:
X: distance in the leeward direction;

b: constant determined by Pasquill-Smith vertical dispersion curve.
CALINE4 uses Draxler method to estimate the horizontal dispersion:
Jy = 0JeXf (IT)
Where:
cye: is standard deviation in the horizontal direction; and
f: is the general function which takes the following form:
1
f =      I
I +0.9(CTo)
Where:
T = x is dispersion time
To is the dispersion time when f=1.0, in Draxler method, To is proportional to
time t,
Because the testing area for the P-S dispersion coefficient is relatively open and
surrounded by trees and lawns, the roughness of the land surface, and thus the a and b
values of the coefficient, are relatively small. In a research project "Study on dynamic
regularity and mitigation methods for Guangzhou motor vehicle emissions", dispersion
coefficient values were experimentally determined in Guangzhou old city and suburb as
the measured dispersion coefficients (Table 5-6). Compared with the theoretical P-S
coefficient, the measured values in Guangzhou are higher, largely consistent with the
location conditions characterized with low latitude, close to the sea and high ground
roughness. When CALINE4 is used for this project, P-S dispersion coefficients are
modified by taking one half level to one level towards the instability when selecting
atmosphere stability.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
Prediction Scope
The CALINE4 modeling is used f6r NO2 and CO concentration distributions in areas of
leeward directions from Guangfo road at peak hours for the control years of 2005, 2010
and 2020. The modeling will cover the entire Guangfo road as one section and also the
Fangcun interchange as a typical interchange.
According to requirements for air quality impact assessment scope, the prediction area
will start from the edge of the motor vehicle lanes and extends horizontally to 5 m
(equivalent to non-motor vehicle lanes), 10 m (pedestrian lanes), 25 m, 50 m, '100 m, 150
m, 200 m, and 300 m, at a height of 1.2 m from the ground. The motor emission
concentrations at these points are predicted using the model.
Climate conditions used
Based on the climate data, as analyzed in the above section, the following climate
conditions are assumed and used in the modeling:
*  At the yearly prevailing wind direction (N), wind speed is 1.9 m/s and atmosphere
stability is D;
*  At the second prevailing wind direction (SE), wind speed is 1.9 m/s and atmosphere
stability is D;
* For the worst case conditions, wind speed is 1.0 m/s and atmosphere stability is E,
reflecting the stable and calm conditions often occurring in Guangzhou. It is
considered worst case conditions as they are not favorable to dispersion of pollutants
from motor vehicle emissions and the highest ground level pollutant concentrations
may be found on both sides of the roads.
Modeling results and assessment
The modeling results for Guangfo road for CO and NO2 for near, medium and long terms
are presented in Table 5-7. Note, the data in Table 5-7 is for one section (Zhongshan Balu
interchange to Pearl river east bridge) which has the highest predicted air pollutant
concentrations according to the model. This is consistent with the traffic volume
prediction which shows that this section will have the highest traffic volume on Guangfo
road.
The trends such as short, mid and long terms and south and north sides of the road are
very similar for other sections of the road. The complete modeling results are presented
in Appendix I.

The modeling results, as shown in Table 5-7, indicate that CO does not seem to be a
concern. All predicted CO concentrations, even those at the closest distance (5-10 m
range) from the motor vehicle lanes of Guangfo road, under the worse case climate
conditions (wind speed of I m/s and atmosphere stability of E), will meet the applicable
ambient air quality standard designated for the project area (Class 11 at 10 mg/mr3).
NO2 on the other hand, will exceed the applicable standard (Class 11 at 0.24 mg/m3),
causing significant impacts to these areas. The impacted area (area where the predicted
concentrations exceed the standard) depend primarily on the climate conditions and
distance from the motor vehicle lanes. At the south side of the road, NO2concentrations
are predicted to exceed the standard for an area up to 10 m from the motor vehicle lanes
for the short term (2005) under the normal climate conditions (the prevailing north wind
at 1.9 m/s and neutral atmosphere stability D). Under the worse case climate conditions,
the significantly impacted area will be up to 50 m from the motor vehicle lanes within
which there are many sensitive receptors.
The impacts to the ambient air quality will be increased somewhat for the mid and long
terms, because mainly the expected increase in the motor vehiicle traffic on the project
road, which will be so high it will offset more stringent emission standards for new
vehicles according to relevant state and provincial laws and regulationis. 'Ilhc new

emission standards for future motor vehicles will however slow the increase in the
ambient air pollutanit concentrations. Thie impacted areas (wvhere the predicted
concentrations will exceed applicable standards) for both the/mid and long term (2010
and 2020, respectively) will be up" to 10-25 m under normal conditions and 50-250 m
under the worst case conditions, although the higher concentrations for the longer term
than those for the mid term due to the further increase in traffic volume. As the prevailing
wind direction in Guangzhou is from the north, the impact to the south side is expected to
occur more frequently.
The situation will be very similar for the north side of Guangfo road, which is influenced
the most by the motor vehicle emissions originated from the road during the southeast
wind. The NO2 impacted area where NO2 exceed applicable standards will be 25 m under
normal conditions (SE wind at 1.9 m/s) and 100 m under worst case climate conditions
for the short term. This will be reduced to about 25-50 m under normal conditions and
100-250 m under the worse case conditions for the mid and long terms.
It is noted that the highest concentration is predicted not for the closest distance. They
usually occur 10 to 50 m from the road. This is because pollution sources are on elevated
viaducts while the predicted concentrations are for ground level. It will take some
distance for the pollutants to reach the ground.
The air pollutants dispersion profile for other sections of Guangfo road is similar to that
described above, as shown by the data presented in Appendix 1. The concentrations for
other sections will be, however, lower than those presented above, due to the differences
in traffic volume and site conditions
Since multiple layer interchanges have high concentrations of traffic within a relatively
small area, motor vehicle emissions can be different from the road itself. Therefore one
interchange is selected (Fangcun Interchange) to simulate the emission dispersion using
the model. The modeling results are presented in Table 5-8.

In general, pollutant concentrations around the interchange will be similar to those on
both sides of the road. Other general patterns of the pollutant concentrations predicted for
the road sides are also predicted for the interchange, such as compliance of CO
concentrations with the standard for CO, but not always for NO2, pollutant concentrations
will decrease over the mid and long terms as more stringent emission requirements will
be enforced for motor vehicles over time, etc. However, the highest concentrations
around the interchange is not necessarily at the locations nearest to the interchagne but
some distance away. For example, the above table shows that in short term, the highest
concentrations for both CO and NO2 will occur at 50 m from the interchange, instead of 5
m on the south side of the interchange while the highest concentrations will occur at 10 mn
the north side. This is mainly because that the interchange is quite high, and so will be the
pollutant sources from motor vehicles driving on the interchange. For the pollutants
emitted from the vehicles to touch the ground, it may take some distance. For the short
terms, the predicted concentrations show that the maximum ground level concentrations
near the interchange is higher than those near the straight road. However, buildings
around the interchange is much farther away from the pollutant sources than those near
the road.
One of the major impacts of the motor vehicle emissions is those to humnani hcaltlh. Withil
the impacted areas, there are residential areas and schools. Air pollutant concenltrations at

5.1.4 Air Pollution Mitigation
During the implementation of the World Bank financed Guangzhou inner ring road
project, a motor vehicle emission control strategy (MVECS) has been developed in
Guangzhou, involving numerous measures and programs to reduce and control the
emissions. At the time this EA was prepared, many of the measures and programs are
beirig implemented such as clean fuels and limited inspection and maintenance program,
while others are in the preparation stage for implementation such as a motor vehicle
emission monitoring and research center. Although no data are available to firmly link
the  inner  ring  road  project and   the  various  mitigation  air quality  impact
measures/programs, the ambient air quality in Guangzhou has been improved over the

last two years siice the inner- ring road has been In operation, compared with the previous

Together with the inner ring road, Guangfo road is part of the fast urban transport road
network. Most of the air quality mitigation measures, by nature, require integrated effort
city  wide  whichi involves multiple government agencies and  non-government
organizations. During the operation stage, Guangfo road will participate In and become
part of the city wide MVECS to mitigate the adverse impacts to the surrounding areas,
particularly the 200 m areas on both sides of the road. These mitigation
measures/programs which are currently implemented or to be implemented in Guangzhou
are:
Polllution sources r elated miligation measures
The air pollution source in this project is motor vehicles on the road. Motor vehicles are
mobile sources and are not limited to this road. Motor vehicle emissions control is a city
wide or region wide systematic work. The mitigation measures for air pollution source
control is closely related to the motor vehicles emission control strategies and programs
of Guangzhou city, Guangdong province and the State. There are state and provincial
programs for motor vehicles with a target to reduce emissions. In addition, the city of
Guangzhou is developing a Motor Vehicle Emission Control Strategy (MVECS) through
the World Bank finaniced Guangzhou Ring Road project. The Guangfo road project will
be integrated with the MVECS and adopt the measures in the state, provincial and
munLicipal programs. ilcluding:
*  Setting up motor vehicle emission standards and ban the motor vehicles which exceed
the standards. In 1995, China released "Light Motor Vehicle Pollutant Emission
Stadnards (GBPBI-1999)", which is based on the emission standards of Europe
Council of Economics (ECE). The standards are equivalent to about 50-70% of the
ECE's motor vehicle emission limits in the 1970's. Guangzhou has road side and
annual inspection programs. Guangfo project will support such programs and ban
motor vehicles which exceed the emission standards. In fact, Guangzhou's air quality
is seriously affected by the increasing motor vehicle emissions with increasing motor
vehicle fleet size which is expected to continue expanding quickly in the coming
years. The fundamental measure to control the total emission volumes and thus to
maintain and improve air quality, is to apply more stringent standards and further
reduce emissions from lidividual vehicles. Guangzhou will gradually adopt more
stringent standards for new veehicles whicih will help mitigate the impacts on the
Guangfo road area.
*  Continue implement and upgrade the inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs in
Guangzhou. Practical experience has shown that the amount of exhaust eniissions is
largely dependent upoIn the state of tuning of the motor vehicle engines. I-ligh levels
of emissions from  vehicles can be largely attributed to poor mainteniance and
ineffective repairs. Effective inspcction and maintenance programs will be critical to
encourage vehicle operators to properly maintain their vehicles, as well as
discouraging unauthorized tampering with the engine settings and the unauthorized

removal of catalytic converters after conversion to unleaded petroleum. The current
l/M exhaust test program is, an idle test, whiich although adequate for older vehicles,
hias been shown to be insufficient with more modern vehicles, and for more stringent
emission standards. With implementation of more stringent emission standards and
exhaust controls, it becomes imperative to improve the existing l/M programs to
include a loaded transient driving cycle test as well as a test of the fuel evaporation
control system.
* The installation of catalytic converters is necessary to control automotive pollution;
however their introduction must be preceded or accompanied by the distribution of
unleaded gasoline. Once this is achieved, emissions may be significantly reduced if
vehicles are properly maintained and operated. The environmental component,
Guangzhou City Center Transport Project, proposed five strategies for motor vehicle
pollution control:
- Introduction of unleaded fuel
- Catalytic converters
- Improvements to existing I/M program
- I/M demonstration projects
- Automatic monitoring stations
*  The main source suspended particulate in the air from roads are the dust on the road
surface. Control the dust on the roads will result in reduction in dust source intensity.
To achieve such a control, Guangfo road will be water sprayed/washed daily by local

Studies have showed distance between the air emission sources and receptors would
directly affect pollution concentrations at the receptors. Therefore, future plans for
buildings along Guangfo road should consider increasing distance to the road, provide
greater space for dilution and dispersion, and thus reduce pollutant concentrations at the
receptors. The planning department should not approve any residential housing within
200 m from the road. Instead, the area may be used for shopping malls, office building,
warehouses and other enclosed structures. The first row of building should retreat as
much as possible to avoided the most impacted area. Particularly in areas near
interchanges, the impacted area is larger and the peak air pollutant concentrations occur
in the 50-150 m and there will be more open space near the interchanges.
Trees and vegetation have been proven to be able to intercept air dust, and to some extent,
clean up other air pollutants. The plants along both sides of Guangfo road and in the open
space of the interchanges will help mitigate impacts on air quality.
Clean Fuels
A proven fleet-wide strategy to reduce the negative environmental and health impacts of
emissions from vehicles is the improvement in fuel quality. With respect to diesel fuel,
the particulate or smoke emissions largely comprise sulphur compounds. Therefore
reducing the sulfur content will contribute to a decrease in the amounl of particulate

emitted from diesel engines, while also allowing the introduction of more stringent
standaids for diesel enginies and more modern engine techniologies. Altcrnate fuels are
also a means of reducing the negative environmental impact of vehiicle emissions. These
fuels, such as liquefied propane and compressed natural gas (CNG), comprise
hydrocarbons which have a much lower toxicity than those of gasoline. Also, the engines
may emit lower emissions of CO and NOx, if they are properly adjusted to take full
advantage of the fuel. As an example, CNG fueled vehicles have the potential to emit
97% less CO, 72% less HC, and 39% less NOR, than conventional gasoline engines.
Sensitive Facility Siting/Planning
T o prevent the impact of excessive levels of HC and NOx, the areas within 100 m of the
roadway will not be approved for any new residential housing. Instead, these areas may
be assigned uses such as warehouses, shopping arcades, office buildings and other
enclosed structures. More open space will be created and well landscaped near the
interchanges.
5.2   Noise Impacts
The Guangfo road area will mostly be in urban built up area. Towards the outer ring road
area, it becomes urban/suburb joint area with some agricultural land. Thlere are noise
sensitive receptors suchi as schools and urban and rural residential housinlg, particularly
those on the first row facing the road, which will be the focus of noise impact assessmenit.
As discussed before, Guangzhou zoninig divides the project influenced arca into Class If
(mixed commercial and residential) and Class IV (trunk road or railway side) noise zones.
However, this EA will apply the more stringent Class 11 standard to all sensitive receptors
including schools and residential housing even though they may be located in Class IV
zones to better protect these facilities.
5.2.1 Noise Prediction Modeling and Model Coefficients/Factors
Guangfo road will be built mostly on elevated viaduct including several multi-layer
interchanges, adjacent to existing surface road and a railway. A good portion of the
project will be built on two parallel viaduct on both sides of the railway tracks. Such
deign and configurations will form complex noise fields in the project area. T he noise
prediction in this EA made the followling simplified assumptions:
e  All motor vehicles on Guangfo road will be assumed to move in a same, uniform
speed;
*  Each section or lane will have the same amount of traffic volume with the same
motor vehicle fleet composition;
e  The future traffic will be those projected by feasibility and presented in Table ----.-
and
*  Noise prediction will be made for year 2010 and 2020 to represent the noise levels in
the medium to long terms.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessmenit
This EA uses U.S. Federal Highway Association's (Fl-IWA) model as a basis for noise
level prediction, which has been modified based on the road and other conditions in
China. This model, together with the modifications has been successfully applied in the
EA for the World Bank financed Guangzhou Inner Ring Road project and proven to be
suitable and appropriate.
The FHWA model is defined as:
Leq, = Leo, +I01ogV   +10og         +AS) -3
where:
Leq, hourly noise level equivalent at r generated by type i vehicle, dB(A Of>>
Leo, -- reference noise level average at 15 m of type i vehicle, dB(A);
N,-- traffic volume of type i vehicles, vehicle/hr.;
, -average speed of type i vehicle, km/hr., 60 km/hr. on Guangfo road;
T--observation time, T= I hr.;
r --vertical distance of observation point to road center line, m.;
a--absorption factor of ground surface between observation point and road center
line, zero in the Guangfor road project as the ground is basically paved;
AS--correction for road structure and surroundings, dB(A), discussed below;
i --vehicle type, i =1, 2, 3, 4, i.e. heavy-duty, medium-duty, light-duty.
The aggregate of noise levels at a receptor in assessment, generated by all types of
vehicles on a single lane, is expressed as:
Leqj = l0IOg  IlOOILeq,
The aggregate of noise levels at a receptor in assessment, generated by all type of
vehicles on multiple lanes, is expressed as:
Leql   = lOlogZ1OOILcLq
J=I
where m= the total number of motor vehicle lanes
Viaduct Only Sound Field
For surface (ground) level road, the noise field may be predicted using the above model.
But the situation is more complex when viaduct is involved. For a clear understanding of
the: sound field of a viaduct in operation, a geometrical method is used to describe the
sound field on both sides of the roadway, as shown the following drawing.

Grouind Sound Field under Viaduct
The Sound field of a ground roadway under viaduct becomes quite complicated due to
viaduct reflection which can be taken as sound emitted at mirror source. In the following
drawving, AB is the shield height hi; AO' is the half width of viaduct d,; 00' is the
viaduct surface height, ho; S is the sound source at hleight 115; S" is the primary image of
source S to the ground; S" and S"" are primary images of source S and S' to the viaduct;
longitudinal coordinates of S" and S"" (I's-2nho) and (-h,-2ho), image source coordinates
after n'li reflection of sources S and S' to viaduct (h,-2110) and (01,2nh0o) It can be seen
from the figure that sound field generated by source on the viaduct is divided into three
sound fields, field #1, the aggregate direct sound of S and S'; field #2, the aggregate of
direct sound from source S and diffractive sound from source S'; and field #3, the
aggregate diffractive sound from source S and S'.
Traffic volume and speed on the viaduct are higher at ground level noise sources on the
viaduct are correspondingly louder. This assessment assumes that sound energy of field
#3 is only from traffic on the viaduct; sound energy of field #2 from single direct
reflection of source S; and field #I from direct sound energy of sources S and S'. As such,
there are three cases:
*  y>=YO', sound field #3-the aggregate sound energy Leq, will be
Leq,=o
*  Y0<y'14Yo', sound field #2, the aggregate sound energy Leq2 will be:

If additional weighting is given to multiple image sources, i.e., multiple reflections
between viaduct bottom and the ground, the sound field would become very complicated.
Experiments conducted by Mr. Akinori Fukushima and Mr. Dazon Kohishi of Japan
showed that traffic noise levels on a ground-level roadway with viaduct are higher than a
roadway without a viaduct. Thle difference is the multiple reflection by the viaduct
bottom. IThe incremenit is bigger directly under the viaduct thani at the roadside areas. For
this reason the calculated values are increased by 2 - 3 dB(A) for points directly uLider the
viaduct.
Roadway wvith viaduct
For the roadway with a viaduct, traffic noise level at any point is the aggregate of sound
from ground traffic and the traffic on the viaduct. Accordingly, it is necessary to calculate
the sound levels contributed by both separately, then combine them for the aggregate.
Roadway wvith viaduct and ramps
TIhere are 5 locations on Guangfo road with ramps with a design speed ranging Irom 25 -
30 km/h and slope of 7%. The sound field of the ramps is complicated because they have
a number of combinations of height, traffic flow and speed. Theoretically the noise levels
can be calculated using previous equations, assuming the traffic volume is 1/20 or 1/21 of
the trunk Guangfo and the speed is much lower than 60 km/h. By calculation, noise
source levels of individual vehicles on ramps is 9 - 10.5 dB(A) lower than on trunk IRR,
correction for traffic volume on ramps I - 10 dB(A) lower, and correction for ramilp slope,
0 dB(A). In total the noise level from ramps is at least 10 dB(A) lower thanl trunk
Guangfo. Using the sound aggregation theory, sound energy from ramps can be neglected
for aggregation and its contributioll to overall traffic noise level assumed to he 0 dB(A).
Interchanges
ESRI                             September, 2002                           60



Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
Large size interclhanges are usually composed of multiple layers of viaducts, ground-
level roadway and ramps, and have cornplex patterns of sound fields. Theoretically the
noise from each component of the interchange can be calculated and then combined using
the previous equations. In practice, it is too hard to do it this way because most
parameters for the interchange have not been determined. Using another method the
interchange can be taken as a column with the noise source at various heights and the
sane noise level at the same height. Using the by sound aggregation principle, the
increment for sound aggregation of two trunk roads is 3 dB(A).
5.2.2 Model Coefficients Determination
Trajfic volume and speed
According to relevant traffic volume forecast and design specifications, the traffic
volume has been predicted, as presented in Table 24. As the noise will be predicted for
both day and night time periods, the daily traffic volume is divided into day time traffic
(16 hrs.) and night time traffic (8 hrs.) which will take 87% and 13% of the daily traffic
respectively. The traffic for peak hours are further derived for noise imodeling whicil
together with daily and night time traffic in the two prediction years are presented in
Table 5-10.

Theory and experiments results show that the friction caused by rough road surface and
motor vehicle tires has little influenice on the total noise level from large vehicles. For
smaller vehicle the noise level equivalent shouild be modified according to the road
surface materials with higlher modifications for rougher surface. However, as the asphalt
road, which is the design for Guangfo road, has very smooth surface, it has need to
modify the noise level.

As small vehicles have little change in noise levels when driving on dilferent slopes of
roads, there will be no modificationi for noise levcls for small vehicles during modeling.
Medium and large vehicles will generate larger torque in order to go uphill, and thus
higher noise than driving on flat road. The incremental increase in noise while driving
uphill is shown in Table 5-11.

factor will be 2 for the sloped section of the road.

First rol', building modification factor
The first row of buildings on bothi sides of a road, particularly multiple stories or high risc
buildings would be good noise barriers to the buildings on the second row from the road
and beyond. Different buildings, heights and configurations would have different effect
in noise attenuation to buildings in the back. The determination of this effect is very
complex but in this project the buildings on the first row from Guangfo road will be
considered as giant noise barriers, which will significantly reduce the noise level to the
buildings directly behind them.
5.2.3 Noise Prediction Results
Using the above model, coefficients and modification factors, noise level generated from
Guangfo road is simulated for years 2005, 2010 and 2020. The results, shown as noisc
levels at the height of 1.5 m from the ground in different distances in an open area
(without considerations of the effect of first row buildings to the area behind them) from
the red lines of Guangfo road are presented in Table 5-12.

The noise modeling results show that starting from 2005, open areas wvithinl 100 m fiom
the red line of Guangfo road (all three sections) will all exceed the Category IV standard
at day time. Areas up to 200 m exceed the Category IT standards. The iilpacts will be
particularly significant at night: the open areas of 200 m from the red line will all exceed
Category IV. The noise impacts of the road will further increase over timie with
increasing traffic volume on Guangfo road. The modeling results show that by 2020, the
day time noise will increase from 2005 level by approximately I to 2.5 dB(A) whiile the
night time noise will increase by about 0.4 to 2 dB(A). The noise levels fi-om the innier-
ring road to FangcuLn interchange are very slimilar but those in the Fangcun interchianige to

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Asscssieiit
The above noise modeling results are for open areas. The areas on surrounding the
interchianiges includilng the two parks near Zhongshian Balu intercilange and the
agricultural land towards the outer ring road have a lot of open space, but il other
sections of Guangfo road, there .are many buildings on both sides of the road. The above
predicted noise levels will therefore be applicable only to the first row of the buildings
which will then serve as very effective noise barriers to the buildings behind them.
The noise impacts will in fact be compounded by the presence in the middle of the two
Guangfo roads a railway line. The Guangsan railway is built on a 3 m high railway base,
has no fence and is the main existing noise source for the Datansha to Fangcun section.
The existing noise levels (noise level equivalent) at the sensitive receptors along the side
are ranged from 55.2 dB(A) (day time) and 54.7 dB(A) (night time) for the New World
residential development about 120 m away to about 66.9 dB(A) (day time) and 65.1
dB(A) (night time) at Jiaobiao primary school approximately 10 m from the railway. The
instantaneous noise levels at trains passing, however can be as high as 87 dB(A) or even
91 dB(A) when trains whistle at the Jiaobiao primary school location.
The train traffic volume will increase over time. Based on the current estimate, the
combine passenger and cargo trains will increase from 47 per day (including 13 at night
time) in 1998 to 58 (including 20 at night) by 2010 and further to 65 (including 22 at
nighit) by 2020. The train speeds will reach up to 100 km/hr. by 2010 and 120 km/hr. by
2020. Using noise modeling and above estimates, it can be predicted that noise levels
fi-om the railway, as noise level equivalent, will increase by about 0.2-0.9 dB(A) for day
tine and by 0.2-1.3 dB(A) for night time by 2010 and by 2.1-3.1 dB(A) for day time and
1.9-2.3 dB(A) at night by 2020 from the predicted 2005 levels at the same sensitive
receptors.
When Guangfo road is completed and opens to traffic, the noise levels at the sensitive
receptors will be aggregate of both sources: motor vehicles on the road and train on the
railway line. The aggregate can be calculated by:
Leq  l 0log(10' I.eq, + 10 I Leq)
Where:
Leq,-motor vehicle noise
Leq,. train noise
Combining the impacts of both Guangfo road and the Guangsan railway line, the
predicted noise at the sensitive receptors along the road alignment is presented in Table
5-13.

Among these sensitive receptors, Jiaobiao village, Jiaobiao village Hengjiao village and
Li's Family Shrine are located within 40 m to the proposed road from its closest point.
The two villages have about 2000 households and 8000 population. Within the most
sensitive area (the 30 In to the road), there are about 30 households who wvill be impacted
the most. The above table indicates that over the long term (2010-2020), the noise levels
equivalent from the both railway and Guangfo road sources will exceed the Category 11
standards (60 dB(A) for day time and 50 dB(A) for night) which are the applicable
standards for residential areas, by as much as 19.1 dB(A) for day time and 26.4 dB(A) for
night. The daily life of the 30 households Would be seriously affected by the noise
includinig effects to their sleep at night.
Jiaobiao primary school has 760 teachers and students in two four stories buildings,
roughly perpendicular to the proposed road. Guanigfo road will in fact cut into the campus,
requirinig demolition part of one school building and occupying part of the school yard.
Thle noise will be very high, up to 78.1-79.1 dB(A) during the day whiicih is 23.1-24.1
dB(A) above the applicable Category I standards (55 dB(A) for day time and 45 dB(A)
for fight). At these nloise levels, many of the students in this school would not be able to
hear their teachers and classes cannot be conducted properly. While the night time noise
is also very high, there will be no activities or any student in the school at night and thus
no night time impacts.
The Li's Family Shrine is a traditional place for the Li's in the region to gather on
important family celebrations, dates and ceremonies and to worship their ancestors. There
is no body living in the Shrine although diuring the day time there are elderly there to chat,
play cards and meet with eacli otlier. The Li's F7amily Shrine is a stone structifral building
with thick walls and hlas no windows on the side facing the road and railwvay (the south
side). Therefore the noise impacts to activities wvithin the Shrine is expected to be limited.
Otller senlsitive receptors are located beyond the 40 In area, from 85 (Shuangqiao Middle
School) to 120 in (New World Residence). The current noise levels at schools are slightly
highier than the Category I staiidards bLIt the residential area noise can all meet tile
applicable Category 11 standar-ds. However. the above table shows that once Guanigfo
road is completed, noise level equivalent at schools will exceed the standal-ds by 15-16
dB(A) while thlat will exceed the standards by 9.8 dB(A) at day tinme and up to 18.4 dB(A)

at nighit at the residential area and by 16.4 dB(A) at the school (day time only). The most
seriously impacted people will be those with their classrooms arid living/bed rooms
directly facinig the project road. While Jiangzhiou primary school is even closcr (65 rn) to
the proposed road, it is located behind a large commercial.building. TI'hc noise levels at
this school is expected to be within the standard as the building can effectively reduce
noise level by 15-25 dB(A).
Vibration
In order to forecast the level of vibration from Guangfo road, a section of inner ring road
with similar design (also on elevated viaduct) and traffic volume (currently 7579 mixed
vehicles per day) with Guangfo road was selected for a real life vibration measurements.
T he results are shown in Table 5-14.
Table 5-14 Measured Vibration from a Similar Viaduct on Inner Ring Road (dB)

50                                     59.2
As a similar road, the vibration levels at Guangfo road are expected in the similar range
as shiowin in the above table. Compared with the applicable standard at 75 dB, the
expected vibration due to Guangfo road operationi will be well below the standard.
Furthermore, since the inner ring road is in operation, the has been no complains received
from the public on vibration. This further confirms that conclusions that the elevated
viaduct operations at the forecasted traffic volume will not have significant impacts to the
surrounding areas.
5.2.5 Noise Mitigation
The noise standards are established with the consideration of noise impacts on human
health (effects on headaches, annoyance, cardiovascular diseases, etc.) and life activities
(sleeping, reading, listening, etc.), and specially sensitive activities (conducting classes,
concentration on learning, patients recovery, etc.). Noise levels in areas where different
activities are located should meet the applicable standards to protect the environmental
quality required for the activities. As the noise levels of Guangfo road is predicted to
exceed the standards, mitigation measures are needed to reduce or control the noise levels
to meet with the standards.
In addition to the understanding of the general features of major mitigation measures, the
EA team has included the lessens learnt from noise mitigation measures in the inner ring
road project into considerations in designing noise mitigation measures for Guanigfo road.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmenital Impact Assessment
Review of the mitigation measures In the Inner Ring Road project
The World Bank financed inner ring road project has been completed and operational
since January 2000 and noise mitigation measures have been gradually implemented
along the ring road. The original Environmental Action Plan (EAP) requires installation
of 3.6 km of noise in 6 sections, which have been completed. In fact, the actual noise
barrier length is about 6.5 km, much more than the original requirements. The additional
noise barrier has been installed in response to the strong public reaction on the increased
noise from the inner ring road. The other important noise mitigation measure, installation
of double glazed windows in sensitive receptors, has been gradually implemented.
A study was conducted in March 2002 to monitor the effectiveness of the noise
mitigationi measures. Six locations were selected to determine the noise reduction effect
of noise barrier and two were selected for double glazed windows.
In general, the noise barriers are most effective to three to six floors of the buildings
targeted for protection, with average noise reduction of about 2 to 4.7 dB(A). Higher
floors are generally beyond the noise barrier protected area and have no measurable noise
reduction. The lower floors on the other hand, are mostly impacted by the noise from the
ground level traffic for whlicIh the noise barriers mounted on the elevated viaduct have no
effect.
Double glazed windows have been installed in a hospital and a school. The monitoring
program at the two locations show that noise can be reduced by 26-27 dB(A) at the
hospital (with a vacuum lawyer between two pieces of glasses) and 17-22 dB(A) at the
school (ordinary design with two layers of windows put together) when the windows are
closed. When the windows are open, the reduction is about 6-10 dB(A) compared with
the noise levels one meter outside the same windows.
The lessens learnt from the inner ring road noise mitigation, which will be included into
the consideration of mitigation measure planning and design for Guangfo road include:
*  For multi stories buildings, the noise barriers should be higher. A noise barrier 5-7 m
tall as originally designed, compared with the current height of 3 m, would
significantly increased the protected area;
*  The lack of seal of noise barriers at the structural expansion joints and the poor design
in aluminum frame of the noise barriers are to blame for the less than desired
effectiveness of noise barriers;
* The noise barrier installation are not well planned. In some areas noise barriers are
installed where is no sensitive receptors to protect. Such waste of eflort should be
avoided and the location of noise barriers should be carefully planned through site
investigation and acoustic study; and
* Double glazed windows prove to be a very effective measures for noise attenuation
for indoor environment. It seems that to meet the noise standards at the sensitive
receptors, the windows are required to be closed; therefore, the ventilation must be

Guanlgfo Coniecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
resolved to ensure the effectiveness of double glazed window as a noise control
measure.
Noise barrier
In the following section of Guangfo road, noise barrier will be built to protect the
sensitive receptors nearby:
*  North side at Jiaobiao and Hengjiao villages for 400 m long; on the Southeast side,
450 m long. The noise barrier w'ill be 3.5 m high using absorbent materials,
considering the fact there is no high rises in the directly impacted area. As the
buildings in the villages are mostly two stories high at about 10 m to the road for the
closest houses. To this height, the noise barrier will be most effective in noise
reduction, particularly this part of the road will be single elevated viaduct only with
no roads on the ground level. It is expected that the noise level equivalent at the
houses will be reduced from the originally predicted levels by about 15-20 dB(A).
The residual impacts at the village houses following the noise barriers will be about
60 dB(A) during the day time and about 58 dB(A) at night, whicih meet or slightly
above the applicable Category 1I standards.
e  Based on the lessens learnt from the inner ring project, the noise barrier to be
installed will be carefully designed using quality materials. In particular, the
aluminum frame of each panel, between panels and between the structural expansion
joints will be well sealed to enhance the noise reduction function.
Noise absorbent road surface
Guangfo road will use bitumen based noise absorbent material for its surface in the
entire 5.6 km of road. According to experience overseas, such road surface materials will
reduce the noise to the surrounding areas by about 5 dB(A), compared with the concrete
road surface.
Double glazed windows
The experience gained from noise mitigation of the inner ring road project has showed
that noise barrier alone may not be adequate in terms of noise reduction to the acceptable
levels while installation of double glazed windows at the sensitive receptors is the most
effective measure to protect indoor environment from noise impact. Guangfo road will
take such measure to noise mitigation at the most sensitive receptors.
e The Shuangqiao middle school is about 85 m from the proposed road, with a 4
stories classroom building. The first and second floor of the building is behind a
factory shop and as such the noise impact is mostly towards the classrooms on the
third and fourth floor. There are a total of 10 classrooms on these two floors with a
2
total window area of 120 in
ESRI                            September, 2002                           70



Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
*  Jiangzhou primary school, although located only 65 m from the proposed, is
completed behind a factory shop of the same height. The noise level is expected to be
able to meet the applicable stahidards. No further mitigation is needed.
*  Guangdong Commerce School is about 100 m from the proposed Guangfo road. It
has an 8 stories building with classrooms and administrative/teachers offices. The
building side facing the road is 40 m wide. On this side, each floor has eight
windows of 1.5 by 2 m giving a total window area of 24 m2 per floor. Since the first
three floors of the school are hided behind factory shops which act as very effective
noise barrier themselves, the top five floors will be installed with double glazed
windows, with a total area of 120 m2.
Relocation
Jiaobiao primary school would be immediately adjacent to Guangfo road. In fact, the
road will occupy part of the teaching building and about a quarter of the campus. The
noise level will be very high, predicted to be at 83 dB(A) which is 28 dB(A) above the
applicable standard. Even double glazed windows would not be able to reduce the noise
to the standard. As shown in the previous sections, Jiaobiao primary school will also be
the most impacted receptor from motor vehicle exhaust emission with NO2 exceeding
the standard even under normal climate conditions and would be by up to 264% under
unfavorable climate conditions. Furthermore, as part of the school will be occupied and
there is no room within its current location to expand, the school will be unable to
function properly for its 760 students and teachers.
Therefore, the best mitigation for the noise, air pollution and campus occupation will be
to relocate the school to a quiet location sufficiently away from Guangfo road. As from
Fangcun interchange to the outer ring road will not be funded by the World Bank but by
the Nanhai government and Jiaobiao primary school is located in this section, the
relocation of the school as a mitigation measure and a condition for the project has been
proposed to the Nanhai government and accepted. In fact, the Nanhai govemment has
long planned for the relocation and committed funding for it, because of the noisy
environment in the school area from the train operation. The relocation and resettlement
of Jiaobiao primary school will be completed in its new location prior to the start of the
Guangfo road construction to a new location, which is about 700 m northwest of the
current school site. The funding of the relocation will come from the land compensation
from the Project resettlement budget as well as funds already committed by the Nanhai
government The additional funds from the city are needed since the school will be
expanded in teaching space and upgraded for better facilities in its new location.
Other measures
Appropriate Land Use and Development Planning - Along the project area (e.g.,
southwest of the Fangcun Interchange) there are still land parcels to be developed.
During the zoning and planning process, the following measures/policies will be taken:
*  The first row of the buildings will be controlled to be no less than 20 in to the red
line of Guangfo road;
ESRI                           September, 2002                          71



GLiaigfo Connectinlg Road Environmental Impact Assessmenit
*  New development will have landscaped area betweeni the development and the road;
*  Th first row of the buildings will not have any noise sensitive facilities sucil as
schools, hospitals, kindcrgar-tenis, but less noise sensitive facilities such as parking
garage, commercial complex, other closed structures, etc.
*  The immediately adjacent land will not be used for residential developmenit in
general. If it is used for such purposes, the building should design the building
configuration as much as possible to locate the kitchens, bathrooms, elevator wells,
auxiliary facilities on the side facing the road. In addition, developers will be
requested to include noise control and reduction into the building design through
materials selection, window designs, etc.
* The first row of the buildings may be designed to be in parallel to the road which
would be a noise barrier themselves to the buildings behind.
Road structure and materials selection will include considerations for noise control and
minimization. Such considerations will include:
*  As discussed before, the entire Guangfo road surface will use high quality bitumen.
*  The design will utilize no expansion joints and continuous large displacement and
multiple span structure, so that the expansion joints can be minimized and thus the
noise resulting from motor vehicle vibration when through the joints.
*  The design will utilize flexible support such as board rubber supports and spherical
rubber support to absorb structural vibration and the noise thus caused.
AManagement measutres will be taken during Guangfo road operations, including:
*  Gradually increase motor vehicle noise emission standards, implement vehicle
inspection system and enforced maintenance for vehicles which exceed the standards.
High noise, old model vehicles will be retired. Guangzhou will establish control plan
and targets for motor vehicle noise. The reduction of noise from vehicles is the most
directly and effective measures to control noise.
*  Strictly enforce motor vehicle speed limits, particularly in the sections where there
are sensitive receptors and at night.
*  Guangfo road will be periodically and regularly maintained for good working
conditions.
Estimated costs for mitigation measures
The above noise mitigation measures will be included in the project design where
appropriate and implemented at the same time with Guangfo road construction, and
therefore the cost of the mitigation measures will be included in the total project budget.
The estimated cost for the mitigation are:
*  The total length of noise barriers will be 850 m long. The type of noise barrier is 3.5
m high with a unit price of RMB 1000/m2. The total cost: RMB2.55 million;
*  The noise absorbent road surface will have an incremiiental unit cost (compared with
regular road surface) of RMB240/m  and thus the total cost will be RMB40 million;
*  Landscaping of a 10 m wide area on both sides of the road of 5000 in long (excluding
surface water body) at RMB I 59/m, total RMB795,000;

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
*  Double glazed windows witlh ventilation cost for schools within the most impacted
area, which will be 240 m2 RMB300/m2, totaling RMB72,000.
* Relocation of Jiaobioa primary school to a new site willIcost an RMB6 million.
* The total estimated cost for noise mitigation measures (excluding relocation cost) will
be RMB43.417 million of which RMB40 million for absorbent road surface materials
will be included in the project engineering cost and RMB3.417 million will be
dedicated to noise pollution mitigation cost.

5.3   Water Environment Impact
Roads projects themselves do not generate wastewater. However, some contaminants
from motor vehicles exhaust emissions will participate on the road surface. When it runs,
the contaminants will be carried away by surface runoff and discharged eventually to
surface water bodies nearby, resulting in adverse impacts. This EA uses a mathematical
model to simulate impacts of surface runoff from Guangfo road to Pearl River (west
channel) during the road operation stage, as a general case. Impacts on other water bodies
wilIlbe also be discussed.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
Pcarl river hydrology characteristics
The Pearl river is the largest and dominate surface water body in the project area. Much
of surface runoff from guangfo road will be discharged to this water body either directly
or indirectly via other smaller water ways along the road. The Pearl river (west channel)
at this area is about 530 m wide. The river is affected by both the river flows from
upstreamn and tidal flows from downstream, resulting in potentially longer holding time of
contaminants in the river and thus pollution of water quality. According to GESRI's
earlier data, the dry season water flow is averaged 691 m3/s, with an average depth of
6.43 m during high tides and 611 m3/s with an average depth of 5.69 m during ebb tides
at this section of the river.
As discussed before, the main contaminants in the "first flush" of surface runoff from
Guangfo road will be COD and oil and grease (petroleum based), which will be the focuts
of the impact assessment. The concentrations of these contaminants have been estimated
and presented in Appendix 11.
Water quality model
According to relevant guides in the Technical Guidelines for Environmental Impact
Assessment HJ/T2.3-93), the non-permanent contaminants, CODcr and BOD5, may be
simulated by a two dimensional steady state mixing and degradation model. The model is
expressed as:
c(x ~-x (-K_____           cO     F   (   Uy2          u(2B-_yJ)2 ~l
C(,y)ep     xi         Ch +    ""~    exp -            r   4Mxx
86400u)      HVmdxu          4MA4   +exJ     4   Y    I
Where:       C(x,y)- position x, y average concentration (mg/L);
x,y- coordinators (m);
U- cross-sectional average river flow speed (m/s);
Cp-contaminant discharge concentration (mg/L);
Qp-wastewater discharge rate (m3/s);
My- horizontal mixing coefficient (m2/s);
H-average water depth (m);
B-river width (m); and
K-oxygen consumption coefficient (l/d).
The two parallel roads for Guangfo road at the Pearl river section can be treated as two
discharge points. The compounded impacts from two sources to the receiving water body
may be calculated as:
C(x,y) = E C, (x,y)
ESRI                            September, 2002                            74



Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
Where:       Ci is the contribution of contaminants from the i"' source to position (x,y);
in this case, i=2.
The results of the water quality impacts are presented in Tables 1///11 throughi 1111111.
The modeling results indicate that during the operation stage, discharge of surface runoff
from Guangfo road to Pearl river will cause narrow bends of increased pollutant
concentrations on both sides of the river, during the first few hours of a rain storm. These
bends are about 10 m upstream and downstream from the discharge points. The
concentrations will be relatively higher near the banks and gradually decreasing towards
the river center.
The incremental increase in pollution concentrations is slightly higher in high tide than
ebb tide. In the east bridge area, the maximum increase in CODcr will be 0.0263 mg/L
during high tides and 0.0252 during low tides; while the increase in oil and grease
concentration is only 0.004 mg/L. For the west bridge, the increase in CODcr
concentrations are expected to be 0.0285 mg/L during high tides and 0.027 during ebb
tides; while the increase in oil and grease is about 0.005 mg/L.
The pollutant concentrations decreased rapidly a short distance from the discharging
points, indicating the enormous assimilative capacity through dilution and degradation in
the receiving water. For example, the model predicts the incremental increases in COD
concentrations will decrease by 25-90% about 1000 m from the discharge points. At
about 690-770 m up- and downstream from the east bridge and 800-900 m from the west
bridge, the impacts in terms of increased oil and grease concentrations in the receiving
water will be completely disappear.
Clearly, the impacts to surface water quality is very limited even within the impacted area
as shown by the very low incremental increase in COD and oil and grease concentrations.
Such increases will not be able to alter surface water quality categorization. In fact, at
such low increases, the impact will not cause any visible impact in terms of color or odor
of the bends even to the people closest to the banks. The only sensitive receptor, Xicun
Water Purification Plant water intake is located about 4.7-5.2 km upstream from Guangfo
road bridges, will not be impacted by Guangfo road surface runoff.
Imp'act of Accidents
I
Guangfo road crosses Pearl river twice at the east and west channels, respectively. The
east channel is about 250 m wide while the west channel, 350 m wide. If tank trucks
containing hazardous materials passing through the bridges on Guangfo road involve in
traftic accidents, risks exist that hazardous materials may be released to Pearl river
causing pollution episodes.
Many factors affecting a traffic accident which would lead to a spill/release of liquid
hazardous materials into Pearl river. These factors include tank truck drivers, hazardous
materials in the trucks, frequencies of trucks passing the bridges, truck driving speed,
ESRI                            September, 2002                           75



Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessmncit
traffic volume at the time, road/bridge conditions, local climate conditions, bridge length,
etc. The probability, P, of accidents causing releases of hazardous materials into the P'earl
river at the Guangfo road section may be determined by the following fomula:
P=P0 Cl C2 C3 C4
Where, P0 - expected traffic accident frequency on the project road, times/year;
C, - the traffic accident reduction following the proposed road completion;
C2 - percentage of tank trucks containing hazardous materials in the vehicle fleet;
C3 - percentage of hazardous chemicals within all the commodity transportation
using Guangfo road;
C4 - ratio of the road length over Pearl river over the total length of Guangfo road.
P0 reflects conditions of the traffic, existing roads and motor vehicles as well as local
climate, drivers' experience, etc. Using accident data on an existing road similar to
Guangfo road and considering the Guangfo road length as a portion of the existing road,
the expected accident rate Po can be estimated to be 35 times/year.
Cl reflects the improvement in road conditions, transportation conditions, safety
management, etc. comparing the road with controlled access roads (such as expressway,
fenced fast urban road including Guangfo road) and regular urban roads with no control
on access, the traffic accidents will be reduced by 25%. Therefore, for Guangfo road the
Cl factor is selected to be 0.25.
According to statistics of motor vehicles using existing roads between Guangzhou to
Foshan, the trucks occupy about 22.57% of the motor vehicle fleet, wlich is assumed to
be the value for C2
Once again, using the data on the existing commodity road transportation between
Guangzhou and Foshan, hazardous materials such as fuels, pesticides, other chemicals,
etc. are about 2% of the total commodity in this transportation corridor. This is assumed
to be the value for C3.
The total length of Guangfo road over Pearl river, i.e. the total length of both bridges on
east and west channels will be 600 m. Over the 5.6 km of the total length of Guangfo
road, the C4 can be determined as 0. 11.
Based on above assumptions and estimates of the factors, the probability of accidents
involving hazardous materials over the Pearl river is:
Po = 34.8x0.25x0.02x0.2275x0.11 = 0.00432 times/year
This is a very small probability, equivalent to one such accident in every 231 years.
However, if such accidents occur and hazardous materials released into Pearl river, it
could impacted a very large area including the water purification water intakes and the
urban section of the Pearl river. Fisheries resources in Pearl river will also be affected,

likely resultilIg in a fish skill, depending on the type of hazardous materials involved in
such accidents.
5.3.2 Impact Mitigation
Although the probability is very low, main potential impacts of Guangfo road will be
traffic accidents on or near the bridges involving hazardous materials. As such, mitigation
measures are planned to minimize such risks. These measures are:
* Strictly enforce hazardous materials transporta:tion permitting system - Guangzhou
Hazardous Materials Transportation Regulations stipulates that transportation of
hazardous materials must receive prior approval and receive permit from road
transportation authority. The permitting requirements that the trucks to be used for
such transportation must be in good conditions, equipped with fire extinguishers and
hazardous materials signage. Non-motor vehicles and motor cycles are banned for
hazardous materials transportation. Transportation of explosives and hazardous
chemicals will further require special permits from the public security (police)
authority. As part of the Guangzhou/Guangdong road network, Guangfo road will
implement these requirements during operation.
* The road management authority which will be Guangzhou Road Bureau in this
project will establish emergency response procedures and plans together with public
security and environmental protection bureau to respond promptly to any spills, leaks
and other accidents which involve hazardous materials. Necessary equipment and
materials will be available to deal with such accidents to contain the spills to the
maximum extent possible to protect the contamination of Pearl river as well as to
protect resident the communities and natural environment in the area.
* At the key and sensitive sections of Guangfo road, such as bridges and areas near the
bridges, warning signs will be erected to set speed limits to vehicles hazardous
materials. These trucks will be banned to use Guangfo road during rush hours.
* An emergency reporting system will be established. Any accidents involving spills of
hazardous materials and release of such materials to Pearl river will be required to
report to Guangzhou Environmental Protection Bureau immediately. Procedures will
be established to closed down the Xicun Water Purification Plant water intake
following such accidents. The intake can only be opened again following detailed
investigation and mitigation/remediation as may be necessary and with assurance
that the spills will not reach the intake and have any impacts to water quality at the
intake area.
5.4   Resettlement and Relocation
5.4.1 Applicable laws and policies
The resettlement and relocation policies and resettlement action plan (RAP) for Guangfo
road have been developed based on resettlement and relocation laws and regulations of
the Chinese government, as well as operational policies on Involuntary Resettlement
(0D4.30) of the World Bank. The applicable laws and regulations are:

5.4.2 Land acquisition and impact assessment
Agricultural land
Guangfo road will pass both urban and rural area and as such both urban housing and
agricultural lands will be acquired for the road development. The rural land required for
Guangfo road is presented in Table 5-17.

Although the average cultivated land in the project region is scarce the impact of
agricultural land acquisition in terms of reduction in the average cultivated land per
agricultural population will be modest, as shown in Table 5-18.

Table 5-18 shows that the maximum reduction in the average land ownership will be
11.8% at Jiaobiao village. Although the total land acquisition at about 154 mnu is not high
it will be nearly 12% in agricultural land in Jiaobiao village as the village does not have
much agricultural land left. However, to put the impact of cultivated land loss into

perspective, the existing land at the suburb area cannot support the living of the local
farmers, who basically all have developed other sources of income to support their living
over the years when the urban Guangzhou has been expanding rapidly and wvell into these
villages.
Housing
The total amounts of housing affected have been estimated based on the detailed on site
survey of the entire project affected area. The results of the survey as well as
compensation rates are presented in Table 5-19.

Guangfo road will need to dismantle a total residential housing area of 10,950.38 m2,
affecting a total of 35 households and 87 people. For these households, compensation
will be provided based on the following:
*  For users, compensation will be provided for housing searching, moving and facilities
in the housing;
*  For owners, compensation will be provided for housing relocating, yards, wells and
other auxiliary materials associated with the housing; and
*  For owners who also use the housing, both the above compensation will be provided.
The principles to be applied for housing relocation and resettlement are:
* Residential relocation and resettlement will be within the same district at close area if
possible;
ESRI                             September, 2002                           79

.  The   resettlement  area  will  be  fully  serviced  withi road, hydro,  water
telecommuniications, post and other municipal services as well as education, health,
commercial, parks, and cultural facilities;
*  The resettlement area will be located in zones which will benefit from Guangfo road
project;
*  The resettlement area will have at least two routes of public transportation to the
urban center. The resettled area will also be in the benefited zones of the proposed
Guangzhou subway system.
In addition, for particularly vulnerable group$ of residents, such as disabled, elderly,
poverty, etc. the following principles will also be applied:
*  Will be resettled to area as close to urban area unless choosing otherwise;
*  Increase resettled area;
o  Relocate the poor in the first floor if available so that there will be opportunities for
small commercial operations to supplement family income; and
*  Relocate the disabled and elderly in the lower floors for convenience.
Based on the above principles, Beiyun Park and Guangcun district have been selected as
the resettlement areas for Guangfo road affected residents. Both areas meet the above
requirements and are well serviced with various municipal and other facilities. These are
also the resettlement areas for residents affected by the Inner Ring Road project and
described in detail in the RAP for the IRR. Particularly relocation to the Guangcun
district which is very close to the project area will not result in much difference for the
affected and relocated residents in terms of living areas and convenience.
The existing housing in the project area is mostly old and underserviced. In comparison,
the areas selected for relocation and resettlement for this project are well zoned, designed
and constructed residential districts based on the 215 century living concepts. In both
districts, there are education, cultural, medical and environmental sanitation facilities and
well serviced with all municipal utilities. Designed as integrated residential districts, both
areas are well landscaped with lots of open space, providing good living conditions and
environment. The affected and resettled residents will be compensated with at least the
same living areas or larger. Therefore, except the brief interruption of daily life and
inconvenience due to moving, the impacts to the resettled and relocated residents will be
generally positive.
Commercial and Institutional Impacts
Guangfo road development will require demolition of 347 commercial shops with a total
area of 1122.9 m2 affecting 696 staff and others related to these shops. The resettlement
principles will be to compensate to the housing and relocate new business spaces to
ensure that the owners and staff do not lose business opportunities.
The only institution to be affected will be Jiaobiao primary school. AlthougIl the project
will occupy a small portion of the school, the entire school will be relocated for

sufficiency in teaching and activity space, noise impacts and air impacts. The school will
be relocated prior to the start of project construction to ensure noln-interruption in school
year and classes. A new site has been identified and planned for a new school which is
located about 700 m northwest of and 20% bigger than the 'current site. The new school
construction will be funded by resettlement compensation and supplemented with
additional funds from the local government as the new school will be bigger and better
equipped. The new school construction will be complete prior to the construction of the
viaduct at this section with no interruption to any of the school activities.
Resettlement costs
Based on detailed site surveys of the entire project affected area, relevant government
policies and compensation rates, as well as relevant policies and principles of the World

5.5   Sunshine Impacts
Except 200 m which will be on the ground level, the entire Guangfo road will be built on
elevated viaduct. The area immediately near the road on the north, northwest and east
side will be affected in terms of the reduced sunshine, while areas on the south and
southeast will not be affected.
ESRI                            September, 2002                           81



Guangfo Connectinlg Road Environmental Impact Assessment
Among the nine sensitive receptors, only Jiaobiao primary school, Li's Family Shrine and
several houselholds from Jiaobiao village are very close to the road and within the
sunshine affected area. However, Li's Family Shrine does not have any windows on its
east side walls and will not be affected by the elevated viaduct in terms of sunshine.
The sections in the Datansha island are surrounded by temporary commercial and
fabricating shops. Pearl river bridge west and northwest sides residential areas (New
World residential) are sensitive to the sunshine. These buildings are located about 550 and
1250. At these angles, the sunshine time in winter will be about 7.3 hours, meeting the
Class I standards. On the Southwest, the sunshine can be 3.3 hours (Class 11) while on the
northwest side it will be 1-2 hours (Class 111, see Table 1-8 for details). The maximum
sunshine impacted area is about 9 meters from the viaduct at the winter time beyond
which the sunshine can meet the Class III standards. At the project area, 5 households
from Jiaobiao village are located 10 meters from the viaducts which are among the
closest sensitive receptors (Table 3-2). At this distance, the area can meet the Class Ill
standard. Jiaobiao primary school and Li's Family Shrine are also located 10 meters from
the proposed viaduct. The school is to be relocated while the shrine does not have any

There are 10 safeguards policies in the World Bank which could apply to a Bank
financed project. The Project EA has given considerations to all 10 safeguards policies
includinig initial screening and, where triggered, full application as may be necessary. The
following summarizes the safeguards issues for Guangfo road.
OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment - Guangfo road is classified as a Category A
project and as such a full environmental assessment has been completed. This document,
as well as a separate, stand alone Environmental Management Plan (EMP) are prepared
as a result of the EA.
OP 4.04 Natural Habitats - The entire project area, including both the urban built-up
area and suburb countryside, has been completely modified from its original native state
by a very long history of human activities. There are three parks in the project area but
there is little native plants and vegetation and wild animals except some species of birds
commonly found in urban area. The initial screening did not trigger a full assessment for
natural habitats in this project.
OP 4.09 Pest Management - Limited amounts of pesticides will be used for vegetation
and lawn maintenance during the operation stage following Guangfo road completion.
These pesticides will be not be procured through the World Bank funds. In any event, the
project will not procure WHO  Class la (Extremely Hazardous) and lb (Highly
Hazardous) chemicals, regardless of funding sources. Therefore, no further action was
taken with regard to the Pest Management in the EA.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
OPN 11.03 (being converted to OP 4.11) Cultural Property - The project has
undertaken a cultural property survey under the EA to determine if any project sites have
archeological, historical, religious,,or unique natural values as, required under the OPN. A
survey result, presented in Section 3.2.6, shows no archaeological sites or other
significant cultural property except the Li's Family Shrine which is a 1921 structure
which is included in the Nanhai city cultural property protection list. Guangfo road is not
going to impact the Shrine directly, as the stone structure has no windows on the side
facing the road and its gate is in parallel with the road. However, the elevated viaduct is
very close to the Li's Family Shrine (only about 10 m) as the modern structure amy not
harmonize well with the traditional architectural style.
In fact, the impacts will be more serious for several other structures associated with the
Li's Family Shrine, including Mr. Li's bronze statue and monument and an octagonal
pavilion which possess a similar architectural style. Although not included in the local
government cultural property list, they are part of architectural group with the Shrine and
treasured by the locals' as their tradition, value and culture. Guangfo road, as elevated
viaduct, will run directly above these structure, not only cover it completely under its
shade but seriously affect its surrounding setting and locals' feeling about them. As a
mitigation measure, the stature, monument and pavilion will be relocated to the southwest
side of the Shrine to a small community park near the village (see Figure 5-1 for detail).
The particular new location was in fact suggested by the local villagers during the public
consultation and would maintain the harmony and connection of this group of structures.
OD 4.20 (being converted to OP 4.10) Indigenous Peoples - The surveys during the
EA and resettlement evaluation showed that there are no indigenous peoples with
characteristics described in OD4.20 Paragraph 5.4 among the project affected groups and
residents. Thus no further assessment or actions are taken in this regard.
OD 4.30 (being converted to OP 4.12) Involuntary Resettlement - The project will
involve significant land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. A Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of OD4.30. The key
findings of RAP are presented in this report in Section 5. for mitigation measures.
OP 4.36 Forestry - The Project will not finance forest management or logging in tropical
moist forests. There is no primary or native forest in the project area, although the project
are6a has trees and other types of vegetation mostly planted within the last 50 years. The
baseline of the project area vegetation is included in the EA and this report in Section
4./11 and impact assessment on these vegetation is presented Section 5.3.
OP 4.37 Safety of Dams - No dam construction or repair is included in the project, thus
nolaction on this issue is necessary.
OP 7.50 International Watenvays - There are no project components that involve
international waterways as defined under OP7.50, thus no further action is necessary.
ESRI                            September, 2002                           83



Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessmeint
OP 7.60 Disputed Area - The project is not located in any knowni disputed areas, so no
further action is needed.
BP 17.50 Public Disclosure - The project proponent agrees to follow the Bank's
disclosure requirements and disclose project documentation il-country and to the
InfoShop of the World Bank. The Project EA documentation including EIA report and
EMP which include proposed mitigation measures to the affected population, have been
distributed to local libraries and other venues with good public access as part of the in-
country public disclosure. The availability of the EA reports has been announced in a
local media distributed city wide. The project proponent agrees to distribute the EA
documentation in the Bank's InfoShop once the documents are ready.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
Chapter 6 Analysis of Alternatives
6.1   Alternative Alignments/Layouts
Three alternative in alignments for Guangfo road have been proposed and considered
during project feasibility study and design stage. The alternative are (Figure 6-1):
*  Alternative I: The road will be divided into two elevated viaducts, i.e., Line A and B
lines, one on each side of the existing east and west Pearl river bridges; the two lines
continue towards Fangcun boulevard west (Fangcun Dadaoxi) and merged into one
line at about the Guocun residential area; the single line extends towards southwest
and connects with the outer ring road at Huangqi interchange;
*  Alternative II: The road will be single elevated viaduct on the north side of the
existing roads/bridges; after crossing the l'earl river west bridge, the road extends
straightly west bound and finally connects with the outer ring road at Surounding
interchange north of Huangqi; and
* Alternative III: The alignment prior to Wuyangqiao residential area is basically
identical to Alternative 1, i.e. twin elevated viaducts one on each side of the existing
roads/bridges. At about the Guocun, Line A continues along the same alignment as in
'Alternative I but only has three lanes and remains as an one way viaduct. Line B
extends around the south side of the Hengjiao village and the two lines are merged in
the open field east of Quangqi interchange before connects with the outer ring road at
lHuangqi.
The advantages and disadvantages of both alignments/layout are compared in Table 6-1.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environilmental Impact Assessment
The impacts of the three alternatives are mixed, each of whichi has its advantages and
disadvantages in terms of environmental inpacts. However on the balance, with all
factors considered, Alternative I in appears to have less environmental and socio-
economic impacts and other engineering and cost advantages. In particular, the entire
Alternative I is within the current railway and road corridor/alignment and its
construction would be similar to an exiting road upgrading. The other two alternatives
would create new alignments in the currently relatively quiet suburb communities As
such it will have the minimum land occupation and least disturbance to the communities
in the project area. Thus Alternative I is selected as preferred alignment for Guangfo road
project.
6.2    Elevated Viaduct vs Surface Road
An alternative to the elevated viaduct design is to upgrade or construct new road at the
ground level. The comparison of the two alternatives is presented in Table 6-2.
Table 6-2 Co  parison of Elevated Viaduct vs Surface Road
Item                   Elevated viaduct             Surface road

existing roads           roads need to close)
Impacts to local roads             Low                         High
Construction period               Short                       Long
Visual impacts                  High                        Low
Cost                        High                        Low
The table shows that although the surface road design would have low engineering cost
and low visual impacts compared with the elevated viaduct option, in virtually all other
aspects, the elevated viaduct design will have lower impacts to the natural and socio-
economic environment. As elevated viaduct will occupy less land, it will have less
impacts on soil, access to services, community severance, etc compared with the surface
road design. As the only road from Guangzhou to Nanhai/Foshan area, the project
corridor is already highly congested. Any surface road construction would seriously
blocked the exiting road affecting the traffic in this area. Therefore, with all factors
considered, elevated viaduct design is selected for Guangfo road project.

Guangfo Coniecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
Chapter 7 Public Consultation
7.1   Objectives
The objectives of public consultation may be described as follows:
*  Provide the public, particularly project directly affected public the opportunities to
express their opinions and concerns about the project;
*  Provide the public the opportunities to influence the decision making in terms of the
project design so that the impacts to the environment can be minimized;
*  Promote and solicit response from the public on impact mitigation measures so that
the mitigation measures are acceptable in public opinions;
*  Address different opinions or potential conflicts on environmental matters the public
may have on the project so that minimize any resistance to the project development
by the public;
*  Meets the various reasonable and legitimate demands in terms of protection of the
natural environment and the communities in the project area; and
*  Promote communications and exchange of opinions between the government and the
public, and help the government to understand the public concern and public value on
key environmental and social matters so that the government can make sound and
informed decisions on alignment selection, project design, mitigation programs and
environmental management plans.
Public consultation is one of the key elements in the EA and an effective approach to
scientific decision making. The public, particularly those who will be directly affected by
the project construction and operation, may have more specific concerns on the project
impacts that the government and its consultants may not be aware or identified. Through
the consultation, such concerns can be raised and bring to the attention of decision
makers and specialists so that appropriate design changes and/or other mitigation
measure can be developed to address these concerns and avoid, reduce, minimize or
otherwise compensate to any adverse impacts. Through such a consultation process, the
project can better receive the support of the public and avoid or provide solutions to any
po'tential conflicts between developments and protection of the natural environment and
the communities.
7.2   Approach
According to Article 15 of the Guidelines for Elnvironmental Protection for Construction
Projects of the State Council, other applicable laws and regulations, the EA TOR, as well
as! OP4.01 of the World Bank, the EA must include public consultation programs. The
public consultation may include the following aspects:
ESRI                           September, 2002                          87



Guangfo Connectinig Road Environmental Impact Assessment
*  Iopics and issues: the public consultation will cover the topics and issues related to
the natural and socio-economic environments, whicih can also be evaluated with
applicable laws and regulations;
*  Scope: the public consultation will cover the scope in which the environmental
impact assessment is conducted, and areas which will be impacted by the project
discharges and emissions and other project activities; In fact, the public consultation
will take an open mode which would crease the opportunities to allow any concerned
public to raise their concerns and opinions about the development;
*  Objects: the public consultation will include primarily the affected public members,
such as urban and rural residents, school teachers and students, etc. as well as relevant
government agencies for environmental and social protection;
*  Method: the main methods to be used in public consultation will include public
opinion questionnaire surveys, public interviews and public meetings with real names
for participants;
*  Contents: fill public opinion questionnaire, record public opinions during prublic
meetings, compile and evaluate the response from public consultation, develop
measures to address or respond public concerns, etc.
This EA includes two round public consultation: the first round was during the EA TOR
preparation stage, to mainly obtain public opinions, concerns and comments on the
project design, and potential adverse environmental impacts. The second round of public
consultation wvas conducted during draft EA report stage to explain the result of impacts
assessment, mitigation measures and environmental management plan. The objective is to
determine whether the public is satisfied with and feel acceptable of the residual impacts
following the implementation of mitigation measures.
7.3   First Round Public Consultation Results
The first round of public consultation was conducted in July 2001 in the form of public
opinion questionnaire. In total 100 copies of a questionnaire was distributed to mostly
rural residents. The EA team received 81 copies of complete questionnaire.

During the first round of public consultation, relevant government agencies and education
institutions were also consulted for their opinions and concerns. The agency/institution
consultation was conducted primarily through meetings and interviews with staff. The
main issues raised by these institutions are:
*  Fangcun Environmental Protection Bureau - through construction management and
technology, speed up the bridge construction. The architectural design should
harmonize with the surroundings. The operator the road should contact and consult
with the Fangcun EPB regularly.
*  Nanhai city Environmental Protection  Bureau - While the project alignment (the
original alignment) along the river bank will occupy less land, it would be too close to

the residents of.liaobiao village and thus impacts heavily on residents. The alignimient
should be better go along the railway line;
*  Jiaobiao Primary School - Following planned demolition of part of the school for
Guangfo road, there will be insufficient space for teaching activities at this site.
Further the noise will also serious affect teaching in the classroom at this particular
location. Hope the project will help and support relocating the school to another site.
*  Song Jia Middle School - the elevated viaduct will be very close to the school and as
such noise will be a major issue.
The concerns and opinions from the first round of public consultation has been well
received by the EA team who will include these concerns into their assessment and
mitigation planning. Where appropriate, the opinions have also been forwarded to design
engineers and the project proponent for actions. For example, Guangfo road will noNw be
located adjacent to the railway tracks, avoiding to be too close to the residential housing
at Jiaobiao and Hengjiao villages.
7.4   Second Round of Public Consultation
Thle second round of public consultation was conducted primarily through a series of
public meetings between May 9-18, 2002 during the preparation of the draft EA report.
Three public meetings were held to during the public consultation process. Details of
these public meetings are summarized in Table 7-2.

The vast majority of people (92 or nearly 94%) consulted supported construction of
Guangfo road. They believe this will be a critical link between the inner ring road and
urban Guangzhou to Fangcun district, Nanhai city and Foshan city and will be a trunk
road in the greater Guangzhou area's transportation network. It will provide the
convenience to the people in western Guangzhou, alleviate transportation congestion and
bottleneck in this area, provide a fast channel between Guangzhou and Foshan, and
promote the economic development in the region.
Good alignment
The people surveyed felt the alignment selection is good because it goes along the
existing railway tracks and thus save occupying more land and dismantling more houses.
About half of the people consulted considered this alignment to have least impacts to the
surrounding area.

Optical Cable
Concern - Along the Guangfo road alignment, tilere are several Chinia Telecom's signs
showing "Underground Optical Cables, Contact Before Excavation". There were 13
people who were concerned about construction practice which could damage the optical
cable, which if occurs would affect many in the regions for their telecommunication
services.
Response - Protection of underground cable will be included in the contractor
contractual requirements. Appropriate training will be provided to contractors and
construction supervision to ensure such damages will not happen during Guangfo road
construction.
A lignment
Concern - The current design is for Lines A and B to be located on west side of the
railway line at the Jaiobiao village section. About 30 surveyed, mostly from Jiaobiao
village, suggested to move one line to the east side of the railway to avoid the double
lines occupation of land in Jiaobioa village. In particular, should the existing design
adopted, the Li's Family Shrine (built in 1921) will need to be partially dismantled.
Response - The request and concern have been forwarded to project design engineers
and project proponenit. Design changes to modify the alignment is currently bcing
contemplated. Except the pavilion and statue, the Shrine itself will not be directly
affected by the viaduct. The pavilion and statue will be relocated to the southwest side
near the shrine and the relocation cost has been budgeted and included in thle resettlement
cost.
Land utilization
Concern - as the project occupies a certain amount of land and dismantled some shops
along the project area, about 29% surveyed suggested to create commercial outlets
underneath the elevated viaduct to compensate the loss in the commercial shops. Some
also suggested to install flower shops in this area .
Response - the request has been forwarded to relevant planning authority and district
government for further consideration.
Flower planting
Concern - Some concerned that the area directly underneath of the elevated viaduct will
have a bad looking and should be mitigated by planting flowers which do not need much
sunlight. This will milimize the adverse visual impacts.
Response - The flower planting suggestion has been included in the mitigation measures
and envi-onimental management plan.

Guangfo Connectiiig Road Environmental Impact Assessment
Pavilion
Concern - There is a 1924 built pavilion near the Li's Family Shrine, which currently is
located in the campus of Jiaobiao primary school The pavilion was built for the locals to
pay their respects to their predecessor. The road will go over the Pavilion but some are
concerned that having an elevated viaduct over head such pavilion will be a sign of lack
of respect to the elderly.
Response - The pavilion will be relocated and estimated cost for this purpose has already
been included the final project resettlement and relocation program and in the total
estimated budge for this year. A new location has been identified following the
suggestion from the local villagers (see Figure 5-1).
Design
Concern - About 38% of the people suggested that whether it is possible add exit ramps
at Guangzhou Nanhua flower market, because residents in the Fangcun area will have
reduced access to road as the interchange extends all the way on elevated via duct to the
outer road and have no access to or exit from the Fangcun area.
Response  - the request has been forwarded to project design engineers and project
proponent for consideration.
Opposition
Concern - A small number of people surveyed (about 4%) were against build Guangfo
road. They feel there is enough transportation links between the inner ring road and outer
ring road. Building two bridges over Pearl river, on top of the existing railway and road
bridges will affect the view and visual impact of the Pearl river in this section.
Response - The EA team has explained the importance and necessity of Guangfo road
and its role in the Guangzhou road network, during the public meeting. The 4 persons
who raised the concern expressed they understand the decision to build.
7.5   Information Disclosure
The EA team and the Project Office, the project proponent, plan to release this final EA
document as well as the final EMP to the public once it is completed. The plan is to place
two copies of each of the two copies of the final reports to Guangdong Commerce School,
Shuangqiao Middle School, and Jiaobiao village meeting house for public review. The
release is to take place by the early October, 2002.
Once the reports are issued in these schools and village meeting house, the PO and EA
team will place an advertisement in one of the major newspaper in Guangzhou, informing
the public the availability of the EIA and EMP and venues where they are available. The

Chapter 8 Environmental Management and Monitoring
As discussed above, Guangfo road project will generate adverse environmental ilmpacts
in both construction and operation stages. The impacts during construction can be high
and extend to a large area but it mostly limited to the relatively short construction period
(up to two years). While during operation, the impacts will'be long lasting. For both
stages, environmental management system including environmental monitoring will be
necessary to control the impacts to the minimum.
8.1    Environmental Management Organizations
The environmental management organizations involve in Guangfo road construction and
operation, and their interrelation are presentecl in an organizational charge (Figure 8-1).
The functions of each organizations are summarized in Table 8-1.

As the project proponent, the PO will take the ultimate responsibility for environmental
performance and environmental management during construction. During the inner ring
road construction which was competed in 2001, the PO gained substantial experience
with environmental management. The PO has dedicated environmental specialists on
staff who manage the day to day environmental performance of the contractors, maintain
liaison with regulatory agencies and communicate with the affected public including
receiving public complaints.
The environmental staff are also responsible for ensuring the ilplementation of
mitigation measures identified and designed by the EA. They will work closely with the
design institute and contractors as may be necessary to modify and update the mitigation
design and scale as needed by the actual conditions during project construction and
implementation. An effective working system has been developed with the PO for
environmental management through the ring road construction and such system, as well
as the extensive experience gained during the inner ring road construction will be
capitalized for Guangfo road implementation as well.
8.2   Environmental Management
Construction Stage
In order to effectively control and minimize environmental pollution resulting from
construction activities, the construction site must be assured of an environmental
management system including management people and full time environmental persons
to ensure mitigation measures designed during EA stage are appropriately implemented.
More specifically, the construction stage will:
*  Include environmental protection requirements, mitigation plans and moniitoring plan
into the bid documents and eventually in the contract;
*  Prepare environmental, sanitary measures by contractors and implemented other
mitigation measures identified and described in the EA reports;
* Request construction supervision to have at least one full time environmental
supervision engineer
ESRI                            September, 2002                           96






Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
*  Request contractors to have full time environmental staff at the site;
*  Explain to the affected residents potential impacts through public notice and
informnation release; and
*  Continue public consultation through hotline telephone, bill boards at the
construction site.
Operation stage
Environmental management during operation is a long term effort, which requires well
structured environmental management system, and on which to further build supervision,
monitoring and management procedures. The environmental monitoring will be an
effective tool to determine the environmental performance but preventive will also be
needed such as proper maintenance. During the operation, the project operator
(Guangzhou Communication Bureau) will work closely with Guangzhou EPB on city
environmental programs such as motor vehicle emission control strategy, vehicle
inspection and forced retirement plan etc.
Continued Public Consultation
It is very important that public consultation and communications will continue
throughout the project construction stage. The objective is to inform the public of
construction activities to gain their understanding and support, and to listen to anv
concerns they may have and suggestions for mitigation. For example, contractors will be
requested to inform and discuss with affected communities prior to construction activities
which could result in high noise. The public opinions and concerns will be taken to full
considerations for properly scheduling noise construction activities.
A bill board will be erected in every construction site. This board will briefly explain the
activities on this site, and indicates specifically that public concerns and opinions on the
environment will be welcome. To ensure public concerns, if any, can be received
properly and timely, the board will include specific contact information such as telephone
numbers, email address where possible, and contact persons, which will be the head and
environmental staff of the contractors on that particular site.
Public notice will also be issued in media during the operation stage to inform of the
public with contact information so that they can express their concerns and opinions, if
any, on environmental impacts of Guangfo road operations. Once again telephone
numbers and contact persons will be provided. At this stage, the contact information will
be those of that of the road operating company.
8.3   Personnel Training
Personnel training will be provided in different stages of project implementation. At the
construction stage, heads and environmental staff from winning contractors and
construction supervision companies will be requested to participated in a mandatory
environmental traininig program. This request will be included the construction tenderiig

*   Daily environmental monitoring requirements (see section below), mnethodology and
procedures;
*  Environimlenital reporting requiremilenits; and
*   Environmental emergency response and cleanup.
Regarding personinel training, the effort wvill be focused on tile contractors who will be
conduct the construction, because other environmental training for project mzanagement,
monitoring and other professional staff hiave been included in the Ininer Ring Road (IRR)
componenit. In total, 10 people from the contractors will be requested to parlicipate in the
environmental training for a total of eiglit days. Based on the Ullit cost of RMB4000 per
person for the traininig, the total traininig budget for the Guiangfo road will be RMB40.000
For operation stage, enviroinmenital staff fromii the road operation companiv and relevanlt
govem-iinment organizations whiiclh oversee and supervise the road operations will be
provided the traininig. The training programs will be primarily provided by professional
environmental staff or in local unliversities
8.4    Environmental iMonitorinig
The objective of the environimenital imonitorilng plan is to verify the prediction of
environinenital impacts assessmenit and detenmine environmental performance and
impacts to surroLunding area. The monitorinig plan will also provide a basis for project
executing agency and road operator to prepare environmental policies, take additional
actions for mitigation as may be necessary and minimize adverse impacts.
Envirolinenital monitorin g plan
Environimenital monitoring will be carried out in bothi the constrLctioni and operation
stages. In the construction stage, the monitoring will be done in two levels: daily and
regular monitorinig, to be carried out by contr-actors and construction supervisioni
companies. Environimental staff will be trained prior to the start of construiction for thle
monitoring whicih will include mostly visual monitorinig of air bonie dust, surface ruToff,
storage and disposal of constructioni waste, traffic impacts, and constructioni safety issues.
Hand-hold noise meters will be used to monitor the noise levels at sensitive receptors
durinig construction. Thle objective of thils daily monitoring program  is to identify
environilimenital issuies at the same timile as the construictioni activities on thiese sites to that

appropriate mlitigation actions, if needed, can be initiated and inipleiinenited timely to
minimize the impacts.
At the same tine, in additional to the daily monitorinig by contTactors a forilial
environimiiental monitoring program will also be carried out durinig the constr-uction, as
well as operation phase. This programs will be conducted by professional environmenital
monitoring program witlh main objective to provide official records on environimental and
regulatory compliance status.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental lmpact Assessment
Chapter 9 Summary and Conclusions
Guangzhou's inner ring road and outer ring road are linked through a series of "radial"
connecting roads to form and inner ring road and outer expressway network for effective
and fast transport. Guangfo road is one of the connecting roads linking inner ring road
with western Guangzhou area.
Guangfo road will be built for the most part in two parallel elevated viaducts, Line A and
B which will be close to each other. The total length of Line A will be 5.2 km and that for
Line B, 5.6 km, of whicil 3.2 km will be in the Guangzhou area and the reminder, Nanhai
city which is part of the Foshan municipality. The alignment will basically goes along the
Inner ring road at Shangshan Balu interchange, through Pearl river east bridge, Datnashan
interchange, Pearl river west bridge, Fancun interchange, the Jiaobiao village area, and
ends at the Huangqi interchange at the outer ring road. Together with the ring roads and
radial roads network-, Guangfo road will help to divert the traffic away from the
Guangzhou urban center, contribute to alleviate traffic congestion in urban area, strength
the link between Guangzhou and Foshan, and play a significant role in promoting
economic development of the western Guangzhou and Nanhai areas.
Environmental Baseline
An ambient air quality monitoring program shows that NO2 in the monitored area are
mostly within 0.037-0.342 mg/m' range, parts of which exceed the standard at 0.24
mg/mi3. The higher than the standard concentrations were monitored at the Zhongshan
Balu interchange at the Guangzhou end, with monitored data in other areas all withill the
standard. The monitored CO concentrations, ranged from 0.34-8.69 mg/m3, for hourly
average and 0.57-7.05 for daily average, met the applicable standards. The monitored
TSP ranged from 0.191-0.438 mg/m3, with the exceedance over the standard occurring
only at Zhongshan Balu interchange. PM,o exceeded the standard at all monitored
locations. The monitoring data show that the existing air quality is poor at the Guangzhou
end and becomes towards the suburb. This is consistent with the gradually decreased
urban activities such as motor vehicle traffic, etc. from urban area to suburb.
The project area acoustic environment mostly meets the Category 11 standards. When
there is no trains passing, all monitored locations can meet Category 11 standards both
during the day time and at night, except Jiangzhou primary school, Shuangqiao middle
school and Guangdong Commerce College, where the day time noise exceeded the
standard by up to 6 dB(A) (the applicable standard is Category I because of higher
sensitivity). When there is passing trains, however, all monitored locations near the
railway are significantly affected by the train noise. For example, at the Jiaobiao primary
school, the instant noise levels from passing trahis could reach 87.4 dB(A), even to 91.4
dB(A) when the trains blow their whistles at this location. Therelore, the acoustic
environment is considered generally good except the impact from passing trains.

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
The water quality monitoring programs carried out in the EA that the Pearl river section
near the project show that the existing water quality exceeded the Class Ill surface water
quality for COD and petroleum based oils. But heavy metal parameters were all within
the standards. This indicates that the pollution sources causing the existing water quality
deterioration in the Pearl river are primarily domestic based.
The site survey indicates there are several receptors which will be highly sensitive to the
construction and operation of Gouangfo road. These sensitive receptors include
Jiangzhou primary school, Shuangqiao middle school, Guang,dong commerce college,
Fangcun Guocun residential area, Fangcun New World residential area, Jiaobioa village,
Jiaobiao primary school, Li's Family Shrine, and Hengjiao village. Most of these
sensitive receptors are located at the northwest side of the road and about 10-100 m to
Guangfo road. Because of their proximity to the roads and nature, they will be sensitive
to the noise and motor vehicle exhaust pipe emissions.
Construction Plhase Impacts
Guangfo road project will have large scale activities, with a long construction period,
mostly within urban and built up areas with a high population density and congested
traffic on the existing roads. Therefore, construction activities in such areas will impact
the surrounding natural and socio-economic environment. More specifically, the impacts
will include:
*  Noise generated from construction activities is expected to exceed both the day and
night time standard limits in the "Construction Site Boundary Noise Standards"
(GB12523-90). Such noise levels will impact the area within the 50 m zone and any
facilities particularly sensitive receptors will be impacted by construction noise.
About 10 residential households and three schools are in these zones which will be
most affected.
*  Bridge construction and other construction activities construction equipment and
vehicle machinery washing, surface runoff from the disturbed soil, etc. near water
bodies particularly Pearl river, could result in increased suspended solid and in some
cases oils in the receiving water.
o  Many construction activities such as demolition, loading/unloading, site cleanup and
* preparation, vehicle movements, etc. will cause air-borne dust which will affect the
surrounding areas especially those in the leeward direction. Once again, the
households and schools closest to the construction site will be most affected by the air
borne dust.
* The construction will result in a large quantity of spoil and solid waste including
demolition waste, excessive soil and other waste from construction activities. The
storage of the waste on site could pollute the surrounding environment and disturb the
communities. The transportation of the waste, if not properly handled could result in
pollution of the transportation routes. Finally, the disposal of the waste will occupy
land and impact the areas surrounding the disposal sites.
* Construction activities such as materials storage, loading/unloading, truck movement
and parking, etc will occupy a portion of the existing roads causing traffic jams near

the constr-uction sites. Since the roads near the sites are the major gate ways to the
western GuangzIhou area and towards the Foshan municipality (as this connects the
bridge on the Pearl river), and they are narrow and very busy, the occupation of thle
roads, even temporarily could cause serious traffic problems.
Operation Plhase Impacts
Air Quality lmpact
Based on modeling prediction, on the climate conditions of average wind speed of 1.9
m/s and D atmospheric stability (normal climate conditions), the hourly average NO2
concentrations at the pedestrian roads (about 10 m to the motor vehicles lanes) will be
ranged between 0.103-0.242 mg/mr3 for the short term, 0.106-0.251 mg/m3 for the mid
tern and 0.189-0.414 mg/mr3 over the long term. Under worse climate conditions, i.e.,
slower wind speed or caln and E atmospheric stability, the NO2 concentrations will be
ranged between 0.190-0.762 mg/m3 up to 80% higher than the standard, according to the
modeling prediction.
Another important air pollutant which can be related to motor vehicle emission, CO, is
predicted to be always below 6 mg/m3, within the applicable standard (10 mg/m3). Even
under the worst case conditions (I m/s wind stability and E atmospheric conditions), the
CO concentrations at predicted to be below 9 mg/m3 will still be below the standard.
It is noted that the modeling results show that predicted concentrations of both CO and
NO2 will increase over time, indicating the increase in motor vehicle fleet and traffic
volume on Guangfo road will offset the decrease in individual motor vehicle emission
from the implementation of more stringent emission standards to new motor vehicles.
According to relevant national and local policies, more stringent motor vehicle emission
standards will be enforced to new motor vehicles in Guangzhou, as well as in the rest of
the country, without which the impact of Guangfo road to ambient air quality would be
much higher than currently predicted.
During the operation stage, at various sensitive receptors average hourly NO2
concentrations are expected to be in the range of 0.101-0.206 mg/m3. Compared with the
applicable standard of 0.24 mg/m3, the predicted concentration is below the standard
indicating insignificant impacts. Under the worst climate conditions, however, the NO2
concentrations at these locations will be 0.173-0.412 mg/m3, up to 71% above tihe
standard. Among the sensitive receptors, Jiaobiao village and Jiaobiao primary school
will be worst affected as both are very closely located to the project road. The highest
concentrations are predicted at these locations.
In general, CO is not going to be a major affecting pollutant even under the worst case
climate conditions, according to the air quality modeling simulation results which show a
maximum CO concentration in the sensitive receptors of 7.439 mg/mi3 under the worst
case conditions over the long term which is well below the 10 mg/rn3 standard. NO2 on
the other hand will be the primary air pollutant which will impact the project surroundinig

area and sensitive receptors, particularly during the slow wind speed and stable climate
conditions.
Noise
According the noise modeling results, at 30 m from the road, the combined road and
railway noise will be 75.8-76.1 dB(A) for day time and 73.5-76.4 dB(A) for the night,
significantly exceeding the applicable noise standards for the both time frames. Within
this distance, there are Jiaobiao primary school and residential housing from Jiaobi,o
village. Compared the applicable standards for these sensitive receptors of 55 (day) 45
(night) dB(A) and 60 (day) and 55 (night) dB(A), respectively, the predicted noise levels
ex,ceed the standards by up to 22 dB(A), indicating very serious noise impacts on these
sensitive receptors. At these noise levels, the school will be able to carry classes properly
and the residents sleep and rest will be seriously affected.
Other sensitive receptors which are located outside the 40 m areas include Shuangqiao
middle school, Jiangzhou primary school, Guangdong commerce school, and New World
residential development. The predicted combined railway and road noise levels will be 70
to 71 dB(A) for day time, exceeding the applicable standards by up to II dB(A) for day
time. Jiangzhou primary school, however is expected not to be affected as there is
building between the school and the proposed road which will act as a very effective
noise barrier reducing the noise by 15-25 dB(A).
Water Impact
At the operation stage, the pollutants such as dust, oil, etc. accumulated on the road
surface, could be carried away by the "first flush" of rain water. The contaminated
surface runoff, when drained into the receiving water, could affect the receiving water
quality. The modeling results indicate that at the point where the surface runoff will be
drained into the surface water bodies, COD and oil could increase slightly, up to 0.263
and 0.0006 mg/L, respectively. The affected area is mostly limited within a narrow bend
of 1000 m by 15 m along the river bank. The sensitive points, the water intake for Xicun
Water Purification Plant located 4.7 km up stream from the east bridge on Pearl river,
will not be affected by the road operation. Traffic accidents involving tank trucks
containing hazardous materials over the bridges could seriously affect water quality in
project area. However, the chance of such accident occurrence is extremely small.
According to the estimate, an accident resulting in release of hazardous materials into
Pearl river from Guangfo road is about once every 236 years.
Mitigation Measures
A series of mitigation measures have been planned to avoid, reduce and minimize the
adverse impacts from both the construction and operation of Guangfo road, which will be
implemented during the design, construction and/or operation stages of the project. More
specifically these mitigation include:

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
Noise
*  At thle section near Shuangqiao mid school and Jiangzhiou primary school, classrooms
in the upper floors facing the road without any barriers will be upgraded with double
glazed windows;
*  For Guangdong commerce school and New World residential development will also
be installed double glazed windows. Any residential buildings built after the road
developed, the developers will be requested to install double glazed windows.
*  Jiaobiao primary school is too close to the road and partially demolished for the road,
the whole school will b relocated to a new place not to be affected by Guangfo road
activities at all.
*  For road section near Jiaobiao and Hengjiao villages, a total of 850 m noise barriers
(400 m on one side and 450 m on the other) will be erected on the elevated viaduct
for noise mitigation.
*  For other residential areas impacted by the road, double glazed windows with natural
ventilation mechanisms will be installed.
*  The entire road will use low noise road surface materials for the final pavement.
*  These sensitive receptors will also be the facilities most impacted by the construction
noise, so some mitigation measures such as relation and double glazed windows
installation will be completed prior to start of construction control and mitigate
construction noise impacts.
*  Construction activities particularly those generating high noise such as drilling, etc.
will be carefully scheduled to avoid the sensitive time such as class hours for school
area, after lunch naps for residential areas, etc.
  The past practices in Guangzhou urban road construction including inner ring road
construction show that night time construction are in-avoidable because the
government wishes to complete the construction in the shortest tine possible in the
busy and congested urban areas. In fact, some activities such as materials
transportation will likely take place mostly at the night time to avoid the heavy traffic
during the day time. The following mitigation measures will be taken for night time
construction:
- Public, particularly residents, in areas immediately adjacent to the construction
sites will be consulted prior to the start of night time construction, to alert them
the noisy activities at the night time, to explain the reasoning for night
construction to obtain public understanding, and to solicit specific public concerns
and suggestions for mitigation;
-  Public billboards will be erected at the construction sites, listing construction
activities, contact persons and telephone numbers for receiving public concerns.,
complaints, and suggestions on a constant basis;
-  The most noisy activities such as piling will not conducted at night where possible;
- Temporary noise barriers may be erected at the most sensitive areas; Some of the
stationary noise machinery such as generators will be located away from sensitive
receptors and in enclosed structure for noise control;
-  Dedicated and trained staff from contractors and constructioll supervision will be
on site for traffic managemcnt and public safety during night time construction;

Guangfo Connecting Road Environmental Impact Assessment
-  Proper signage, fencing and lighting will be used to divert the traffic, alert the
motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic of the safety hazards, particularly during the
night construction;                         I:
- Night time supervision by the environmental monitoring teams will be enhanced
including on-site noise measurement and prompt incidents response.
Air Quality
As part of the Guangzhou Inner Ring road developed (also financed by the World Bank),
a motor vehicle emis:sion control strategy (MVECS) has been developed and is being
implemented. The key elements of the MVECS include a motor vehicle inspection and
maintenance (I/M) program, mandatory old vehicle retirement, bans of using the road
systems for motor vehicles not passing the emission standards, regularly cleaning of the
road surface to control the accumulation of dust on road surface, landscaping, etc. At this
stage, many of these elements are in the implementation stage: A motor vehicle emission
research center is to start the construction soon and I/M program has already started. The
mitigation plan for air impacts for Guangfo road is to be fully integrated into the
Guangzhou MVECS and comply with requirements and implement all measures in the
MVECS.
In,addition, the road side will be fully landscaped with trees, lawns and bushes. This wil
help contribute to the improvement of air quality in the area as well as mitigating the
impacts on vegetation and visual impacts by Guangfo road construction and operation.
Environmental Management
Full-time and dedicated staff will be assigned both during construction and operation
stages for environmental management within the organizations involved in Guanggo road,
including project proponent, design EA and resettlement teams, contractors and operation
company of the road. Personnel training for environmental management will be included
as' part of the institutional strengthening to better equipped the staff for the environmental
control tasks. In both phases, the project will be closed monitored for noise, air quality
anid water quality to confirm the predicted results from this EA and to identify any
unexpected environmental issues so that prompt mitigative actions can be taken to
minimize the adverse impacts.
General Conclusions
OVerall, the Guangfo road alignment is reasonable and optimally selected. Although the
construction and operation of Guangfo road will have adverse impacts to the natural and
socio-economic environment, various measures have been designed and included in the
project design and implementation plan to avoid, minimized or otherwise compensated
the adverse impacts. Following the full, proper and timely implementation of the
mitigation measures, the residual impacts will be reduced to acceptable levels. The
project is environmentally sound and acceptable.
