Environmental Management Plan of Longxi Bus Maintenance Depot
1. Introduction
1.1 Background
In order to support the growth of the public transit fleet in Guangzhou, and to ensure that proper
maintenance is carried out on the vehicles, the municipal government proposes to establish the
Longxi Bus Maintenance Depot.
The site of the Longxi Bus Maintenance Depot is in the Fangcun distnct south-west of
Guangzhou, in an area separated from the city center by the Pearl River. The population of
Fangcun district will increase to 600,000 in the year 2010 from 150,000 now and the bus fleet
will be over 660. There currently is no bus maintenance depot in this district and all the buses
must now go back to the city center to be maintained. The project will reduce the dnving
distance of the buses and enhance the condition of the fleet thereby improving the overall traffic
of the city center
Overview of the Prbject
The project is located at Haibei village of the Longxi Road in the Fangcun district (Figure I - 1)
The land required is 32,151 m2 which includes the road (4743 m2) and land for the faciltties
(27,408 m2). The total floor area is 40,143 m2 which includes the maintenance workshop,
testing room, hazardous goods storage area, velicle washing room, fuelling station and
multi-purpose building.
The facility will be able to maintain a fleet of up to 800 vehicles The three-story parking garage
can park 232 buses and can park other vehicles in daytime. The layout is presented in Figure
1-2.
1.2 Objectives of the EIA and EMP
The objectives of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) are to assess potential effects of a
project on the environment during construction and operation The Environmenital
Management Plan (EMP) of the project supplies the framework for the implementation of the
actions and the environmental management as well as the environmental monitoring. The EMP
provides detailed measures from the EIA and is the reference document for the implementation
of the actions.
The EMP
*  Identifies site-specific mitigation measures: Through the field investigation of the sensitive
receptors and the analysis of the vanous parameters, the EIA team, project office and
representatives of the design team identified environmenital protection and management
measures suitable for the project. All the measures must be cost effective and teclnically
reliable.
*  Provides an exclusive document for implementation: The EMP is one of the documents
which are necessary for the project approval of the World Bank. At the same time, it is also
the key document for enviromnental information during the construction and the operation
of the project for reference by the constructor, the supervisors and other relevant
departments.
*  Identifies institutional roles and responsibilities: The EMP explains the functions and
responsibilities of different organizations and provides direction on reporting.

2. Environmental Protection Measures
2.1 Design Phase
Environment protection procedures are part of the design of the main engineerng.
2.1.1 Noise
According to assessment results of this project, after construction and operation, noise, if not
controlled, would have an adverse impact on the surroundings. The main noise sources, which
could cause exceedance of the standards, are diesel generating set and passing buses of parking
garage. The responsibility for implementing the (lesign mitigation is that of the Guangzhou
Environmental Scientific Research Institute.

Environmental Management Plan ofLongxi Bus Maintenance Depot.
2.1.1.1 Diesel Generating Set
The diesel generating set noise will be rare, occurring only as an emergency power supply, in
the 0600 to 2200 period. It is, however, a significant potential noise source and a number of
effective mitigation measures have been incorporated. The measures are listed below
Noise control of the diesel generatina set
An imported diesel generating set is to be selected, with due regard to the noise control features
of the equipment. The generating set will be equipped with 1 muffler, which has noise
elimination capacity of 2OdB(A) ,an absorber and soft wave pipe The noise level is 105 dB(A)
at 1 meter outside of the generating set and is 110 dB(A) at the exhaust pipe. The level is be
reduced to 90 dB(A) when the generating set has been equipped with the muffler.
Sound Insulation of Generating Set Room
The diesel generating set room is to be constructed as a fully enclosed sound-insulation room.
The thickness of wall is to be 240 mm. The door and windows of this room are designed in
accordance with the requirements of sound-insulated doors and windows. The sound insulation
is to be at least 40 dB(A).
Sound Absorption of Generating Set Room
In order to reduce noise due to reverberation and enhance actual sound insulation in generating
set room, an absorptive plate is laid in the inner wall and ceiling of the generating set room.
Shock Absorption of Generating Set
This project will select a generating set to be equipped with spring or rubber absorber, giving an
absorptive rate is 90-95%. In addition, soft wave pipe is installed at exhaust air vent of diesel
generating set to reduce the influence of intensive vibrant noise, which is caused by
high-pressure airflow in the exhaust air pipe. At the same time, during the generating set
installation, while exhaust pipes are drilled through wall, they will be wrapped with
heat-resistant damper materials to avoid contact with the wall of this room and transmission of
vibration to the wall.
Muffler on the exhaust system
The exhaust system of the diesel generating set will adopt two classes of muffler requirements.
The primary one has a silencing capacity of 20 dB(A) and the secondary one has a silencing
capacity of -35 dB(A). The resulting noise level will be less than 55 dB(A).
Noise control of the ventilation svstem of the generatng set room
Because the diesel generating set room is constructed as a fully-closed sound-insulation room, a
mechanical ventilation system is used in the room. It uses an axial fan to provide supply air, and
an exhaust fan equipped with the set for discharge air. The entrance and exhaust air vent must
be equipped compound muffler chambers; the noise elimination capacity will not be less than
40 dB(A). Noise control must allow for the fact that, ni order to reduce heating of the room from
the exhaust, the exhaust and muffler must have then nial insulation.
Table 2-1 details the quantity and specifications for the noise control equipment, conceptual
design drawing see figure 2-1

2.1.1.2 Parking Garage
As the garage will not have any traffic at night (22 00 to 06 00). the noise impacts occur
primarily during day The mitigation measures include
*  The original garage design will be modified ancl a wall will be erected on the north and west
sides of the garage and all the openings in the original design will be installed with double
glazed noise control windows (5+1.5+5 inm), capable of noise attenuation of 30 dB(A). On
the top floor where there is no roof, a 2.5 in high sound barrier with noise attenuation of
12-15 dB(A) along the entire north side will be inclided in the design to control the noise
impact from this area to the north. The design modification will significantly reduce the
noise levels from the garage. It is predicted that thle noise at I m from the north property line
will be below 55 dB(A), and the noise at the first row of the residential buildings will be 55
to 58 dB(A), complying with the Category II noise standards All residential houses
surrounding the Depot (to the north and west) will be protected by this mitigation measure
*  using sound absorbing material on the inside walls of the ramp area,
*  requinng dnvers to maintam the appropnate gearing and speed for the ramp.
*  strictly scheduling the filling of spaces within the garage so that the buses themselves act as
noise bamers,
*  requiring routine noise measurements o'l all buses using the facility with mandatory
maintenance if thresholds are exceeded,
*  monitonng the noise levels at the houses opposite the ramp and requiring further mitigation
including, for example, raising the walls on the outside of the ramp or enclosing the end if
the noise from the facility ever exceeds the Class IV standard, and if the facility contributes
more than 10 dB(A) above background,
*  acting to eliminate future possibility of land-tsc conflicts by balTing construction of other
unplanned housing within the buffer zone of the surrounding roads.
*  As the most serious impacts (exceeding the appllcable noise standards) will occur at the
houses north and northeast to the site, a sound insulation wall will be built to completely
cover the north side of the garage. On the top floor where there is no roof, a sound bamer
will be erected, along the north side.

2.1.2 Wastewater
2.1.2.1 Wastewater Streams
The sources of wastewater discharges from the Longxi Bus Maintenance Depot are as follows
*   Wastewater from the cleaning workshop from the washling of vehicles;
* Cleaning water from the maintenance workshop;
* Wash water from the refueling station,
* Domestic sewage from the offices, and,
*   Domestic sewage from the dminig-room
According to the project design document ancl past experience with similar facilities, it is
predicted that the total amount of wastewater of this project is 373.4 m3/d (see Table 2-2)
In addition, the "first flush" of storm water could he contaminated withi oil, suspended solids
and other contaminants on the road suiface or othei paved area As the ninoff from the site will
be discharged to the environment directly, the potenitially contaminated storn water/surface
runoff must be treated as well. The quantity of stonn water requmrng treatment can be estimated
by, according the Water Supply and Sewage Design Handlbook:
Q=TPFqt (m3)
Where, P is runoff coefficient and equals to 0.6 for paved road
F is catchment area and equals to 1 6 lia. for the depot (excluding landscaped aiea)
q is storm intensity and is determine(d by the following fonnula
q= 2424.I7(1+0.533LgT)/(t=lI I Of 661 (s ha)
Where, t is precipitation period (minute), t=15 milute in this design
T is the time of frequency of occurrence fot stor m (year), T=5 is selected because it is
the criterion used in stonn system design in Guangzhou
Using the above formula, the volume of storimi water requiring tieatment is estimated to be
326 1 m3 (Table 2-2). Storm water is occasional flow occurring only dunng a storm mostly in
the raining season and is therefore not included in the daily flow rate used foi the wastewater
treatment design. Design provisions will be provided foa those unit processes receiv'ing the
storm water (a separate oil  water separator and the biological treatment process) to
accommodate this occasional flow rate.

2.1.2.7 Treatment results
Following the pre-treatment, the oil concentrations of the wastewater are expected to be below
5 mg/L, and following the biological wastewater treatmnent, other parameters are expected to
meet the Class I discharge standards. The final effluent equality is expected to be as follows;
*  COD          <60 mg/L
*  BOD5         <30 mg/L
*  SS:          <70 mg/L
*  Petroleum oil <5 mg/L
*  Grease       < 10 mg/L
2.1.3 Air Emissions
The design components that contribute to the mitigation of air emissions are listed below for
each major component.
Diesel Generating Set
A modem imported unit will be selected to use # 0 light diesel oil as fuel, which is low sulfur
(0.5%), provides efficient combustion and is low in emissions. The exhaust gas will be
effectively dispersed from the top of the multi-purpose building.
Vehicle Emissions
Exhaust emissions of the buses is the largest source air emissions. The basic function of the
Longxi Bus Maintenance Depot is to provide modem and thorough maintenance of the vehicle
fleet. This will reduce the emissions from the vehicles and contribute to the reduction of
emissions throughout the municipality.
The open structure of the parking garage contributes to the effective dispersion of the emissions.
Green areas within the facility helps improve urban all quality.
Cafeteria Facility Exhausts
The grease and smoke in the cooking exhaust is piped to the top of multi-purpose building by a
gas flue, treated by a water-membrane filter, and dispersed. The control system should be
regularly checked to ensure proper operation.
The treatment process as follows:
oil smoke collection => water-film filter (black smoke) => fans =r acceptable dispersion
Treatment capacity of cooking oil emissions smoke is 33 000 m3. The exhaust gas is piped to
the top of the multi-purpose building by a galvanized gas pipe whose section area is more than
0.8 mi. The velocity of the cooking oil exhaust pipe V = 11.45 mI/s. Then it is drafted by a
centrifugal fan, model T4-72 NO.10, at the building top, treated by water-film filter, model
EYC7.5#, and dispersed.
Wastewater from the cafeteria air control system is treated by the wastewater treatment system
of the multi-purpose building The conceptual design is detailed in figure 2-5.
The main components of the equipment in the cafeteria e\haust gas treatment are showni in
Table 2-5.

2.2 Construction
2.2.1 Noise
In order to minimnize noise impacts on the surrounding envirorunent during construction of the
Longxi Bus Maintenance Depot, the constructor will adopt the following methods to reduce
noise influence:
*  Prohibit noise equipment (e.g. impact pile drivel) to operate at break time (12 00-14:00)
and at night time (22:00-06:00).
*  Select low noise equipment or equipment with noise insulation and elimination devices.
*  Builder must appropriately arrange construction time and site. According to constructive
requirement, the location of noisy operations is as far away as possible from the receptors
(Fengci Village and Nan Village), i.e., the southeast corner of the project site.
*  Equipment will be regularly maintained, and strictly operated.
*  The boundary of construction site near Fengci village and Nan Village will have a
temporary enclosure for sound insulation, or barrier for noise isolation and absorption.
2.2.2 Water
Because there is a lot of silt in construction wastewater, it can not be directly discharged, but
must be treated by settling before being discharged. A temporary settling pond will be built to
intercept and hold site drainage before it is discharged to the ditches.
A septic tank will be built on the construction site to hold and treat wastewater from dinning
room and sewage from on-site facilities and donnitory of the contractor.
Equipment on-site must be refueled in accordance with groundwater protection. Spills of oil or
fuel must be cleaned up inmmediately. Spill response equipment must be available to handle the
quantities and types of materials that will be present on site.
2.2.3 Air Quality
The following measures will be adopted to prevent or reduce dust:
*  Transportation corridors will be located away from residential areas and other sensitive
points and dust control measures (covers) will be applied to vehicles transporting materials.
*  Site enclosure structures and water spraying, twice a day during dry weather will be used to
suppress dust.
*  Measures to minimize dust due to on-site mixing and unloading operations will be
implemented.
*  Concrete mixing stations will be located as far as possible from housing at the perimeter of
the site.
* Proper operation, maintenance and repair of power generators and construction machinery
will be carried out to minimize emissions.

2.3 Operation Phase
2.3.1 Noise
The noise from the buses, particularly at departure (06.00-08:00) and arrival (20:00-22.00),
requires mitigation. The houses to the west will be most affected by the buses on the ranp
between floors of the garage, particularly at niglht when they are climbing the 10% grade of the
ramp. Mitigation includes:
* There will be no bus access between the hours of 2200-0600
* Prohibit vehicles from using horns, except in emergency situations;

*  In drainage design of the gas station, must consider the presence of the open ditch
connected to the oil separation tank so as to collect surface wash water run-off and any
leaked or spilled oil.
*  Emergency Response Plan There are a senes of emergency response plans and emergency
system and administration organizations in Guangzhou. Staff of these departments have
had working experience and been trained to respond to various emergencies.
*  In order to avoid leaked fuel (e.g. oil) and hazardous clemicals entenng water ways and
avoid leakage of dangerous matenials during transportation, the traffic department is in
charge of controlling of business transport license According to the rules signed transport
license is required for the transport of dangerous goods by public security department; once
an accident occurs, it must be jointly handled by the EPB, Public Security Bureau,
communications department and fire-fighting department.
*  License of Transport of Dangerous Goods: According to the Guangzhou dangerous articles
transportation (see also GZ Commrunications Develop. (1994)No. 128 ) all transportation of
dangerous goods must be checked and issued a Licen. e of Road 7ransportation Business
by murncipal communications department, and have certifications of approved transport
route. Technical conditions of vehicles for transportation of dangerous goods are excellent.
These vehicles must be equipped with fire resistance devices and fire-fighting equipment,
and have markings of dangerous articles. There are special transport vehicles for each kind
of oil and oil mixtures. At the same time, transport vehicles must have explosion protection
and electrostatic grounding devices, and their exhaust pipes must be equipped with a
reliable flame annihilator and protective baffle o0 themnal baffle to avoid combustibles
droppmg on exhaust pipe. And trio-cars, tradlers, tractor, non-motor vehicles and

3. Environmental Monitoring Plan
Environmental monitoring is normally carried out to assess the effectiveness of mitigation
measures during construction and operation, react to unanticipated environmental problems as
early as possible, and confirm environmental impact forecast An environmental monitoring
plan must be designed to reflect the different phases of the project and identify requirements for
sample collection and analysis, data disposal, and reporting requirements.
It is through environmental monitoring that supplemental environmental protection methods
can be implemented to improve mitigation measures if necessary.
3.1 Monitoring Locations
3.1.1 Construction
The main monitoring factors during construction are noise, vibration and ambient air quality
impact on Fengci Village and Nancun Village. In addition, suspended particulate (mostly air
borne dust) will also require to be monitored regularly. There are 2 construction noise
monitoring spots, which are 1 meter outside of the first row of houses facing the project in
Fengci Village and Nancun Village (Figure 3-1). 'lTe monitoring frequency is two days every
week and once in a day, at daytime and nighttiie for noise and vibration. Night time noise will
be undertaken whenever the work is carried out in the late evening beyond 22:00 hours.
In addition, the contractor and construction supervision will be requested to conduct
self-monitonng and kept the result in record. This will primarily be visual observations for dust,
noise, traffic disruptions, muddy road, and other enviromnental impacts from the construction
activities
3.1.2 Operation
The main monitoring factors during operation are noise, water quality and vehicle exhaust.
Four noise monitoring locations are proposed at 1 meter beyond the boundary of the facility and
two monitoring locations 1 meter outside of the first row of houses facing the project in Fengci
Village and Nancun Village diesel generating set room, air compressor room, maintaining
workshop and parking garage (Figure 3-1) .The mornitonng frequency is one day every quarter,
and two periods including day and night. The purpose of water quality monitoring is to confirm the
treatment effect of the wastewater treatment facility There are 2 water quality spots, including entrance
and drainage opening of sewage treatment devices. The monitoring frequency is one day monitoring
every quarter

3.3 Monitoring Organizations
Water quality and noise are monitored by the Guangzlhou Environmental Protection Science
Institute. Guangzhou EPB will be in charge of supervision, regulatory review and compliance
enforcement.
3.4 Analysis and Management of Monitoring Data
Environmental monitoring data of this project is important for future environmental
management. It can determine whether future environmental quality changes are as predicted.
In order to provide the scientific basis for establishing or aniending environmental management
methods, it will be necessary to establish file management and database management of
environmental monitoring data, and compile analysis and assessment report of the
environmental monitoring results. The detailed requirement as follows:
*  Report Content: original data (including parameter, monitoring location, monitoring time,
and environmental conditions) statistical data analysis and assessment of environmental
quality, and authorizing signature.
*  Report Frequency: submitting one comprehensive report every quarter, and one overall
report every year
*  Report Submnission: Reports will be submitte(d to the Guangzhou EPB, the World Band and
the const-uctor. Copies will be sent to the environmental impact assessment group who
carried out the assessment of the facility.
*  Report response: the project proponent and owner/operator of the facility will be
ultimately responsible for the environmental peifonnance at the facility. If the monitonng
results show that the impacts exceeded what is predicted by the EIA or any other
unanticipated expects, they will be responsible to plan for necessary additional mitigation
measures to ensure any such impacts will be initigated and reduced to acceptable levels.
