MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A SKILLS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of
Indonesia for US$27.7 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a
term of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate,
and would help finance a Skills Development Project.
2.          Background. Indonesia's economy expanded rapidly in the 1980s in response to
reforms deregulating the economy and opening it to trade. The growth of the manufacturing sector
and of exports, which more than doubled between 1987 and 1992, has created expanded employment
opportunities and is expected to continue at over ten percent per year. Export-oriented manufacturing
is currently based on relatively labor-intensive, low-technology and low-skill production, which takes
advantage of Indonesia's abundant supply of low-wage labor. Nevertheless, increased competitiveness
and productivity will be a key to sustaining future growth especially as Indonesia is beginning to face
increasing competition in export markets from some of its ASEAN neighbors. The 1993 Country
Economic Memorandum stresses the need to improve productivity, efficiency and quality throughout
the whole economy in order to sustain economic growth. One of the key instruments to achieve this
will be an increasingly skilled labor force. The existing skills training system of Indonesia overall is
not capable of meeting the challenge to increase competitiveness via productivity. In order to meet
the expansion and changing nature of industrial production, the technical training capacity needs to be
substantially upgraded. Lack of early attention to the human resources requirements of industrial
development could lead to ski!l bottlenecks and constrain growth.
3.          Government Subsector Strategy. Following substantial expansion of access to basic
education at the primary level, the Government of Indonesia plans to implement its obligatory nine-
year basic education program, as well as to improve the quality of basic education, with Repelita VI
starting in 1994. The Government recognizes the importance of general basic education as the
foundation for further acquisition of specific technical skills either through pre-service or on-the-job
training. The 1993 Guidelines of State Policies (GBHN) emphasizes the importance of human
resources development and the reduction of unemployment. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is
concerned about the low internal and external efficiency of its public training institutes (BLKs/KLKs)
and has decided not to invest further in these centers until thorough studies are conducted, and a new
development strategy is carefully formulated in the context of the study. The Government supports
the position that more demand-driven, industry-based training systems need to be developed, and that
the Government should provide the private sector with incentives to develop skills training capacity at
the initial stage on a cost-sharing basis. The Government intends to demonstrate the effects of
demand-driven and industry-led skills training programs and has requested Bank assistance to initiate
these programs. A key element of this new approach will be the provision of financial incentives to
private enterprises which are willing to participate in such training.
4.          Project Objectives and Description. The proposed demonstration project has three
objectives: (a) to develop and implement innovative industrial skills training schemes within private
enterprises in three provinces (West Java, East Java and North Sumatra) for possible replication in
other pail. of the country in the future, as part of an overall training program to promote productivity
and efficiency of the economy; (b) to support a special training program for unemployed university



-2-
graduates in five provinces (the three mentioned above plus South Sulawesi and Bali); and (c) to
strengthen policy making, research, planning and management capabilities of the MOM. The above
objectives will be achieved by providing technical assistance, equipment, instructional materials, staff
development and funding support for industry-based and demand-driven skills training for various
activities which could be grouped in two main components based on implementation responsibilities:
(a) provincial component; and (b) the Ministry of Manpower component.
(a)   The Provincial Component would establish, in the provinces of East Java, West Java
and North Sumatra, a Provincial Training Fund (PTF), governed and implemented by a
private sector-led board and a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), respectively. The
PTF would finance training services with a special emphasis on productivity
enhancement, through contracts, to industry on a cost-sharing basis and would be open
to all eligible, public and private training providers. The activities this component
would support can be summarized as follows:
(i) Company Group Training Services would encourage medium sized companies to
carry out efficiently and effectively, high quality training by the establishment of
Company Group Training Units (CGTUs). The CGTUs would establish the
training function to be an important business activity in companies; improve the
training skills of training managers and supervisors in industry; and increase the
capacity for training staff in industry. CGTUs would identify company training
needs, prepare training plans, implement training or arrange for training to be
provided on contract, and evaluate training programs. They would also assist
companies manage training, and design and implement on-the-job training
activities. The project would also support newly established, off-the-job, in-
service training programs;
(ii) Individual Companv Training Services would encourage the development of the
training function and consequential training activities in large or technologically
advanced companies by assisting individual companies to employ new, full and
part-time training managers. The responsibilities of the training managers would
be similar to those described for CGTUs in the preceding paragraph. The
objective is to encourage companies to efficiently and effectively carry out high
quality training by putting special emphasis on productivity improvements;
(iii) Targeted Training of Job-Seekers would: demonstrate the benefits of demand-
led training of job-seekers; encourage the training providers to learn how to
reorganize the delivery of their training to meet private enterprise needs; and
foster closer linkages between training providers and industry. The PTF would
receive proposals from training services providers (both public and private) for
performance-based contracts and the PTF would only pay the individual unit
training cost for course graduates who would receive employment in a job
related to the training received; and
(iv)  Small Enterprise Training and Advisory Services would assist selected small
companies, mostly in the modern, formal sector, to grow by supplying
customized training and consultant services focused on owners as key
influencers; and developing the management capacity of the officers of



3 -
associations and groups of small companies to assist their members to develop
their businesses.
(b)   The Ministry of Manpower Compcne:it would strengthen the policy making, research,
planning and management capabilities of MOM; and enhance the impact of the
provincial component through the following four subcomponents:
(i) The Young Professional Entrepreneur Development Program (PMP) would test
the effectiveness of several approaches to alleviate unemployment problems of
university graduates in five provinces. The approaches were piloted under ILO-
supported programs which provide for special training, counseling and some
capital support. Based on actual results from the ILO programs, about 70% of
the persons completing the PMP should succeed in starting small businesses as
an average of about three jobs would be generated with each small business
established. An information system for self-employment would also be
developed through a study which would recommend the type of information and
approaches required to serve the needs of entrepreneurs and support
organizations interested in entrepreneur development;
(ii) The Local Labor Market Information System would support development of a
system for systematic analysis of the labor market which would help design,
monitor and evaluate labor market policies and programs. This information
system would largely build on existing data sources and it would produce and
disseminate information relevant to national and provincial organizations;
(iii) Staff Development would strengthen the capacity of the MOM staff for policy
development, research, planning and management through overseas and
domestic fellowship programs. The Ministry is being reorganized and there is a
shortage of wel!-qualified staff at upper and middle management levels which is
a limiting factor in carrying out the functions of the Ministry; and
(iv)  Preparation of a PTF Scheme for South Sulawesi. The Government has selected
South Sulawesi as the next province to implement a PTF scheme following the
completion of the proposed project. Preparation of the South Sulawesi PTF
would be supported.
5.          Total project cost is estimated at US$39.7 million, of which US$10.3 million would be
in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan would cover about 70 percent of the total cost,
excluding reserved procurement of vehicles and taxes and duties; GOI wouid finance the rest.
Schedule A shows the breakdown of project cost and financing plan. Amounts and methods of
procurement, allocation of loan proceeds and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations are given in Schedules C
and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 12748-IND dated
February 14, 1994 is being distributed separately.
6.          Project Implementation and Sustainability. At the national level, a Project Steering
Conmmittee would facilitate the overall project implementation, and it would be responsible for policy
coordination. The Provincial Components would be implemented by the Governors concerned
through a PTF Board and a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) established in each of the three



-4 -
participating provinces. A PIU in the newly established Board of Planning and Development in the
Miniistry of Manpower would be responsible to implement the MOM component. The activities of
the proposed project span a wide geographical area, and effective coordination and management are
especially important. To support project implementation, adequate technical assistance (national and
international consultants) would be provided. There may be a risk that some of the project activities
may not be sustained following the completion of the project. The levy-grant scheme already
authorized independently by the Government would provide a significant source of funding to meet
the requirements in the three project provinces so as to sustain the efforts supported by the projects.
7.          Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Projects. Important lessons from the Manpower
Development and Training Project (Loan 2705-IND) for the private sector are: (a) private sector
training expenditures and expertise are low and there is a need to develop a capacity to react to
increasing competitive pressures; (b) for the private sector to be willing to develop training, it needs
to be permitted to play a significant role along with government in the management of training and
transparent arrangements need to be established to achieve this; and (c) supporting the development of
in-plant training is more successful when employers are involved in the ownership of the process and
when private sector experts are involved. compared to such an initiative inanaged directly by
government. Other major lessons are that the role of MOM should change in order to focus on
creating the enabling environmnent for the private sector to develop training and to supervise rather
than control this development. Also MOM needs to: (a) promote the participation of all interests in
the training system; (b) gradually decentralize authority to provincial level and develop management,
coordination and technical skills at both national and provincial levels; and (c) develop its training
operations to be more self-financing, efficient, flexible and relevant. The concept of the proposed
project and its implementation arrangements draw upon these lessons -- the project is solely demand-
driven, and the private sector will play the key role in its implementation.
8.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. Involvement in skills training is an important part of
the Bank's human resources development strategy. Building on the continuing improvement of the
quality of formal education, the GOI is now giving high priority to the acquisition of specific
technical skills. The overall training system is at a critical stage of development and it is important
that all interested parties contribute financially and participate equitably in the system to ensure that it
is effective, sustainable, flexible and responsive to changing skill demands. As pointed out in the
Country Assistance Strategy presented to the Executive Directors on December 22, 1992, the Bank's
human resources development strategy in Indonesia includes new approaches to industrial skill
development. This new strategy supports a shift from the "expansive" phase of government
interventions to "second generation" service delivery that emphasizes quality of services, improved
efficiency, decentralized management and delivery, and an expanded role for the private sector. By
providing support for these objectives, the proposed project is fully consistent with the Country
Assistance Strategy. The Bank can also play an important role in bringing the lessons of international
experience to bear on the Indonesian case.
9.          Actions Agreed. During negotiations, the Government agreed to:
(a)   carry out PTF activities in accordance with operating procedures and eligibility criteria
satisfactory to the Bank;
(b)   (i) furnish to the Bank for comments a proposal for the establishment of a levy-grant
scheme for the financing of training of staff of manufacturing enterprises in West Java
and North Sumatra, and for the amendment of the scheme in East Java, not later than
Dcceimber 31, 1996; and (ii) to implement the new and amended levy-grant schemes in



-5-
the project provinces not later than June 30, 1997, taking into account the Bank's
comments on the criteria for such schemes;
(c)   by August 31, 1994, (i) establish the PMP Private Sector Management Committees and
Project Coordination Units; (ii) prepare and send the detailed action plan for
implementation of the PMP to the Bank for review and comments;
(d)   establish a guaranteed loan repayment scheme not later than September 30, 1994, for
graduates having completed the short-term or medium-term training programs, in
accordance with criteria acceptable to the Bank, including loans for capital for the
development of small businesses of up to Rp 2 million for graduates of the short-term
training model and Rp 5 million for graduates of the medium-term training model;
(e)   for long-term domestic training and overseas fellowships: (i) select the fellows using
criteria acceptable to the Bank; (ii) identify a post for each candidate for long-term
domestic training and overseas fellowships at the time of selection; and (iii) upon their
return, assign graduates to these posts;
(f)   (i) send TORs for the two project evaluation studies to the Bank bv June 30, 1995 for
review and comments; (ii) carry out such studies not later than December 31, 1995 and
December 31, 1996; and (iii) furnish the findings and recommendations to the Bank for
review and comrnents; and
(g)   (i) carry out technical audits, acceptable to the Bank, of the training services provided
through the PTF and the operation of the PMP every six months during the
implementation of the project, commencing not later than February 1, 1995; and (ii)
send copies of the audit reports to the Bank for information.
10.         The condition for disbursement against the category of expenditures for equiprnmnt
would be that GOI has procured vehicles for the three PTF PIUs.
11.         Benefits. The major benefit would be the demonstration of provincial skills
development mechanisms to implement a variety of innovative approaches to industry-based and
industry-led skill training. During the project, approximately 77,000 existing workers would be
trained in a variety of short-term programs. In addition, the project would also test schemes that
would provide training, counseling and capital support to about 5,500 young professionals (university
graduates) who would want to establish small businesses. Existing studies suggest that this component
would create about 11,500 new jobs within the newly established businesses. The project would also
enhance productivity of an estimated 4,000 small businesses through targeted advisory services.
Other benefits include: (a) increased capacity for skill training in the participating firms; and
(b) improved linkages between labor, firms and training providers resulting from an enhanced
participation of employers in quality improvements in industry-based training and dissemination of
relevant labor market information. At the central level, the project would improve planning and
policy making, research and industrial training support capacity of the MOM.
12.         Risks. In order to reduce the potential risk related to the sustainability of the project
activities, the new and amended employer levy-grant schemes to partially pay for these activities
would be implemented in the three PTF provinces not later than June 30, 1997. Effective
coordination and management among all the conce-ned government agencies and the private sector are
especially important to the attainment of project objectives. To address these concerns, an effort has



-6-
been made to reduce the complexity of the implementation process by decentralizing project
implementation to the participating provinces. Foreign consultants would also be used to supplement
the implementation capacity of the PIUs. Also important, the project must have the strong
commitment of private sector employers. To address this issue, tbe" Governors of the project
provinces would appoint private sector representatives to chair their respective PTF Boards and select
PIU Directors from the private sector.
13.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recomnmend that the Executive Directors approve the loan.
