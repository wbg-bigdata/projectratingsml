MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH II PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendations on a proposed development
credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for SDR 44.4 million (US$57.3
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be
on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity and would help finance an
Agricultural Research II project.
2.      Background.  Agriculture in Pakistan accounts for 22X of GDP, employs
52% of the labor force and contributes 551 of export earnings. During the
Sixth Five Year Plan (FY84-FY88) agricultural output grew at some 3.81
annually against a plan target of 4.9% per year. Although Pakistan has
attained self-sufficiency in wheat production, and has become a major exporter
of cotton and cotton products, the agricultural sector is constrained by
structural and institutional weaknesses, and is still characterized by low
productivity and yields in most subsectors. Faced with a rapidly growing
population (3.11 annually) and limited opportunities for increasing the area
of land under irrigated or dryland cultivation, Pakistan will have to increase
the productivity of existing farmland to maintain its self-sufficiency in
basic food crops, such as wheat and maize, and meet the increasing demand for
other agricultural commodities. Pakistan also aims to improve small farmer
incomes, diversify agricultural production into higher value crops
(horticulture, livestock), increase agricultural exports, substitute local
oilseed production for imports, and reverse the degradation of its land, water
and forest resources. While the sector requires investment in rural
infrastructure (irrigation rehabilitation, drainage, salinity control,
farm-to-market roads), it also needs considerable development in research and
extension services to improve the productivity of existing resource use, open
up new opportunities for small farmers, enable sector diversification, and
preserve the agricultural resource base.
3.      Substantial inputs from the Government of Pakistan (GOP) with Bank and
other donor assistance have gone far to establish a viable federal
agricultural research system. However, such is not the case at the provincial
level, and it is clear that if Pakistan is to have an effective agricultural
research service to benefit most of its farmers, the provincial agricultural
research services need strengthening. Several subsector reviews have
identified the following major constraints in the provincial agricultural
research systems: (a) ineffective planning, programming, monitoring and
evaluation of research pertinent to farmer problems; (b) insufficient training
and research qualifications of many of its scientists; (c) inadequate
operating funds to conduct meaningful research; (d) inappropriate systems of
staff service; (e) insufficient understanding of farming systems and little
on-farm research to remedy priority problems; and (f) ineffective linkages



with the extension services for effective transmission of demonstrated
improved technology to farmers.
4.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project forms an integral part of
GOP's agricultural sector development strategy which IDA supports, and which
aims to expand the ongoing program of assistance to agricultural research and
extension, and to support ongoing investments in irrigation rehabilitation,
drainage, and agricultural resource protection and management. It focuses
mainly on improving provincial research planning, administration and execution
and, together with the Agricultural Research I Project (Credit
1158-PAK)(ARP I), which established the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council
(PARC) as an autonomous national research agency to provid- research
leadership and coordinate and guide research in Pakistan, and planned future
assistance to research, is a part of a long-term effort to substantially
improve agricultural research throughout Pakistan. The strengthening of
research and extension is pivotal to improving agricultural productivity,
output and income, expanding diversification, and increasing export earnings
and import substitution. IDA!s involvement in the project will help ensure
that GOP's program to improve overall research capabilities moves ahead as
quickly as possible, provincial research administrations are reorganized, and
a high-priority research program emerges which will support GOP's investment
in agricultural extension. USAID, the only other donor likely to support this
large program, is already assisting two large research projects (which the
proposed project would complement), and is unlikely to finance another in the
near future.
5.      Proiect Objectives.  The proposed project's objectives are to:
(a) improve and strengthen research capabilities in the provinces;
(b) consolidate and complement the advances achieved under ARP I at the
federal level, that is, within the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council
(PARC) and the National Agricultural Research Center (NARC); (c) support high
priority research programs at the federal and provincial levels; and
(d) improve and strengthen research/extension linkages. The project is part
of a planned stage-by-stage program of IDA assistance to the research
subsector and, while mainly supporting the provincial research systems, it
would also continue to develop the capabilities of federal research systems to
plan, monitor, evaluate and coordinate agricultural research at the national
level.
6.      Project Description.  The project would be IDA's first large-scale
assistance to the provincial research services, and would strengthen
provincial research planning and management by establishing a semi-autonomous
research organization in Sind which would merge its crops, livestock and
fishery research, and Agricultural Research Boards in Punjab and Baluchistan.
It would provide each of these bodies a management support unit or secretariat
to assist with research planning, monitoring and evaluation, and would prepare
provincial research master plans (PRMP) to cover the next ten years for each
of the four provinces. The project would support the provinces, using a
farming systems approach, undertake diagnostic studies of the main
agro-ecological zones to develop appropriate research programs to solve the
farmers' most critical productivity problems and improve research/extension



- 3 -
linkages. It woul1d also support, through both national/provincial coordinated
research programs and provincially funded research programs, research on
horticulture, livestock, soil science, integrated pest management (IPM), and
social sciences. Following the preparation of the provinces' PRMPs, the
project would provide funds for new items of provincial priority research
identified in PRMPs.
7.      To continue the development of federal research systems which began
under ARP-I, the project would strengthen PARC's Social Science Division, and
-       expand its Planning Directorate to give it a greater capacity for research
planning, monitoring and evaluation. At NARC the project would construct a
new crop sciences office block, a community center and some 5 km of link
roads.  It would also support NARC's development of research programs in
horticulture, livestock, soil science, IPM and social sciences to enable WARC
to more fully complement provincial programs in these areas. Finally, it
would initiate and expand research programs in Pakistan's mountainous,
northern area, and provide technical assistance and training at both the.
federal and provincial levels.
8.      Proiect Costs and Financing.  The project, to be implemented over
seven years, has an estimated total cost of US$81.9 million equivalent with a
foreign exchange component of US$51.8 million (631). IDA's Credit of SDR 44.4
million (US$57.3 million equivalent) would finance 70X of project costs, or
100l of foreign exchange costs and 18X of local costs. Schedule A shows a
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan, while Schedule B shows
amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the procurement
schedule. Schedules C and D give a timetable of key project processing
events, and the status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan. The attached map
shows the main agricultural research institutions and agro-ecological zones in
Pakistan, while the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7614-PAK dated May 21, 1990,
is being circulated separately.
9.      Agree_d Actions.  At negotiations GOP and the provincial governments
(GOProvinces) agreed on the following: (a) Sind would establish a
semi-autonomous research organization by June 30, 1991, while Punjab and
Baluchistan would change Public Service regulations to improve the recruitment
and promotion of agricultural research staff and establish new Agricultural
Research Boards by June 30, 1991; (b) the four provinces would establish
management support units to assist with research planning, monitoring,
evaluation, and project implementation by December 31, 1990; (c) PARC would
establish its new Planning Directorate by December 31, 1990; (d) PARC and the
provinces would meet periodically (every three months) during PRMP preparation
to ensure a degree of uniformity in approach; (e) Punjab and Sind Agricultural
Universities would enter into twinning agreements with overseas universities
to assist upgrade their Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology, and
Agricultural Social Sciences faculties, respectively, by June 30, 1991, and
also sign a memorandum of agreement with PARC for funds to finance the
twinning arrangements and social science research by December 31, 1990;
(f) the provinces would only use the research funds provided for provincial
priority research for programs identified and specified in PRMPs as approved
by IDA; (g) by December 31, 1990 the provinces and PARC would each sign a



- 4-
contract to employ an internationally recruited consultant firm to assist in
introducing methodologies to assess the priority of research investments,
establish or strengthen research monitoring and evaluation, prepare PRMPs
(provinces only), undertake diagnostic surveys of the major farming systems
(provinces only), initiate and strengthen research programs in the priority
areas of horticulture, livestock, soil science, IPM, and social sciences, and
place and administer long and short-term trainees in foreign universities and
programs. The signing of these contracts would be a condition for disbursing
against civil works, equipment, furniture, books and journals, training and
incremental operating costs except for a small amount to cover urgent initial
expenditures; (h) the Soil Survey Institute of Pakistan would employ
internationally recruited consultants to assist in computerizing soil science
data by December 31, 1990; (i) PARC would employ consultants to assist design
thle crop sciences building, and help with other project implementation matters
as needed; (j) the provinces would appoint working groups to prepare PRMPs by
October 31, 1990, submit the first PRMPs to IDA for review by August 31, 1992,
annually update PRMPs and send to IDA for review by March 31 each year, and
provide adequate capital and operating and maintenance funds each year to
implement PRMPs; (k) PARC would define broad national research priorities and
establish guidelines for the allocation of resources to these priorities by
November 30, 1990; (1) GOP would provide PARC adequate funds to enable it to
successfully implement its long-term research plans as contained in the
National Master Agricultural Research Plan; (m) PARC and the provinces would
each, jointly with IDA, assess project implementation at the end of the
project's first two implementation years, that is, not later than November 30,
1991 and 1992, and would make any needed changes in project design or
implementation; and (n) PARC, assisted by internationally recruited
consultants, would undertake a mid-term review of the project no later than
January 31, 1994, and would implement any changes in project organization or
design agreed with IDA.
10.     Benefits.  The project would upgrade and strengthen the provincial
research effort, improve the efficiency and effectiveness of resources
allocated to research, and build sustainable research systems, sensitive to
national and provincial priorities, and the critical production problems which
farmers face. Strengthening of key research programs, and closer
research-extension-farmer linkages should translate into technology to help
farmers to overcome the key bottlenecks to enhanced production and thereby
raise their incomes.
11.     Environmental Effects.  Project activities would contribute
substantially to improving and safeguarding the agro-ecosystems. The project
would establish integrated pest management programs throughout Pakistan which
would reduce the use of pesticides and pesticide contamination of food and
pollution of water resources.  The soil science programs would concentrate on
work which would increase the efficiency of irrigation water use, reduce
water-logging, reclaim saline soils, improve the design of drainage systems,
and design techniques for water harvesting and storage in rainfed areas.
Livestock programs would look at regenerating rangelands and other grazing
areas, and introducing livestock production systems which allow the
sustainable use of these areas. Lastly, the project would finance



- 5 -
multi-disciplinary research programs in the Northern areas of Pakistan
directed at not only increasing agricultural production but also improving and
protecting the land and water resources of the area.
12.     Risks. The main risks are resistance to major institutional changes,
inadequate funding and farmers possibly not adopting research recommendations.
Technical assistance and training would facilitate the institutional changes.
Improved research planning, resource allocation, monitoring and evaluation
would promote a more efficient use of research resourcesas well as promoting a
stronger case for adequate resource allocations thereby lessening funding
constraints. Formulating research programs with a farming systems perspective
and attention to strong research-extension-farmer linkages should ensure
research program relevance, and farmers' acceptance of the programs.
11.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
