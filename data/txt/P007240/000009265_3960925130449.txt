Petroleum gxaloration Promotion Proiect (Credit 1208-GUAI
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Guyana - Petroleum
Exploration Promotion Project (Credit 1208-GUA)" prepared by the Latin America
and the Caribbean Regional Office. Part II, based on the Borrower's comments,
highlights performance shortfalls by the Bank as well as the Borrower while
confirming the positive overall outcome of the project.
The project aimed at promoting oil exploration by foreign oil
companies, appraising heavy oil deposits, and strengthening the Governmunt's
Petroleum Unit. Although the heavy oil component was not carried out, other
project components achieved their objectives. Four exploration contracts were
successfully negotiated with international firms; the capacity building component
was implemented (although with excessive emphasis on academic education); and
petroleum legislation was passed (under different financing).
The Bank's performance was mixed. Inadequate project preparation
support delayed processing and lack of follow-up on a possible restructuring of
the project ultimately resulted in the cancellation of about half of the loan
amount.
Overall, the outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory, its
institutional impact as substantial, and its sustainability as likely.  The
Project Completion Report is thorough and informative but comments were not
requested from co-financiers.
No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOTION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1208-GUAM
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Petroleum Exploration Promotion
Project in Guyana, for which Credit 1208-GUA in the amount of SDR 1.7 million (US$2.0 million)
was approved on February 16, 1982. The credit was closed on September 16, 1987, one year and a
half behind schedule. It was partly disbursed (52.1% of amount) and the last disbursement was on
September 16,1987. The notice to cancel SDR813,862 (47.9%) or US$1,174,371 was sent on
September 23, 1991 to be effective as of date of last disbursement.
Trhe PCR was jointly prepared by the Trade, Finance, Industry and Energy Operations
Division of the Latin American and Caribbean Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I
and m), and the Borrower (Part II). The Government has transmitted its contribution on March 22,
1993 and it is summarized in Part II and fully copied as Annex 1.
Preparation of this PCR was started five years after the official closure because the project
was carried as "active" in the hope of completing it, once disbursements would be reauthorized.
However, since the Government did not present a justification for the reactivation, the final decision
to close the credit retroactively as of September 16, 1987 was made on September 23, 1991. The
preparation is based on the President's Report (no Staff Appraisal Report was produced); the
Development Credit Agreement; supervision reports; correspondence between the IDA and the
Borrower; and internal IDA memoranda.

PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOIION PROJECI
(CREDIT 1208-GUA'
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
The objectives of the project were: (i) to attract foreign oil companies to explore Guyana's
sedimentary basins and hopefully discover and produce petroleum; (ii) to confirm the existerce of
heavy oil at shallow depths onland to the south-east of Georgetown and develop it to substitute for
imported fuel oil in existing power plants; and (iii) to strengthen the Government's capability to
administer the petroleum sector.
Implementation Exnerience
Credit effectiveness and project start-up needed considerably more time than initially
estimated. The project took quite a while to get implemented, around two years after Board approval
or one year after it was declared effective and then another 22 months before the promotion seminars
were successfully held in London and Houston in February 1986. Initial delays were due to (i) the
inability to anticipate the need for counterpart funds to help launch the project, (ii) the shortage of
competent local staff to properly set up a Petroleum Project Unit having administrative experience
with IDA projects, and (iii) the difficulties encountered by the Association in its efforts to set the
project in motion (para. 5.1). In retrospect, these problems could have been alleviated, had the IDA
made use of an extremely useful instrument, the Project Preparation Facility. In this context,
qualified consultants could have been hired two years earlier and the Petroleum. Unit could have been
adequately manned almost at the onset. In that same vein, the heavy oil component could have been
easily completed within one year if the work had been carried out by consultants; the idea of using
force account to implement this component, turned out to be ill-founded.
PeMject Results
The petroleum exploration promotion component achieved its objective, namely to attract
oil companies for exploring Guyana's oil prospective basins. As of date, work under four
exploration/production contracts has been initiated as a result of the promotion effort. This is the
measure of a very successful promotion component. The second project component, the heavy oil
component, could not be carried out because of lengthy discussions on whether working rigs were
available, and whether it would be better to have the oil companies look for shallow oil possibilities.
Subsequently, the component, could not be carried out because credit disbursements were suspended
by IDA due to unpaid arrears to the Association. The training portion of the exploration component,
covering on-the-job training as well as special short training courses for professionals, was
successfully carried out. However, most of the financial resources earmarked for training were spent
on college education for three students, two of whom now are employed by the Petroleum Unit.



- iii-
Sugainabkiiy
Thanks to comprehensive training and institutional buildup efforts including establishmer.t
of a Petroleum Unit and of modern petroleum legislation, there are good reasons to believe that
project achievements will be sustained for the longer term.
Findings and Lessons Learned
The main lesson from this project is tha it would be to IDA's and the Borrower's
advantage to prepare a project using staff trained in project management and engineers who have
knowledge of IDA procedures. In this case, the project officers were not acquainted with the
potential of a project preparation facility (PPF) advance to provide bridge financing for initial project
costs. This led to a very s'-w start, resulting in a two-year delay in consultant selection and contracts
fmalization, in turn leading to loss in the Borrower's enthusiasm. Furthermore, undue complications
related to outside financing (UNDP, Commonwealth Secretariat) could have been avoided, had legal
consultants been selected at appraisal time (Section 4,B of Part III).
The proposal to create a national oil company, initially supported by IDA missions, was
later discarded by the Goverrnent under IDA prodding. In retrospect, this decision proved prudent,
especially since no oil has yet been found.
Another lesson is that, when a project runs into difficulties and much time (Section 4B of
Part III1 elapses before effectiveness is declared a short reappraisal may be desirable in order to
confirm that the appraised project is still on track.
Concerning the training component, college education, though very useful, does not always
constitute adequate or timely training to ensure effective project implementation.
Finally, as indicated by the Government (Annex 1, para 7), continuity of project officers
would have helped project implementation.

PROJE(:T REVIEW FROM IDA'S PERSPECTIVE
1.  Wect Identiy
Project Name:                Petro:eum Exploration Promotion Project
Credit Number:               1208-GUA

Country:                     Guyana
Sector:                      Energy
Subsector:                   Petroleum
hnplementing Agency:         Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM)
2.1  Guyana's small economy is based in the production and export of sugar, rice and bauxite.
Shordy after independence in 1966, the Government took over the means of production which were in
hands of foreign companies. By 1980, newly created public companies and state-owned financial
institutions accounted for about three-quarters of GDP. On one hand, rising petroleum prices and
accompanying inflation resulted in a decrease of trade, and on the other, the Govermnent's continued
intervention in running what was left of the private sector led to shortages of basic commodities and
flight of capital and skills. Export volume and real gross domestic income had deteriorated to the
point that in 1980, the latter amounted to only 88% of 1976 levels.
2.2 In recognition that a long-term program was required to address the fundamental development
constraints of the economy, a three-year program to progressively remove subsidies and price
controls, to increase interest rates and limit wage increases, was adopted in 1979 with IMF support.
However, the economic situation continued to deteriorate and the IMF agreement was suspended
because of insufficient compliance with agreed targets. In late 1980-early 1981, the GOC with
renewed IMP and IDA support took the following steps: electricity and transport tariffs and rice
prices were raised; an export development fund was launched and a comprehensive wage incentive
scheme was introduced in the public sector. Despite these measures, the economic situation continued
to worsen. However, the GOG's development strategy aimed at resuming economic growth, creating
employment and strengthening the balance of payments through the expansion of export-generating
and efficient import-substituting activities.
2.3  Despite Guyana's continuing economic difficulties, it has a good resource base and long-term
economic potential. Guyana's total energy consumption in 1980 amounted to about 5 million barrels
of oil equivalent, petroleum imports accounting for 80%. The remainder 20% is made up of
traditional sources such as wood fuel, charcoal, rice chaff and bagasse. Because the country's
hydropower capacity is insignificant (2MW), thermal power plants were the main source for
electricity generation and they consumed imported residual (bunker) fuel. Guyana was facing severe



energy problems because of its heavy dependance on petroleum products imports for energy
requirements and its non-existent petroleum resource base. Therefore, petroleum exploration
appeared particularly attractive since it could be carried out by the private sector and because a small
discovery even of heavy oil would go a long way toward alleviating Guyana's dependence on imports
for power generation.
2.4 The value of total petroleum products imports had iw:reased fromn US$21.6 million in 1973 to
US$140 million in 1980 mainly as a result of the first two oil shocks of aRd 1973 and of 1977,
despite some assistance from Trinidad. The major energy user is the baui :e ndustry, accounting for
about 44% of fuel imports, while the utility power company (GEC) accoui.ts for 13%, and the
balance is split between the sugar industry, transportaticn, domestic consumers and small industry.
2.5 The country's power generation capacity which amounts to 165MW is almost entirely based on
thermal plants that consume residual/bunker fuel. Alternate energy sources such as wind, solar and
peat use have been investigated in studies financed by OLADE and USAID. Energy conservation
measures have been successfully implemented particularly in the bauxite industry where savings of
about 18% were recorded in 1980.
2.6  Not only Guyana produces no crude oil or natural gas, but it has no refining capability, and
rather limited storage capacity. Therefore, because Guyana was facing severe energy problems as a
result of its heavy dependance on imported petroleum products whose prices were increasing fast, the
Government was very receptive at the IDA's proposal to initiate a petroleum exploration project to
promote Guyana's prospective sedimentary basins. Though some sporadic exploration had taken
place in the offshore territorial waters and also in the interior basin of the Takatu Rift, no commercial
oil was discovered, only some minor shows in the remote Takatu area.
2.7 Potential investors in petroleum exploration in Guyana would have to face the political
problems resulting from the claims on part of its territory by Suriname in the offshore, and by
Venezuela in the interior (in this particular case, about one third of Guyana's land!). This border
issue was later discussed at the Issues Meeting, and the consensus was that the Association would not
deal with this issue, in other words would ignore it until faced with the fact, which so far has not
manifested itself.
2.8  At the time of appraisal, MEM was aware of the need to improve the institutional set-up for
petroleum exploration and in particular it realized the insufficiency of its current petroleum
legal/fiscal framework. Home Oil, a Canadian concern, was doing exploration work in the Takatu
Rift Basin and a small independent promoter joint-venture from Texas and Canada was holding some
offshore acreage in the hope of promoting it to large companies. The petroleum potential of
Guyana's sedimentary basins appeared rather modest. There was need, therefore, to enhance its
positive outlook and the IDA project was to address precisely this problem but within the entire
petroleum context, that is including promotion and most important the modernization of the
legal/fiscal framework.
3. Proiect Obectives and Description
3.1                    Thoect Objective. The main objectives of the Petroleum Promotion Exploration Project were
primarily to attract international oil companies to explore in Guyana's onshore and offshore
prospective sedimentary basins, and subsidiarily to conduct a magnetic-gravity survey, and if the
results warrant it, to undertake shallow drilling operation onland for shallow (300-500 m) deposits of
heavy oil assumed to exist in Guyana as in neighboring Suriname. Other objectives of the project



- 3 -
resu,ts warrant it, to undertake shallow drilling operation onland for shallow (300-500 m) deposits of
heavy oil assumed to exist in Guyana as in neighboring Suriname. Other objectives of the project
were first, to provide technical assistance for establishing a professional management unit (Petroleum
Unit) in the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) to monitor exploration activities, and, second, to
carry out the training of local professionals in modem petroleum exploration and management
techniques.
3.2  Proect Descripion. The project was deigned around two components, one for petroleum
exploration promotion (A) and another, (B), for evaluating the heavy oil possibilities onshore in SE
Guyana.
3.3    Component (A) or Peo-leum Exploration Promotion Component, provided for:
(a)  petroleum exploration consultants (40 m-m) to help
(i) collecting, compiling, organizing and interpreting existing geological/geophysical
data which were previously acquired by private oil companies;
(ii) preparing documents on areas to be offered to international oil companies and
conducting promotion seminars;
(iii) negotiating jointly with legal consultants exploration/production contracts;
(iv) monitoring the activities of operating companies; and
(v) integrating newly acquired data for GOG's guidance;
(b) Legal consultants (10 m-m) to assist in
(i) preparing a draft Petroleum Act with its regulations and a model contract; and
(ii) negotiating exploration/production contracts;
(c) Accounting and management consultants (12 m-m) to help
(i) installing modern petroleum accounting procedures, and
(ii) establishing a small Petroleum Project Unit to be responsible for monitoring
petroleum exploration/production activities;
(d) Training of Guyanese professional staff in petroleum exploration techniques and related
activities such as laboratory procedures (staff was not identified at appraisal); and,
(e) Purchasing equipment and materials needed for exploration/production supervision
activities.
3.4    Component (B) or Evaluation of Heavy Oil Possibilities Component provided for



4 -
(i) technical support;
(ii) a gravitylmagnetic survey;
(iii) if justified, the d,illing of at least three shallow slim holes to look for heavy oil
that could be used directly as replacement fuel for the existing power plants.
4. Proiect 12esign and Qrganization
4.1   The project was conceived and designed as a petroleum exploration promotion effort to attract
international oil companies to explore the onshore and offshore domains of Guyana, with the
expectation that even minca oil discoveries would contribute to alleviating Guyana's petroleum bill.
The project was organized along two lines, the promotion line as described above, and the direct
search for shallow (300-500 m) occurrence of heavy oil (140 API) expected to exist some 70 km
onland from the Atlantic shore. Oil was known to occur in Suriname and was assumed to have been
generated farther offshore and then have moved in onland reservoirs.
4.2   The promotion component was to deal with areas of difficult access - the offshore and the
interior onshore basins, whereas the heavy oil component could be carried out by the Government's
Petroleum Unit in an area about 170 km to the southeast of Georgetown. The first component would
take between three and four years before drilling would start in the case of a successful promotion,
while the second component could be implemented within less than a year and hopefully bring some
production of heavy oil at low development costs, to fuel power plants, and thus in part offset some
high cost diesel imports.
5. Proect Implementation
5.1      Credit Effectiveness and Prolect Start-up. The project, pre-identified in December 1979
and identified in September 1980, was appraised in March 1981 and negotiated in Washington in
December 1981. Board Approval was on February 16, 1982 and signing some nine months later, on
November 24, 1982. Effectiveness was finally declared on March 30, 1983. The delay of about 13
months after Board Approval was due to administration constraints in complying with effectiveness
requirements and also because of lengthy discussions with UNDP concerning a UNDP project which
was duplicating in part the Association approved Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project. The
initial Completion Date was June 30, 1985 and Closing Date December 31, 1985. An extension of
the Closing Date to December 31, 1986 was granted on December 23, 1985. A request by the GOG
for a second extension until December 31, 1987 met no favorable answer by the Association because
disbursements from all IDA loans had been suspended as a result of unpaid arrears. However, the
credit was maintained on the 'active" file. In early 1988, a proposal to move the Closing Date to
December 31, 1988 was not acted upon. Finally, in April 1990, an IDA mission then in Guyana for
the appraisal of a Structural Adjustment Project agreed with the Guyana Natural Resources Authority
(GNRA) who was in charge of petroleum matters, that a request for justifying the reactivation of the
credit be forwarded to the Association for its consideration. The mission also recommended
reallocating the remaining credit funds (SDR814,000) to finance: (i) compilation and interpretation of
the newly acquired exploration data; and (ii) a comprehensive study of Guyana petroleum products
supply and distribution systems. Unfortunately, the Association did not seem to have actively
followed up on the reactivation of the project (there is no evidence in the files of any follow-up
action). Failing to receive such a request, the Association informed the Government of its decision in
late 1991 to close the credit retroactively as of the date of the last disbursement, i.e. September 16,
1987 and therefore confirming the cancellation of the balance of SDR 813,862.25.



-  -
5.2      Credit Conditions. During project appraisal, the Government agreed on the following
conditions:
a)  MEM would establish a Petroleum Unit with the necessary counterpart personnel to
execute the project;
b)  Not later than 60 days after completion of the review of the petroleum legislation and
model contract by the legal consultants, the report would be sent to the Association
for comments;
c)  The decision on establishing a national petroleum corporation as well as its timing,
staffing and scope of activities would be reviewed jointly by the Government and the
Association;
d)  Before proceeding with the drilling for heavy oil and as a condition of disbursement
of this component's funds, the GOG would agree with the Association on a detailed
proposal for its execution; and
e)  The proceeds of the sales of geophysical data and studies would be placed into a
special account and these funds would be used exclusively for energy sector surveys
and studies.
5.3      Petroleum Exploration Promotion. A well known exploration consultant prepared the
petroleum potential appraisal report on Guyana's prospective basins, which was offered to interested
oil companies (para 6.2). The promotional seminars were organized by that consulting firm, one in
London (26 entities represented) and one in Houston, Texas (37 entities attending). The technical
presentation was well received, but the petroleum legislation presentation was viewed by the oil
companies as rather awkward. In fact, oil companies never liked and still do not like the so-called
'sliding-scale" type contract whereby taxation increases (or decreases) are triggered by the producing
company's rates of return previously negotiated. This type of contract may be good for very large
discoveries, but is detrimental in the case of marginal discoveries, which were targeted under the IDA
petroleum effort. IDA missions encouraged the Government to show more flexibility in its petroleum
legislation so that traditional concession contracts and production sharing agreements could also be
negotiated by willing oil companies.
5.4      The training portion under the Petroleum Exploration Promotion component, was carried
out following two lines: The first was the traditional on-the-job and specific short courses, and two
professionals, one manager and one lawyer benefitted from this approach . The second line consisted
of sending interested students to foreign colleges in order to acquire additional degrees in petroleum
geology. Three recipients were sent to Canadian schools.
5.5      Guyana New Petroleum Law. The objective of a modern Petroleum Law is to establish a
legal and fiscal framework for petroleum activities, upstream and downstream, putting the emphasis
on attracting high-risk foreign investments. In countries like Guyana where no oil has been
discovered yet, the petroleum law must be simple, flexible and attractive in its terms as well as fair
for both sides of an agreement, so that even marginal discoveries can be developed. Also an
exploration/production agreement either directly with the Government or else with a state enterprise
(NOC) should provide the holder of the exploration rights with the right to exploit its discovery
without the Government being free to refuse the grant of a license to produce a commercial
discovery.

5.6      Based on these schematic lines, the Association argued successfully against the petroleum
act proposed by the group preparing the modem legislation who were keen to protect the interests of
the country at the cost of attracting no one. These specialists wanted a fiscal scheme which was
difficult and complicated to administer, was carrying a "sliding-scale' type of taxation whereby a
certain level of taxes was triggered by previously negotiated levels of rates-of-return, and was
generally opposed by the oil industry willing to make high-risk investments. IDA missions finally
succeeded in having the new legal/fiscal legislation preserve flexibility in types of agreements, either
production sharing or concession exploration/production contract agreements. The result is that
Guyana, despite its modest potential, attracted four international firms as renowned as TOTAL (CFP),
MOBIL and- Huint Oil (Section 4,A of Part HI).
5.7      Variance in Project Implementation. An important change in the project had already
occurred before the signing of the Development Credit Agreement in November 1982, when the
Association agreed with the Government's request for the study of the petroleum legislation
framework and model contract preparation to be financed through a grant of the Commonwealth
Secretariat and carried out by their specialists. It was also agreed that the study would be reviewed
by IDA staff to ensure that the proposed legislation framework fit with the IDA's proposed project of
Petroleum Exploration Promotion. This modification freed around US$135,000 for other activities.
5.8      A few months later, at the time of Credit Effectiveness, another project modification was
agreed upon concerning the size of the scope of work initially designed to be undertaken by the
exploration consultants. The finding out that the MEM petroleum files contained all the important
data and information acquired during previous exploration activities by independent oil companies,
enabled to save another US$135,000 that had been allocated to data gathering by consultants. Finally
it was agreed that an aggregate amount of US$280,000 would be transferred to the Heavy Oil
Potential component if justified and needed after confirmation of speculated heavy oil occurrence in
an area to the west of the border with Suriname (para. 4. 1).
5.9      Evaluation of Heavy Oil Possibilides. Long delays incurred in starting Part B or the
second (heavy oil) component of the project, was due to several factors. First, the Petroleum Unit
which consisted of one person did not have the specialists nor the funds to hire them to undertake the
assignment. After Credit Effectiveness when funds became available, rig availability in Guyana
became a big constrain. Then, when a couple of small rigs for shallow depth were spotted, they were
in such a dire state of disrepair that a big chunk of the credit proceeds would have to be dedicated to
refurbish them. Finally, after discouragement set in, it was decided to present this shallow oil
opportunity to oil companies interested in exploring the coastal basin of Guyana. However, there was
no taker, and the idea of looking for and developing the shallow oil potential belatedly reverted to the
Petroleum Project Unit. But it was too late as disbursements under IDA financed projects had been
suspended. Nevertheless the idea was, and still is a sound one and the Government is still wishing to
find proper financing to undertake the exploration.
5.10     Finally, in relation to condition (c) in para. 5.2, after much discussion, it was decided to
discard the idea of creating a NOC.
5.11     Implementation Schedule. The project was originally scheduled to be completed by June
30, 1985. However, it was necessary to extend the original Closing Date from December 31, 1985 to
December 31, 1986. The activities pending at the time of the first Closing Date were:



-7-
- preparation of the petroleum potential evaluation of the sedimentary basins, and
- starting the heavy oil component.
5.12     Procurement. IDA guidelines were followed in all steps of the project. Evaluations of
bids were thorough. Terms of reference, shortlists of consultants, selection decisions and draft
contracts were reviewed by the Association prior to their finalization.
5.13     Poect Cost. The estimated project cost to be financed at appraisal and approved by the
Board was US$2.0 million (SDR1.7 million). Shortly after credit negotiations, the GOG requested
changes in the credit allocation. Before Credit Effectiveness, the IDA agreed to delete the legal
framework review and preparation portion of the promotion component, the reason being that UNDP
and the Commonwealth Secretariat were to finance this basic study through grants. Finally the cost
of the project at Closing Date was SDR886,000 or US$930,000, after Component B (heavy oil
evaluation) had not been implemented.
5.14     Disbursements. The credit was not only slow in being disbursed, but was closed when
only 52. 1% had been expended. The estimated and actual disbursements of Credit 1208-GUA are
presented in Section 3, Tables A and B, of Part III. At the original Closing Date (December 31,
1985) about 34.5% of the credit amount was disbursed. Disbursements were made for 100% of
foreign costs and 85% of locally purchased materials or equipment.
5.15     Proiect Risks. The risks that the project faced at the time of appraisal though well
founded, did not materialize. The geology after the work of the exploration consultants was
completed, appeared sitificiently attractive so that, to date, four more exploration contracts have been
signed on top of the two already in place in early 1981. Despite Guyana's record in nationalization
of foreign enterprises, some international oil companies were attracted to make high-risk investments
in Guyana, thanks to investment insurance agreements with Canada and the US.
5.16     Credit Allocation. The original and final allocation of Credit 1208-GUA are shown in
Section 5,C of Part III. There was no change in the way credit proceeds were allocated, for the
credit was suspended before contemplated modifications could be formalized.
5.17     Actions/Decisions Made or Not Made that Most Affected Project Implementation. There
is a clear evidence, as per Section 4,B of Part Im that, had the PPF approach been followed, the
project implementation and proceeds disbursement would have been accelerated by more than two
years. This would have also allowed the immediate hiring of key experts for the Petroleum Unit as
well as for the implementation of the heavy oil component and, most important, to the early success
of the promotional effort, finally for the swift preparation of the legal/fiscal framework in a
businesslike manner.
6. Prject Results
6.1      Uroject Objectives. Of the diree main project objectives, two were achieved - attracting
high-risk exploration investments and the training of Guyanese professionals, while the third objective
- the drilling to confirm the possible occurrence of heavy oil, was not implemented (para. 5.5).
6.2      Physical Results. (a) The petroleum promotion component of the project was successful
first in selling some 18 reports (15 on the offshore and 3 on the onshore) which brought in between
US$500 to 600 thousand, and then in attracting four oil companies to sign high-risk exploration



- 8-
contracts (Section 4 of Part III). These companies have already drilled two wildcat wells and are
planming to drill another two in the near future. (b) The establishment and the strengthening of the
Petroleum Unit within the MEM, though for the first two years it was a one.man unit because
potential engineers were sent to school to get a college degree. Later the Project Unit was transferred
to the GNRA. The unit has contributed favorably to the exploration effort. (c) The training of two
professionals immediately improved the management of the petroleum subsector, and the education in
the petroleum area of three young professionals should have contributed, by now, to the strengthening
of the Petroleum Project UJnit.
6.3      Financial Performance. The beneficiary of the credit being a Government entity (MEM),
it is not financially independent since its budget is part of the State's budget, and therefore it has no
financial statements to present. Regarding the project finances, the final audit report of the project
account implies that proper accounting procedures were followed. However, there is no record in the
files of an audit of the special account for handling the proceeds of sales, in line with Section 4.01 (b)
and (c) of the Credit Agreement (Section 7 of Part III), and there is no report concerning the use of
these funds.
6.4      Impact of Project. (a) The Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project has already had some
impact on both the country and the oil sector. The country as a whole has benefitted financially
directly and indirectly. Direct benefits which include the yearly payment of acreage rental fees,
represent some welcome income; and indirectly: the financial fall-out of exploration activity such as
geophysical surveys and well drilling. Using a rough rule-of-thumb of 10% of offshore and 30% of
onshore costs, an estimated US$2 to 3 million in local expenses could have stayed in Guyana. It is
not possible to estimate the direct Government income from petroleum activity because of a lack of
factual information in LAC files. (b) The training element of the Exploration component has resulted
in the strengthening of the institutional set-up dealing with the petroleum subsector.
7. Project Sustainability
7.1      The project has provided Guyana with technical and institutional benefits through training
of professionals, and the establishment of a Petroleum Unit and modern petroleum legislation.
Another favorable outcome of the project, under strong IDA suggestion, is the harmonization of
petroleum products prices with the prevailing Caribbean market prices. In short, it is expected that
the mentioned benefits will be sustained for the long-term.
8. IDA Performance and Lessons Learned
8.1      Overall IDA performance was mixed. The project was properly identified. Its
preparation, however, was lacking particularly in what concerns the use of early expense financing
facilities such as Retroactive Financing in case the Government would have agreed to finance the
needed advances, or, better, Project Preparation Facility (PPF) which is an advance from the
Association to be refinanced under the credit. If the project appears to have been adequately
supervised by altogether 16 missions, however in terms of staff weeks, 19 only (Section 8,B of Part
III), it was insufficiently supervised, particularly because of the comph:xity of petroleum exploration
promotion projects and also because of the lack of domestic personnel knowleable of the petroleum
industry and of expert counterpart. This aggregate figure might appear high, but it is entirely
justified because of the difficulties and complexities of a promotion project, in particular the
petroleum legislation which has an important and lasting effect. For instance, eight missions relating
to the promotion effort were to New York, London and Houston to coordinate the efforts of the
consultants, discuss their contribution, harmonize the differing opinions and monitor the final



- 9 -
preparation of the seminars; and nine missions have visited Guyana.
8.2     It is unfortunate for the Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project, and this has nothing to
do with the Association performance, that the IDA had to make the decision to cease disbursements
on all ongoing projects on account of unpaid arrears, and therefore, admittedly, prevented the
implementation of the already much delayed second component (Heavy Oil). But the most important
component of the project, namely the exploration promotion with the training of personnel, has been
successfully completed, and bore more fruit than expected (Sections 4,B and 6,A of Part III).
8.3     It is worth noting that there was no follow-up on the April 1990 mission and the mission of
November, 1990 for the second Structural Adjustment and the "Petroleum Technical Assistance
Projects (CR 2168-GUA and CR 1208-GUA). Follow up on the missions' recommendations would
have ensured the reactivation of the credit and perhaps the completion of the Heavy Oil component or
else, the use of the remaining funds for consulting services (i) for monitoring the exploration work of
oil companies active in Guyana; (ii) for some geologic mapping; and (iii) for optimizing the process
of shipping and handling of imported petroleum products.
8.4 Lessons Learned were:
a) That by using the PPF approach, much time would have been saved (Para 5.1 and
Section 4,B of Part III);
b) That supervision missions to the country itself were not sufficient, particularly at project
start-up time which basically lasted a good two years (paras 5.7 to 5.10 and Section 4,B
of Part III);
c) When a project has a protracted slow start, probably a project reevaluation would be
useful when implementation speed is reached. Also when a project moves at a very slow
pace, it may be necessary to increase the supervision effort and missions as necessary to
help solve the incipient problems; and
d) Another issue was that most funds initially earmarked for training were spent on
education (college degrees), thus depriving project training and correspondingly proper
manning of the Project Unit with professionals (para 5.4).
9. Borrower's Performance and Lessons Learned
9.1      The project which was properly identified by the IDA and later prepared by the
Government with IDA assistance, was implemented by the Borrower's newly created agency, the
Petroleum Unit. Because the Petroleum Unit was scantily manned (only one professional), this
Government agency was not able to move forward as swiftly and decisively as it hoped, but
nevertheless, it accomplished the difficult task of successfully carrying out the petroleum exploration
promotion component.
9.2      Section 4 and Section 7 of Part III present a summarized log of project implementation.
One can see that the implementation of the project was rather slow, and the explanation for the slow
pace of project start-up, rests in great part with IDA's failure to propose the use of Project
Preparation Facility or PPF advance, so that the project could start rolling and tap the existing
enthusiasm. Once the project started in earnest, after a more than two-year delay, implementation
went well and the exploration component was successfully completed. However, the reporting



- 10-
obligations were apparently performed unevenly, and LAC Files do not contain progress reports,
either quarterly or yearly. The only audit report which is available in the files is the cumulative
statement of expenditure prepared by an outside auditor after completion of the 1988 exercise. This
report presents the end 1987 situation. There is a discrepancy in relation to the project accounts
between IDA's booked expenses in US$ dollars and the auditor's report for the project expenditure.
This minor difference is due to the use of differing exchange rates for non US$ denominated
expenses.
9.3      Thanks to the insistence and knowledgeable approach of the Government, four exploration
contracts have been negotiated (Section 4,A of Part mII).
9.4      Lessons leairned were:
(a) when a proje,ct starts at a very slow pace, usually the country representatives are not
familiar with the Association reqairements in project management, and therefore more
care should be given to solve the problems by increasing the number of missions to the
country itself, particularly the manning of the Petroleum Unit (para 6.2); and
O) continuity in project officers assigned would have helped project implementation
(Annex 1, para 7).
10. Project Relationship
10.1    IDA relationship with the Government of Guyana and later the Guyana Natural Resources
Authority has been good throughout the project cycle.
I1. Consultant Services
11.1     The consultants performed well. The exploration consultancy firm contracted to prepare
an evaluation of the petroleum potential of Guyana sedimentary basins and organize the promotion
seminars (London and Houstor) made a good work, which was instrumental in attracting new private
exploration investments. The individual petroleum consultant hired later in the implementation effort
to advise the Petroleum Project Unit and the Ministry during and after negotiation of
exploration/production agreements, made a valuable contribution. His services have been retained for
this intermittent assignment, at Government's expense.
12. Projection Documentation and Data
12.1     Project documentation and data include legal documents, the President's Report (PR),
supervision reports, and other relevant correspondence. Progress reports and annual audit reports, if
provided by the Borrower, are not in the files.
12.2     Ihe Legal Agreements and the PR were adequately prepared and served satisfactorily
during project implementation. Supervision reports provided a good comprehensive picture of the
implementation progress.
12.3     Most of the data needed for the preparation of the PCR were readily available in the
Central Files.

PART ll
PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPEIVE
The Government contribution under Part ll was received on March 22, 1993 and is
reproduced with its cover letter under Annex 1. The Government's input mainly brings precisions
from the Borrower's point of view, most of them were either not known or were not clearly
expressed in the Latin American Region Project Files. These comments represent a valuable
contribution to understanding the project and its benefits to Guyana.
Principal among the comments are the following:
* Some uncertainties in some areas not foreseen in the project documents might have led
to some delays in project implementation (para. 3.4);
* Because Guyana emphasized the need to get the Project Guyana Basin Report promptly
finished and the new petroleum legislation in place under different financing, Guyana
succeeded in promoting its petroleum potential (para. 3.5);
* Failure to implement the Heavy Oil component was due to delays by the consulting firm
to prepare a contract and by the IDA for not approving said contract prior all
disbursements to Guyana were ceased (para. 3.6);
* Failure to implement Part A(c) and not fully utilize Part A(e) funds was due to a certain
lack of support on the part of Guyana's authorities (para. 3.7);
* The Project was undoubtedly a success since one of the main objectives was to attract
foreign investment in Guyana exploration (para. 5.1) and this was realized to the tune of
four exploration contracts signed until this day with two wells drilled (para. 5.2), or
total financial commitments of US$45 rmillion (par. 5.3);
* IDA Performance is judged uneven, particularly because of change of project officers,
the new ones insisting on applying IDA procurement rules despite Guyana experience
(para. 5.7); and finally,
* The IDA should have insisted on the formation of a properly staffed Petroleum Unit
(para. 8.1).

2.1  PrjectQ912jecdvs - The main objectives of the Petroleum fPomotion Exploratloti
Project were primarily to attract Internationa oil companies to explore in
Guyana's onshore and offshore prospective sedimentary basins and subsidiarily
to conduct a slolow drilling operation on the Caribbean shore for shallow (300-
500m) deposits of heavy oil assumed to extend into Guyana from neighbouring
Surname. An andllary objectve of the project was first, to provide technial
assistance for establishing a professional maagement uwit (letoleum Urit) in thf
Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) to monitor eploration activities, and,
second, to carry out the training of local professionals in modern petroleuni
exploration techniques.

2.2  Projec DescriRft   - The project was designed around two components, one for
petroleum exploration promotion (A) and another for evaluating the heavy oil
possibilities on the coast of Guyana (B). These components consisted ofi
(A)  Petreu-m Eplratior Promotion Component, which provided for.
(a) petroleum exploration consultants (40 m-m) to help (i) collecting, compiling
and organizing existing geological/geophysical data; (iil preparing
presentation of documents on areas to be offered to internadonal oil
companies and organing promotion seminars; (iii) negotiating jointly
with legal consultants exploration/production contracts; (iv) monitoring
the activities of operating companies; and (v) integrating newly acquired
data for GOG's guidance;
(b) Legal consultants (10 m-m) to assist in (i) preparing a draft Petroleum Act
with its regulations and a model contract; and (ii) negotiating
exploration/production contracts;
(c) Accounting and management consultants (12 m-m) to help (ti) Installing
modern petroleum accounting procedures and (ii) establishing a smal
Petroleum  Unit to  be  responsible  for monitoring  petroleum

(B)  Ev_luation of Hev  Ol Psilti  CoMo          which provided for
technical support including a gravity/magnetic survey as wel as the
drilling of at least three shallow slim holes to look for heavy oil that could
be used directly as replacement fuel for the existing power plants.
3.   Project DeslAn and Oruanizalon
3.1   The projects main objective of promotig Guyana's Petroleum potentala was
dearly conceived and understood by all parties. The heavy dependence of
Guyana on imported petroleum products had lead to a large proportion of the
countys scarce foreign reserves being udlised to finance these imports. The
petroleum potential of Guyana was already established after the discovery of oil
deposits In one of GuyaWa's two sedimentary basins (The Takutu Basin, some 440
km SW of the Capital, Georgetown). There, then existed a defnite need to

promote this potential with the main focus being on the scantily explored offshore
Guyana Basin.
3.2  In conceiving the project there were four main areas of focus (a) Compiling of a
technical data base and reinterpreting this data, (b) Redrafting of the Petroleurn
Legislation, (c) Strengthening of the Petroleum Unit and (d) Exploring for
possible heavy oil deposits over the onshore coastal extension of the Guyana
Basin. (Such deposits were found in Suriname to the east).
33   These concepts were discussed at length and resulted in an adequately prepared
project document, with the objectives dearly defined and allocation of funds
reflecting the relevant priority of the individual items.
3.4   The roles of the various institutions and agencies responsible for the project was
dearly defined in the final project dooument   However, during Its
Implementation there were some uncertainties in some areas which might have
led to delays in executiorL Some of the pFersomel who were involved in the
project negoatitions, because of various factors, were not involved in the
implementation - the Chief, Petroleum Unit, who resigned in late 1982 and tWe
Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Einergy and Mines who was assigned other
responsiilities.
3.5  in retrospect, because the emphasis was placed on ensuring that the Guyana Basin
Project report was completed and that the new legislation was In place (though
this part was not completed from funds provided for In the project), Guyana
succeeded in promoting effectively, Its Petroleum potenial.
3.6  Failure to Implement the Heavy Oil component was manly due to delays by the
consulting frmn chosen (BRASPETRO) to formulate an appropriate contract and
a delay by the Bank In approving his contract before the deision was made to
cease disbursement on al Bank loans to Guyana.
3.7  Failure to inplenient Part A (c) and not fully udtising Part A (e) was not due io
organization or design of the project, but in failure by the Mw to provide
assistance to the Petroleum Unit for the former, and laborious, time corsuming
procedures for disbursement approval by the Bank for the latter.
4.   Project- hMle_mentation
4.1   Variaace In ProJt IMpeatio  - The major variances between planned and
actual project implementationwere (a) Part A (b) - te item was mutually agreed
to be carred out with grant funds from the Commonwealth Secretariat utlising
their expets and the Assocation's  role wasl merely to review the fial

documents prepared, (b). Part of the funds allocated for Part A (a,, were later
found, after review of the Petroleum Data base by the Consultants, to be
unnecessary and (c) The Heavy Oil component was delayed owing to various
factors, and not implemented.
4.2   Variances (a) and (b) could not have been avoided since the Agreement was
already signed and the funds allocated. Variance (c) could have been avoided if
the MEM (Petroleum Unit) had the personnel and support to quicldy identify
consultants and to evaluate the drill rigs available in Guyana at the time.
4.3  The project risks idendfied prior to implementation as stated in Part 1, para 5.10
did not materalise. However, because of the protracted delays in the project
unplementation, the tirng of the seminars and subsequent date for submission
of bids by prospective investors colndded with a period (July, 1986) when oil
prices had spiralled downwards to $7 -8 per barrel. This could not haVe been
foreseen at the time.
5.   ELP q s
5.1   Pflect Obtecgye  - The prject was undoubtedly a success. One of te main
objecdves viz attracting investment for petroleum exploration In Guyana was
realised. The training of Guyanese professionals for the Petroleum Unit was
partially fulfilled noi because the intention was not there but because simply the
funds allocated were exhausted.  The cost assocated with undergraduate
university trainlng had been much higher hn antdipated at the outseL
Unfortunately, the third major objective - the Heavy 011 component - was not
completed as stated earlier and for reasons also stated earlier (para 4.2).
5.2 j.hysical Results - as stated In Part 1, para 6.2 some 18 data packages were sold
since 1986. The prices of these packages had to be revised downward (from US
$45,000 to US$25,000 for the offshore and from US$25,000 to US$12,000 for the
onshore). One coastal area package (US$3,0) was aso sold. The companies felt
that the prices offered were too high To date (March 1993) two wildcat wells
were drilled, one offshore and one onshore (Takutu Basin) and there are plans to
drll more. Four Production Shating Agreements were signed (3 offshore and one
onshore) by various foreign companies. The Petroleum Unit was strengthened,
both by use of training funds allocated for this project and by dtse that were
provided by the foreign oil companies.

5.3  Impact of Project - As stated in Part 1, para 6A, the project has already had an
impact on Guyana. Some US$%5 millon has already been invested of wich US$5
- 6 nMllion has been spent locally. Training and Rental fees accruing to
Government amount to US$1.4 million (up to Decembr 1992). Please note that
there were no signature bonus payments made as mentioned in Part 1, para 6.4.
6.   Project Sustainability - covered adequately in Part 1 para 7.1
7.  'Bank _P9&onanZ The project suffered somewhat by a change midstream in
personnel overseeing the project.
and the relationsnip between the parties "soured" slightly. The delay in
disbursements had caused some embarassement but the consulting firm (ECL)
was accommodating. The insistence on half payment on invoices when ordering
equipment and payment of the remainder on delivery, excluded some reputable
intnaional firms and caused not only embarrassment, but inordinately
prolonged delays. Most fims insisted on ful payment before delivery.
8.   Borrower's Perfmance Borrowers performance was affected by the lack of
support personnel In the Petroleum Unit and the inexperience of the persm
heading the Unit in supervising such a project. Unfamiliarity with Bank's rules
-aused mistakes to,be made initially. The systems at the Ministry of Fmance for
handling disbursements was slow Inidtially, but improved as fte project
proceeded. In retrospect MEM's accountins staff should have been given tis
task.
8.1  The Bank should have insisted on one of the conditions precedent - the formation
of a properly staffed Petroleum Unit. Lack of support, placed a heavy burden on
the one professional. However, the additional professionals, though identified,
were not available after project signatwe.
9.    rtRelations   Relationship between the Bank's and Borrower's personnel
was generally good troughout with the exception of the comment made Lin
para. 7. This did not have any detrimental effect on the project but it did delay
start up of Part B.
