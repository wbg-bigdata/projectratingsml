INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY
FOR THE FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Paraguay for the equivalent of US$14h5 million
to help finance the Fourth Highway Project. The loan would have a term
of 25 years, including five years of grace, with interest at 8% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Paraguay in September 1973 and again
in February 1974. The resulting updating economic report (299a-PA) was
distributed on May 10, 1974. A summary of Country Basic Data is attached
as Annex I.
3.        Paraguay is a predominantly agricultural country of about
2,4 million inhabitants, located in the flat tropical heartland of the
South American continent. After a long period of political and economic
turmoil following the Chaco War (1931-35), the country's economy recovered
in the 1960s and achieved an average annual growth of 4.6% per annum during
1962-72. Output growth proved insufficient to provide adequate employment
opportunities, but continued emigration to neighboring Argentina helped to
contain the growth of population, eased the unemployment problem and permitted
an improvement of almost one-fifth in per capita income during the decade.
In 1971 per capita income was estimated at US$280, which was less than one-
half of the South American average. Its distribution, however, was about
the same as that of the continent. Literacy rates appear to be higher than
for countries at a similar stage of development, although educational
facilities are below average.
4.        Paraguay is a landlocked country and conducts most of its world
trade through Argentina and Brazil. The high cost of shipping its products
to the nearest seaports has delayed the country from taking full advantage
of its agricultural and labor resources and determined the nature of its
export trade. Paraguay specializes in the production of agricultural and
livestock goods with high unit values. In addition to world market fluctu-
ations, a significant part of the country's exports is dependent on supply
and demand fluctuations in neighboring countries. Paraguayan economic
prospects appear to be favorable, however, over the longer term. Extensive
areas of unused land suitable for agropastoral and forestry production
provide opportunities for large scale colonization and expanded production.
Technological improvements, now under way, are expected to increase
substantially the productivity of land already under cultivation. The
country's vast water power resources are expected to provide a plentiful



-2-
source of cheap energy and foreign exchange earnings. Additional
transportation facilities are expected to enhance further the compe-
titive position of Paraguayts products in world markets. Finally, the
deepening of agricultural and forestry products-processing industries
is expected to continue raising the value-added content of Paraguayan
exports.
5.        Economic growth accelerated in the 1970s.  Between 1969 and
1973, overall output increased at an average rate of 5.5% per annum.and,
despite a setback in 1971 resulting from adverse weather conditions, the
aggregate production target set by the 1971-75 Development Plan was met
in 1973. The Paraguayan economy responded quickly to the stimulus provided
by rising world demand for its export products during the period. The sup-
ply response was facilitated by earlier investments in transportation,
official assistance to mechanize agriculture, and the reinforcement of
fiscal and credit export incentives. Export earnings boomed between 1969
and 1973, easing the foreign exchange constraint to growth and boosting
domestic savings and investments.
6.        Government investment spending in the last three years lagged
behind the targets set by the Development Plan. Tne country's investment
rate increased, however, as a result of greater investment outlays by the
rest of the public sector and by the private sector. The decline in
Government investment expenditures was caused by the completion of some
lumpy infrastructural projects as well as by budgetary stringencies during
most of the period.
7.        The fiscal situation deteriorated in the early 1970s. Despite the
expansion of output and trade, Government revenues remained almost stagnant
in the face of growing current expenditures. To deal with this situation,
the Government made key personnel changes in the tax and custoras administra-
tion and introduced a number of revenues measures. At the CIAP Country
Review held in January 1972 the authorities established targets for fiscal
improvement in 1972 and 1973 aiming to restore Government savings to the
peak levels achieved in the past. The fiscal situation deteriorated further
in 1972, but improved markedly in 1973, when the revenue targets established
two years earlier were met and Government recourse to Central Bank financing
ceased. This was made possible by Government's actions to increase taxes
and to improve the performance of the Income Tax and Customs Administrations,
as well as by an upsurge in imports which helped to increase revenues from
import duties.
8.        While the strengthening of external demand for Paraguayan products
gave considerable impetus to output growth in the 1970s, increased export
prices and world inflationary conditions broke Paraguay's impressive record
of price stability. The consumer price index,which in the second half of
the 1960s increased at an average annual rate of 1.3%, rose by 5% in 1971,
10% in 1972 and 13% in 1973. Wholesale prices, however, increased faster
last year (33%) largely reflecting price hikes in internationally tradeable
commodities.



-3-
9.        Government efforts to curb inflation followed a three-pronged
approach: measures to control domestic prices of exportable foodstuffs
(particularly beef), strict control over real wages, and increased fiscal
effort to mop up purchasing power. At the same time, disincentives to
imports of consumer goods were maintained while applying a liberal policy
of duty exemptions towards imports of capital goods and transport equipment.
Although they helped to contain price rises, these policies failed to break
the inflationary impulse. Beef price and marketing controls, removed since
February 1974, proved to be largely ineffective as the system of export
quotas associated with them created speculative expectations on the part
of ranchers and led to scarcities in the domestic market. Government
incomes policy depressed real wages in urban areas (particularly those of
public servants), but real wages in the countryside increased rapidly under
the influence of rising export prices and labor shortages at harvesting time.
The improvement in the Central Government financial situation in 1973 and
the elimination of the overall fiscal deficit contributed, however, to cooling
off the economy.
10.       Given the Paraguayan economy's relatively small size and large
degree of openness, anti-inflationary policy is likely to be only partially
effective so long as worldwide inflation persists. The Governmentts strategy
to contain inflation has been by and large correct, and as long as fiscal,
monetary and incornes policies continue in their present form, domestic infla-
tion should subside. Inflationary prospects, however, have become somewhat
more threatening as a result of the increase in world petroleum prices.  In
recent months the price of oil landed in Asuncion trebled, which caused
retail prices of petroleum products to double. It is expected that the price
hike will trigger a first round increase of some 3% in the consumer price
index, but its impact over the year is likely to be considerably greater.
11.       As of December 31, 1973, Paraguay's outstanding and disbursed
external public debt repayable in foreign currency was US$123 million,
compared with a total of US$114 million a year earlier. The Bank Group share
in the former total was US$38 million as compared with a level of US$33 mil-
lion the year before. In 1973, net public medium and long-term external
debt is estimated to have increased at a somewhat higher pace as a consequence
of the upturn in investment experienced during the year.
12.       Paraguay contracted new external obligations amounting to US$115 mil-
lion in 1969-73,over 70% of which was contracted with bilateral credit agencies.
Of the remaining 30% the Bank provided the largest share (12.5%), with roughly
a blend of 40% IDA funds and 60% of IBRD funds. In addition, new loans
disbursable in foreign currency but repayable in local currency were contracted
with the 1DB for a total of US$84 million. The rhythm of new external commit-
ments is expected to accelerate in 1474 as a result of bunching in the prepara-
tion of projects amenable to external financing as well as greater availability
of local funds following recent improvements in domestic resource mobilization.



-4 -
13.       Despite Paraguay's impressive export perfornance in 1972-73 and
the promising prospects for 1974-76, the country will continue to need
substantial inflows of external assistance in order to attain its growth
and employment objectives. Additional capital inflows will also be
required to finance the increase in Paraguay's import bill resulting from
the recent increases in international oil prices. The oil import bill,
which in 1972 was about US$8 million or 11% of imports of goods, is expected
to climb to some US$30 million in 1974, which would be about 20% of total
imports. However, since Paraguay has obtained the bulk of its foreign
capital needs on concessionary tems and since its exports are expected to
continue increasing at high growth rates, the country's creditworthiness is
not expected to be impaired by the recent changes in oil prices.
14.       The debt-service ratio remained within the range of 1Ov to 161 in
1968-72 and declined in 1973 to 8.6%  of exports of goods and nonfactor
services. While the country's external borrowing is ex-pected to increase
in the coming years, the debt service ratio is unlikely to exceed 13% in
the remainder of the decade provided that the addltional capital is con-
tracted on terms comparable with those of the recent past. The Bank Group's
share in the debt service amounts to about 11.4% of the total and in 1973 rep-
resented 1% of exports of goods and nonfactor services. Under these circun-
stances, Paraguay is creditworthy for increasing amounts of Banlk lending.
Given Paraguay's improved economic prospects, we are planning to gradually
phase out IDA operations.
PART II  - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PARAGUAY
15.       Paraguay has received US$69.4 million (net of cancellations) in
Bank loans and IDA credits. Of this amount, US$31.9 million has been in the
fonn of seven IBRD loans, while six credits totalling US$37.5 million have
been from IDA resources. As of September 30, 197L, the Bank held US$26.1 million,
including US$11.9 million undisbursed, and IDA US$37.3 million, including
US$16.1 million undisbursed. On a sectoral basis, Bank Group assistance to
Paraguay has been 66% for agriculture, 26% for transportation, and 8% for
education. Execution of Bank Group-financed projects has, on the whole,
been satisfactory. There has been a delay, however, in disbursing the loan
for the Second Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 652-PA), as the fiscal
situation led the Government to reduce the highway maintenance budget.
This has now been corrected, as the Governument has appropriated sufficient
funds for this purpose in the 1974 Budget.
16.       Thus far, IFC has made no loans or investments in Paraguay. It is
processing an integrated forestry project which could have a significant impact
on Paraguay's foreign exchange earnings. Annex II contains a summary of Bank
loans and IDA credits as of October 31, 1974, and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.



17.       In FY74 the Bank Group did not make any new loans or credits
to Paraguay. Bank Group lending to Paraguay in FY75, however, will be
substantial: in addition to the proposed Fourth Highway Project now
under consideration, a loan to help expand beef production and exports
(1037-PA/US$l million) and a development credit for a small farmer
credit and rural development project (509-PA/US$ll million) were
approved on August 6, 1974. Other projects in preparation are in the
fields of highway maintenance, preinvestment, agroindustry and power.
These may be ready for consideration by the Executive Directors during
the next two years.
l8.       In lending to Paraguay, the Bank Group tries to assist the Govertm-
ment in achieving four major objectives. These objectives are interdependent
and complementary; hence, it is not possible to rarLk them in order of priority
or importance. One objective is to spread the benefits of growth more widely
than before and, more part iularly, to attack directly the problem of rural
poverty. A second objective is to help Paraguay expand output, including
e.,pots, by supporting projects that direc'ly or indirectly make large con!-
tributionis tc Irodacl;,aon and employment. A third obJective is to bring
about institutional improvements in the management of the economy and in
the developmenr. of pub,lic financial intexnediaries. A fourth objective
is to ' ransfer sufficient external resources t-o complement Paragua7 s
domestic savings and prov-de the necessary funds for maintaining an ade-
quate level of economic aLd social investments in a framework of sound
domestic finances and a viable balance of payments.
19.       While the last objective primarily influences the magnitude of
the Bank Group's program in Paraguay, the other three jointly determine its
structure. The livestock projects are designed to help expand the production
of beef, thus strengthening the balance of payments, by increasing beef exports.
Projects for rural development are designed to help ease the rural poverty
problem; basically, the Bank Group would work in consolidating existing colo-
nization settlements, a strategy which is consistent with promoting better
resource utilization and which conplements the role of other international
lenders, notably IDB and AID, in the small farmer field. Loans for highway
construction and maintenance are designed to transfer resources to Paraguay,
to help expand the country's paved road network, which is considered
crucial for expanding agricultural output, and to consolidate the
ongoing efforts to strengthen transport planning and coordination as well as
the road maintenance organization. Bank Group assistance for agroindustry is
to help increase the processing of agricultural products destined for export,
raise employment and expand marketing outlets, particularly for small farmers.
Lastly, Bank Group financing of power development is designed to transfer re-
sources to Paraguay on suitable terms and to help increase the country's
exports.



-6-
PART III - TRANSPORT SECTOR
20.       Given Paraguay's mediterranean position, the most important
transport link to the sea is the Paraguay River, which flows north-south
across the country to join the Parana River at the border with Argentina.
River transport, therefore, carries some 85% of all foreign trade, but the
importance of this mode has been declining in recent years following con-
struction in the early 1960s of a bridge across the Parana' River between
Paraguay and Brazil, and the recent completion of a paved road from the
Paraguayan border through Brazil to the Atlantic port of Paranagua; this
bridge and road, together, provide an alternative link to the sea.
21.       About 80% of the country's population of 2.4 million and most of
the economic activity are located east of the Paraguay River in the "Triangulo"
area, roughly defined by the corners at Asuncion, the capital; Encarnacion;
and Puerto Presidente Stroessner. The country's economy is based mainly on
primary and processed agricultural products and, in order to further develop
Paraguay's agricultural potential, the Government is pursuing a policy of
intensive land colonization. Roads have been built to support these
efforts and also to integrate scattered centers of agricultural and indus-
trial production into the national economy. The transport sector has been
receiving a large share of public investments, and the basic transport
system--essentially roads--now exists. However, continued emDhasis on
extending and improving the road system to meet the growing demands of agri-
cultural development is needed, road transport being the main mode used for
domestic freight and passengers, particularly since the steady decline in
the efficiency of the railway system over the past 20 years, A wide domestic
air service network complements surface transport. River transport is unimpor-
tant domestically except for timber rafting and some internal river shipping
on the Paraguay and Parana Rivers.
22.       Since 1950, the length of the country's highway system has increased
eightfold from 830 km to 6,500 km. Highway construction has been one of the
most dynamic subsectors in the economy, and also one critical to the
development of the agricultural sector by providing access to new agricultural
land. Road development over the past 20 years has been concentrated on paving
primary roads and on extending the system. The network as a whole provides
acceptable transport to most populated areas of the country. However, some of
the existing paved and gravel roads need to be improved to meet growing
traffic volumes and facilitate the development of new agricultural areas.
23.       The Planning Office of the Ministry of Public Works and Communications
(MOPC), and the Government's Central Planning Office, have responsibilities for
coordinating the activities of the various agencies in the transport sector;
however, their work has been generally poor due mainly to insufficient expertise
and inadequate support within the Government. As a result, decision-making
has been carried out independently by each of the transport agencies. Despite
this, investments in the sector have for the most part met the development
requirements of the economy. To help provide the Government with a sound
basis for effective transport coordination and planning, the UNDP financed a



-7-
transport survey for which the Bank was executing agency. The first phase
of the study, completed in 1973, consisted of an integrated approach to the
various transport modes, development of investment priorities and the recom-
mendation for the establishment of an agency for transport planning and coor-
dination as well as for the training of persomnel.  The major recommendation
of -the study was to create, as a first step, the Office of Coordination and
Integral Planning of Transport (OCIPT). A further recommendation was the
creation of a National Transport Council, and the eventual estahlishment of a
Ministry of Transport0  In late 1972, the Government created OCIPT to carry
out the responsibilities envisaged by the UTDP study but it did not allocate
sufficient funds for its operation. The Government has now decided to make
OCIPT fully operational and, starting in 1976, to adequately fund its opera-
tions. Assurances to this effect were given by the Government to the Bank
(Section h.04 of Loan Agreement).
24.       ExternaIL lenders have been very active in assisting Paraguay's
transport sector. Over the 1965-73 period, about 4C% of highway expenditures
have been financed by external borrowing, while most of the remainder, com-
prising local funds, have been provided from eanmarked taxes from fuels and
a 5% surcharge on imports. (Total revenues from road users have, in recent
years, substantially exceeded total expenditures on roads. Since the recent
oil crisis, fuel costs have risen from US$0.21 equivalent per litre in
November 1973 to US$0o40 per litre in February 1974, representing an increase
of about 90e.)  Between 1961 and 1970, the World Bank Group provided four
loans and one credit totalling US$16.3 million for construction, maintenance
and studies of highways, and one loan amounting to US$2.8 million for improve-
ment of port facilities in Asuncion. In 1956 the Export-Import Bank made a
US$1.2 million loan to finance the construction of the runway at the interna-
tional airport of Asuncion. Thereafter, in 1968, USAID provided US$4.7 million
for financing a new and larger runway. Also between 1960 and 1967, USAID made
three loans totalling abou-t US$15 million for the reconstruction and paving
of the Asuncion-Puerto Presidente Stroessner road (330 Ia) and for the
rehabilitation of a sec-tion of the same road. Between 1964 and 1972, UNDP
also provided financial assistance totalling US$1 million for highway studies,
training programs and the aforementioned transport survey. Finally, in 1971
the IDB made a US$26.4 million loan to finance the engineering and construction
of the Trans-Chaco highway, which is the largest single road project ever
undertaken in Paraguay.
25.       The Bank's approach in the transport sector is to support the
Government's primary objectives in expanding the country's transport system:
(a)  to foster output in produc-tive areas through better transport facilities;
(b)  to integrate scattered centers of production into the national economy;
and (c)  to improve international links with neighboring countries to facili-
tate foreign trade.  Also Bank assistance for transportation has a strong
orlentation towards institution building, with the objective of improving
overall sector planning and coordination, optimizing the benefits of invest-
ment resources in -transportation and strengthening the administrative capacity
of the existing transport services.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
26.       The proposed project evolved from the UNDP preinvestment study
carried out during 1964-67 which evaluated the agricultural potential and
road requirements of southeastern Paraguay (Triangulo area). Feasibility
studies and detailed engineering for some of these roads were later per-
formed under the Bank's Second Highway Project (Loan 443-PA) and the project
roads were shown by these studies to have a high economic return. A Bank
mission appraised the project in November 1971 and, following the recent
improvement in fiscal performance which was necessary to assure the avail-
ability of local funds to finance the project, a second Bank mission updated
the appraisal in March 197h. On October 10, 197f, a Bank Mission visited
Paraguay and agreed with the Government on all the conditions contained in
the Draft Loan Agreement; as a result, it was not necessary to hold formal
negotiations in Washington. A report entitled "Paraguay: Appraisal of a
Fourth Highway Project" (No. 532a-PA) dated November 25, 1974, is being
distributed separately. A Loan and Project Summary is attached to this
report as Annex III.
General Description
27.       The roads that would be improved with the proposed project serve
two important agricultural regions. The Itapua region, where the Encarnacion-
Hohenau-Pirapo Road lies, is a fertile area with about two-thirds of its soils
suitable for crop production, of which more than half are considered among the
best soils in Paraguay. Through Encarnacion, the region has access to Argen-
tina by ferry. The Guaira region, where the Mbocayaty-Colonia Indepen-
dencia Road is located, is also a good agricultural area. The Mbocayaty-
Colonia Independencia Road comnects with the Villarica-Coronel Oviedo Road,
which is an affluent of the main highway between Puerto Presidente Strossner
(export outlet to Brazil) and Asuncion, the capital. Over the years, several
colonization settlements have been established in the two regions, some of
which are of different ethnic groups (mainly German and Japanese). Land d s-
tribution in the regions is quite even; the farmers are very progressive and
many are grouped in well-run cooperatives. Their main produce is soybeans,
cassava, sugar, silk, wine and poultry, and, except for some products which
go to the local markets, the bulk of the produce is for export.
28.       The proposed project consists of the following elements:
(a) Road construction and reconstruction as follows:
(i) Fncarnacion-Hohenau-Pirapo Road--Reconstruction and
paving of an existing gravel road between Encarnacion
and Hohenau (37 km.), including the construction of a
bypass around the city of Encarnacion (about 1.5 km.)
and a connecting road to the river port of Pacu-Cua
(about 4.5 km.); and the construction, including paving,
of a new 33 km. section between Hohenau and Pirapo.



- 9 -
(ii) Mbocayaty-Colonia Independencia Road--Reconstruction
and paving of 24 km. of road and of a 2 kn. access
road to Melgarejo.
(b) Procurement of spare parts, tires and batteries for
maintenance equipment financed under Loan 652-PA (First
Highway Maintenance Project).
(c)  Consulting services for:
(i)   Supervision of the roads under (a) above;
(ii)  Extension of the assistance currently being provided
for maintenance under Loan 652-PA;
(iii) A study to determine further highway maintenance
requirements; and
(iv) Technical assistance for transport planning, including
the training of nationals abroad, and for aid to the
local construction industry.
29.       The vertical and horizontal alignments of the existing Encarnacion-
Hohenau-Pirapo and Mbocayaty-Colonia Independencia roads are not satisfactory
and the roads lack an appropriate drainage system; during heavy rains the
highway authority sets barriers preventing vehicle transit to avoid major
maintenance expenditures. The project would provide paved, all-weather roads
needed to cope with the growing traffic demand and a permanent connection to
the outside markets. It would also finance the procurement of spare parts,
tires and batteries for maintenance equipment to strengthen and complement
the ongoing road maintenance program being financed by the Bank (Loan 652-PA).
The stepped-up maintenance activity requires an increase in the normal
inventory of spare parts to permit making efficient use of the road
maintenance equipment.
Project Cost
30.       The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$20.0 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange cost of US$1h.5 million (72%). Details
of cost estimates are summarized below. All estimates reflect expected
prices at end of 197h.

31.       The proposed Bank loan would cover the total foreign exchange cost
of the project (US$l.5 million); local project costs will be met by the
Government in the amount of US$5-5 million equivalent. The Government has
allocated suFficient funds in the 1975 Budget to carry out the project and has
given assurances that it will continue to do so in the following years until
successful completion of the project (Section 4.03(a) of Loan Agreement).
Organization and Execution
32.       The Directorate of Highways (DGV) within the Ministry of Public
Works and Communications (MOPC) will be responsible for all the operations
related to the project, While DGV's role in highway administration has been
steadily growing, shortage of staff has prevented it from undertaking major
highway design and engineering studies for the network. For this reason the
engineering for the two roads under the proposed project was prepared by
consultants Louis Berger, Inc., (U.S.) in association with SAE (Argentina).
Since investments for the period 1975-78 are projected to be three times the
average expenditure in the previous five-year period, assurances have been
obtained from the Government that it will strengthen DGV's technical and
administrative staff to cope with the increased workload. (Section 4.05 of
the Loan Agrpeement).



33.       The possibility of breaking down project works into units attractive
to local contractors was taken into account. However, the limited capacity
of the few local firms would make it necessary to subdivide the works into
many units, leading to inefficient administration of project works. Local
contractors are expected to participate through subcontracting to larger for-
eign firms as has been the case in previous Bank highway projects. To assist
the local contracting industry in improving its capability, the project pro-
vides for the financing of consultants who would work with the contractors'
association to identify problems and recommend measures for improvement.
34.       Road maintenance has lagged behind other aspects of road development
mainly because most of the earth and gravel roads were originally only tracks
with poor alignment, inadequate drainage and shortage of staff and equipment.
A master plan for maintenance was prepared in 1966 under the Second Road
Project (Lh3-PA) and in 1970 the Bank made a loan (652-PA) to implement this
plan; highway maintenance is now substantially improving. Under the proposed
project the highway maintenance department's operations will be strengthened
further in order to enable its staff to fully take over from consultants the
day-to-day operations, over a period of two years. Consultants will be
retained to provide the necessary technical support and training of local
highway personnel during the transition period.
35.       To assist the Government in improving transport sector planning and
coordination and in implementing the recommendations of the previously mentioned
IJNDP transport survey, assurances were obtained from the Government that it
will provide the necessary financing for the operation and staffing of the
Office of Coordination and Integral Planning of Transport (OCIPT). During
negotiations the Government agreed to (a) select consultants acceptable to the
Bank to undertake the required technical assistance and (b) set up and staff
OCIPT by June 30, 1976. (Sections 3.02 and h.04 of the Loan Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
36.       Construction contracts will be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Since the procurement
of spare parts is for existing equipment, packages of contracts of up to us$50,ooo
will be awarded directly to the local dealers for the equipment. In the
case of tires and batteries, however, procurement will be made on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines.
37.       For civil works, disbursements will be made on the basis of 100% of
expenditures denominated in foreign currencies and 33% of expenditures denom-
inated in guaranies. The latter is equal to the estimated indirect foreign
exchange component of civil works. On this basis, it is estimated that the
Bank will finance 70% of the project's total civil work cost. In the case of
spare parts, tires and batteries, and consulting services, disbursements will
be made for the actual foreign exchange cost. Any funds remaining after com-
pletion of the project will either be used for additional consulting services,
studies or items for highway maintenance, or will be cancelled.

Benefits and Justification
38.       The benefits of the project would primarily consist of a reduction
in unit vehicle operating and road maintenance costs for normal and generated
traffic. The project is also expected to stimulate colonization and develop-
ment of some areas adjacent to the roads by reducing passenger and freight
costs. Additional, but unquantified, benefits are time savings for passengers,
increased cargo load of commercial vehicles, and reduced spoilage of agricul-
tural products. The economic rate of return from construction of the Encarnacion-
Pirapo Road is estimated at 24%, and that of the Mbocayaty-Colonia Independencia
Road at 13%; the weighted average economic return for the project's civil works
is estimated at 21%. With respect to the Mbocayaty-Colonia Independencia Road,
it is relevant to note that because of flooding during heavy rains the road has
remained closed to traffic over 70 days per annum, with duration of closures of
up to three days. Although quantifiable costs for these closures with regard
to vehicle costs and operators' time were taken into account when calculating
the rate of return, it is not possible to quantify their adverse developmental
effects on the people in the region served nor the loss of production caused
by them. The benefits of the other components of the project were also not
quantified; however, it is expected that they will be considerable, particu-
larly the increase in the normal inventory of spare parts which is essential
for the improvement and maintenance of the highway network.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Paraguay and the
Bank, the Report of the Comnittee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed loan, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft Loan Agreement contains provisions to reflect the various arrange-
ments described in Part IV above, including the usual covenants for highway
projects.
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
41.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

B3. Projects in Executio 1/
Loan 396     First Road Project, US$6.0 million and US$2.2 million,
Credit 12    October 1961 and December 196L.
Work financed by the Bank Group for improving a road between Asuncion and
Encarnacion was completed satisfactorily in March 1970. The German contractor,
Hochtief, claims that it is entitled to US$11.1 million more than the
.US$9.6 million it has received for its work under the contract. Supported by
I/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

the project consultants, MOPC rejected the claim. For some time Hochtief
tried to resolve its claim through direct negotiations with the Paraguayan
Government. In June 1972, Hochtief altered its approach and attempted to
settle its claim by invoking the arbitration clause of the contract. The.
Government, however, has refused to appoint its representative on the arbi-
tration panel as called for in the arbitration clause, and Hochtief has
asked for Bank assistance in bringing the Paraguayans to arbitration. We
have advised the Government of the Bank's interest in having the parties to
Bank-financed contracts adhere to the disputes provisions of such contracts
and have advised Hochtief that, under the circumstances, its most appropriate
course of action would be to pursue and exhaust the judicial remedies which
are still open to it under Paraguayan law.
Loan 620      Third Livestock Project, US$h.3 million, IBRD,
Credit 156    and US$4.3 million, IDA, June 25, 1969
The US$4.3 million from Credit 156-PA was fully disbursed by January of
1973. The funds provided by Loan 620-PA were fully committed by January 31,
1971L. The project is about one year behind schedule due to slow disburse-
ments during the 1970-72 period.
Loan 652      Second Road Maintenance Project, US$6.0 million,
January 9, 1970.
The project comprises provision of maintenance and shop equipment,
improvement of the maintenance organization and its operations, and training
of personnel. Important progress has been made, with the assistance of con-
sultants, in strengthening the road organization and in improving the
physical maintenance of roads, as a result of the project; approximately 90%
of the provision for equipment has been disbursed. In 1971 and 1972 procure-
ment was delayed pending the provision of adequate local funds to operate the
extra equipment. These funds are now available and will enable the remainder
of the equipment to be procured in 1974 and 1975. In this event, the project
should be completed by mid-1975, with disbursements extending to the end of
the year, approximately two years behind schedule.
Credit 347     Secondary Education Project, Us$5.1 million,
December 22, 1972.
After a seven-month delay due to a recess in both houses and an ensuing
backlog of pending legislation, the Credit Agreement was ratified by the
Congress on September 1i, 1973, and the Association declared it effective on
October 30, 1973. Key staff of the project implementation unit have been
appointed and, at this stage, no special problems are envisaged for the proper
carrying out of the project. Since the Government met CIAP's 1973 fiscal
targets, the second tranche of the Credit, which was conditioned on the
Government's meeting these targets, has been released.
