FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1059-PA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the Fourth Highway
Project in Paraguay, for which Loan 1059-PA in the amount of US$14.5 million
was approved by the Board on December 10, 1974. The Loan was closed on
June 30, 1981, and, on July 21, 1981, undisbursed funds amounting to
US$27,243.14 were canceled.
This Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Latin America
and the Caribbean Regional Office and is based on information obtained from
the files of the Bank's Record Center, LAC Information Center, Appraisal and
Supervision Reports for Loan 1059-PA and on the final reports prepared by
consultants responsible for supervision of the civil works.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department but was not audited by OED staff. The Draft Completion Report
was sent to the Borrower; however, no comments were received.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1059-PA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
Loan 1059-PA for US$14.5 million supported road construction and
reconstruction of 102 km of high priority roads, purchase of spare parts for
road maintenance equipment and technical assistance to improve road main-
tenance operations, transport planning and development of the local construction
industry.
The project was generally implemented as planned except for substantial
delays in the completion of the Encarnacion-Pirapo Road (para 3.04). The actual
cost of the project, US$21.1 million, was in line with the appraisal estimate of
US$20 million. The reestimated ERR for the Encarnacion-Pirapo Road (39%) is well
above the original estimate (24%), mainly because agricultural development along
this project road exceeded that foreseen at appraisal (paras 5.02, 5.05). On
the other hand, the reestimated ERR for the Mbocayaty-Colonia Independencia Road
does not show a significant difference from the appraisal estimate of 12%
(paras 5.06, 5.07).
Although the technical assistance for transport planning and road
maintenance proved of value to the Government, its impact was below appraisal
expectations (para 8.02). The main objective of strengthening indigenous
capabilities to enable the phasing out of consultants' services is being achieved,
at a slower pace than foreseen at this project appraisal, within the framework of
three follow-on projects. However, the recurrent problem encountered during the
implementation of the Fourth Highway Project, the loss of qualified technical
staff to the highpaying hydroelectrical projects, still persists and is being
addressed under the Seventh Highway Project (Loan 2140-PA) (para 6.04). Also,
the abundance of work for the construction industry greatly diminished the
interest in the recommendations for aid to the industry developed under the
project, and no action resulted from them (para 8.02).

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1059-PA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Paraguay's highway network, including the primitive track system
serving the Chaco, totals about 8,500 km of which some 6,700 km are under
the jurisdiction of the Ministerio de Obras Publicas y Comunicaciones (MOPC).
Of the latter, some 85% are unpaved and susceptible to closure for up to 100
days per year because of rain. Road development has been concentrated on
paving the more heavily trafficked roads and expanding the network to connect
economic and population centers. Adequate maintenance is critical and improve-
ments are required to meet growing traffic volumes and facilitate the develop-
ment of new agricultural areas.
1.02      Over the past 20 years, the Bank has been continuously involved with
highway development in Paraguay. Since 1961, seven highway projects (total
lending about US$149 million) have been approved which, when the ongoing Fifth,
Sixth and Seventh Highway Projects are completed, will have resulted in the up-
grading of more than 900 km of primary roads, construction of about 500 km of
feeder roads and improvements in maintenance management and operations. In
addition, four agricultural projects have provided US$17.5 million for improve-
ment and maintenance of about 1,500 km of additional feeder roads.
1.03      This Completion Report is based on information obtained from the
files of the Bank's Record Center, LAC Information Center, Appraisal and
Supervision Reports for Loan 1059-PA and on the final reports prepared by
consultants responsible for supervision of the civil works.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      Project preparation began in early 1969 when, under financing
provided by the Second Highway Project (Loan 443-PA; US$2.1 million; April
1966), a contract was awarded to a US consulting firm for carrying out feasi-
bility studies for about 460 km of roads included in the so-called "Plan
Triangulo" area (Map IBRD-3770RI-PCR). Detailed engineering for about 250 km
of the highest priority roads was also included in the consultant's contract.
The feasibility studies were completed in early 1970, the priority roads were
selected in July 1970, and detailed engineering was completed in November
1971. However, the Highway Department (Vialidad) of MOPC questioned the final
cost estimates which were substantially higher than those of the feasibility
studies. Although the consultant had followed the design standards recom-
mended in the feasibility studies, final quantities and unit price estimates
produced results well above the current range of costs per kilometer for
similar roads in Paraguay. Subsequently, in mid-1973, the consultant revised
the engineering using lower design standards where appropriate to reduce major
quantities and lower costs to an acceptable level.

2.02      During project preparation the Bank felt that the project should not
be appraised until Government made clear its intentions regarding improvement
or closing of the state-owned, 376 km Presidente Carlos Antonio Lopez railway
(PCAL) and that there was acceptable evidence of adequate local financing
being available for the project because of serious fiscal problems in the
country. The Government informed the Bank by letter in May 1971 that it would
provide no additional financial support to the PCAL beyond the level of funds
currently assigned to meet deficits (about US$0.6 million per year); this was
accepted by the Bank. Although no formal confirmation concerning counterpart
funds was received, the Bank, under strong pressure by Government, sent an
appraisal mission to Paraguay in November 1971.
2.03      Five "Plan Triangulo" roads, for which detailed engineering and
cost estimates had been prepared, were considered at appraisal. These roads
were:

Encarnacion-Pirapo                       76             6.9             1.9

Totals                        266            22.2
1/   Including bypasses of towns and access roads.
2/   Feasibility study estimates, excluding contingencies.
As only the Encarnacion-Pirapo road showed an acceptable economic rate of
return, the project proposed at that time included construction and supervision
of that road alone. The appraisal report was advanced to the yellow cover
stage in December 1972 but further action was deferred by the Bank because
of the continuing difficult fiscal situation in the country.
2.04      Paraguay's financial situation had improved considerably by early
1974 and in March that year the Bank agreed to reappraise the proposed project
on the basis of revised engineering and cost estimates (para 2.01). The
Government had asked that the other four "Plan Triangulo" roads be again
considered in the reappraisal and Vialidad had been requested to obtain new
traffic counts on the roads prior to the mission's visit. Unfortunately, a
fuel shortage in February 1974 caused a substantial drop in traffic and,
therefore, the new traffic figures were not representative. Traffic counts
were again taken in mid-1974 when fuel supplies and traffic had returned to
normal. As a result, the Mbocayaty-Colonia Independencia road showed an
acceptable economic return and was included in the project.

2.05      The Government requested that the project also include financing of
spare parts, tires and batteries for road maintenance equipment procured under
the previous highway project. The Bank agreed with this request and suggested
that, in addition, other components aimed at institution building and prepara-
tion of the next highway projects be included. The following elements were
added to the project:
(a) Continued technical assistance for highway maintenance -
During recent years, road maintenance had been managed by
consultants rather than by Vialidad. Therefore, the pro-
ject included financing of consulting services for an interim
two-year period during which it was expected that Vialidad
would strengthen its maintenance department and take over
all maintenance operations.
(b) Preparation of a study to determine further maintenance
requirements - The objective was to prepare a five-year
highway maintenance program to improve planning and
operations and which would provide the basis for possible
Bank and other financing.
(c)  Technical assistance for transport planning - Neither
the Technical Secretariat for Planning nor MOPC Planning
Office were capable of proper transport planning. Therefore,
consultant assistance was provided to establish and make
operational the Office for Coordination and Integral Planning
of Transport (OCPIT) within MOPC as had been recommended by
the 1973 UNDP-financed transport survey. Training abroad
of selected local personnel was also included.
(d) Aid to the local construction industry - The Bank, in agree-
ment with MOPC and the Paraguayan Chamber of the Construction
Industry, included financing of consulting services for a
study to improve the performance of the local construction
industry mainly in the fields of work planning, site manage-
ment, equipment usage, personnel training, costing and bid
preparation.
2.06      Negotiations were carried out in Asuncion between March 7 and 10, 1974,
and, on December 10, 1974, a loan amounting to US$14.5 million was approved by
the Executive Directors. The Loan Agreement was signed on December 12, 1974
and became effective on March 11, 1975.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Construction and Reconstruction of Roads
3.01      Fo- bidding purposes the 76 km Encarnacion-Pirapo road was
divided into two contracts with the option of bidding individual contracts
or the two in combination. The Mbocayaty-Colonia Independencia Road (26 km)
was tendered as a single contract. Bids, by prequalified contractors, were
opened in September 1975 and, with Bank agreement, awards were made to the
lowest bidders as follows:
(i) both contracts of the Encarnacion-Pirapo road to a
Japan/Paraguay joint venture for US$10,950,000, about
10% below the appraisal estimate, including contingencies; and
(ii) the Mbocayaty-Colonia Independencia Road to an Argentine/Paraguay
joint venture for US$4,154,688, about 3% above the appraisal
estimate, including contingencies.
Two joint venture Paraguay/Argentine firms (one for each road) were retained
to supervise construction.
3.02      Contractor mobilization began in January 1976, somewhat earlier than
originally scheduled. However, work on the Mbocayaty-Colonia Independencia
road encountered delays after a few months when the contractor in order to
provide suitable materials, was required to locate and develop a new gravel
quarry located some 90 km from the project as compared with a possible quarry
adjacent to the road which was indicated in the bidding documents. The
documents, however,'clearly specified that it was the contractor's respon-
sibility to provide acceptable materials for the base and pavement works.
Additional delays resulted from a management reorganization by the contractor
and late provision of some key construction equipment, particularly for
crushing operations.
3.03      The Mbocayaty-Colonia Independencia road was satisfactorily completed
in mid-July 1978, about eleven months behind the contract schedule. Upon
completion, the contractor submitted a claim amounting to US$666,000 mainly to
cover additional transport costs from the new quarry. Vialidad agreed to pay
US$320,750 of the claim but, at the same time imposed a fine of US$98,500 in
liquidated damages for late completion. The final cost of the works, without
the fine and including price escalation, was US$4,133,819, about 0.5% below the
bid proposal and about 2% over the appraisal estimate, including contingencies.
3.04      Works on the Encarnacion-Pirapo road suffered delays from the outset.
Initially the contractor concentrated all efforts on constructing a large camp
near the center of the project and delayed mobilizing needed construction
equipment, especially crushing plant, together with adequate equipment repair
facilities. The contractor's field management was initially very poor and was
changed several times but without significant improvement in work organization
and execution. By the contract completion date of March 1978 only about 55%
of the work was completed and construction was not finished satisfactorily
until July 1980, about 28 months behind schedule. Liquidated damages amounting
to US$530,000 were levied for the delay.



- 6 -
3.05      Shortly after completion the contractor submitted a claim for US$5.5
million mainly for additional administrative costs caused by the longer
construction period and for additional equipment, materials and labor costs
required to finish the work. Vialidad rejected the entire claim as not
justified. Thus, the final cost, including price escalation, was US$11,380,000
which is about 4% over the bid price and nearly 5% less than the appraisal
estimate including contingencies.
3.06      Construction supervision by the consultants was satisfactory.
Final costs, including necessary contract extensions, were US$504,800
for the Mbocayaty-Colonia Independencia road and US$1,370,000 for
the Encarnacion-Hohenau-Pirapo road. Both costs are about 12% of
the final construction cost, which is reasonable under the circumstances
but are about 38% over appraisal estimates mainly because of the longer
than expected construction periods.
Purchase of Spare Parts, Tire and Batteries for Maintenance Equipment
3.07     Spare parts and other items were procured by direct purchase and
negotiated contracts as specified in the Loan Agreement. Following deter-
mination of final costs for road construction and other project elements,
all funds remaining in the loan account (about US$1.1 million) were used,
with Bank agreement, for the purchase of additional spare parts for
rehabilitation of road maintenance equipment.
Consulting Services for Road Maintenance
3.08      The same joint venture of US/Paraguay consulting firms that carried
out the maintenance assistance under the previous Bank highway project was
engaged for the extension of assistance. This continued assistance was
intended to phase out consultant management and return operations to Vialidad's
control but this was not accomplished entirely, mainly because of serious
losses of professional and technical Vialidad staff, particularly to a
major hydroelectric project where salaries were up to four times those paid by
the Civil service. The situation, however, was partially corrected under the
Fifth Highway Project (Loan 1529-PA; US$33.0 million; March 1978) when a Main-
tenance Project Unit was created. The Unit was initially staffed with some
expatriates, but most of these have been replaced and a majority of staff is
now from Vialidad.
3.09      The joint venture consultant also completed a report in mid-1977
which recommended a comprehensive five-year road maintenance program.
The program, which was the principal basis for appraisal of the Bank's
Fifth Highway Project, included proposals for rehabilitation and enlarge-
ment of Vialidad's equipment fleet; improvement of inventories, cost account-
ing and budgetary control; and a road betterment program to be carried out
simultaneous with the maintenance program. Vialidad accepted the report's
major recommendations and their implementation is being carried out under the
Fifth Highway Project.

Technical Assistance for Transport Planning
3.10      The assistance in transport planning by the Office of Coordination
and Integral Planning for Transport (OCPIT) was carried out satisfactorily by
a joint venture of Argentine and Paraguayan consultants. Among the tasks
performed were:
(i) preparation of feasibility studies for several high priority roads;
(ii) evaluation of the operating efficiency and service of the various
transport modes and recommendations for improvements;
(iii) preparation of a ten-year investment program for the different
transport modes (except civil aviation) on the basis of economic
priorities;
(iv) determination of transport costs and tariff policies;
(v) study of road user charges;-and
(vi) development of basic data for the transport sector.
3.11      The results of the above tasks proved of value to Government but,
unfortunately, only minimum training was imparted to OCPIT staff by the
consultants in the course of their work. This was due entirely to OCPIT's
inability to recruit and retain qualified staff because of non-competitive
civil service salaries. Technical assistance to OCPIT is being provided
for under ongoing projects.
Development of the Local Construction Industry
3.12      Vialidad engaged the services of a joint venture of Argentine/
Paraguay consulting firms to carry out a study of the local construction
industry and to conduct seminars for MOPC staff and contractors. Some
major recommendations of the report, which was submitted in early 1979,
were:
(i) creation of a Register of Contractors;
(ii) improved contractor insurance and financing;
(iii) reliable Government work program with related funding; and
(iv) continuing training courses for contractors.
3.13      Vialidad has not yet taken action on implementing,the study recom-
mendations and, in an effort to induce action, a covenant was included in the
Loan Agreement for the Sixth Highway Project (Loan 1736-PA; US$39.0 million;
June 1979) requiring the Borrower to prepare an implementation plan of action
satisfactory to the Bank. Successive supervision missions have reminded MOPC
of this obligation but the matter has continued to receive little priority.



- 8 -
This is due in part to the fact that there is abundant work for contractors,
particularly in Paraguay, on major hydroelectric projects where prices paid
are substantially higher than on normal construction works and, therefore,
industry interest in new regulations and laws is limited.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A summary comparison between appraisal estimates and final costs is
shown in Table 1. Final project cost was US$21.1 million, less than 6% over
the appraisal estimate of US$20.0 million, including contingencies. The
variations in actual costs and appraisal estimates for the various project
components have been explained in previous paragraphs.
4.02      The allocation of loan funds was revised three times, as shown below,
to meet actual construction costs and to provide for necessary additional spare
parts, tires, etc.

4.03      Disbursements lagged behind appraisal estimates from the start
(Table 2). This reflects the initial slow pace of the construction works
and the considerable delay in completing both project roads (paras 3.03
and 3.04). The closing date was extended three times: from the original
date of June 30, 1979 to June 30, 1980; then to December 31, 1980; and
finally, to June 30, 1981 to allow for additional spare part purchases
(para 4.04).
1/   On July 21, 1981, undisbursed funds amounting to US$27,243.14 were canceled.

V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
Encarnacion-Pirapo Road
5.01      Reconstructing, improving and shortening by 20 km the road between
Encarnacion and Pirapo has already contributed significantly to the economic
development of Itapua Province. Further, this 76 km section of Route 6 was
the first link in completing a paved through road from Encarnacion to Ciudad
Stroessner, Paraguay's principal entry port to Brazil. The continuation of
Route 6 from Pirapo to Ciudad Stroessner and construction of about 500 km
of feeder roads in the region are being financed under the Sixth Highway
Project with completion scheduled for 1984. Over the next ten years this
through road will substantially support and augment agricultural development
and rural accessibility in Itapua and Southern Alto Parana Provinces.
5.02      Development along the project road has exceeded that foreseen at
appraisal. The many highly efficient colonies and cooperatives in the area
have prospered rapidly and the value of export crops such as cotton, soya
beans and tuna oil has been growing at over 10% p.a. during the period 1976-80.
The Bank's Second Rural Development Project (Loan 1418-PA; US$ 22.0 million;
May 1977) has been a major factor in the area's accelerated development.
5.03      Although the road was not formally completed until July 1980,
by November 1978, 60% of its length was open to traffic and actual traffic in
February 1980, when the entire road was opened, exceeded the appraisal estimate
for 1980 by 80%. Average daily traffic for 1980, based on counts both in and
out of harvest season, was 1,050 vehicles of which more than 50% were trucks
(Table 3). This traffic growth occurred despite rapid escalation in motor
fuel costs and it can be expected that the continued rapid growth of production
in this richly endowed area will continue for at least the next 15 years, the
period used for forecasting benefits in this reevaluation. It has therefore
been conservatively assumed that traffic will grow at the following rates -
Light vehicles, 6% p.a.; buses, 4% p.a.; and trucks, 7% p.a. This compares
with appraisal estimates of 5.4%, 3.5% and 6%, respectively.
5.04      The nominal construction cost taking into account price escalation
was US$11.38 million and the supervision nominal cost was US$1.37 million.
Thus, total cost for the project road was US$12.75 million. Due to delays in
completing the works (para 3.04) Vialidad assessed the contractor liquidated
damages amounting to US$530,000. The cost to Vialidad of the project was,
therefore, US$12.22 million.
5.05      The appraisal estimated economic rate of return (ERR) for this road
averaged about 24% for the two sections, Encarnacion-Hohenau and Hohenau-Pirapo.
The reevaluation considers the entire 76 km as a whole, taking into account the
20 km distance saving over the old road. The economic cost of construction
(US$16.5 million) is calculated by inflating nominal costs to 1980 prices;
benefits are also in 1980 prices. With a revised estimated ERR of 39%, this
highway investment has proved much more successful in economic terms than expected.



- 10 -
The higher ERR is due to greater than expected traffic, reflecting fast
economic development which the road helped to generate, and much greater than
estimated vehicle operating cost savings (Table 3), principally due to the
rapid escalation in real fuel prices.
Mbocayaty-Colonia Independencia Road
5.06      Very little information is available on development of the influence
area for this 26 km road improvement. However, traffic counts taken in
October 1980 show average daily traffic on the road of 310 vehicles with about
55% being buses or trucks. This is slightly higher than the appraisal estimate
for 1981.
5.07      The works were completed and the road fully opened to traffic in
July 1978, ahout eleven months behind schedule. The final construction cost
of US$4.13 million is about 2% over the appraisal estimate, including
contingencies. The economic cost of the project including supervision is
US$6.52 million in 1980 prices. The estimated ERR on this road is 12% as
compared with the appraisal estimate of 13%. The reevaluation confirms
that the improvements were justified.
VI. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
6.01      Considering the serious staff constraints under which the
project was executed, the Borrower's performance was generallv 0atlsractorv
The long delay in completing the Encarnacion-Hohenau-Pirapo road was caused
mainly by contractor problems. Although the Government made numerous and
strong representations to the contractor's headquarters concerning needed
improvements in work scheduling and overall project management, little or no
action was taken on the Ministry's complaints.
6.02      The institution building components of the project were not
entirely successful. Good results were obtained from the assistance to
improve transport planning (para. 3.10), and in preparing a road main-
tenance program (para 3.09) but, the exodus of qualified personnel, par-
ticularly to the nearby hydroelectric works, prevented Vialidad from
assuming all highway maintenance activities during the agreed two year period
of consultant assistance. The consultant's recommendations for aiding the
local construction industry have not been implemented by Vialidad because
of limited interest by the industry (para 3.13).
6.03      Paraguay has kept the lid on the size of its government agencies.
Institutional capacity is, therefore, clearly lagging behind requirements.
On the other hand, the public sector has not claimed large shares of GDP
and has not built up large and inefficient administrative establishments.
Restraints on administration growth within a framework of containment of
the public sector will continue to limit opportunities for improvements.



- 11 -
6.04      The Borrower, in general terms, has complied with the principal
covenants of the Loan Agreement except for the following:
(a) Section 4.03(b) Sets forth the Borrower's obligation to
improve the enforcement of regulations limiting dimensions
and weights of vehicles using the national roads. The
Borrower has only three obsolete fixed weighing scales
which do not have any cross-check system and control is
loosely carried out. The Fifth Highway Project provided
financing for a thorough study of the problem as well as for
the purchase of electronic scales and construction of the
weighing stations. This study was completed in August 1980.
The scales have been purchased and construction of the
weighing stations is under way. The vehicle weight control
system is expected to be operating in 1983.
(b) Section 4.40(b) Requires adequate staffing and funding
of the OCPIT. The local staffing has been insufficient and
of inadequate quality because of low authorized salary
scales. Consultants have assisted OCPIT in carrying out
its designated functions which otherwise could not have
been carried out because of the above mentioned reasons.
The Fifth and Sixth Highway Projects include the financing
of consultants for continuing the assistance to OCPIT.
(c)  Section 4.05   Requires that Vialidad employ and retain
qualified personnel for carrying out highway maintenance
operations and provide funding and supporting services
for its staff. Vialidad has not been able to meet the
staffing obligation mainly because of low salary scales
(para 3.08). The Seventh Highway Project includes the
Borrower's obligation to complete, by no later than
June 30, 1983, the hiring of engineers in order to meet
the staffing targets set forth in the Loan Agreement.
(d) Section 4.06 requires Vialidad to assume all highway
maintenance functions within two years from the effective
date of the loan. The shortage of staff explained in
the above paragraph, has prevented compliance with this
covenant. The ongoing program to improve highway mainte-
nance and strengthen MOP's field and headquarter capacity
is presently being coordinated by a Project Unit within
Vialidad (para 3.08).



- 12 -
VII. ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The Bank was significantly involved in project identification
and preparation by inclusion of feasibility studies and detailed engineering
in the preceding Second Highway Project and by participation in the review of
that work. The scope and size of this, the Fourth Highway Project, addressed
priority needs in the highways sub-sector which, at the time, were within
MOPC's administrative capabilities and the original implementation schedule was
tight, but reasonable. The Bank was accommodating and flexible in agreeing
to use loan funds remaining after road construction was completed for purchase
of additional spare parts.
7.02      The number and timing of supervision missions were appropriate for
project needs and good relations with the Borrower were maintained throughout
the project period. The Bank is continuing to provide essential technical
assistance to MOPC under the three follow-up projects presently being implemented.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      Although delayed, the road improvement elements of the project were
successful and are meeting the main objectives of lowering transport costs
between agricultural regions and domestic and internationel markets and
providing all weather accessibility to improve general living conditions in
the areas of influence.
8.02      Accomplishments resulting from the projects' technical
assistance components were mixed. Some significant gains were realized in
improved transport planning and in establishing a long-term road maintenance
program for which implementation assistance is being provided under subsequent
Bank projects. Although recommendations for aid to the local construction
industry were developed under the project, no action resulted mainly because
of an abundance of work. The need, however, for such aid continues.
8.03      The project emphasizes the importance of a patient and supportive
attitude by the Bank to assist Borrowers through difficult institutional
circumstances, such as developed here during implementation. It also high-
lights the benefits to the Borrower resulting from a long-term view and
participation in the sector such as in this case where three follow-up
projects are being carried out.
