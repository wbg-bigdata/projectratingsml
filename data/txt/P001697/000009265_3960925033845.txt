MALI SUD AGRICULTURAL PROJECT
(CREDIT 669-MLI)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report of the Mali Sud Agricultural
Project, for which Credit 669-MLI in the amount of US$15.5 million was
approved on December 14, 1976. The original Loan Closing Date was December
31, 1981. After three extensions, the Credit was closed on December 31,
1984.  The project  was  the  eleventh  Bank  Credit  to Mali and the fifth
credit in the agricultural sector. It was followed by the Second Mali Sud
Rural Development Project (Credit 1415-MLI) now under implementation. As
the first and second Mali Sud Rural Development projects are closely linked
and represent in many ways two complementary interventions which cannot be
separated  from  each  other,  this   PCR  does  not  intend  to  carefully
distinguish the effects of the first and second operation. The approach of
this PCR is instead to focus on the key elements which were commenced in
the first project and for the most part continued in the second Mali Sud
project.
This Project Completion Report was prepared by the West Africa
Region, following a mission to Mali from May 4 to May 24, 1987, and is
based on the completion report prepared by the project implementation
agency (CMDT), a review of the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 1171-MLI), the
president's Report (No.P-1949-MLI), the Credit Agreement, Bank supervision
reports, and relevant Bank files, as well as interviews with past and
current officials of the Bank and in Mali who have been associated with the
project.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by  OED  staff.   The draft PCR was sent to
the Borrower and cofinanciers on February 19, 1988 for comments. Comments
received from the cofinancier (Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique)
have been included and are attached as Attachment 1.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALI
MALI SUD AGRICLTURAL PROJECT
(CREDIT 669-4QI)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
Credit 669-MLI was the first IDA-supported rural development
project in Mali, situated in Mali Sud, an area which comprises about 30% of
the country's total population.    It was  designed as an integrated rural
development project focused upon cotton production.
Ob1ectives
Principal ob.1._tives were (i) to develop further the country's
cash and export crops and (ii) to initiate a co¢prehensive development
program in the Mali Sud area. Prospects for expansion of cotton production
were deemed good:   international  cotton  prices  at the time of appraisal
were forecast to  remain  high;  the  region  considered  suitable in agro-
climatic terms; farmers had a long experience with cotton production and
the existing cotton company had developed considerable experience over the
years.
The project expected to (i) expand and improve cotton, kenaf and
rice production; (ii) strengthen agricultural support services Including
research and credit; (iii) cvselop rice, cotton and kenaf processing
facilities; (iv) provide vocational training, adult literacy and health
programs; and (v) support C.(DT in strengthening its management and in
transferring responsibilities to  Malian  leadership.   Total project costs
were estimated at US$44.6 million of which US$15.5 million was to be
provided by IDA; US$15.9 million by respective cofinanciers of CCCE, FAC,
ADF and BADEA. The project was to be implemented over a period of five
years.
Implementation Experience
Area cultivated to cotton increased rapidly during the first three
years of project implementation but declined  in 1980/81 and 1981/82 due to
decreasing financial returns.   Cotton production increased, however, after
project closing when producer price incentives improved. Rice production
lagged during project implementation;    shortfalls attributed to delays in
stattup because of late finalization of  the loan agreement with ADF, which
fully financed this component.    Kenaf  production  came to an abrupt halt



- vi -
when domestic production became increasingly uncompetitive with imports
from South Asia and subsidy arrangements intended to support domestic
production became unsustainable.    Kenaf  production was discontinued when
the processing facility closed.    An unexpected development during project
implementation was the rapid increase in maize production, albeit from a
very low base as maize cultivation was new to the project area. Millet and
sorghum production was intensified leading to significant production gains.
Strengthening of supporting services was successfully implemented
with distribution targets of agriculture equipment exceeding appraisal
expectations; credit was efficiently administered by CMDT. The health and
livestock components were not fally implemented although the latter was
well designed, successfully integrating agriculture crop production and
livestock. During project implementation, CMDT developed into an efficient
cottor, and development institution. Its initial strength, due largely to a
strong adminstrative structure established by CFDT, was developed and
expanded  during  project   implementation   with  successful  transfer  of
leadership to Malian management.
Actual project costs were close to appraisal estimates (US$42.7
million) with cofinanciers providing US$15.8 million (vs. US$15.9 million
at appraisal) and IDA support of US$15.1 million, compared to US$15.5
million at appraisal.  Project Implementation was delayed two years due to
delays  in  startup   activities   with   late  fivalization  of  financing
arrangements  by  cofinanciers,  difficulties   in meeting  conditions  of
effectiveness and delays in undertaking studies in oncho areas.
Proiect Results
The recalculated ERR, over a 20 year development period, is
estimated at 37.52 against the 442 estimeted at appraisal. The lower than
expected ERR is due to the substantially higher opportunity costs of
labor arising from increased wages in the project area. On the other hand,
the project benefited from higher incremental production during initial
years.
The project contributed substantially to the development of a
strong institutional structure. This is one of the major reasons for the
successful implementation of  this  project.    The trust developed between
CMDT and farmers allowed for a rapid adoption of the technical package and
its administrative efficiency contributed to the successful implementation
of the remaining components.
Sustainability
Throughout the project, the financial viability of CMDT has been
threatened due to an inadequate equity base and an insufficient allocation
for operating  costs.    Although  this  was  recognized  early  in project
preparatioa and stressed during project supervision, it remained a problem



- vii -
at project completion.    CNDT  operated  with significant financial losses
having to rely on expensive bank overdraft facilities. Thie problem was
only solved under the auspices of the follow-on Mali Sud II project.
Lessons
The findings of this PCR in many ways support the conclusions of a
recent OED evaluation of cotton projects in other West African countries.l/
Cotton in Mali acted as a motor of development, especially in the Mali Sud
region, with important income, employment and linkage effects. This rural
operation could succeed  because  it was  designed  around an economically
ufficient lead crop, was well designed in its components, not overly
ambitious in the number of developme.it activities undertaken and built on a
strong institutional structure. The fact that cotton was an economically
efficient crop and that a DT operated effectively as an institution is
probably at the heart of this successful project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MALI
MALI SUD AGRICULTURAL PROJECT
(CREDIT 669-MLI)
I *   BACKGROUND AND PROJECT FORMULATION
9.       The project is located in the Mali Sud Region, which covers
virtually all areas of the country south of the Niger River and west
of Mopti, and represents about 302 of the country's total population.
The 100,000 farm families in the area belong to the following tribes:
Bambaras and Bobos in the North, Senoufous and Miniankas in the South.
The climate is characterized by a distinct rainy season (from May to
October) with average annual rainfall increasing from 800 mm in the
North to 1,200 in the South. Vegetation ranges from Sudano-Sahelian
in the Northeast to Guinean in the extreme Southwest.  Arable lands
are suitable for rainfed cotton, coarse grains, cowpeas and
groundouts.
10.       The Mali Sud Agricultural Project was appraised in November
1975 based on a feasibility study prepared by the Institut d'Economie
Rurale  (IER).   The  credit  was  negotiated  in  Washington  from
October 11-15, 1976   with   representatives   of   the   cofinancing
institutions  FAC  and  ADF  present.   Neither  CCCE  nor  BADEA  was
represented. Three major issues were repeatedly raised during project
preparation and appraisal:
(e) the insufficient equity structure of CMDT which did not allow for
sufficient borrowing from the banking system to cover liquidity
needs;
(b) the weak financial position of CMDT due to significant outstanding
arrears from SOMIEX, ITEMA, and COMATEX for cotton lint purchased
and due to insufficient remuneration of CMDT for cotton activities
under the "cotton bareme";
(c) the necessil; of transferring procurement of agricultural inputs
and equipment from the procurement agency SCAER to CeDT as SCAER's
financial situation was deteriorating and SCAER was unable to make
the necessary down payments for inputs and equipment. SCAER was
thus judged to be an unreliable deliverer of vital inputs.
11.       Government  was  unwilling  to  accept  the  transfer  of
procurement activities from SCAER to CMDT. At negotiations, IDA and
the Malian delegation agreed upon a provision to be included in a
supplemental letter to the Credit Agreement which specified that if
after the first year of project implementation, procurement of
agricultural inputs and equipments were not satisfactory, the
Government was to take appropriate steps to ensure such procurement.



This was not to exclude the transfer of such responsibility from SCOAER
to CMDT. The Malian Delegation was equally reluctant to accept any
fixed amount of equity participation of CMDT in the Credit Agreement.
The Government finally agreed that CMDT equity must be increased to at
least 10% of total annual peak cash-flow requirements.   Government
requested, however, that this provision not be included in the Credit
Agreement but be specified instead in a supplemental letter.
Conditions of effectiveness  included that satisfactory arrani.3ments
be made for SOMIEX, ITEMA and COMATEX to make payments of their
arrears  to CMDT within six months of credit signing.   A further
condition was that Government would commit itself to calculate cost
allocations under the bareme for CMDT's products on the basis of
actual costs incurred during the previous campaign as adjusted for
subsequent economic changes.  This provision was included to assure
sufficient remuneration for CMDT.
12.       The project was presented to the Board on December 14, 1970.
Questions were raised during Board presentation about the high
anticipated economic rate of return of 44%.  This was judged to be
overly optimistic.   Staff  replied  that  the  high  rate  of  return
reflected past investments in Mali's agricultural sector. Incremental
investments involved in the project were thus to reap the benefits of
earlier investments made by several external donors.   The credit
agreement was signed on December 23, 1976.
13.       Project Objectives and Description.  The project was designed
as an integrated rural development project based on the development of
the lead cash crop, cotton. A significant feature of the project was
the  strengthening  of  CMDT's  institutional  capacity,   including
iiprovements  in  its  financial,  organizational,  and  managerial
performance. Specific objectives of the project were:
(a) expansion   of   cotton   and   kenaf   production   through   the
intensification of improved methods used by farmers and expansion
of the area under cultivation and expansion of maize and rice
production;
(b) providing   project   farmers   with   technical   advice,   seed
multiplication facilities, applied research and credit for the
purchase of additional equipment and incremental seasonal inputs;
(c) improving animal husbandry of cotton farmers;
(d) expansion of processing facilities with the rehabilitation and
construction of new ginneries, improvement and construction of
kenaf retting ponds and rice mills;
(e) undertaking studies for the future development of the areas freed
from onchocerciasis;

(f) expansion of the health program; and
(g) training of CMDT staff, and the rural population, through young
farmers' and blacksmiths' training and a functional literacy
program.

II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
14.       Effectiveness.   The Credit  became  effective  in  September
1977, six months later than originally anticipated. Delays were due
to difficulties in finalizing financing arrangements of other donors,
particularly of BADEA, as well as delays in meeting some of the
conditions of effectiveness. Significant efforts had to be made, both
by IDA and CMDT staff, to establish communication with BADEA to
receive  information about progress  in financing  arrangements.   In
contrast collaboration with FAC and ADF proceeded smoothly. As CMDT
was reluctant to commence with project implementation before Credit
effectiveness and also had to spend much administrative efforts to
finalize   project   arrangements   with   other   donors,   project
implementation was delayed by one year.   In the first year only
technical assistance and training activities were carried out.
15.       Implementation  Period.   The  project's  closing  date  was
originally anticipated for December 31, 1981 but was extended three
times.  The credit was closed on December 31, 1984.  A request for a
fourth extension was denied by Bank management.   Extensions were
needed as project implementation was delayed at the outset because of
slow compliance of effectiveness, in particular slow finalization of
credit approvals by co-fi'.ancers. The third extension was needed to
allow for completion of a study of areas recently freed from
onchocerciasis. This study was only initiated in 1983 and needed to
be  complemented  with  aerial  photography.   Because  of  visibility
problems, aerial photography could only be carried out between
September and mid-November, i.e. the end of the rainy season and the
start of the dust storms. This period was missed in 1983 as bidding
documents were prepared too late. When bidding documents were finally
presented in 1984 for IDA approval, they were found to be inadequate.
Aerial photography could therefore not be  carried  out.   As  Bank
management decided against a fourth extension, the undisbursed balance
of US $441,413, allocated for this study, was cancelled.
16.       Project  Reformulations.   Some  reformulations  in  project
components were required due to the late finalization of cofinancing
arrangements and shortfalls in cotton, kenaf and rice production.
Retting facilities for kenaf production and the rice mill, to be
financed by BADEA and ADF respectively, were cancelled as production
was not sufficient to require the additional  facilities.   Due to
shortfalls in cotton production, the additional ginnery planned for
CCCE financing also was judged not to be necessary. It was decided to
postpone investments in additional ginneries until cotton production
reached project targets. Some reformulation was also required in the
livestock component, where the construction of central vaccination
yards was abandoned and smaller vaccination centers were instead
constructed by Associations Villageois (AVs) at the village level. No
reformulations were made to the health component in spite of a serious
implementation delay. Project activities did not commence until 1979



-5-
when BADEA financing became available. During the project period only
50% of the targets were reached.  The health component was continued
under the follow-up credic Mali Sud II (Cr. 1415-MLI). As a result of
implementation delays, studies to be undertaken for the development of
the  oncho  areas  were  not  completed.   Savings  made  under  the
reformulated cotton, kenaf and rice components were reallocated to
infrastructure investments, especially to agricultural tracks, and to
the construction of housing and storage facilities for CMDT.
17.       Project Cost and Financing.  At appraisal total project costs
(excluding taxes and duties) were estimated at US $44.6 million.
Actual project costs are difficilt to establish but are estimated to
amount to US $42.7 million. Savings are primarily due to elimination
of additional ginning capacity, originally anticipated to be financed
by CCCE.  Other savings were the result of the scaled-down rice and
kenaf  development  components.   Costs  might,  however,  be  somewhat
underestimated, as Government and farmers' contributions are difficult
to establish. Table I compares appraisal estimates by components with
estimated actual expenditures.
18.       Financing was arranged with BADEA, ADF and CCCE on a parallel
basis and pari passu with FAC.  As the new ginnery included in the
cotton development component was not built, no financing was provided
by CCCE. Financing of ADF and in particular BADEA did not commence
until the second half of the project implementation period, which
affected the rice, kenaf and livestock components. Disbursements of
ADF  funds  fell  short  of  the  original  project  estimates.    The
Government's and farmers' own contributions are estimated to have
exceeded  appraisal  estimates  somewhat.   The  appropriate  level  of
disbursements of BADEA funds evolved into an issue of dispute between
CMDT and BADEA.  CMDT objected to the exchange rates applied by BADEA,
which  deviated  significantly  from market  rates  or exchange rates
applied by IDA. The reason for this was that BADEA had covered its
exchange risk by forward coverage and applied the rate obtained under
this coverage.   This did not seem acceptable to CMDT.  This issue
remained unresolved.
19.       Disbursements.    Table  2  depicts  disbursements  of  IDA
financing according to categories.  Total disbursements amounted to US
$15.06 million, an amount of $441,413.22 allocated to the completion
of the studies for the development of oncho areas was cancelled.
Important  reallocations of expenditures were made for categories 3
and 4, which exceeded substantially original estimates, while category
i (compound fertilizers) was reduced, as sufficient short-term credit
was  available  through  the banking  system  to  finance  inputs.   In
contrast, it was difficult for CMDT to secure longer term credit to
finance the construction of warehouses and garage3.  Disbursements
extended over a longer period than originally anticipated due to delay
in project implementation in the start-up phase, and due to late
submission of disbursement requests by the project implementation
agency, CMDT.

20.       Procurement.   The  SAR  specified  that  all  contracts  for
equipment, compound fertilizer and construction with a value of more
than US $50,000 be subject to international competitive bidding.
Contracts of less than $50,000 were to be procured locally on the
basis of domestic competitive bidding. Procurement under the project
proceeded smoothly with two exceptions. IDA refused approval for the
financing of vehicles of CMDT in the first project year as vehicles
were replacements for previous vehicles, and therefore not additional
vehicles as specified under the project. Moreover, vehicles were not
purchased in accordance with ICB procedures and IDA had not given
approval  to  the  contract.   The  second  incidence  referred  to  a
construction contract for CMDT facilities awarded in 1980 to the
"Soci6te Nationale d'Entreprise et de Travaux Publics" (SONETRA). IDA
objected to the award of the contract to SONETRA as the company was
judged technically unqualified and another qualified bidder presented
a bid which was 11% cheaper than the SONETRA bid.

III. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
21.       Performance  on  the  agricultural  production  side  of  the
project was mixed during the implementation years. Results of cotton,
kenaf and irrigated rice production were disappointing. In contrast,
maize and millet/sorghum production showed impressive developments,
significantly exceeding project objectives. The cultivation of maize
increased from 6,500 ha to 38,200 ha between 1975/76 to 1984/85, and
of sorghum/millet from 26,100 ha to 135,600 ha in the same time
period.   The Mali Sud area, however,  showed substantial gains in
production of most crops in the 1984/85 and 1985/86 seasons,  far
exceeding annual production targets of the first and second Mali Sud
Project.  While some of these gains were due to good rainfall in the
1984/85 and 1985/86 seasons, some of the gains are also likely the
result of investments and institution building efforts carried out
under the first Mali Sud project.   Evaluation of the agricultural
impact of Cr. 669-MLI should therefore be extended to include
production results achieved beyond the actual project implementation
period.
22.       The  project  was  successful  in  the  application  of  its
technical package and its credit component for the purchases of
fertilizers and agricultural equipment.  In the first three project
years, application of fertilizers and insecticides expanded rapidly,
but declined in the 1980/81 and 1981/82 seasons, responding to the
strong increase in input prices. With increasing returns to cotton
production reestablished in 1982/83, application of fertilizer and
insecticide again picked up. By 1984, 89% of the area under cotton
cultivation was treated with compound fertilizer and 80% with at least
three insecticide treatments (see Annex 2 for detailed statistics).
Fertilizer   and   insecticides   are   not   directly   applied   to
millet/sorghum, but the rapid expansion of improved millet/sorghum
production experienced during the project implementation period is
likely the result of crop rotation with cotton thereby benefitting
indirectly from inputs applied to cotton.   The technical package
designed for cotton production under the Mali Sud Project appears to
have had important spill-over effects for the production of other
crops.
23.       The project was an unqualified success in the implementation
of the agricultural equipment component. Distribution of agricultural
Implements exceeded project targets in almost all project years and
for all items (see Annex 3).  The rapid acceptance of agric ltural
equipment in the Mali Sud appears to be the combined effect of a well
organized extension service, coupled with a credit component, all
organized by one strong institution, CMDT, which was well accepted and
trusted by the farmers and AVs.
24.       Cotton.   Area  brought  under  cotton  production  expanded
rapidly during the first three project years and reached a record high
in 1979/80, primarily due to sufficient, well distributed rainfall.



- 10 -
The situation reversed in 1980/81 when area brought under cotton
cultivation was reduced for the first time; it fell further
dramatically in 1981/82, when both area planted and production had
plunged to 79,200 ha and 87,200 tons of seed cotton, below the level
at project start-up (see Table 3). Thereafter, cotton production
recovered steadily and by the closing of the project in 1984 had
reached 83% of the projects production target. This growth continued
vigorously under the Mali Sud II project, and total production reached
an all time high with the 1986/87 season, amounting to 201,000 tons of
seed cotton production compared to 139,100 tons in the 1984/85
season..
25.       The decline in cotton production was to some extent due to
unfavorable weather conditions in 1980/81 and 1981/82, which seriously
depressed yields.   But more importantly,  decline in areas brought
under cotton cultivation were caused by a serious erosion in financial
returns to cotton production experienced by farmers in 1980/81. Table
4 shows the decline in net revenues experienced in 1980/81, which were
the result of increasing input prices, stagnating producer prices, and
declining yields.   Since  cotton  farmers  in  Mali  react  in  their
planting decisions with a one-year lag 2/, the effects of the 1980/81
pricing decisions were primarily felt in 1981/82. Then area brought
under cotton cultivation declined further by 23%, in spite of a
gradual improvement in returns to cotton production due to a
substantial increase in nominal producer prices.   The declines in
areas under cotton cultivation was further caused by a shift  in
relative  prices.   Table  4  points  to  the  significant  shift  in
cotton/millet price ratios, which dropped from 2.2 in 1979!80 to 1.5
in 1981/82 and of cotton/maize which declined from 2.2 to 1.4 during
the same time period.  The shift in relative output prices coupled
with the erosion of financial returns to cotton production led to a
significant substitution from cotton into millet/sorghum. Production
statistics provided in Table 3 depict this trend: while the areas
brought under cotton cultivation declined by 23,200 ha in 1981/82, in
the same year area brought under sorghum/millet cultivation increased
by 33,400 ha.
26.       Cereals.  The rapid expansion of cereals production in the
CMDT region was an unexpected development. Actual maize production
and area brought under cultivation far exceeded original project
objectives. In the final project year (1984) area cultivated with
maize, exceeded project targets by 260%, but calculated from a very
low base.   Developments of sorghum and millet during the project
period was even more encouraging. The appraisal report of Cr. 669-MLI
2/   The one-year lag effect of price announcement for cotton is clearly
brought out in the econometric studies by K. Levine, Trends in Malian
Agricultural Production, World Bank, 1983.



- 11 -
acknowledged production of sorghum and millet in the CMDT area but
expansion of the area brought under cultivation was not explicitly
defined as a project objective. Yet, during project implementation,
sorghum and millet were increasingly brought under systematic
cultivation and CMDT extension services were covering sorghum and
millet areas.   Table  3 points to the dramatic  increase in areas
brought under improved millet and sorghum cultivation.   The rapid
expansion of areas grown with millet/sorghum in 1977/78 to 1979/80
might also reflect the treatment of these crops in CMDT's production
statistics: while sorghum/millet was formerly grown outside official
areas  supervised  by  CMDT,  sorghum/millet  now  became  a  crop
systematieally included in CMDT's extension services.  At the same
time, it reflects the substitution effect brought about by shifts out
of cotton into millet/sorghum due to declining returns from cotton
productions and shifts in relative prices (see para. 17).
27.       Kenaf.  Production objectives for kenaf were not achieved and
purchases through CMDT were discontinued after 1982. Kenaf production
in the first project years was slow to increase due to unattractively
low producer prices. After a substantial increase in producer prices,
kenaf production augmented in  1979/80.   At the same time,  kenaf
production in Mali became increasingly uncompetitive with jute imports
from Asia. As domestic production was too expensive for the SOMASAC
processing plant, substantial subsidies needed to be paid to continue
further processing of domestic kenaf through SOMASAC. These subsidies
were judged to be justified for a certain period of time as kenaf
presented the only cash crop in the northern region of CMDT, where
rainfall was insufficient to grow cotton. In 1982/83 subsidy payments
for kenaf production became unsustainable; SOMASAC was closed and
purchases of kenaf through CMDT were discontinued. Kenaf production
in the Mali Sud area continued only on a very limited basis with
selected purchases through private traders for export to the Ivory
Coast or for the domestic market.

IV.  LIVESTOCK
28.       The project's livestock component was to be limited to the
improvement of animal husbandry practices of the cotton farmers under
supervision of CMDT extension services. The component included the
establishment of extension services for livestock, the constructLon of
livestock vaccination yards, and vaccinations against rinderpest and
pleuropneumonia. Implementation was to be carried out by CMDT through
agents seconded from the livestock services to CMDT. The component
was to be fully financed by BADEA.  Due to the late signing of BADEA
loan documents, implementation of the component only started in
1979/80.   This late start is the mnin reason for the incomplete
implementation of the livestock program.  While by the end of the
project period all 22 extension agents were in place and were actively
promoting the defined themes, the coverage of the program remained
substantially  below  expectations.    As  no  reliable  monitoring
statistics were developed, achievements of the livestock component
cannot be presented in quantitative terms.  Some difficulties were
encountered with the vaccination component. Coordination between the
national livestock services end CMDT did not function and mortality of
livestock, particularly in the Sikasso area, remained higher than
anticipated.  The construction program of central vaccination yards
also was  reformulated  during project  implementation.   As  central
facilitiet were expensive and remained underutilized, only 8 of the 42
scheduled central vaccination yards were constructed.   Smaller and
simpler vaccination areas were instead constructed by AVs at the
village level.  In spite of the difficulties experienced with this
component, a special livestock supervision mission, carried out in
May 1982, praised the Mali Sud livestock programs as the most
successful livestock program in West Africa, which in particular
achieved a good integration of agriculture and livestock. The program
was continued and expanded under the Mali Sud II Project.

V.   ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
29.       The recalculated rate of return of the project is 37.5%
compared to 44% at appraisal.  Project costs and benefits have been
estimated   over  a   20-year  period,   consistent  with  appraisal
assumptions. The rate of return calculated refers only to the crop
component.  No rate of return was estimated for investments in the
livestock  component  as  available  data  did  not  allow  for  a
quantification of benefits. All costs and benefits are expressed in
constant 1985 prices.  Annex 4 presents detailed costs and benefits
and economic prices  for individual crops.   The major assumptions
underlying the calculations are as follows:
(a) The cost stream includes project investment costs for all crop
development components as well as project costs for training,
research and agricultural tracks, as theae components are most
directly linked to agricultural production. Excluded from project
costs are the health and studies components, as no benefits could
be quantified  for these activities.   The assumptions for the
opportunity cost of labor in this PCR differ significantly from
the assumptions in the SAR.  While the SAR assumed opportunity
cost of labor of CFAF 205/day (in 1985 prices), in the
recalculated ERR all labor is valued at CFAF 400/day. Actual wage
data available and selected interviews in the field point to much
higher wages than assumed in the SAR, caused primarily by
increasing labor shortages due to expanded agricultural production
and small industrial and trading activities. The opportunity cost
of labor of CFAF 205/day assumed in the SAR is judged to be
unrealistically low.
(b) Incremental production for cotton, kenaf, paddy, maize and
millet/sorghum  is  included  as  project  benefits.   Incremental
production is estimated over the same baseline assumptions as made
in the SAR.  Production levels achieved in 1985 are projected
until the end of the 20-year project period.   Projected world
prices for 1987 to 1997 are based on EPD price forecasts and a
constant exchange rate assumption of 300 CFAF/$.  The recalculated
rate of return includes incremental benefits for millet/sorghum,
starting with the fifth project year.  Benefits and costs for
millet/sorghum were not included in the analysis of .;he SAR as
improved millet/sorghum production was not specified as a project
objective.   During project  implementation,  however,  it became
obvious that improved millet/sorghum cultivation was a significant
development in the project area which was closely linked to the
technical  packages  delivered  by  extension  agents  for  cotton
production.  The role of millet/sorghum as an alternative crop to
cotton production has already been pointed out (see para. 17).
Starting with  the  fifth project  year,  40%  of millet/sorghum
production of the CMDT area is counted as incremental project
production. Only 40% is allocated as a conservative estimate of



- 16 -
the project impact as production statistics are unreliable and
millet/sorghum has likely been shifted from marginal production
areas to CMDT supervised fields.  Therefore not all production
shown in CMDT statistics can be assumed as incremental production.
30.       The somewhat lower than anticipated economic rate of return
over SAR estimates is due to the higher assumptions for opportunity
cost  of  labor.   At  the  same  time,  in  the  first  three  project
Implementation years the project benefitted from incremental cotton
production  much  higher  than  anticipated.   This  had  a  positive
influence of the estimated rate of return.   As none of the high
production gains achieved in all crops in the 1984/85 and 1985/86
season were attributed to this project, the economic rate of return of
37.5% is likely to be somewhat underestimated. Increased production
achieved in these two seasons were not attributed to the project as
the influences of good wheather conditions, attractive producer prices
and technological changes induced by the first project are difficult
to separate without careful econometric analysis.
31.       The project has important secondary benefits not quantified
in  the  economic  analysis.    These  include,  in  particular,  a
strengthened human infrastructure through improved literacy and health
as well as better developed skills at the village levels brought about
by extension services and agricul-ural/vocational training programs
supported  trader  the  project.   But  even  more  important  are  the
organizational changes which have been introduced in the social fabric
of Mali Sud villages through the AVs. These village associations not
only carry out important activities related to cotton production and
marketing, they also decide and undertake numerous development
activities in the fields of health, literacy training, maintenance of
feeder roads, energy development through bio-gas ovens, and more
recently the development of facilities for cereals stocks. Tne AVs
have in many ways become the pillars of rural life in the Mali Sud
area and represent a strengthened, more responsive and efficient rural
self-help structure involved in commercial as well as development
activities. Important income, employment and linkage effects, brought
about through rapid agricultural development and project investments,
can also be observed in the Mali Sud area: higher levels of income
and an improved rural infrastructure have encouraged increased
small-scale industrial and trading activities. These can particularly
be observed in the more urban centers of Sikasso, Koutialla, Fana and
San. Small industrial activities still remain limited, but a growth
momentum can be observed, particularly in the repair and assembly of
agricultural implements.

VII. *INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
32.       The  institutional  development  was  certainly  the  most
successful aspect of the Mali Sud I Project.   CMDT and the rural
village structure in charge of cotton production was significantly
strengthened through the first project. The institutional structure
created provided much of the basis for the success of cotton
production in Mali experienced in subsequent years under the follow-up
project  1985/86-1986/87.   During  the  implementation  period,  CMDT
successfully applied the technicai production package to most of the
cotton farmers, strengthened Its extension services by including
significant areas of cereals production, assumed responsibility for
distribution of agricultural inputs and equipment and credit. Most
importantly, CMDT successfully developed a well-functioning system of
village participation which built on the dynamics of cotton
production. The system of AVs developed rapidly during the project
period. In 1985 about 600 AVs were responsible for a wide diversity
of activities.
33.       It is remarkable that the institutional performance could be
achieved in spite of a continued weakening of CMDT's financial
structure (see paras. 27-29). CMDT managed to survive the financial
crises through squeezing costs, improvements of ginning coefficients,
and some cross-subsidization from more generous allocations received
from barames other than cotton. But CMDT also managed to survive the
difficult financial situation because of its relatively strong
personnel structure. Even at the beginning of the project, CMDT was
already   a   fairly  well   functioning   institution  with   strong
administrative structures and a relatively well-trained staff. This
was a heritage of the former CFDT, not a contribution of the project.
Yet, Cr. 669-MLI carefully built on these structures, through a
successful technical assistance and training component. The technical
assistance component was designed as a training component with the
built-in transfer of expatriate activities to Malian personnel. While
in 1974, CMDT maintained 33 expatriates, the number was reduced to 14
in 1982 and to six in 1984.  Technical assistance positions were
limited to selected executive positions or technical and financial
services which were judged to be crucial to the success of the
operation.

VIII. KEY PROBLEMS
34.       Production Incentives.  Government showed a mixed record in
managing prices for cotton production. The rapid erosion of returns
to cotton experienced in 1979/80 and 1980/81 is the main reason for
the dramatic decline in cotton production in the mid-years and the
resulting shortfall in cotton targets.  Government was reluctant to
increase producer prices while increasing input prices to reduce input
subsidies.   Taxation  continued  to be  excessively  concentrated  on
cotton, while alternative crops, in particular cereals, were exempted
from taxation. In 1982, producer prices for cotton were about 62% of
export parity equivalents (69% after reincorporating the effects of
input subsidies), while at the same time effective market prices for
cereals were close to 100% of border parities. Taxes were essentially
levied through two interventions: one, the direct taxes collected on
cotton exports, two, surpluses maintained by SOMIEX and used to cover
deficits incurred by SOMIEX from other operations.  These surpluses
constitute the difference between the transfer price paid to CMDT plus
actual SOMIEX costs and actual c.i.f. price. Table 5 depicts how this
taxation of SOMIEX continued to be excessive even in 1981/82 when
after the poor cotton harvest experienced in 1980/81 there were strong
indications that cotton incentives were insufficient.  In contrast,
adjustments were rapidly made on the general level of taxation, when
after the poor 1980/81 harvest, cotton export taxes were abolished.
To prevent in future a similar erosion of returns to cotton
production, the Second Mali Sud Credit (Cr. 1415-MLI) made adequate
returns to cotton production the centerpiece of its adjustment
component. As Government accepted a maximum cash cost coefficient of
30%, farmers were granted a guaranteed rate of return to cotton
production. 3/ But with the excess supply situations emerging in
international cotton markets during the 1985/86 and 1986/87 seasons,
the cash cost coefficient system was short-lived.   It had to be
abandonned  in the  1986/87  season when due  to  financial deficits
accumulated in the previous cotton season the guaranteed producer
price  became  unsustainable  and  producer  prices  had  to  remain
depressed. In 1986/87 cash input costs amounted again to about 36% of
gross revenues per hectare of cotton.
3/   Cash cost coefficient is defined as total fertilizer and pesticide
costs per hectare of cotton at the average application rate, as a
percentage of gross revenues per hectare at the average yield level.

35.   Financial Viability of CMDT.   CMDT's financial viability was
identified as a major issue early in project preparation and remained
unresolved for the most part during the implementation period. Final
solutions to the issues were only agreed upon with negotiations of the
Mali Sud II project (Cr. 1415-MLI).  CMDT's financial viability was
threatened on three accounts:
(a) CMDT was severely undercapitalized as CMDT equity was never
sufficient. This limited CMDT's access to short-term borrowing in
times of high liquidity needs as Malian banking regulations allow
only for borrowing up to 10% of equity;
(b) ITEMA, COMATEX and SOMIEX maintained significant outstanding
liabilities  which  threatened  the  liquidity  of  CMDT.   CMDT  in
particular suffered under the injection of SOMIEX as intermediate
buyer.   Due  to  insolvency  of  SOMIEX,  payments  to  CMDT  were
constantly delayed, which increased interest charges and threatened
CMDT's creditworthiness with the banking system.
(c) CMDT's costs were not sufficiently remunerated under the "bareme"
system, which did not specify compensation of CMDT on costs
actually incurred and did not provide for an adequate remuneration
of CMDT, which could then be reinvested into equity. Moreover,
CMDT was not compensated for subsidies paid for agricultural inputs
and equipment and could not make provisions for amortization of
equipment and ginneries.
36.   To remedy the financial difficulties of CMDT the loan documents
for Cr. 669-MLI specified four major provisions:
(a) CMDT and its trading partners (SOMIEX, COMATEX, ITEMA) enter into
yearly agreements by which the latter indicate their planning of
monthly purchases of lint and cottonseed and commit themselves to
paying CMDT within specified dates from delivery.
(b) It was furthermore agreed that as a condition of credit
effectiveness, Government would have taken measures satisfactory to
IDA so that overdue debts owed to CMDT by SOMIEX, ITEMA and COMATEX
would be paid within six months of credit signing;
(c)  CMDT's commission would be increased to the level of 5% of the
ex-ginning price. The commission was to be used for reinvestments
in equity;
(d) the "bar&me" would include a provision for the depreciation of
equipment and for subsidies given CMDT farmers for the purchase of
agricultural inputs.
37.   Little progress was made on all issues.  Some of the initial
outstanding liabilities of SOMIEX, COMATEX and ITEMA were repaid in
the  first  two  years  of  project  implementation.   But  with  the



- 21 -
deteriorating financial situation of SOMIEX and COMATEX financial
arrears accumulated again.  CMDT's financial situation deteriorated
dramatically in 1979/80 and 1980/81 when the cotton bareme made
insufficient provisions for reimbursements of costs, made no provision
for depreciation of ginneries, and did not provide for adequate
working  capital.   The  deteriorating  CMDT  remuneration  is  well
reflected in Table 5, which shows the negative remuneration in
1980/81, while at the same time increasing taxation through SOMIEX.
Government's squeeze on CMDT was motivated by its need to tax cotton
to increase fiscal revenues. Various supervision missions alerted IDA
to the fact that cotton barame were not in agreement with several
covenants and IDA intervened to demand compliance with the Credit
Agreement. Yet, CMDT remunerations were only increased in 1981/82. A
permanent solution to the financial issues was only found with the
Second Mali Sud Project (Cr. 1415-MLI), which separated CMDT from the
direct purchases of SOMIEX and linked all participants of the cotton
production system to the Cbtton Account, which directly received
receipts  from  exports  of  cotton  and  remunerated  CMDT  on  actual
expenditures incurred.
38.   Procurement through SCAER.  The appropriateness of procurement of
agricultural inputs and equipment through SCAER was an issue raised by
Bank  staff  already  early  during  project  preparation.   SCAER's
financial position weakened significantly during project preparation
time, as a result of poor repayment records of agricultural credit
through farmers and the provision of agricultural inputs and equipment
by SCAER at subsidized rates which were not fully covered by
Government transfers to SCAER.   SCAER's financial position in the
appraisal year was already precarious.   As regular deliveries and
applications of insecticides and fertilizers were judged to be vital
to the success of the project, IDA staff considered it essential that
CMDT should be allowed to procure its own inputs and equipment.
Government was not in agreement with this proposition and proposed
instead  to  strengthen  SCAER.   Agreement  was  finally  reached  at
negotiations that if procurement arrangements after one year of
project implementation were not satisfactory, Government was to take
appropriate steps, satisfactory to IDA, to ensure such procurement.
This was not to exclude the transfer of procurement responsibilities
from SCAER to CMDT.
39.   During  the  first  project  year  SCAER's  financial  situation
deteriorated further. As a result, in the 1977 planting season there
were shortages of fertilizers and insecticides. Further, in November
1978 only a small proportion of inputs required for 1978 were
available to be distributed to the villages, when trucks drive to
villages to pick up cotton and usually transport inputs for the next
planting season on their way to the villages. To find solutions for
the rapidly aggravating procurement situation, Government commissioned
a study financed by CCCE, which proposed several alternatives to the
present procurement situation. In July 1978, the Government of Mali
informed IDA that CMDT had been authorized to purchase agricultural



- 22 -
inputs and equipment for farmers in the CMDT area directly. This
decision could not be immediately implemented and for 1979/80 SCAER
continued to purchase fertilizers for CMDT. By 1980, CMDT had become
fully responsible for all input and equipment purchases.

VIII. IDA'S PERFORMANCE
40.   The Mali Sud Development Credit is in many ways an example of a
well-defined and timely project. The intervention came at a time when
CGDT had just been founded as a "socite mixte' (1974). While CND-
inherited from its preceding organization, CFDT, good administrative
structures and a relatively well-trained staff, the task was now to
establish its own management, to gradually transfer responsibilities
from expatriate to Malian staff and to preserve the autonomy necessary
for a commercially-oriented corporation to function efficiently. The
objective was also to gradually expand the role of CMDT from a purely
commercially-oriented cotton corporation to a development institution.
IDA performed a constructive role in this institution-building aspect.
At the end of the project period, CMDT was a strong, dynamic
institution which had expanded its managerial abilities and dynamics
well beyond its original cotton growing and marketing activities. It
had become the country'a most successful and dynamic development
institution.  While the results of this strengthened institutional
framework were only partly reflected in production statistics during
the project period, the improvements became more obvious in the
implementation years of the Mali Sud II Development Project, when
cotton production increased rapidly and CNDT showed significant
efficiency gains in production costs.
41.   Mali Sud was also well designed as an area development project.
Centering on the strengthened cotton production system, it also
concentrated   on   complementary   development   activities:    road
construction, community development, health, literacy and functional
training.   At the same time, unlike many other rural development
projects, Cr. 669-MLI did not spread managerial capacity too thinly
over many components and institutions. Project activities remained
limited and well-focussed, the institutional framework remained well
defined.
42.   The project also presented an effective technical package.  This
package was well delivered by the extension service and accepted by
the farmers. The ready acceptance of agricultural equipment, improved
and extended use of fertilizers and insecticides (in spite of
increased input prices) demonstrates the readiness of farmers for the
technological  innovations.   The  project  was  also  strong  on  the
financial side.  CMDT's financial situation was carefully analyzed,
all financial issues were identified and highlighted early in the
project cycle.  The reason that CMDT's financiai problems remained
essentially unresolved throughout the implementation period, was only
partly  a  reflection  of  poor  IDA  performance.   They  remained
unresolved, as Government was unwilling to make difficult political
decisions: Government was unwilling to delegate cotton exports from
the financially weak SOMIEX to CMDT, was slow to delegate procurement
from the bankrupt SCAER, and continued to tax cotton heavily at a time
when farmers needed additional price incentives to increase cotton
production. As such the financial structure of CMDT and production



- 24 -
incentive system fell victim to the country's weakening macro-economic
situation. Tax revenues were needed from cotton to finance increasing
budget deficits and to subsidize SOMIEX deficit operations, which
largely  subsidized  imported  consumer  products.   During  repeated
supervision missions IDA alerted and intervened at appropriate
political levels to rectify the deteriorating financial situation.
The interventions remained for the most part futile--partly also as
the conventional project approach did not provide the framework or the
incentives to discuss and correct broader macro- and sectoral
distortions.
43.   While   the   financial   analysis   undertaken  during  project
preparation and supervision was thorough, the solutions designed to
solve CMDT's financial problems were somewhat unimaginative.   The
insistence of IDA staff to base cotton barames on actual cost incurred
by CMDT is understandable but provided little incentive to CMDT to
reduce cost. It pushed CMDT instead into an accounting system and an
operational attitude which has as its primary objective to demonstrate
actual cost incurred and is not designed to control and monitor cost
developments.   The  insistence  of  IDA  staff  on  maintaining  and
increaskig the compensation to be paid to CMDT, calculated as a
percentagt. of actual cost incurred, was another incentive for CM-T to
demonstrate higher rather than lower costs. Rather than maintaining
this cost-oriented incentive system, a more efficiency-oriented system
should have been designed.
44.   IDA staff was not successful in its analysis of agricultural
pricing and production incentive issups. The danger that inadequate
producer prices and distorted relative prices might seriously affect
cotton production, was not --c'gnized. Instead, the SAR uncritically
stated that the level of proaucer prices was adequate, while at the
same time recognizing that producer prices for cotton represented only
60% of the economic value, compared with 100% of economic value for
kenaf, maize and paddy. 4/ This comparison already indicated heavy
price distortions biased against cotton. Such price distortions would
only  have  been  justified  if  cotton  supply  had  been  very
price-inelastic--an unlikely assumption for a cash crop. No analysis
was undertaken during project preparation or supervision to estimate
cotton supply elasticities to gauge the production effects of pricing
policies. The SAR equally uncritically recognized the very high level
of taxation of seed cotton at the appraisal stage but accepted the
level of taxation as justified as cotton is the major export
commodity.   No effort was made to examine this effect of export
taxation on cotton supply and demand. It is likely that with an early
identification  of  the  cotton  pricing  issue  and  a  prominent
presentation of the issue during project preparation the very
4/   See para. 7.10 SAR No. 1171-MLI.



- 25 -
significant shortfall of cotton production experienced in the later
years of project implementation could have been either avoided or more
limited.   During  supervision  missions  the  importance  of  the
appropriate producer prices was only recognized after the very poor
1980/81 harvest--too late to rectify the situation.  With the lag
effects of prices experienced in farmers' production decisions (see
para. 17), the dramatic decline in cotton production which occurred in
the 1981/82 season could not have been avoided. Appropriate levels of
producer prices were subsequently made the centerpiece of the
adjustment component of the Mali Sud II Development Credit which
essentially provided for a guaranteed-rate-of-return to cotton
production through the "cash cost coefficient" system. 5/

X.    CONCLUSIONS:  LESSONS LEARNED
45.        Based on the experience of the first Mali Sud Development
Project and Its follow-up operation now under implementation some more
general conclusions can be highlighted:
(a) agricultural producrion activities and complementary development
activities can be implemented successfully within the framework of
a project intervention,  provided the project is well-focused,
limited  in  components  and  rests  on  a  strong  institutioual
structure;
(b) area development must rest on a sufficiently strong economic base.
In the Mali Sud area, cotton production exercised the function of
a motor-of-development, with important linkage effects (income,
employment, structural development) and spill-over effects in the
production of other crops (millet/sorghum, maize);
(c) the rapid development of maize and millet/sorghum along with
cotton underlines the fact that extended cash crop production does
not necessarily imply substitution of food crop production.  To
the contrary, in the Mali Sud area, rapid expansion of cotton had
beneficial effects on improved cereals production;
(d) area development projects must rest on a sound institutional
structure, capable of handling various complementary production
and development oriented activities. The success of the Mali Sud
project is to a large extent the result of the effective
intervention of CMDT.  The institution was able to effectively
handle extension, credit, supply of inputs and agricultural
equipment and marketing of cotton, while at the same time
implementing and supervising development activities.   This can
only be undertaken by a strong administration, staffed with
capable  and  motivated  personnel.   The  Mali  Sud  experience,
however, successfully demonstrates the benefits of centering all
these activities in one efficient institution. By concentrating
several   service,   development   and   commercial   activities,
economies-of-scale could be achieved by utilizing one functioning
extension  and  distribution  service.   This  would  have  been
difficult to coordinate with a number of different institutions
involved;
(e) the concentration of interventions in one strong institution also
facilitated  communication  between  farmers  and  villages.   The
messages sent by CMDT were clear and consistent, and farmers came
to trust CMDT as a reliable and knowledgeable partner. This was
certainly one reason for the quick acceptance of the technical
package. With more institutional players involved in the program
it is unlikely that a comparable trust relationship could have
been developed;



- 27 -
(f) but the success of the Mali Sud area project also points to the
limitations of the area development approach, particularly when
successfully  implemented.   Because  different  agricultural  and
development activities were centered in one strong institution
confined in its operations to one region, national services and
development agencies did not receive the support needed to operate
more  efficiently.   CMDT  has  in  many ways  replaced  national
services, and where they continued to exist, overshadowed them.
While   efforts  were   made   to   coordinate   national/regional
institutions with CMDT activities as for example in the health and
livestock components, collaboration has proven difficult and CP)T
has for the most part been a too forceful and efficient partner to
work successfully with  the national administration.   National
institutions have proven difficult to strengthen due to the more
immediate  effects  of  macro-economic  mismanagement   on  the
functioning of these institutions and their close integration into
the political structure;
(g) the project experience painfully highlighted the interdependence
of a project with the macroeconomic environment in which it
operates.   The  Mali  Sud  project,  albeit  well  designed  and
implemented by a strong institution, could not be isolated from
the deteriorating macro-economic developments resulting, among
other things,  in  increased Government  budget  deficits.   This
induced the Government to undertake rapid increases in input
prices, heavy taxation of cotton and insufficient financial
remuneration for CMDT;
(h) the project experience also highlighted the importance of adequate
producer price incentives. The negative supply response to cotton
production in 1980/81 and 1981/82, together with the simultaneous
extension of the area brought under cereals production, bears
testimony to this fact.
