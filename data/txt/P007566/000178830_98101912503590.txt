MEXICO
SECOND MEDIUM SIZE CITIES WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Mexico has requested the continuation of Bank finan-
cial assistance for the expansion and improvement of water supply and sewerage
systems in medium-size cities. The project was prepared by the Secretariat of
Human Settlements and Public Works (SAHOP) with Bank assistance. The total cost
of the project is estimated at US$297 million equivalent, and a Bank loan of
US$125 million is recommended to finance the foreign exchange component.   The
Borrower will be the National Bank for Public Works (BANOBRAS), and the Executing
Agency, will be SAHOP.   The Beneficiaries will be state or municipality-owned
water supply and sewerage companies. The works to be financed are scheduled for
construction and completion during the four year period 1980-84.
1.02      The following medium-size cities are expected to benefit from the
project (see map No. 15092):

2.  Nogales       Sonora         115,100       Water
3.  Tepic         Nayarit        121,400       Water & Sewerage
4.  Toluca        Mexico         240,000       Water & Sewerage
5.  Cd.Juarez    Chihuahua       671,500       Water & Sewerage
6.  Matamoros    Tamaulipas    214,500         Water & Sewerage
7.  Queretaro    Queretaro       315,000       Water & Sewerage
SAHOP had prepared feasibility studies for the first four cities by the time of
appraisal; this report summarizes the conclusion of these studies.  Subsequently
SAHOP liubmitted satisfactory feasibility studies covering the last three
cities- .  SAHOP is preparing additional feasibility studies for two or three
more cities accounting for the balance of the project and would be submitted to
the Bank not later than June 30, 1981.
1.03      In addition to reviewing the four subprojects mentioned above, the
appraisal mission focused on strengthening the capacity of BANOBRAS and SAHOP.
Particular attention was given to SAHOP's project preparation, supervision, and
technical assistance responsibilities (para. 2.23, 3.13 and 6.15).

II. THE SECTOR-/
Population
2.01      The mid-1979 population of Mexico was estimated at 67.9 million
inhabitants, of which about 63% were urban and 37% rural (communities with
less than 2,500 inhabitants).   The total population is growing at an
estimated rate of 2.9% annually. This growth rate has been declining from
3.5% p.a. which prevailed in the 1960s in part as a result of the family
planning program started in 1972.  The present administration is further
strengthening this program with the ambitious goal of reducing population
growth to 1% p.a. by the year 2000.
2.02      With regard to the provision of public services, the problem of
rapid population growth is compounded by an uneven geographic dis-
tribution. Twenty percent of the total population lives in the congested
Mexico City metropolitan area, while rural population is scattered among
almost 100,000 localities.   A serious effort is being made to influence
population distritTtion patterns  through  the National  Plan  for Urban
Development (PNDU)-
Water Resources
2.03      Mexico has  particular water  resource  limitations.   Rainfall
ranges from 100mm per year in dry areas to 5,000mm in the tropical low
lands. Heavy rainfall areas are thinly populated, while dry areas are
heavily populated.  About 85% of the surface water resources are found
below 500 meters of elevation, while 75% of the population and 80% of the
industrial output are located above that level. As a result, water in many
areas is scarce and costly, and competing demands from agriculture, domes-
tic consumers, and hydroelectricity are accentuated.  Aware of the needs
for orderly use of their scarce water resources, the Mexican Government
requested assistance from United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to
prepare a national water study. The resulting National Water Plan (PNH),
for which the Bank was the executing agency, was prepared from 1972-75.
Its objectives, which were at least partially achieved, were to formulate
and institutionalize systematic water resource planning to aid in the
rational selection of water programs, projects and policies. To this end,
a permanent PNH commission was established in 1976 under the Secretariat of
Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources (SARH).
2.04      The total mulWi-use water consumption in 1970 was estimated at
around 31,000 million m , representing §% of the total annual renewable
water resources (over 400,000 million m ).  Of the water withdrawn, 95%
was used for irrigation, 3% for domestic use, and 1% each for energy and indus-
try. A PNH groundwater survey identified 32 aquifers as being overpumped,
mostly for irrigation purposes.   The maldistribution between population
and water resources is escalating the cost of urban water as sources
located at more remote sites have to be exploited.
1/ A sector memorandum prepared under the IBRD/PAHO Cooperative Programme
was published in August 1979. It is available in Project Files.
2/ Copy available in project files.

Health Situation
2.05      The reporting of health statistics has somewhat improved in re-
cent years. It is estimated that about 95% of all deaths are registered
and 80% are certified by the medical authorities.   While these figures
pertain to the nation as a whole, reporting in rural areas is less accurate
than in urban zones because of dispersion of the population, difficult
communications,  and lack of health services.   The mortality rate for
enteritj7 and other diarrheal diseases in 1975 was 85 per 100,000 inhab-
itants,- showing a reduction from 119 in 1963. Mortality rates from these
diseases, however, still occupied second place in the all-age group in
1975.   Of all  diseases,  waterborne  and  sanitation-associated  enteric
infection and diseases account for the highest mortality rate in Mexico.
In contrast to declining mortality rates, morbidity rates for diarrhea,
dysentery and salmonellosis all rose between 1963 and 1977 indicating poor
water supplies and unsanitary living conditions.  More health statistics
are available in project files.
National Planning
2.06      While PNH represented a serious analysis of the water resources
and their present and future uses, the recently elaborated PNDU should
become the blueprint for a more rational distribution of economic activi-
ties and population.  The plan aims at improving the population/resource
mismatch by controlling growth in the three main centers (Mexico City,
Guadalajara and Monterrey), and promoting development in a number of in-
termediate cities. In an effort to decentralize the economy, these inter-
mediate cities are to serve as growth poles in a number of regions. These
regions form priority zones and are to be particularly favored with public
investments.  Analogous centers with a full range of public services are
planned to serve surrounding rural populations.
2.07      The general policies outlined in PNDU are now being translated
into specific programs at regional, state and municipal levels,  For the
purposes of required water supply and sewerage investments, SAHlOP has
worked in close contact with the local authorities, and has prepared a
1980-82 investment program for urban areas.  Details of this program are
given in paragraphs 2.20 and 2.21.
Sector Organization
2.08      At the national  level,  the 1972 Water Law assigned the main
responsibility for planning, constructing and operating water supply and
sewerage works to the Secretariat of Hydraulic Resources (SRH) Twhenever
such works were partially financed or required loan guarantees by the
Federal Government.  Even in cases where no federal financing was involved,
the entities which were to exploit  water resources had to obtain SRHVs
approval, especially whenever there were competing demands for scarce
water. The 1976 Administrative Reform assigned the authority previously
exercised by SRH to its successor,  SARH.   Responsibility for the con-
struction of water distribution and sewerage systems in urban and rural
areas, however, was assigned to SAHOP.   SARH and SAHOP have set up a
committee to coordinate the functions of these agencies in each geogra-
phical region.
1/ For selected countries in Latin America these rates were: Perut 7C in
1972;  Colombia:  53 in 1975;  Argentina:  21 in 1970.



- 4 -
2.09      SARH's organization includes a Direccion General de Captaciones
y Conducciones de Agua which plans, constructs, and operates bulk-water
schemes that deliver water to municipal borders where SAHOP's jurisdiction
begins. SARH is generally responsible for water supply schemes only where
the projects are multi-purpose or where there is drought or where there are
competing demands  for water resources.   SARH is in charge of overall
planning of water resources administration, but delegates the actual cons-
truction and operation of specific water supply schemes to SAHOP.
2.10      When SAHOP was formed in 1976 it absorbed the former Secretariat
of Public Works and several Directorates from the old SRH (organization
charts are presented in Annexes 3 and 4). Among these Directorates were
the General Directorate for Construction of Water Supply and Sewerage
Systems (DGC) and the General Directorate for Operations (DGO).   SAHOP
includes two other Directorates responsible for water supply and sanita-
tion: one for systems in border towns (Juntas Federales de Mejoras Mate-
riales-JFMM) and the other for desalinization schemes (Direccion General
de Aguas Salinas).
2.11      SAHOP  initially  experienced  difficulties  in discharging  its
responsibilities, but this situation has improved considerably.   Recent
developments include the implementation of guidelines for preparing feasi-
bility studies and engineering designs.   A planning division has been
created to coordinate sector activities at all levels and develop strate-
gies to meet sector goals. To operate at the state level, SAHOP has formed
the Centros SAHOP, or state offices, that take on a large share of the
sector tasks.   Their duties are not restricted to the water supply and
sanitation fields. The operation of some 1,200 systems is arranged through
a variety of operational entities, among which the Juntas Federales de Agua
Potable (JFAP) under DGO are the most important ones. The management of
both JFMM and JFAP has been inefficient.   Their operations have been
hampered by a lengthy, centralized decision-making process, and their fi-
nances have suffered from insufficient cash generation and lack of clear
financial policies.   As part of SAHOP's decentralization plan, JFMM and
JFAP are being transformed into local water and sewerage companies.
2.12      At  the  state  level,  the  regional  offices  of  the  federal
agencies,  and SARH and SAHOP are responsible for carrying out federal
investment programs in their respective states.  The organization of the
Federal Government is mirrored by state governments which have specific
duties in the sector, including the definition of investment programs in
agreement with SAHOP.   In addition,  they are responsible for approving
water and sewerage tariffs. SAHOP is assessing a program for the creation
of state-wide water companies which would be in charge of operations and,
eventually, construction of rural and urban water supply systems.   This
program is in agreement with PNDU and would aim to develop, in addition to
the local water companies, strong state-owned companies.   Provided that
appropriate financial arrangements are made, such state companies could
resolve the problem of supplying rural and small cities which could not
have viable companies at the local level. SAHOP has requested Bank assist-
ance in the creation and definition of scope of these companies which SAHOP
expects to be operative by late 1981.



- 5 -
2.13      Finally, at the local and municipal levels, the entities have
varying degrees of autonomy in the operation of their water supply and
sanitation systems: (a)  Federal Juntas (JFMM and JFAP - para. 2.10 and
2.11) which are owned and controlled by SAHOP; (b) the so called Juntas
Estatales de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado (State CompanIes), which are in
practice municipal entities operating water supply and sewerage systems
only at the local level; the operation of these companies is controlled by
state authorities but their jurisdiction is restricted to their respective
municipalities and their revenues cannot be transferred to any other state
or municipal entity;  (c) autonomous municipal water supply and sewerage
companies, which are managed by local authorities; and (d) departments of
the municipalities in charge of these services.   The authority of local
companies is greater in larger urban communities and their autonomy
(including construction) is almost complete in the cases of Guadalajara
and Monterrey.
Service Levels and Quality
2.14      Service levels have been estimated on the basis of partial data
provided by SAHOP since the entities in charge of operating the systems at
the local level do not monitor or report this information regularly. It is
estimated that by mid-1979, about 54% of the urban population (excluding
the Federal District) had access to potable water through house connec-
tions and about 42% (excluding the Federal District) was connected to sew-
erage systems. Service levels in the Federal District are reported to be
83% for water supply and 80% for sewerage services. Service levels in ru-
ral areas are lower; about 38% of the population has access to water sup-
plies through house connections, while access to waterborne disposal sys-
tems is almost non-existent.   No information is available on coverage
through septic tanks or latrines in rural areas.   Service  levels are
summarized in Table 2.1.
2.15      The percentage of total po?ylation served with water connections
rose from 49% in 1970 to 53% in 1979,-  a substantial increase (21% to 38%)
in the percentage of rural population served being offset by a significant
decrease (65% to 54%) in the urban population served (excluding the Federal
District).  Heavy migrations of low-income rural population to urban areas
have not been accompanied by the necessary investments in the sector. As a
result, about 17 million people living in urban areas, mostly lower-income
population, do not have access to safe water.
2.16 I/   The percentage of total population with sewerage in 1979 was
32%, -  as opposed to 35% in 1970 (Table 2.1).  It is estimated that about
21 million urban dwellers did not have access to waste water disposal
systems in 1979.
1/ In 1978 service levels by house connections in selected Latin American
countries were: Colombia: 61% water and 42% sewerage; Peru: 34% water
and 34% sewerage.

2.17      Water supply in Mexico is provided mostly through house con-
nections..  Public standpipes are used only as an interim solution or to
serve dispersed urban and rural populations and are not considered by the
governn nt and the urban population as an acceptable permanent solution.
The extent of water pollution is not known in detail, and desinfection
(chlorination) of water supplies and water quality control are limited.
Many water supply systems reportedly provide intermittent services. This
presents a pollution risk when contaminated groundwaters infiltrate the
water lines. To overcome these problems, the Secretariat of Public Health
and SAHOP had initiated by mid-1979 a program to control and improve the
quality of water for domestic use.
Past Sector Investments
2.18      Over the 1971-78 period, executed annual investments in water
supply and sewerage projects, expressed in 1978 prices, were about Mex$8 bil-
lion. On average, the share of total sector investments in the Mexico City
Metropolitan Area was close to 50%, while the remaining 50% was distributed
among other urban and rural areas where 80% of the Mexican population
lives.
2.19      Both SARH and SAHOP have been financing their projects with
funds from the Federal Government, in most cases interest free, with the
intention of recovering investments in 10 to 20 years. In effect most of
these works become grant financed. There are other channels and mechanisms
at the national level that intervene in water supply and sanitation works.
The Convenios Unicos de Coordinacion (CUCs), for example, seem to be grow-
ing in importance. These are direct agreements between the Federal Govern-
ment and each of the 31 State Governments. The CUCs are instruments for
distributing federal revenues as grants and are intended for a wide range
of investments in rural areas. SAHOP often acts as the executing agency
for CUC projects.   One exception to the pattern of grant financing is
BANOBRAS, which has been financing water and sewerage works through dif-
ferent lending windows at varying interest rates (para.   3.02).  One of
these is the Investment Fund for Water Supply and Sewerage Works (FIFAPA),
which was supported by Loan 1186-ME. Bank support would be continued under
the proposed project.
Sector Objectives and Programs
2.20      Mexico's long term goals aim at providing by the year 2000, 95%
of the urban and 70% of the rural population with piped water, and 80% of
the urban and 42% of the rural population with sewerage or sanitation ser-
vices. SAHOP has developed intermediate targets for the year 1982 for ur-
ban areas, excluding the Federal District.  These targets are to provide
water to an additional population of 8 million and sewerage to 5 million,
reaching a coverage of about 70% in water supply and 50% in sewerage.  For
the rural areas, a recently approved SAHOP-COPLAMAR program will provide
piped water to 8.2 million additional inhabitants and will rehabilitate
existing systems benefitting 6.8 million inhabitants.   The coverage of
water supply in rural areas would thus reach 66%.



- 8 -
2.21      The investment programs for the period 1980-82 are Mex$18 bil-
lion (US$800 million) and Mex$20.7 billion (US$920 million) for urban and
rural areas, respectively. More than 90% of the investments will be fi-
nanced by the Federal Government. This will more than double the annual
financing of the past decade for the sector outside the Metropolitan Area
(para. 2.18).
Manpower Aspects
2.22      In 1979, there were about 60,000 persons working on urban and
rural water supply and sewerage systems. The capability and experience of
engineers is adequate. At the local levels, however, integrated financial
and economic analysis in project preparation is still inadequate partly
because of the lack of qualified personnel in these areas.   Local con-
sulting firms and contractors are adequately qualified to undertake most
design, construction, and supervision of water and sewerage works. Oper-
ation and maintenance of these services suffer most from lack of funds and
inadequacy, both in number and quality, of skilled labor.
2.23      SAHOP initiated a national training program in late 1976 and its
first stage concluded in 1979. There were 1,675 participants who received
training through 66 courses given in different regions of the country.
These activities covered only a small percentage of the original ambitious
training plan. Loan 1186-ME included US$200 thousand to finance 40% of the
cost of this program.   This allocation has not yet been used and is
expected to be applied to a second stage of the training program. SAHOP is
presently evaluating the results of this first stage training program and
is preparing a second stage for 1980-84. The second stage would address
the most important deficiencies, and its goals are being set at a more
realistic and practical level. It places special emphasis on the training
of administrative and technical personnel at local levels, so that sector
decentralization policies can be implemented in a more efficient manner.
The programs are being coordinated and tailored to the needs of the muni-
cipal companies receiving financing under the proposed project in accord-
ance with the needs identified in the corresponding feasibility studies
(para. 4.03).   SAHOP has agreed to carry out this program, paying due
attention to the needs of the AWS companies.
Review of Previous Bank Loans
2.24      Since 1974 the Bank has been assisting Mexico with the imple-
mentation of sector plans. It helped to finance a US$155 million project
for bulk water supply for the Mexico City Metropolitan Area under Loan 909-
ME for US$90 million (signed on June 18, 1973), and a US$100 million water
supply and sewerage project for medium-size cities under Loan 1186-ME for
US$40 million (signed on January 13, 1976).
2.25      In addition, the Bank has participated in the financing of water
supply and sewerage components of the:
(a) Papaloapan Integrated Rural Development Project (Loan 1053-
ME) signed in November 1974, financing US$5.5 million for
water supply and US$1.6 million for sewerage;



(b) PIDER I Integrated Rural Development Project (Loan 1110-ME)
signed in November 1974, financing US$7.1 million of the
sector components;
(c)  PIDER II Integrated Rural Development Project (Loan 1462-
ME) signed in July 1977, financing US$6.6 million of the
water supply component;
(d) Zihuatanejo Tourism Project (Loan 793-ME), already com-
pleted;
(e) Baja California Tourism Project (Loan 1420-ME), signed in
May 1977; and
(f) Lazaro Cardenas Urban Development Project (Loan 1554-ME),
signed in April 1978.
The sector components were an integral part of the infrastructure com-
ponents of the latter three projects.
2.26      The first medium-size cities water supply and sewerage project
financed through FIFAPA, under arrangements similar to those of the pro-
posed project, is currently being implemented (para. 3.06). As of June 30,
1980, US$13.35 million (33% of the total loan) had been disbursed, and the
total loan and project funds are already committed (US$40 million and
US$100 million respectively).
2.27      Progress under this project has been slower than anticipated
mainly because of delays in signing the subloan agreements. Construction
started in late 1977, almost two years behind schedule, and completion of
the works is expected by December 31, 1981.  Municipal and state autho-
rities were initially reluctant to borrow for investments in the sector
since they had previously been obtaining federal funds as grants.  As a
direct consequence of this, two cities originally included in the project
(Salamanca and Jalapa) withdrew and were replaced by the city of Culiacan.
The main project objectives, however, should not be significantly affected
since FIFAPA and SAHOP are taking actions to accelerat Vproject execution.
The financial performance of the seven beneficiaries-  is satisfactory,
and all of them are complying with the subloan financial covenants.
Federal funds have been provided in a timely manner and project execution
is now proceeding satisfactorily.
2.28      Project preparation and final designs under Loan 1186-ME took
significantly longer than originally planned. As explained in paras. 6.07
and 6.08, particular attention was given to this problem in the course of
the project preparation and preparation of final designs is well advanced.
All subprojects will conform to guidelines prepared by SAHOP with Bank
assistance under Loan 1186-ME.

III. THE BORROWER AND THE EXECUTING AGENCY
Introduction
3.01      The Borrower will be BANOBRAS, which is also the Borrower in the
first Bank-financed water and sewerage project for medium-size cities
(Loan 1186-ME). BANOBRAS is a public corporation with the Mexican Federal
Government, holding 98% of the outstanding capital stock. BANOBRAS is a
financial agent of the Federal Government and operates several trust
funds.
3.02      BANOBRAS is one exception to the pattern of federal grant finan-
cing (para. 2.19) and finances urban infrastructure works through three
different lending windows at different interest rates.  While its normal
credits carry interest rates of 18% p.a., BANOBRAS' soft-loan window, the
Municipal Development Fund (Fondo Fiduciario Federal de Fomento Municipal-
FFFFM) lends at 4% to 6% p.a. and FIFAPA lends at 9% p.a.   FIFAPA is
partially funded by the Bank through Loan 1186-ME and would serve as the
channel for the proposed loan (para. 3.08).
3.03      SAHOP will be the executing agency (para. 3.11).  SAHOP, through
DGC's Financial Coordinating Unit (SCF) will be in charge of project pre-
paration, supervision of construction, and provision of technical assist-
ance in all areas of administration.   In addition,  SCF, on behalf of
FIFAPA, will monitor compliance with subloan covenants in each project
city.
The Borrower (BANOBRAS)
3.04      BANOBRAS, founded in 1933, is a national development bank spe-
cializing in public and social works lending (sanitation, urban deve-
lopment, marketplaces, housing and transportation). It provides loans to
federal, state and municipal governments and their agencies, and obtains
its funds from the Mexican Government and international markets (bond
issues and bank lines of credit).
3.05      According to BANOBRAS' Organizational Law, the Federal Govern-
ment controls its policies and, in practice, substantially directs its
borrowings and lending activities. The Secretariat of Finances (SHCP) has
veto power over the resolutions of BANOBRAS' Board of Directors and
approves BANOBRAS' yearly budget. BANOBRAS is authorized to carry out such
other functions related to its credit activities as may be approved by
SHCP. BANOBRAS is legally empowered to act as a Bank Borrower.
FIFAPA Trust Fund
3.06      At the end of 1975, the Mexican Government established a revolv-
ing investment fund, FIFAPA, as a trust fund under BANOBRAS to finance
water and sewerage investments in medium-size cities. The Government aims
at progressively replacing direct Federal contributions to investment in
cities with population over 50,000 with loans through FIFAPA.   For its
first operation, FIFAPA was authorized an equity capital of US$100 million
(to be financed by the proceeds of the Bank loan plus US$60 million equiv-
alent from the Government's budget), the capital to be paid in as the sub-
loans are disbursed.   By the end of 1979, all of the US$100 million had
been committed.



- 11 -
3.07      In September 1979, the Secretariat of Programming and Budgeting
(SPP) authorized by decree the increase of the Government's equity contri-
bution to FIFAPA to up to Mex$11,500 million (US$500 million equiva-
lent).This capital increase would allow FIFAPA to substantially increase
the scope of its operations and would guarantee the availability of Federal
funds to execute the proposed project. After SAHOP certification, FIFAPA
will pay contractors and suppliers. FIFAPA will also be responsible for
the timely collection of debt service payments from the beneficiary
cities.
3.08      FIFAPA will relend the proceeds of the Bank loan and Government
contributions to the AWS companies in each subproject city (paras. 7.09 and
7.10). Onlending terms are in accordance with the Government's investment
policies in the sector and replicate those of the first FIFAPA operation:
an interest rate of not less than 9% p.a. and a 15 years term after a grace
period equal to the construction period (2-3½ years) (para.  7.09).
3.09      Although the 9% interest rate is lower than th1cost of capital
in Mexico, and negative at current rates of inflation, - a higher rate
would result in an increased pressure from local authorities to obtain
interest-free funds from the Federal Government. The Bank has accepted the
judgement of the Mexican authorities that it would be premature to raise
the onlending terms including the 9% interest rate charged to local water
authorities, before the concept of loan financing of water supply projects
has been firmly established through the second FIFAPA operation. In ad-
dition, distortion in investment decisions or in financial management of
local institutions would be avoided by insuring: (a) that the least cost
alternative is selected; and (b) that while consumers in the lower income
brackets receive the benefit of the subsidies implied in the onlending rate
and water changes for basic volume consumption are kept at levels afford-
able to the poor, all consumption above this basic volume is charged at
above the long range average incremental cost of the services.
3.10      BANOBRAS agreed under Loan 1186-ME to have FIFAPA's accounts
audited each year by independent and qualified auditors, and to submit
copies of the annual audit report to the Bank not later than three months
after the end of each calendar year.   Compliance with this obligation,
which will also be included in the proposed loan, has been satisfactory. A
satisfactory audit of the 1979 statements of FIFAPA was performed by the
representatives in Mexico of the international firm of Ernst and Whinney-
Despacho Freyssinier Morin S.C.   Assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations that FIFAPA's financial statements will continue to be audited by
competent external auditors and that copies of the annual audit report will
be submitted to the Bank not later than three months after the end of each
calendar year.
The Executing Agency (SAHOP)
3.11      SAHOP will be the executing agency for the proposed loan (para.
3.03). SAHOP is in charge of the planning, design and construction of
1/ The annual average inflation rate in Mexico was 28.9% in 1977, 17.5% in
1978 and 18.2% in 1979, and 24.8% in July 1979-June 1980.   Inflation is
forecast at 15% in 1981, 13% in 1982 and 10% in 1983 and thereafter.

water and sewerage works in urban and rural areas wherever such works are
partially financed or require loan guarantees by the Federal Government.
In cases where no federal financing is involved, the cities have to obtain
SAHOP's  approval  for  their  water  and  sewerage  projects.    In  practice,
however, state and local governments have been able to circumvent SAHOP in
certain cases.
3.12      SAHOP is organized  into five major departments:   three Underse-
cretariats (Human Settlements, Public Works, and Urban Works), the Admin-
istrative Office, and the Centros SAHOP with offices in each one of the 31
states (Annex 3).   The heads of these departments report directly to the
Secretary.
3.13      The  Undersecretariat  of  Urban  Works  is  responsible  for,  among
other  things,  construction  and  operation  of  water  supply  and  sewerage
systems in urban and rural areas.  DGC under the Undersecretariat of Urban
Works (Annex 4) is responsible for project construction and supervision
and  of  all  projects  financed  by FIFAPA  through  SCF.   In addition,  SCF
provides technical assistance   to the beneficiaries in all areas of admin-
istration (para. 6.15)
3.14      SCF has made  considerable  progress  since its creation in 1976,
but still faces the problems associated with the rapid expansion of its
responsibilities. SCF personnel is qualified, although relatively inex-
perienced.   To cope with the tasks ahead,  SAHOP is strengthening SCF and
hiring additional professional staff.   The Bank discussed the organization
with the Director of SCF.   Assurances were obtained   during negotiations
that SAHOP will continue to exchange views with the Bank on its plans to
strengthen  SCF  and  assign  suitable  qualified  staff  in  adequate  numbers
including engineers, economists and accountants, as required for the dis-
charge of its responsibilities.
IV. THE BENEFICIARIES
Organization
4.01      The beneficiaries  of the proposed loan will be autonomous muni-
cipal or state water and sewerage companies (AWS companies) in charge of
the  operation  of water  and  sewerage  services  at  the  local  level.   The
creation of these autonomous companies is one of the major goals of SAHOP's
decentralization  policy.    Consequently  it  is  one  of FIFAPA's  onlending
requirements that such companies be formed where none exist.
4.02      The bylaws of AWS companies follow a standard pattern set by SAHOP.
All the companies manage their own assets and funds, and have an independent
Board of Directors and legal representatives. Generally, the Boards of Direc-
tors have five members. One is appointed by SAHOP, one by the State Governor,
one by the Municipal Council and two by representative groups from industrial,
commercial or consumer organizations.   Of the four cities appraised by the
mission (paras. 1.02 and 5.02), Monclova and Nogales, have AWS companies (para.
2.13). Tepic has a Federal Junta (JFMM -para. 2.10) and a municipal depart-
ment in charge of water supply and sewerage works respectively. As a result of
the proposed project, an AWS company has been created in Toluca, taking over
all assets and liabilities of the municipal department.   In Tepic a new AWS
company is being created to take over the responsibilities of the old federal
junta and the municipal department.



-13-
4.03      Most of the AWS companies still lack experience and, in general, are
not well managed. All share similar problems:
(a) lack of competent senior staff;
(b) poorly trained intermediate level staff, carried over from the
original organizations;
(c) inadequate operational and maintenance practices as reflected
mainly by the high percentage of water losses and deficient
metering;
(d) lack of clear financial objectives and tariff policies; and
(e) inadequate management information systems.
SAHOP is well aware of these shortcomings and is taking the necessary steps to
improve management efficiency of the AWS companies through: intensive train-
ing courses in all areas of management (para. 2.23); specific technical assis-
tance programs for each company to improve accounting practices and main-
tenance program; and close monitoring of their financial performance and com-
pliance with  subloan covenants.   SCF is responsible  for  identifying the
specific areas for improvement in the AWS companies and for coordinating the
provision of the technical assistance in a timely manner.   The areas for
technical assistance will be specifically identified in each subloan, includ-
ing a time frame for implementation of required remedial actions to be taken by
the AWS companies (para. 7.11 (d)).
Accounting
4.04      The majority of the AWS companies have cash accounting systems which
do not satisfy present needs. Of the appraised cities (para. 1.02), only the
Tepic and Monclova companies have accrual accounting systems. Their account-
ing methods, procedures and policies, however, are not satisfactory. Records
of fixed assets are not properly kept, moreover, they are not depreciated nor
revalued. In addition, the AWS companies do not have separate accounts for the
water and sewerage services and their cost accounting methods do not allow the
origin and application of funds by type of service to be determined. Accounts
receivable are not analyzed and a large percentage of such accounts are uncol-
lectables that have been kept on the books for many years. The project aims to
correct these deficiencies in accounting through the provision of consultants
to develop and implement an adequate accounting system in each beneficiary AWS
company (para. 7.05).
Audit
4.05      In all the appraised cities, an external audit has been performed by
SAHOP or by state or municipal authorities every two to four years.   Audit
procedures, however, are far from satisfactory. Under each subloan agreement
the AWS company concerned would be required to have its accounts audited every
year by independent auditors satisfactory to BANOBRAS/SAHOP (para. 7.11(h)).
Such audit reports will be available to the Bank for review.   A similar
requirement was included in subloan made under Loan 1186-ME and performance has
been satisfactory.



-14-
TariLffs
4.06      The AWS companies do not have the power to set tariffs, as this right
rests with the elected congresses of the states.  On the premise that water is
a social good, tariffs are often left unchanged for many years. In addition,
tariffs and other charges are set without a clear understanding of their
objectives and do not reflect the real cost of services to the companies. To
correct this situation, SAHOP has agreed to undertake a study to define ob-
jectives and criteria for tariff structure and levels. Specific tariff studies
within this framework will be carried out in each one of the project cities.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that this framework study will be
developed by SAHOP with Bank assistance not later than June 30, 1981.  SAHOP
intends to have these objectives applied by other cities financed through
FIFAPA.  Draft terms of reference for this study are presented in Annex 12.
Once this study is completed by SAHOP, each AWS company will develop to the
satisfaction of BANOBRAS and the Bank, not later than September 30, 1981, or
six months after subloan signature, whichever comes last, a specific tariff
structure, including a schedule for its implementation (para. 7.11 (c)).
V. POPULATION, SERVICE AND DEMAND IN THE PROJECT CITIES
General
5.01      PNDU, approved by Presidential Decree in May 1978, assigns top prio-
rity to the more even distribution of the urban population and orderly urban
growth through creation of job opportunities by new industries and adequate
provision of infrastructure services, including water and sewerage in medium-
size cities. The proposed project would support the PNDU strategy by helping
to proy1de adequate water supply and sewerage services in medium-size
cities.-
5.02      The estimated population of Mexico's medium size cities in 1979 was
about 12 million.(18% of the total population), as contrasted to the Mexico
City Metropolitan Area which harbors 20% of the country's total population.
These medium size cities are growing at an average rate of 4.2% p.a. as
compared with 2.9% p.a. for the country and 5.6% for Mexico City.  The four
cities appraised (Toluca, Tepic, Monclova-Frontera and Nogales) are taken as a
representative sample of the medium-size cities to be financed under the
project. These cities had a total population of 0.73 million in 1979 and are
growing at a rate of 4.9% p.a. Economic activity is increasing significantly
in these cities.  Toluca, for example, is the main center of the automotive
industry and Monclova-Frontera has one of the largest steel factories in the
country.   Nogales, due to its proximity to the US, has a strong commercial
activity.   Toluca and Tepic,  capitals of the States of Mexico and Nayarit
respectively, are important trading and Government centers.

City, Monterrey and Guadalajara.

Water Resources
5.03      Water resources,  albeit scarce, are not a limiting factor in the
provision of water supply services in these four cities. All four cities draw
their water from groundwater sources, through deep wells or infiltration
galleries, within close range of the consumption areas and additional supplies
can be tapped without special difficulty to meet the expected demand for the
next 15 to 20 years. These groundwater sources, if protected from domestic and
industrial pollution, have the additional advantage of offering water of good
physico-chemical and bacteriological quality that requires only chlorination
to make it safe for human consumption.
Existing Water Supply and Sewerage Systems
5.04      Production capacity in the four cities is now limited and needs
expansion and/or improvement to cover present and future demands. The adequacy
of existing water supply and sewerage services for present and future demand
varies from one city to another.   However, common needs are:  (a)  additional
water production and chlorination facilities; (b) water distribution network
improvements to reduce extreme pressure variation to within acceptable limits
(10 to 50 m.); (c) extension of water supply and sewerage networks to provide
services to low-income areas;   (d) increase in metering coverage; and (e)
improvements in the administrative practices of the local water and sewerage
companies. The municipalities are responsible for providing solid waste col-
lection and disposal services. Information on existing water supply and sewer-
age facilities is given in Annex 1 and in the project file and is summarized in
Table 5.1.
Population Served and Service Levels
5.05      The average water service level in these four cities (70%) is above
the national average for urban areas (61%), while the average sewerage coverage
(47%) is lower than the national average for urban areas (51%). Water service
levels vary from 40% in Nogales to 78% in Toluca. Sewerage service levels vary
from 23% in Nogales to 75% in Toluca.
5.06      Even though coverage in three of the appraised cities is above the
national average, water supply services in all four cities are far from satis-
factory.   Services  in many areas of the cities,  especially in low income
neighborhoods, are provided on a restricted basis due to the inadequacy of
water production and low pressure in the distribution mains. Even Toluca and
Tepic, where water service levels are relatively high, the water supply cannot
be considered bacteriologically safe, as 40% is not chlorinated. In the four
cities, as a result of inadequate water services, some 223,000 people presently
lack house connections and must rely on such hazardous alternatives as public
standpipes or water vendors for temporary relief.
5.07      Metered connections vary from a low of 16% in Nogales to a high of
90% in Monclova, with an average of 67%.   These figures are somewhat mis-
leading, however, as many connections have faulty meters.  Toluca, following
recommendations made by the Bank, has completed a service census to detect
faulty meters and register illegal connections.   Other cities, where appro-
priate, will carry out similar surveys.   Water production is not regularly



- 17 -
metered. Volumes have been estimated on the basis of short-term metering of
production sources and on the number of hours that deep well pumps operate.
Consequently, and given the high percentage of unmetered connections, unac-
counted-for water figures should be considered only rough estimates.
5.08      All four appraised cities have sewerage systems, often of the com-
bined type (storm and sanitary) which have been gradually converted into se-
parate systems as the need for sewage treatment becomes more pressing. Present
sewerage services are inadequate and some 384,000 people are not covered.
Sewerage systems do not function properly due to insufficient capacity of trunk
sewers, and sewage often spills into the streets during heavy rains. In
Toluca, interceptors are inadequate and sewage is discharged into open courses
within the city, thus fouling the environment and creating health hazards.
People lacking sewerage facilities rely on latrines or septic tanks which
frequently overflow because they are not properly maintained. In addition, as
all of these four cities rely on groundwater for their water supply, infil-
tration from latrines or septic tanks may constitute a health hazard.
5.09      Monclova and Nogales have sewage treatment facilities. In Monclova
the sewerage effluent is delivered to the local steel mill where it is treated
(activated sludge process) and reused for industrial purposes. Water reuse
will continue and increase in the future as the steel mill is expanding its
production. In Nogales, under international agreement between the United
States and the Mexican Government, the sewerage effluent is treated at Nogales-
Arizona's sewage treatment plant (oxidation ponds) built with funds provided
by both Governments. Under the agreement, ogales-Arizona will treat Nogales-
Mexico's sewage up to a volume of 18,750 m /day. Given present water consump-
tion and projected service levels, this sewage volume will be reached by 1986.
SAHOP is working on a sewerage master plan to provide for the treatment of
excess waste flow in Nogales-Mexico. Sewerage works, financed by Federal and
State funds, are already under construction in this city to increase coverage
to about 65% by 1983. In Toluca, because of heavy industrial wastes, SAHOP is
developing a plan for the treatment of both domestic and industrial wastes.
The proposed project will finance the construction of a sewage treatment plant
in Tepic to reduce pollution in the Mololoa River. As a general rule, sewage
treatment facilities will be part of the proposed subproject in each city, in
accordance with Government objectives of improving the environment and ecology
of receiving waters.
5.10      Subproject designs for the four cities follow SAHOP's design
standards for the provision of water and sewerage services. These standards,
which the Bank reviewed and found acceptable, make planning provisions for 20
to 25 years and works are staged to cover future demands for 10 to 15 years.
The proposed works correspond to the minimum cost alternatives at a discount
rate of 11% p.a.
Water Production and Consumption
5.11      Estimated waterfTroduction to meet the urbanneeds of thi four cities
appraised varies from 51 m /month/connection in Mosclova to 79 m /month/con-
nection in Toluca (Table 5.1) with an average of65 m /month/connection. These
wide variations are accounted for by, among other things, differences in clima-
tic conditions, extent of metered house connections and industrial con-
sumption. Water consumption varies seasonally from a low of 0.70-0.80 of

annual average during the winter and rainy seasons to a high of 1.20-1.30 of
average during summer. Domestic consumption accounts for 70% to 80% of total
consumption. Distribution of consumption varies widely among consumers, as
typified by the information on metered consumption in Toluca, Tepic and
Monclova (Table 5.2).
Population and Demand Projections
5.12       In 1979, the total urban population of Toluca, Tepic, Nogales and
Monclova was estimated at about 730,000. The average growth rate for these
cities of 4.9% p.a. is expected to decline gradually to 4.0% in 1990-95. By
1995, the population will almost double to 1.44 million. Population, service
levels and demand projections from 1979-95 are available in the project file
and summarized in Table 5.3.
5.13       The lack of adequate distribution systemmaintenance programs in the
past, very old pipes and malfunctioning meters account for the estimated high
percentage of unaccounted-for water (Table 5.1). The proposed project in-
cludes the purchase and installation of water meters at production sources. In
those cities where unaccounted-for water is higher than 30%, which is con-
sidered a practical attainable limit, the subproject loan agreement will pro-
vide funds to carry out a leak detection survey and leak repair program (para.
7.11 (e)).
5.14       In 1979, the average per capita production in these four cities was
330 liters/day, the per capita consumption 190 liters/day, and unaccounted-for
water 140 liters/day. Water demand projections for each city (Table 5.3) take
into consideration: (a) the lower per capita consumption of the low-income
population to be served; (b) improvements in the quality of service; (c)
extended metering in house connections; and (d) tariff increases in real terms
during project construction (Annex 13).
5.15       Water service coverage by house connections is expected to increase
from an average of 70% in 1979 to not less than 80% by the end of the construc-
tion period (1984) and to 90% by 1995. Unaccounted-for water is expected tobe
reduced from an average of 41% to about 30% by the end of the construction
period.  This reduction takes into account the leak detection and metering
programs to be included in the subprojects.   Sewerage service levels are
expected to increase from an average of 47% in 1979 to not less than 70% by 1984
and 80% by 1995.
VI. THE PROJECT
Introduction
6.01       Since early 1979, four Bank missions have visited Mexico to assist
FIFAPA/SAHOP in the identification and preparation of the project. These
efforts follow a Government request for further Bank participation in the
financing of the sector. This project would be the Bank's second direct opera-
tion through BANOBRAS/FIFAPA to develop water and sewerage services in medium-
size cities throughout Mexico.



- 21 -
6.02      The proposed project will consist of improvements and extension of
water supply and sewerage systems in medium-size cities. It is expected that
the project will be completed by June 30, 1984.
Project Objectives
6.03      The proposed project aims to:
(a)   support the objectives of PNDU (paras. 2.06 and 5.01) through
adequate provision of water supply and sewerage services in
medium-size cities;
(b)   assist SAHOP in its decentralization policy through the trans-
formation of local water supply and sewerage services operated
by the Federal Government or directly by the municipalities
into autonomous and financially viable AWS companies;
(c)   strengthen the management capabilities of existing and newly
created AWS companies and improve their financial and oper-
ating performance;
(d)   improve the environmental and health conditions in medium-size
cities through:
(i) expansion of water and sewerage services, especially to
low income areas;
(ii) implementation of chlorination programs to provide bac-
teriologically safe water to all of their urban population
by 1983; and
(iii) provision of sewage treatment in cities where pollution
problems are more pressing or where downstream water use
requires it.
Priority Criteria
6.04      Subproject cities have been selected by FIFAPA/SAHOP in accordance
with the priorities set forth in the PNDU (para.  2.06).   Service coverage
levels lower than the national average for urban areas and the existence of
idle production capacity allowing increase in coverages by complementary in-
vestments are additional factors taken into account in the selection.   In
addition, in all cities to be included in the project:
(a)   a feasibility study will be prepared for the proposed subpro-
ject ifn /accordance with SAHOP's guidelines for project prepara-
tion - and the proposed works will represent the least-cost
solution; and
(b)   an autonomous municipal or state company will be in charge of
operation of water and sewerage services (para. 4.01) and will
have to agree with FIFAPA/SAHOP goals on financial viability
as set forth in FIFAPA onlending conditions (para. 7.11).

- 22 -
6.05      There is a risk that some of the selected cities might not agree to
the onlending conditions, and consequently would not be eligible for FIFAPA
financing and would be excluded from the proposed project. It has been agreed
with the Mexican authorities and confirmed during negotiations that in the
event that an investment program for any project city is cancelled, other high
priority subprojects could be included,  conforming  to the above mentioned
criteria.
Service Standards
6.06      Water and sewerage services in the project cities will be provided
through house connections. In particular, the standards are in accordance with
the population's habits, expectations and ability to pay.   These standards
conform  to  the  Government's sector  objectives  and  to  proper  management
practice of water and sewerage companies. Existing facilities in all project
cities will be upgraded to extend their useful lives, and expanded to reach
higher service levels and to meet the needs of a growing population (para.
5.15). The project includes the construction or extension of waterborne sewer-
age systems where population density is too high to continue using alternative
disposal systems or where infiltration from alternative systems would endanger
the quality of city groundwater sources (para. 5.08). It is not considered
economically feasible to extend service by house connections or waterborne
sewerage connections to serve all the population as many people live in scat-
tered areas on the outskirts of the cities.   It is estimated that by 1995,
about 10% of the population will continue to be served by public standpipes and
about 20% by latrines or septic tanks.  In the four appraised cities (21% of
project cost) a population of 303,000 and 337,000 would benefit, from water and
sewerage services respectively by 1984 (Table 8.2).   By 1995,  the project
benefits would reach an incremental population of about 625,000 (water) and
717,000. (sewerage).
Status of Design
6.07      SAHOP qrepared feasibility studies for seven cities, four of which
were appraised. - These seven studies were prepared with the aid of local
consultants and found satisfactory to the Bank.   These feasibility studies
include subprojects comprising 71% of total project cost.
6.08      The degree of project preparation parallels the proposed implementa-
tion schedule. SAHOP's consultants are working on the final designs, and those
for the four appraised cities are 90% complete.  Final designs for the addi-
tional three subprojects are 80% complete. Therefore, final designs are ready
for work which represents about 60% of total project cost. It is expected that
bids could be called during the first year of project execution for at least
40% of project costs.
Project Description
6.09      Detailed project scope for each one of the cities appraised is pre-
sented in Annex 2. Works in these cities are representative of the project and
comprise the following:

(a)   provision of new production  facilities  and improvement of
existing ones to increase production capacity to meet demand
needs up to 1995;
(b)   chlorination  of all water  supplies  to provide bacteriolo-
gically safe water by 1984;
(c)   construction of transmission pipelines to connect the new pro-
duction facilities to the distribution systems and provision
of additional storage capacity;
(d)   extension of the water system to areas without service and
improvements of the water distribution system to increase its
delivery capacity;
(e)   construction of new metered house connections and provision of
meters for currently unmetered connections to cover about 95%
of all connections;
(f)   purchase and installation of production meters and meter re-
pair shops, and implementation of leak detection surveys and
leak detection and control programs to reduce unaccounted for
water to about 30% by 1984 and 25% by 1995;
(g)   construction of sewer interceptors and outfalls to eliminate
discharge of sewage in populated areas;
(h)   extension of sewer pipes to areas without sewerage service
including the construction of house discharges;
(i)   construction of sewage pumping stations where topographic con-
ditions preclude the use of gravity systems;
(j)   construction of sewage treatment plants where downstream use
(domestic or agricultural) requires improvement in water qua-
lity; and
(k)   provision of technical assistance programs to the local water
and sewerage companies to improve the operational capabil-
ities, including the implementation of an accrual accounting-
system and the acquisition of accounting, water quality con-
trol laboratory and leak detection equipment.
Cost Estimates
6.10      The estimated cost of the project is US$297 million equivalent of
which US$125 million represent the foreign exchange component. Total project



-24-
cost is exclusive of taxes -/ and of interest during construction financed by
FIFAPA. Cost estimates in June 1980 price le?ls have been based on bills of
quantities and unit prices prepared by SAHOP - and its consultants for those
project components with final or advanced engineering designs. Estimates for
subprojects under preparation were prepared by SAHOP, and based on average unit
costs, engineering and administration expenses related to the project have
been estimated at about 7% of base cost on the basis of the experience obtained
during the execution of the first FIFAPA project. Physical contingency allow-
ances vary from 5% to 18% (averaging 15%) according to the type and location of
works and degree of advancement of engineering. Price contingencies were based
on a construction profile of four years starting in 1980. Price contingencies
for the local component were based on estimates of the Mexican price escalation
index of 15% in 1981,  13% in 1982 and 10% in 1983 and 1984.  Price contin-
gencies for the foreign component were estimated at 9% in 1981, 8% in 1982 and
7% in 1983 and 1984.  Table 6.1 gives a summary of investment costs for each
subproject.  More detailed costs for the four appraised cities and the three
additional subprojects submitted by SAHOP are presented in Annex 2.
6.11      Final engineering designs, supervision of construction and manage-
ment consultants for the AWS companies (mostly for the implementation of ac-
crual accounting systems) will require about 4,450 man-months of consultant
services at an estimated total cost of US$13.8 million (Annex 5, Attachment 2).
The average man-month cost, including salary, costs, fees, travel and sub-
sistence is expected to be about US$4,650 for professional staff and US$1,220
for support staff. Most consultant services for final engineering designs and
construction supervision will be charged by FIFAPA to each subproject in the
subsidiary loan agreement as a SAHOP administrative cost (para. 6.08). Due to
the technical capability of local consulting firms, no expatriate consultants'
input is expected.
Project Financing
6.12      The Bank loan would finance the US$125.0 million foreign exchange
component of the project. The Mexican Government has agreed to make available
to FIFAPA, as needed, the balance of its requirements.
6.13      The Bank loan would be made to BANOBRAS with the guarantee of the
Government of Mexico, BANOBRAS would bear the foreign exchange risk. In turn,
BANOBRAS through its FIFAPA Trust Fund, would relend the proceeds of the loan
and Government contributions to the local water and sewerage companies (para.
3.08). Relending of Bank proceeds and Government budget funds will be carried
out pursusant to subsidiary loan agreements between FIFAPA and each AWS com-
pany, state or municipality . Signature of each of the agreements and Bank
1/  Effective January 1, 1980 a value added tax (VAT) was introduced.  This
tax, in the sector, applies only to construction works and materials. VAT is
10% except in border areas where it is 6%.

approval of the agreements would be a condition of disbursement of loan pro-
ceeds for project expenditures incurred in each city. When a subloan is signed
between FIFAPA and a state or municipality, the subloan will  include the
obligation of the state or municipality,  as the case may be. to establish
within six months an autonomous company to operate the water and sewerage
services in the municipality. The establishment of such companies would be a
condition of disbursement from the proposed loan for each subproject.
6.14      If costs are greater than estimated,  the Federal Government will
provide FIFAPA with the required funds to cover overruns.  In those subprojects
where the works are completed at a lower cost than estimated, the Bank will
consider, at BANOBRAS' request, applying any resulting subloan surplus to
financing the cost of properly justified additional works. These surplus funds
could also be transferred to new subprojects as agreed upon between FIFAPA and
the Bank in accordance with the criteria listed in para. 6.04.
Implementation
6.15      SAHOP will be the executing agency for the proposed project, through
SCF under DGC (para. 3.13). SCF will be in charge of (a) supervising the work
done by engineering consultants hired by SAHOP to undertake final designs or
leak detection surveys; (b) preparing bidding documents, tender analysis and
the supervision of construction;  (c)  providing technical assistance in all
areas of management to the AWS companies, including preparation of terms of
reference, hiring and supervision of the work of consultants providing manage-
ment assistance to the companies; and (d) construction supervision and moni-
toring project execution and compliance with subloan agreements by the local
water authorities. The proposed investment program and construction schedule
(Annex 5), was confirmed during negotiations and will form the basis for
reporting on progress. The proposed investment program has been discussed with
FIFAPA/SAHOP and is compatible with the execution capability of SCF, demons-
trated in Loan 1186-ME.   SCF intends to delegate some of the supervision of
construction work to qualified engineering consultants working under its close
supervision. Bank supervision of the project should concentrate on assisting
SCF and the local water and sewerage companies to improve their management
practices.
Procurement
6.16      All goods and services will be procured in accordance with Bank's
guidelines as in the first FIFAPA operation (Loan 1186-ME).  To the extent
practicable, civil works and materials and equipment would be grouped as to
make them attractive for international competitive bidding (ICB). Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that before bids are invited and as a
condition of disbursement for each individual subproject, FIFAPA/SAHOP will
furnish to the Bank, for comment, the list of all major contracts it intends to
award for each subproject, and will make such modification as the Bank may
suggest. Contracts in excess of US$2.5 million for civil works and US$500,000
for the purchase of equipment and materials will be awarded on the basis of
ICB.   Contracts for less than US$2.5 million but over US$250,000 for civil
works or less than US$500,000 but over US$150,000 for the purchase of equipment
will be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding, the procedure for
which is satisfactory.  Contracts of less than US$250,000 for civil works  and
less than US$150,000 for materials subject to a maximum aggregate of US$12.5
million (4% of total project cost) can be procured directly on the basis of a
minimum of three quotations. No force account works are envisaged.

6.17      Given the advanced degree of development of the civil works con-
struction industry in Mexico, all civil works contracts are expected to be won
by local contractors.   For all contracts under ICB, FIFAPA/SAHOP will make
copies of bidding documents, bid analysis  reports  and recommendations  for
award available to the Bank for prior review and approval. General conditions
for tender documents to be used for ICB and local procurement were prepared
under the first FIFAPA operation and are acceptable to the Bank.  Contracts
awarded under local competitive bidding procedures will be submitted to the
Bank for ex-post review and disbursements will only be made after the Bank is
satisfied with said review. Goods manufactured locally and procured under ICB
would be allowed a preference of 15% of the CIF price or the level of import
duty, whichever is lower, over foreign goods.
Disbursement
6.18      The project would be completed by June 30, 1984, and the closing date
would be December 31, 1984.  Bank financing of the foreign component (42%,
para. 6.12) will be achieved by disbursing 45% of all payments to contractors
(net of VAT) except the repayment of the 5% retention withheld from civil works
contractors during the guarantee period following the completion of works or
SAHOP's direct cost for supervision of construction charged to the AWS com-
panies (para. 6.11). BANOBRAS will also be reimbursed 45% of the sum paid to
consultants for engineering designs, construction supervision and management
assistance to AWS companies. Table 6.2 shows the estimated schedule of dis-
bursements. Proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be disbursed under the
following category upon presentation of normal documentation:
Amount
US$        % of Expenditures
Category               Thousands         To be Financed
Equipment, materials, civil works,                       45%
and consulting services for
engineering and management
assistance                           125,000
TOTAL:               125,000
6.19      Retroactive financing from April 1, 1980,  for up to US$5.0 mil-
lion would reimburse FIFAPA for expenses incurred on subprojects approved
by the Bank.
Environmental Aspects
6.20      The  expansion  of water  supply  and  sewerage  systems  in medium-
size cities would lead to an increase in the volume of sewage discharged
into water courses.   In many instances,  the proposed works would help to
reduce health hazards from sewage spillovers caused by insufficient delivery



- 29 -
capacity of existing sewer system (para. 5.08).   The project includes the
construction of adequate sewage treatment facilities (para. 6.09 (j)) in those
cities where domestic and industrial pollutant loads could cause adverse
effects on downstream domestic and agricultural water uses.   In some cases,
sewage treatment will not be part of the proposed works ia a given city as
sewage pollution loads (both current and caused by the project) are low com-
pared with the self-purification capacity of the receiving waters and do not
interfere with downstream uses.
VII. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
BANOBRAS-Financial Performance
7.01      BANOBRAS' financial performance has been satisfactory.   Its oper-
ations are large and have been growing at a very high rate since 1976.   Its
assets and liabilities as of December 31, 1979, were US$4.6 billion equivalent.
BANOBRAS' net worth increased 80% from US$107.1 million in December 31, 1976, to
US$192.5 million as of December 31, 1979. Its net profit after taxes increased
60% from US$11.4 million equivalent in 1976 to US$18.3 million equivalent in
1979. Consolidated financial statements are presented in Annex 6.
7.02      The FIFAPA Trust Fund has been an important factor in helping the
Federal Government to reduce its grant financing through the present lending
policy. FIFAPA has contracted financing with seven entities for an aggregate
amount of Mex$ 2.17 billion (US$95.2 million) of which Mex$761 million has
been disbursed.  FIFAPA will continue to grow and it is expected that by the
end of 1983 the amount contracted to be financed will reach Mex$9.0 billion.
FIFAPA's assets and liabilities have increased from US$12.7 million equiv-
alent at December 31, 1978, to US$28.1 million equivalent as of December 31,
1979 and its net worth has grown from US$12.4 million equivalent at December
31, 1978, to US$27.6 million equivalent at December 31, 1979. In 1979 FIFAPA
had a net income of US$1.96 million equivalent compared with US$0.67 million in
1978.  As a means of capitalizing FIFAPA, the Federal Government will provide
counterpart funds on an equity basis. BANOBRAS will service the principal of
the debt of the Bank loan, assuming the foreign exchange risk.   Cash flow
statements  for 1980-84 are shown in Table 7.1.   Financial statements are
presented in Annex 7.
Subborrowers Financial Performance
7.03      Past financial performance of the water and sewerage companies to be
benefitted by the project is exemplified by the four cities appraised.   All
these operations share similar problems: (a) most maintain only cash account-
ing records (Toluca, Nogales and Tepic); (b) accounts of municipal water and
sewerage services (water and sewerage in Toluca; sewerage in Tepic) are com-
bined with those of such other services as markets and solid waste collection;
and (c) accounts for water and sewerage services are consolidated when a
company is in charge of both services (Monclova and Nogales).

7.04      In 1979,  the financial performapye of the four appraised cities
varied widely (Table 7.2).  Working ratios-  were 0.74 in Monclova, 0.57 in
Tepic, 0.95 in Nogales and 1.16 in Toluca.  Revenues have been low compared
with operational expenses.   Contribution to investment has been marginal or
nonexiste t. Accounts receivable are generally high and recorded inaccurately
as a large portion is made up of very old and uncollectable accounts.   Long
term debt is very low or nonexistent since most of the works have been grant-
financed by the Federal or State Governments. Fixed assets are not properly
recorded, leading to an unrealistically low base rate. Moreover, the accumu-
lated depreciation and depreciation charges are only best estimates since
these entities do not depreciate nor revalue their assets.  Because of these
problems, the financial information and projections for these four companies
for 1980-84, presented in Annex 9, can only be regarded as pre-
liminary and subject to revision upon installation of an adequate accounting
system (para. 4.04).
7.05      The proposed project aims at improving the managerial capacity and
financial performance of the beneficiary companies through the following
actions:
(a) providing training programs in specific areas of administration
as identified in each feasibility study (para. 2.23);
(b) using consultants to implement an accrual accounting system,
based on a manual prepared by the University of Monterrey which
has been reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable (para. 7.11
(c) inventorying and revaluating fixed assets. The methodology to
be used was reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable (para.
7.11 (g));
(d) adjusting tariffs and other charges to meet the required finan-
cial covenants (para. 7.11 (b)); and
(e) reducing accounts receivable to a maximum of three months of
billings not later than two years after subloan signature
(para. 7.11 (j)).

7.07      The total cost of the project is US$297 million equivalent excluding
a value added tax (VAT) of US$21.0 million, US$35.0 million of interest during
construction period charged by FIFAPA to the beneficiary cities, and US$18
million for minor extensions and replacements financed by the AWS companies
through internal cash generation.   The consolidated financing plan for the
project is presented in Table 7.4.

7.08       The total financing requirements for the project of US$371.0 million
equivalent would be financed as follows:
(a)   the Bank will contribute to FIFAPA trust fund with 42% of the
cost of each subproject, (33.6% of total financial require-
ments), up to a total amount of US$125 million to finance the
foreign exchange component of the project;
(b)   the Federal  Government  of Mexico  will provide  counterpart
funds to FIFAPA, on an equity basis of US$193.0 million (52% of
total financial requirements) (para. 7.02);
(c)   FIFAPA will finance interest during the construction period
(9.5% of total financial requirements) to the beneficiary
cities; and
(d)   the AWS companies will finance other works for minor exten-
sions and replacements (5% of total financial require-
ments) out of internal cash generation.



- 35 -
Subloan Agreements
7.09      FIFAPA will relend the proceeds of the Bank loan and Government
contribution to the AWS companies either directly or through the respective
municipality or state government for an amount equivalent to the cost of
construction and consulting services, the corresponding VAT, and interest dur-
ing construction.   Subloans eligible for inclusion in the project should be
signed before June 30, 1982. Each subloan will carry an interest of at least
9% p.a. and a 15-year term after a grace period equal to the construction
period but not greater than 3½ years.  The amount of each subloan cannot be
modified without prior Bank approval.
7.10      Each subloan will be secured by contractual agreements between
FIFAPA/SAHOP, the AWS company, and the government of the state. As required
by BANOBRAS, the State Government will guarantee every loan to an AWS company
in its state by giving FIFAPA a lien on the state's share of federal taxes.
Should a beneficiary fall behind with debt payments, FIFAPA would request the
National Treasury to deduct the amount overdue from its monthly distribution of
Federal taxes to that state. This procedure follows standard practices in all
BANOBRAS loans to municipalities.
7.11      Each subloan agreement would require Bank's approval as a condition
of disbursement for the corresponding subproject (para.  6.13).   Assurances
were obtained from BANOBRAS during negotiations that subloan agreements will
include the following specific conditions:
(a)   AWS Companies:  When a subloan is signed with a municipality or
state, it should include the obligation to establish, within
180 days from the date of the respective agreement, an auto-
nomous company to operate the water and sewerage services of
the beneficiary city and to relend to such autonomous company,
as soon as it is established, the proceeds of the, subloan under
the terms and conditions listed in items (b) to (j) below:
(b)   Revenue Covenant:   Tariffs, other charges and non operating
revenues for water and sewerage shall be set at such levels as
shall be required by each AWS company to obtain in each
calendar year, starting in the third calendar year after the
date of the corresponding agreement, revenues sufficient to
cover the sum of (i) all its operating expenses; (ii) increase
of working capital and the financing of working capital and
minor works (about 3% of net revalued fixed assets plus work in
progress); and (iii) the higher of either the annual interest
and debt repayment on the subloans or the annual depreciation
charges on revalued fixed assets.   The agreement shall also
provide that in the first two calendar years after the date of
each agreement, charges for the water supply and sewerage
services shall be set as follows:
(i) in the first calendar year after the date of the corres-
ponding agreement at a level at least equal to the level of
the present charges plus one-third of the difference
between the level of such present charges and that re-
quired to cover the sum of the item specified in (i), (ii)
and (iii) hereof, as estimated for such calendar year;



- 36-
(ii) in the second calendar year thereafter, at a level at
least equal to the level of the present charges plus
two-thirds of such differences; and
(iii) in the first and second calendar years mentioned in items
(i) and (ii) above revenues for water and sewerage serv-
ices should be sufficient to avoid cash deficits.
(c)   Tariffs:  Each AWS company shall review at least once a year
its tariff levels and other charges and timely submit, when-
ever necessary, a request to the state government and state
congress for tariff increases to meet the financial covenant
(Annex 10).  In addition, each AWS company should develop to
the satisfaction of BANOBRAS and the Bank a specific tariff
structure and schedule for its implementation (para. 4.06).
(d)   Institutional Arrangement:  The institutional changes and im-
provements, including training needs and time frame for their
implementation, recommended in the feasibility study prepared
by SAHOP, will be spelled out as obligation by the AWS com-
panies (para. 4.03).
(e)   Leak Detection and Control Program:   In those cities where
unaccounted for water is higher than 30% a leak detection and
control program will be carried out within the subproject con-
struction period.
(f)   Accounting:   Proper accrual accounting system will be esta-
blished in each AWS company within a year of subloan signature
(para. 7.05).
(g)   Revalued Fixed Assets:   Within a year of subloan signature,
the fixed assets will be inventoried and revalued (para.
7.05). As agreed under Loan 1186-ME, fixed isrsets will be
revalued annually in a proportion equal to 85%- of the cor-
responding variation of the Mexican Price Index (Indice Nacio-
nal de Precios al Consumidor -Banco de Mexico S.A.).
(h)   Auditing:  The accounts of the AWS company will be audited each
calendar year, by qualified independent auditors acceptable to
FIFAPA and SAHOP.   Such reports will be available for Bank
review.
(i)   Monitoring Indicators:   Based on the project objectives and
financial projections included in the feasibility studies a
list of Indicators (Annex 11) will be used to monitor project
execution. These monitoring indicators specify for each year
the following targets:   percentage of population served by
water and by sewerage services; number of water and sewerage
connections;    volume  sold;  percentage  of  unaccounted-for
waters number of employees per 1,000 water connections; cost
per m sold; average water tariff Mex$ per m ; and working
ratio.   These indicators should be updated semi-annually by
the AWS companies to FIFAPA/SAHOP's satisfaction.
1/   This percentage has been found to reflect the average increase in the
value of fixed assets within the sector.



- 37 -
(j)   Within six months of subloan signature, each AWS company will
submit a plan satisfactory to FIFAPA to reduce accounts re-
ceivable to a maximum of three months of billings not later
than two years after subloan signature.
7.12       SAHOP through SCF would be responsible for (a) monitoring the com-
pliance of the AWS companies with the subloan covenants; (b) procurement and
supervision of construction; and (c)  coordinating and supervising technical
assistance to the AWS companies (para. 6.15).
Tariff Structures
7.13       In most cities water and sewerage tariffs levels and structures are
inadequate. The main deficiencies are: (a) there is no differentiation between
types of csonsumers; (b) the minimum consumption allowance is often too large
(up to 20m per month) and as a consequence low income users, using an amount
well below that minimum, pay a higher tariff per actual volume consumed; (c)
progressiveness of charges for consumption is insufficient to discourage water
waste and to allow cross subsidies; and (d) fixed sewerage charges are widely
used and in many instances are levied on consumers lacking this service.
7.14       Connection fees charged to new consumers for either water or sewer-
age services include: (a) a fee (derecho de conexion) for the right of access
to the service,  and (b)   a charge for materials and labor costs that the
utility incurs in connecting the consumer to the service. The rationale for
these fees and charges varies from one city to another and the amount assessed
does not follow a uniform or consistent pattern. Because the AWS companies
have the right to vary these charges without approval from the State Legis-
lature, the charges are adjusted frequently to meet their financial needs.
This situation has caused these charges to be at such high levels that low
income consumers are often deprived from connecting to the water and sewerage
systems.
7.15      A special charge (cuota de cooperacion) has been instituted in some
instances, to partially recuperate the costs of water and sewerage works that
are considered to benefit specific areas, such as water distribution network,
small diameter  sewerage pipes,  and  individual  connections.    This  special
charge is based on the lot area, assessed to property owners and paid in annual
installments under terms and conditions set by each individual AWS company.
7.16       SAHOP has agreed to prepare not later than June 30, 1981, a framework
tariff study, which will establish the basic guidelines and criteria for tariff
levels and structures that would: (a) provide enough revenues to meet financial
requirements and promote an efficient resource allocation; (b) differentiate
between consumers in basic categories (i.e. domestic, commercial, industrial,
etc.); (c) set tariffs and charges for basic consumption affordable by the low
income groups; (d) set progressive tariffs to discourage water waste and to
provide cross subsidies to low income users; (e) establish sewerage tariffs as
a proportion of water usage;  (f) establish other fixed charges according to a
consistent policy of cost recovery (para. 4.06).

Future Finances of Beneficiary Cities
7.17      Financial projections have been prepared for each of the appraised
AWS companies for the period 1980-198./,  Basic assumptions for the financial
projections are presented in Annex 8. -   Given the poor accounting systems of
these entities (para. 7.03) projections shown are only indicative of expected
financial performance. During the construction period all AWS companies will
be able to cover at least operating expenses and in later years they will cover
debt service and will be able to make contribution to investments. The finan-
cial position of the AWS companies as measured by the financial rate of return
on revalued fixed assets will be satisfactory. The rates of return, after the
construction period, range between 2-8% (Annex 9).
Reporting Requirements
7.18      BANOBRAS will send to the Bank semi-annual consolidated reports on
project execution and costs and information on the performance of the AWS
companies based on audited reports (para. 4.05) and measured by the monitoring
indicators (para. 7.11 (i) and Annex 11) and their compliance with subloan
covenants.   Financial projections will be updated annually and will include
revision of tariffs and other changes if necessary to meet the objectives of
the financial covenant. BANOBRAS/SAHOP will take prompt remedial actions as
the Bank may request from the review of these reports.   This requirement is
also included in Loan 1186-ME and compliance has been satisfactory.
7.19      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from BANOBRAS that not
later than twelve months after the closing date they would prepare a completion
report, satisfactory to the Bank, describing project execution and its finan-
cial and physical achievements and benefits.
VIII. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
8.01      The proposed project will meet the needs for water supply and sewer-
age services in selected medium-size cities, thereby enhancing the living and
health conditions of their inhabitants.   At the same time, the project, by
providing these services, supports the Government's efforts to achieve a more
balanced urban development.  The proposed project will also help improve the
management and technical operations of the newly created water companies in the
selected cities in order to permit more accelerated sector development.
8.02      The project, while raising the living standards of the low-income
population, puts special emphasis on the application of sound financial poli-
cies as a means to increase efficiency in the allocation of water resources and
alleviate the burden on Government finances.
1/ Projections made by SAHOP available in Project Files.

Incremental Rates of Return and Marginal Costs
8.03      Incremental rates of return (IRR) were estimated by city fcr project
investments and complementary works in water supply and water supply and sewer-
age comb_.ed.   These IRR calculations are shown in Annex 13.  No return was
estimated for sewerage alone since sewerage tariffs are charged as a percentage
of the water charge and do not reflect benefits that the users assign to the
sewerage service separately.
8.04      The estimated aggregate IRR for the four appraised subprojects and
three additional subprojects submitted by SAHOP (Queretaro, Cd.  Juarez and
Matamoros - para.  1.02) is 13%.  The combined cost of these subprojects is
US$173.0 million (at June 1980 prices) or 71% of the total project cost. All
costs are exclusive of taxes or price escalation. This IRR compares favorably
with the estimated shadow discount rate for the country (11%). Benefits were
estimated according to the tariff to be charged for the services, and as such,
they do not reflect economic and social benefits in full.   Benefits such as
improvements in public health, increases in labor productivity, and environ-
mental improvements are either not reflected or only partially reflected in the
tariff paid for these services.  The use of revenues as a proxy for benefits
under a progressive tariff structure also understates the benefits of supply-
ing water to the low income population where the initial volume of low-price
water ensures most of the health benefits of providing safe water.
8.05      The IRR calculations do not include the consumers' surplus because
the absence of reliable historical data on quantities demanded and of volumet-
ric tariffs and restrictions on supply preclude to estimate the demand func-
tion. Evidence indicates, however, that users assign a value to the initial
volumes consumed much higher than the value of water tariffs.
8.06      Information gathered in the cities of Cd. Juarez, Tepic and Nogales
indicates that people lacking access to public supplies obtain their water
mostly from priNate vendors in recepta5les of 200 lts. at a price varying from
Mex$6 (Mex$30/m ) to Mex$2g (Mex$100/m ). These prices are more than 10 times
the estimated tariff per m in the project cities. Moreover, families earning
less than one monthly minimum salary (about Mex$3,600 presumably below the
critical consumption level), whp are presently paying from Mex$120 to Mex$400
for a monthly consumption of 4m of unsafe water, will now hive access to safe
water, paying about Mex$30 for a monthly consumption of lom .
8.07      The former considerations indicate that the project's economic and
social rates of return, if quantifiable, would be significantly higher than the
estimated IRR.  As an illustration of this, the consumer surplus was roughly
estimated for the subproject in the city of Tepic resulting in an increase in
the respective IRR from 12% to 34%. Results of similar magnitude are likely
for all subprojects. Details of the estimate are available in project files.
8.08      Table 8.1 presents IRRs for the individual appraised subprojects.
These rates indicate that water and sewerage tariffs on average will be close
to long-run average incremental costs estimated on the basis of the same
investment programs (discounted at 11%). Higher tariffs per unit volume for
water consumption in excess of minimum consumption will be set to reflect the
policies of cross-subsidization to low income consumers and of avoiding waste
in the use of water resources.   Tariff studies for each city will include



- 40 -
detailed calculations for long-run average incremental costs and a comparison
with tariff levels and structures (paras. 4.06, 7.16 and Annex 12). In order
to improve resource allocation, tariffs on excess consumption will be set as
closely as possible to long-run average incremental costs, within the con-
straints of the need for financial feasibility and the low-income population's
ability to pay.

Water Supply
and Sewerage    12%         9%           NA        13%
NA: Not applicable.
Project Sensitivity
8.09       Sensitivity of the IRRs to changes in investment costs and benefits
was estimated by city (available in project files). If investment costs were
20% higher than projected, the aggregate return would decrease to 10%. If this
were the case, tariffs would have to be increased to meet the associated higher
financial requirements.
8.10      The estimated IRRs are highly sensitive to changes in revenues since
they were used as the only measure of benefits. Demands have been estimated on
the basis of past evidence and present patterns shown in similar cities in the
country (para. 5.14). Actual demands are not expected to deviate significantly
from those projected. Projected tariff levels are considered achievable since
they will not represent an excessive burden on family expenditures; in those
cases where substantial increases are deemed necessary, a gradual path has been
established.   Revenues from "cuotas de cooperacion" (para.  7.15) are con-
sidered the least certain revenues. However, they have been kept as a moderate
percentage of total revenues, up to 30%, and failure to collect them in a
timely manner would cause the water companies to resort to additional tariff
revenues.
Least-Cost Solution
8.11      The  appraised  subprojects  are  the  least-cost  alternatives  for
meeting water and sewerage demand for the selected cities (paras. 5.10 and 6.04
(a)). Where more than one alternative was found technically satisfactory, the
present value of costs was compared at a discount rate of 11%.
8.12      For subprojects not yet identified,  the selection of least-cost
alternatives constitutes a condition for a subproject to receive FIFAPA finan-
cing (para. 6.04 (a)).

Population Benefitted and Urban Poverty Impact
8.13      The project would provide water supply through house connections to
about 1.2 million additional inhabitants by 1984 and sewerage to about 1.3
million additional inhabitants by 1984. About 36% of the additional population
to be served with water supply and 34% of the additional population to be
served with sewerage are estimated to belong to the urban poverty target group,
defined as people earning less than one-third of the annual national per capita
income (estimated at Mex$9,420 or US$413 in 1979). Table 8.2 shows the incre-
mental population served and the percentage of urban poor for the appraised
subprojects by city.  Maps showing their locations are available in project
files.
8.14      Water supply coverage for the urban poor will increase from 58% in
1979 to 81% in 1984, while the sewerage coverage will increase from 35% to 63%
during the same period.   Coverages will continue to increase in subsequent
years. For this purpose, water intake works, major networks and sewage collec-
tors have been designed for a period ranging from 10 to 15 years.
8.15      Expansion of water production and main distribution facilities and
provision of sewage collectors and interceptors will permit a coverage of 90%
of the 1990 population for water supply and 80% for sewerage through the
expansion of secondary networks. On the basis of the appraised cities and the
additional feasibility studies prepared by SAHOP, it is estimated that as a
result of the project about 2.4 million and 2.5 million additional inhabitants
will be connected to the water supply and sewerage systems respectively by
1990.
Affordability of Project Services by the Urban Poor
8.16      Present water and sewerage charges for minimum consumption (10-20
m3/month) do not constitute an excessive burden on the low-income population.
Tariff studies in every city will ensure that increases in tariffs to meet
financial requirements will be structured so as not to significantly affect
minimum charges.   Table 8.3 shows the percentages of one monthly minimum
salary that a family would pay for water supply and sewerage when consuming
up to 10-20 m3 of water per month. These charges are expressed in 1979 prices.
Tariff increases for minimum consumption from 1979 to 1984 are assumed pro-
portional to increases in the projected average tariff levels.
8.17      It is estimated that by 1984, families will have to spend from 1% to
3% of one monthly minimum salary for minimum consumption. These charges are
considered to be well within the reach of even the poorest families, since
studies on distribution of expenditure in Latin America show that poor families
spend up to 5% to 7% of their monthly income (about one minimum salary per
month) on these services. New consumers connected to the water and sewerage
systems would also have to pay connection fees and other fixed charges.  The
tariff studies to be undertaken in every city (para. 4.06) will devise a system
of monthly payments or fee reductions for the low-income population to facil-
itate the connection of the whole population to the system.

Project Risks
8.18      Given SAHOP's  implementation capability,  the availability of ex-
perienced local construction firms and the advanced stage of project design, no
major problems are envisaged in the construction of the relatively simple
works.
8.19      There is a moderate risk on the timely execution of subprojects
because of lengthy approval processes for subloan agreements at the state and
municipal levels.   Since the water sector is used to receiving most federal
funds as grants, there has been an initial reluctance to accept the terms of
FIFAPA loans.  This risk has been minimized by the Government's decision to
gradually reduce sector grant financing and by FIFAPA/SAHOP continuous promo-
tion efforts from a very early stage of project preparation.
8.20      Most of the AWS companies still lack experience but SAHOP is taking
the necessary steps to improve management efficiency thus reducing the risks of
inefficiencies in the operation of the systems. Required tariff increases have
been staged during the construction period so as to avoid sharp increases
within a short time span. The risk of noncompliance with revenue requirements
is thus considered moderate.
8.21      Overall, the project presents a moderate risk of not achieving its
objectives; the risk is more than compensated for by the benefits accruing to
the beneficiaries and the expected sectoral improvements.
IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During loan negotiations assurances were obtained as follows:
1.   From the Federal Government that it will:
(a)   provide the funds required to carry out the project (para.
6.12);
(b)   cause SAHOP to:
(i) prepare not later than June 30, 1981 a framework tariff
study, which will provide the basis for individual tariff
studies to be undertaken by each AWS company in accordance
with the provisions of the subsidiary loan agreements
(para. 4.06);
(ii) maintain its financial Coordinating Unit in charge of
project preparation and implementation and that it will
adequate its staff to the increasing responsibilities with
qualified professionals in sufficient number at all times
(para. 3.14);
(iii) continue carrying out its national training program,
paying due attention to the needs of the AWS companies
(paras. 2.23 and 4.03);



- 45 -
(iv) provide  technical  assistance   through  its  Financial
Coordinating Unit as required by the AWS companies (paras.
4.03 and 6.15); and
(v) carry out all procurement in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines and under the conditions set forth (Daras. 6.16
and 6.17).
2.   From BANOBRAS:
(a)   subprojects which would be incorporated in the project after
loan negotiations or which would replace other previously se-
lected subprojects will be selected according to the priority
criteria agreed upon with the Bank (paras. 6.04 and 6.05);
(b)   feasibility studies for subprojects to be financed under the
proposed loan will be prepared following SAHOP guidelines and
in a manner satisfactory to the Bank and appropriate insti-
tutional and financial arrangements will be made (para. 6.04);
(c)   FIFAPA's financial  statements will be audited by competent
independent auditors and copies of such reports submitted to
the Bank (para. 3.10);
(d)   it will cause the AWS companies to produce semi-annual reports
to monitor their operations and finances (para. 7.11 (i));
(e)   it will furnish to the Bank semi-annual consolidated reports
on project execution and costs and information on the perform-
ance of the AWS companies as measured by the agreed upon moni-
toring indicators, and on their compliance with subloan cove-
nants (para. 7.18);
(f)   it will prepare a completion report, satisfactory to the Bank,
not later than one year after the closing date (para. 7.19).
9.02      The following conditions of disbursement will be included for each
subproject:
(a)   FIFAPA should enter into subsidiary loan agreements,  under
terms and conditions specified in paras 7.09 and 7.11 and to be
signed before June 30, 1982 (para. 7.09).
(b)   Each subsidiary loan agreement should be secured by the State
Government (para. 7.10), include the conditions listed in para
7.11 and should have been approved by the Bank before dis-
bursements are made on account of such subproject (para. 6.13)
and;
(c)   A list of all major contracts intended to be awarded should
have been approved by the Bank (para. 6.16).
9.03      Retroactive financing from April 1, 1980 for up to US$ 5 million is
recommended (para. 6.19).
9.04      Provided the foregoing conditions are met, the proposed project will
be suitable for a Bank loan of US$125 million.   The loan would be repayable
over 15 years, including three years grace.

MEXICO
SECOND MEDIUM SIZE CITIES WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Description of Existing Facilities
This annex briefly describes the existing water and sewerage faci-
lities in each one of the appraised cities.
1.        TOLUCA
Toluca, capital of the State of Mexico, has a population of 240,000
(1979) inhabitants, growing at a rate of 5.5% p.a., of which 78% are served
with water (house connection) and 73% have access to the sewerage system.
Toluca's main water supply sources are some 24 deep we6ls 3located
within the city, with a production capacity of 850 1/sec (26.8 x 10 m /year);
only about 60% of the water delivered is chlorinated. The disiribution network
includes five storage tanks with combined capacity of 7,820 m , 280 km of pipes
and 26,600 house connections of which 45% are metered. Quality of service is
deficient in many areas of the city due to extreme pressure variations for lack
of adequate pressure zones in the distribution system. Unaccounted-for water
averages 36% of production.
The sewerage system is combined (storm and sanitary) and comprises
238 km of pipes and 25,600 house discharges. During the rainy season, sewage
overflows into the streets. Sewage is discharged into open courses within city
limits and receives no treatment when it is finally discharged into the
Verdiguel River.
Water and sewerage services were operated by the municipality until
March 1980 when a new autonomous state company was created to be in charge of
these services. The number of staff is 170 persons (ratio of 6.4 persons per
thousand connections) which is considered acceptable.
2.        TEPIC
Tepic, capital of the State of Nayarit, has a population of 121,400
(1979) inhabitants, (growing at a rate of 4.2% p.a.), of which 73% are served
with water (house connections) and 61% have access to the sewerage system.
3        Eight deep wells with a combined capacity of 570 lps (18.0 x 106
m /year) provide water to the city and about 64% of the water delivered is
chlorinated.   The distribution network includes three storage tanks with a
combined capacity of 2,700 m , 181 km of pipes and 14,800 house connections of
which 89% are metered.



- 47 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 4
The sewerage system comprises 132 km of pipes and 12,400 house dis-
charges. Sewage is discharged without treatment into the Mololoa River.
Water services are operated by a Federal Commission (Junta Federal
de Agua-Tepic), and sewerage services by the municipality.   Steps are being
taken to create an automonous municipal company in charge of water and sewerage
services. This new company would be operating by end of 1980 (para. 6.04).
3.        MONCLOVA-FRONTERA
These two cities have a population of 254,100 (1979) inhabitants
growing at a rate of 6.0% p.a.   Service levels are 77% for water  (house
connections) and 26% for sewerage.
Water supply comes from groundwater sources6 located some 18 km fron
the city.  Production capacity is 644 lps (20.3 x 10  m /year) and all water
delivered is chlorinated. The distribution network includes six storage tanks
with a combined capacity of 10,250 m , 377 km of pipes and 27,900 house
connections of which 90% are metered.
The sewerage system comprises 178 km of pipes and 9,500 house dis-
charges. Sewage is treated in an activated sewage plant and reused for indus-
trial application by a large steel mill (Altos Hornos de Mexico) located within
city limits.
Water and sewerage services are operated by an autonomous municipal
company (Junta Administradora de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado de Monclova-
Frontera).   The number of staff is 142 persons  (ratio of 5.1 persons per
thousand connections) which is considered acceptable.
4.         NOGALES
It has a population of 115,100 (1979) inhabitants growing at a rate
of 3.5% p.a. of which 40% have water (house connections) and 23% sewerage
services.   Nogales' water is supplied from groundwater sources (infiltration
galleries and A-ep3wells) some 30 km from the city. Production capacity is 250
lps (7.9 x 10  m /year) and all waters are chlorinated.   The distribution
network includes seven storage tanks with a combined capacity of 7,800 m , five
booster pump stations, 115 km of pipes and 7,600 house connections of which 16%
are metered.
The sewerage system, under construction with Federal and State
funds, provides service through 4,400 house discharges.  Under international
agreement between Mexico and the United States, the sewerage effluent is
treated at Nogales-Aurora's sewerage treatment plant (oxidation lagoons -
para. 5.09)
Water and sewage services are operated by a Federal Commission
(Junta Federal de Mejoras Materiales de Nogales).   This commission is being
transformed into an autonomous state company which is expected to be opera-
tional by end of 1980 (para. 6.04).

SECOND MEDIUM SIZE CITIES WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Summary of Assumptions used in Financial Projections
l.        Financial projections prepared by SAHOP showing production, demand,
financial data, and cost data are available in the project files for the four
cities appraised.   These projections were the base used to arrive to the
financial information prepared by the mission. A summary of the main assump-
tions used in the financial projections are described below.
Revenues
2.        Water sales are based on projections for production, consumption per
con/month, and reduction of unaccounted-for water as shown in Annex 9. Oper-
ating revenues are from billings which include charges for water consumption,
sewerage services, connection rights for both services.  Required tariffs for
water and sewerage revenue assumptions and rate increases are shown in Annex
13.
3.        Average tariffs are assumed to be sufficient to allow the AWS com-
panies to comply with the financial covenants and to at least maintain tariffs
in real terms after the construction period. Required rate increases are showi
in Annex 10 and expected combined (water plus sewerage) average tariffs per m
sold are given in Annex 9.   Nonoperating revenues are made up of costs on
materials and labor, which are paid by the user when a water or sewerage
connection is made.   This category also includes the Cuota de Cooperacion
(para. 7.15).
4.        Annual inflation was assumed to be 15% in 1981, 13% in 1982 and 10%
in 1983 and 1984.   Wages are based on present payroll and assumed to grow
parallel to inflation plus an average of 2% per year in real terms to account
for promotions, increases in personnel, bonuses and special subsidies.   The
cost of energy was calculated taking into account the water production and
adjusted on the basis of projected electricity tariffs provided by the
"Comision Federal de Electricidad". Use of chemicals are assumed to increase
in proportion to water production, except when special increases were made to
compensate for historical unrrealistically low consumption. Cost of materials
and other expenses are assumed to increase in proportion to the number of
connections. Experience in the previous project (1186-ME) has shown that the
indirect foreign component varies according to domestic rather than intern-
ational inflation. This assumption has been made to calculate total project
costs for financial purposes.

Depreciation
5.        A straight-line amortization method is used, and an annual average
rate of 3% was estimated on the basis of the average useful life of fixed
assets.
Balance Sheets Accounts
6.        Fixed assets-/ and accumulated depreciation are revalued accordirig
to the Mexican Construction Price Index which is approximately 85% of the
Consumer Price Index.  Accounts receivable are based on uncollected billing
and are assumed to be reduced from present levels to a maximum of three month
of billing by 1981 and thereafter.   Inventories are estimated at a level
sufficient to cover an average of three months of material and chemicals
required for operations. Accounts payable are assumed to reflect unpaid bills
for operating costs (material and services) from two to three months. Other
assets and liabilities, when historical records show no significant amounts,
are reduced to zero and when amounts are large these are kept constant or
reduced slowly to avoid sharp increases or decreases in the flow of funds.
1/  Initial balance   (1979) represents the best information obtained by
SAHOP or the best estimate made by the appraisal mission.

MEXICO
SECOND MEDIUM-SIZE CITIES WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Outline Terms of Reference For Tariff Study
Introduction
1.        The Mexican authorities and SAHOP agreed on the need to undertake a
water supply and sewerage tariff study which will serve as a framework to
design and implement individual tariff structures and levels in medium size
cities. This study will provide specific policies and objectives to achieve a
sound financial basis for the continuous expansion of the services, efficient
resource allocation, and affordable services to the low-income population.
For this purpose, SAHOP will undertake a framework tariff study in accordance
with the outline set out below.
Objective
2.        The purpose of the study is to devise a set of objectives and cri-
teria which complies with financial requirements comprising self sufficiency
and contribution to investments; reflects as closely as possible the costs to
the economy of meeting increasing demands for water and sewerage services; and
ensures that services will be affordable to the whole population (i.e. cross-
subsidizing minimal needs for poorer users).
General Guidelines
3.        The framework study will define the basic parameters to be applied in
the determination of specific tariff structures and levels by the local autho-
rities.  These parameters should include among others, a definition of:
(a)   financial requirements to meet preestablished targets such as:
a viably cash position, contribution to investments, and terms
and conditions of debt service coverage;
(b)   which costs are to be recuperated through tariffs on water
consumption and sewage collection, and which through other
charges, such as betterment levies, connection fees and other
fixed charges;
(c)   resource allocation objectives,  through the application of
tariffs for excess consumption (over the basic consumption)
that reflect as closely as possible long-run average incre-
mental costs of each service separately (excluding costs to be
recuperated through fixed charges);

ANNEX 12

(d)   different tariff levels for different users (industrial, com-
mercial, public and domestic), reflecting different costs of
the services and different ability to pay;
(e)   metering policies for different users; and
(f)   social  objectives  through  the  application  of  affordable
tariffs and charges for minimum consumption which allow low-
income population to be connected and served.
4.        SAHOP will take fully into consideration the following deficiencies
of present tariff structures so that they will be eliminated in the revised
tariff structures.   These deficiencies have been preliminarily identified;
they are not present in the tariff structure of every city nor are they
comprehensive (para. 7.13-7.16).
(a)   no significant progressivity in tariff in relation to con-
sumption;
(b)   no differentiation between type of users (industrial,  com-
mercial, public, and domestic);
(c)   sewerage charges unrelated to volumes discharged;

SECOND MEDIUM SIZE CITIES WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Incremental Rate of Return (IRR) and Long Run
Average Incremental Cost (AIC) Calculations
Basis for Calculations
1.        Individual Incremental Rates of Return have been calculated for sub-
projects comprising 27% of total project costs. These rates have been calcu-
lated for the water supply and the water supply and sewerage components and
complementary works. All investments have been stated in June 1980 prices and
include physical contingencies and engineering, but exclude taxes and price
contingencies. Since about 50% of water and sewerage secondary networks and
connections are built by private urban developers and handled to the AWS
companies, these would have to finance only part of the required networks
beyond the project's construction period. A cost of Mex$2,500/connection has
been assumed for each incremental water and sewerage connection.
2.        Revenues generated by the project services have been used as a proxy
for economic benefits. Revenues have been based on per capita consumption and
tariffs which are forecasted to prevail in each year if each MWS Company
complies with the revenue requirements for the period 1980-1984 which will be
part of each subsidiary loan agreement. Tariffs for the year 1985 and there-
after were assumed to remain at the 1984 levels in real terms.
3.        Operating costs have been based on estimated per m  (m  equivalent
for sewerage) costs.  It was assumed that 70% and 30% of administrative and
operating costs were attributable to water supply and sewerage respectively.
It was also assumed that 20% of these costs were unrelated to levels of
production and as such were not considered as part of incremental costs.
4.         In cases where new investments were required within the project
design period, these have been estimated and included in the calculations.
5.        In the case of Toluca, water supply, investments for rehabilitation
of the present system were excluded from the calculations because of the
impossibility of a quantifying benefit in a meaningfully manner.  The under-
lying assumption in this case was that the net present value of benefits of
rehabilitation works would at least equal their costs.

(d)   different tariff levels for different users (industrial, com-
mercial, public and domestic), reflecting different costs of
the services and different ability to pay;
(e)   metering policies for different users; and
(f)   social  objectives  through  the  application  of  affordable
tariffs and charges for minimum consumption which allow low-
income population to be connected and served.
4.        SAHOP will take fully into consideration the following deficiencies
of present tariff structures so that they will be eliminated in the revised
tariff structures.   These deficiencies have been preliminarily identified;
they are not present in the tariff structure of every city nor are they
comprehensive (para. 7.13-7.16):
(a)   no significant progressiveness in tariff in relation to con-
sumption;
(b)   no differentiation between type of users (industrial,  com-
mercial, public, and domestic);
(c)   sewerage charges unrelated to volumes discharged;
(d)   loosely defined "cuotas de cooperacion" charges; and
(e)   tariffs and charges do not fully reflect the cost of providing
services.
