1. 1        Context at Appraisal

1.1.1       Sector Background1

At the tim e of project design, the Govern ment of Ghana (GOG) was moving towards
more liberal economic policies. The ec onomic performance between 1992 and 2000 was
an issue as its fiscal and monetary policy performance was mixed. Tax revenue collection
had im proved and public investm ent expend itures were rationalized but inflation and
interest rates continued to rem ain at un acceptably high levels. Satisfactory growth was
recorded in aggregate out put, mining and services, bu         t not in agricu lture and
manufacturing. At the sam e ti me, savings and private investm ent2 had remained low. A
major shortcom ing of the Ghana refor m progr am was the s low pace in elim inating the
government m onopoly in cocoa marketing . However, in 1994, elev en years after the
initiation of structural adjustm ent progr ams, Ghana finally opened dom estic cocoa
marketing to private operators and producers be gan to receive up to 50 percent of the fob
price of cocoa.

The liberalization of cocoa m arketing m eant that there was a huge attitudinal change
towards the private sector. The link s between private investment, accelerated growth and
poverty reduction was adequately recognized. As a result, th e policy environment for the
private sector started to im prove and the publ ic-private sector dial ogue initiated in 1991
was broadened and strengthened through the P rivate Sector Roundtable and the P rivate
Enterprise F oundation (PEF). Changes in poli cies included the S tatutory Corporations
Act, under which public corporations were converted into companies with saleable shares.
Ghana's privatization effort, after m any year s of unsatisfactory perform ance started to
pick-up 3 . To achieve accelerated growth, the Gove rnment r eaffirmed its intentions to
make the pr ivate sector the engine of ec onomic growth. It was also acknowledged that
the ability of the private sector to become this engine depended on how rapidly m edium-
term m acro-stability was to be achieved and the m easures taken towards addressing its
other key constraints.

1.1.2       Government's Development Strategy

Ghana's business environment in 1999 was termed as one of the best in A frica for private
sector development due to its political stability. The enactm ent of the Ghana Investm ent
Promotion Center Act of 1994 and the Free        Zone Act of 1995 were the first crucial
actions taken under the strategy. The Acts constituted an ad equate framework, providing
favorable investm ent and export incentives         to enterprises, especially free zone

companies, while setting out the rules an       d regulations governing private sector
participation in the d evelopment of f ree zo nes. The in centives includ ed extens ive tax
holidays, accelerated depreciation, and sales of up to 30 percent of th e value of free zone
products in the dom estic market. The Government acquired sites in Tema, Takoradi, and
Kumasi which have been reserved for private development as free zones.

To further assess the v iability of the Free Z one (FZ) concept, the Governm ent of Ghana
(GOG) co mmissioned a survey of foreign in vestors to compare Ghana's investm ent
climate to those of Mauritius and Du bai (considered best practices) and Togo and Kenya
(potential com petitors). Ghana was shown to have the required env          ironment which,
combined with an E xport Processing Zone (EPZ) to address the infrastructure
shortcomings, can enab le it to attract a critical m ass of exporte rs an d accelerate the
growth of exports. In the final analysis, it was the quality of infrastructure and business
services which would attract investors and not the incentive code and thus great attention
was given in assessing needed upgrades to the infrastructure including the utilities.

1.1.3      Project fits into Bank and Government's strategy

The Gateway Project was fully aligned with IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of
1995/7, which defined poverty reduction as its central goal. The CAS recognized that one
of the key requirem ents for sustainable pove rty reduction w as higher rates of econom ic
growth by restoring sustainabl e fiscal balance and prom oting private investm ent for
exports. A population growth ra te of 3 percent per annu m, an average annual GDP
growth rate of less than 5 percent duri       ng the last decade, proved insufficient to
significantly reduce poverty levels. It was estimated that an annual GDP growth rate of 8-
10 percent would be required for significant poverty reduction and in order to achieve
such levels of investments required to obtain the targeted growth rate, Ghana was obliged
to consciously develop and consolidate its "competitive advantages" and cater to export
markets. Thus, the Gateway Project was designed to help remove identified constraints to
bring about developm ent of trade and export s, and to attract di rect investm ents for
industrial and infrastructure developm ent. The Project was an integral part of the G hana
Gateway Program, designed to make Ghana a middle-income country by year 2020 under
Ghana's Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS).

1.1.4      Sector Issues to be addressed by the Project

The Project was designe d to address two critic al constraints to the incr eased inflows of
foreign direct investment for the acceleration of exports:

            the provision of limited off-site infrastructure around the Tema EPZ, to attract
            a private developer who would provide poten tial investors with required on-site
            infrastructure in the Tema EPZ; and

            the removal of important, but narrow, institutional capacity constraints to
            increase foreign investment in the country.

1.2   Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The Project' s developm ent objective was to attract a critical m ass of export-oriented
investors to Ghana to accelerate export-led growth as well as facilitate trade.

The Key Perform ance Indicators (K PIs) relati ng to the project developm ent objective s
are as follows:
     10 firm s have been established and ar        e operating in the second year after
        completion of civil works; 20 fir ms by end-third year and 30 fir ms by e nd fourth
        year.
     Net export revenues are increa sed by 25 percent in second year; by 30 percent in
        third year; and by 40 percent in fourth year after completion of the civil works.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification

The objectives of the Project are (a) the de velopment of a multi- purpose industrial park;
and (b) th e improvement of the quality and stan dards of ser vices de livered to inv estors
and to exporters by the Borrower' s institutio ns and agencies responsible for trade and
investment aiming to attract a critical mass of export-oriented firms and facilitate trade in
the territory of the Borrower for accelerated growth.

The Performance Indicators relating to the revised project development objective were:
    Off site and on-site infrastructure is completed and MPIP is fully functional in the
       intervention area by the Closing Date of the Project.
    Percentage of prospective Multipurpose I ndustrial Park (MPIP) settlers that are

1.4      Main Beneficiaries

According to the Project Appraisal Docum ent (PAD) and in keeping with Ghana'              s
objective of sustainable poverty reduction thro ugh job creation and increased levels of
economic growth, the Gateway Pr oject was designed to facil itate the higher levels of
private foreign and domestic investm ent nece ssary to achie ve this gro wth. The Project
identified benefits for three broad target groups: (a) the local population; (b) private
investors; and (c) the GOG. For the local population, the Project was expected to lead to a
reduction in unem ployment through the creati on of m ore job opportu nities and through
improvements in the skills and mobility within the labor fo rce. For the GOG, the Project
was expected to attract a flow of foreign direct investm ent that would have a positive
effect on the balance of payments. It would also help increase the capacity of government
agencies dealing with the priv ate sector. In addition, the fisc al impact was estim ated at
US$75 m illion for the 15-year p eriod, m ostly from personal in come taxes of new
employees and service businesses operating around the EPZ and estim ated leasing fees
from the developer of the EPZ. For private        foreign and dom estic investors, benefits
would come from reduced uncertainties and transaction costs associated with d oing
business in Ghana, as well as the availabi      lity of ready sites for export processing
industries and the simplification of trade procedures.

         International Airport (KIA).

      D. Ghana Immigration Services (GIS): The Project would finance (i) assistance in
         preparing operating procedures, benchm arking GIS processing of i mmigration
         functions as they relate to trade facilitation; (ii) technology infrastructure and; (iii)
         retraining of staff in trade facilitation.

      E. Ghana Investment Promotion Center (GIPC). Country and Investment
         Promotion: Preparation and im plementation of well tar geted inve stment and
         country promotion activities; staff training and private se ctor surveys; preparation
         and involvem ent i mplementation of a st rategy to develop backward linkages
         between foreign investors and local supp liers; and support for a program to build
         consensus amongst domestic stakeholders in favor of reforms.

      F. Ghana Free Zone Board (GFZB): The Projec t will f inance im plementation of
         the Developer & Tenants m arketing plans, improvem ent of building service
         delivery of staff in prom otion and f acilitation, developm ent of oversight
         capabilities.

      G. Gateway Project Coordination and Project Management: The Project would
         help finance recurrent expenditures and develops the institutiona l capa city to
         manage and coordinate the Gateway Project and infrastructure unit.

      H. Setting the Stage for Gateway II The Project would support work aim ed at
         developing further policies, instrum ents building and implem entation strategies
         for exam ple in pro ject f inance; vocation sk ills deve lopment, and tourism
         development.

1.6      Revised Components

The original structure of the project was      maintained with two components, but the
activities w ere s lightly reorg anized. Som e activities we re cance lled; where else som e
were added or expanded. For example:




                                                13
       a) The scope under component 1 was increased to include (i) "on-site "infrastructure
          for the Tem a EPZ; (ii) Provision of     technical advisory serv ices for th e
          construction of container devann ing area o utside the Port of      Tem a; (iii)
          Reconstruction of a bridge and around 4 km of arterial roads outside the inner
          security perim eter of t he port of Tem a providing access to the contain      er
          devanning area and other cargo m arshalling facilities; and (iv) can cellation of
          improvement of airport facilities.

       b) The scope under com ponent 2 was reduced by cancellation of subcom ponent 2.8
          Preparation of Gateway II.

Reason for revising the component and changing some of the subcomponents was greatly
to address the non perform ance of the intern ational private developer for the Tem a EPZ
towards provision of "on-site" infrastructure and ease the congestion at the Tema Port.

1.7    Other significant changes

Extension of Project Closing Date: The Project closing date was extended three tim es.
The first extension was from December 31, 2005 to June 30, 2007 which was necessary
due to the restructuring and retrofitting exercise which to ok longer to com plete. The
second extension was from June 30, 2007 to June 30, 2008 to enab le all the project
activities to be implemented and completed on time to consolidate project's achievements.
The Third extension was from June 30, 2008 to December 31, 2009 to allo            w for
completion of the remaining few project activities.

Shift in Project approach: The Gateway Project supported th e GOG to es tablish its first
EPZ/MPIP and at the sam e tim e provide su pport to the overall Free Zones progra m
through GF ZB. Therefore, there were two aspe cts of the F Z program (i) single factory
free zones and (ii) free zone enclave. Th     e FZ program had focused on sectors i.e.
agribusiness/agro-processing and light m anufacturing. The conclusion drawn from the
ICR assess ment was t hat the FZ program succeeded in attracting more single FZ
enterprises than FZ enclave enterprises and it also succeeded to attract more agribu siness
sector firms, in particular cocoa, while that of light m anufacturing e.g. textiles was poor.
The FZ program has attracted over 260 fir ms of which 24 are located in the Tema
EPZ/MPIP over a period of 14 years.

The developm ent of the Tem a EPZ did not ta ke off as expected b ecause the p rivate
developer did not deliver requir ed infrastructure a nd services in the enclave. The second
developer was slow in providing the necessary on-site infrastructure in its leased land. As
a result firms who were interested to invest in Tema EPZ faced the pr ospect of having to
undertake their own investments. In addition, ECOWAS issued a formal interpretation on
rules of origin relating to Special E conomic Zones including EPZ in the W est Afri can
region which essentially treated products as imports from outside the trade bloc. This
meant that goods from Ghana EPZ would attract a higher duty than non Ghana EPZ
goods and thus becom ing e competitive in serving the regional market from Ghana EPZ.
Therefore, in order to get m ore operators in the Te ma EPZ, the concept of Multipurpose
Industrial Park (MPIP ) was added to that of an EPZ to enrich the Free Zone Program of
Ghana by introducing more flexibility on the part of the investors. With an MPIP in place,
both the G overnment and the private deve         lopers were qualified to develop the
EPZ/industrial Park. Therefore, by GOG beari ng the cost of "on-site" infrastructure
development through the project and by developing Common Se rvice Centers (CSCs) in
the MPIP, the Government would create the conditions for making the Tema EPZ/MPIP
more attractive to non EPZ private enterprises.

The Results Framework was revised to reflect the changes in the PD O and additional
activities. The revised PDO indicators as shown in section 1.3 were m ore descriptive and
so was the result framework.

Re-allocation of Funds: Funds were reallocated between components and categories to
support the agreed changes. Th e Project benefited from the exchange rate between SDR
and USD which made more funds available for Project's use.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Factors that positively affected quality at entry.

2.1.1   Lessons from previous operations

Key lesson incorporated in the de sign of the Gateway Project was         lack of adequate
institutional capacity to im plement Bank operations. Ban k was comm itted to develo p
local capacities to enable im provements in the country portfolio which was then (1998)
recorded as unsatisfactory. In this regard, a more participatory approach was adopted in
the preparation of the Gateway Project to ensure greater commit ment and ownership by
GOG. E fforts were m ade to include all identi fied stakeholders on Project discussions
which were held with potential investors an d private sector representatives. Concerns
raised by these groups were addr essed in the design of the Proj ect to ensure relevancy of
the Project. In addition certain issues were identified and earmarked for closer monitoring
and strengthening.

2.1.2 Adequacy of Participatory Approach

The Gateway Project was prepared in a satisfa ctory participatory m anner. Private sector
views were solicited; developm ent partners involved in PSD consulted and various
government institutions, directly and indirect ly involved in the Project participated in
different f orms. Line m inistries o f f rontline agencie s an d regulator y agencies were
continuously consulted throughout the design phas e to ensure effective internalization. In
addition, GOG had inc luded private sector repr esentation in the Board of Directors of
GFZB and GOC.

2.1.3   Soundness of analytical work

Gateway Project incorporated recommendations from Economic Sector Work (ESW), on
private sector developm ent (three FIAS reports, MIGA reports, USAID and CIDA
reports) and most importantly the work done by GIPC and GFZB. The GOG initiated a
self-need-assessment by all key agencies con tributing to the high cost of doing business
in Ghana which resulted into an action plan for each agen cy coordinated by the M inistry
of Finance and the Gateway Secretariat. Th ese actio n plan s includ ed easy to m onitor
performance indicators. Therefore, the Ga teway Project dedicated a whole com ponent
towards developm ent of GOG's project bene ficiary agencies im plementation capacity.
The Ghana Free Zones Act of 1995 had clea        rly recognized the im portance of most
lessons learned in FZ projects. It laid out  an attractive in centive pac kage for private
investors in the free zone. The proposed EP Z at Tem a was to b e en tirely p rivately-
financed, owned and managed, which would be one of the first in Africa. It was p art of
the overall Free Zone program of the count ry which was designed from the on-set to
include processing and services of all kind. The FZ program created a regim e for free
zone companies which could be established eith er within or as a single factory enterprise
called Ghana Free Zone Enterprises. In this regard, Te ma EPZ was a sm all part of the
                                            16
overall FZ program . GOG had planned to lease the land to private investors for a period
of 50 years including provision of off-site infrastructure servic es. In addition, GOG
provided funds under com ponent 2 of the Gateway Projec t to GFZB and GIPC for
continuous investment promotion and trade facilitation activities.

2.1.3 Strong Government Commitment

The high level of Government commitment was critical for a project such as the Gateway
Project which was a multi-m       inisterial, m ulti-sectoral p roject. It was im portant to
recognize at the preparation stage the com plexity and challenges that m ight e merge
during im plementation of proj ect com ponents which cut hori zontally across m ultiple,
government agencies and across the "exclusive territorial" domains of specific functional
agencies. In this regard, the Gateway Project had strong ownership and commitment from
top governm ent decision m akers which enab led the creation of Gateway Oversight
Committee (GOC) and i ncluded private sector representatives. GOC was chaired by the
Vice President and was able to continually monitor implementation performance and put
pressure for funda mental changes while reso lving inter-jurisdictional issues as they
emerged.4

2.1.6     Quality at Entry

The project's overall concept was appropria te and conform ed to the GPRS and the
Bank's CAS of 1995 and 1997. The project underwe nt Quality at Entry review and was
rated satisfactory. There was adequate level of anal     ytical work un dertaken an d th e
participatory process in design was intensiv e. T he project d esign took into account of
country's lim ited capacity and thus relied on international private sector responses to
make the EPZ operational. In this regard quality at entry is rated satisfactory.

Factors that negatively affected quality at entry.

2.1.4     Assessment of Risks and mitigation measures

The PAD rated the ov erall risk as moderate. One critic al risk was id entified but was
under rated. This was stated as "      Finding a developer; and on-site investments by
developers and off-site investment by GOG are completed". The Bank team had put a lot
of emphasis in having an international private developer for the on-site infrastructure and
management of the EPZ. The risk should have been rated "substantial" and more options
should have been explored in case the developer fails to perform. Since the risk was rated
moderate th e m itigation m easures applied wh ere insuf ficient to add ress the s ituation
when the international private developer faile d to perform . GOG continued to encounter
difficulties with the private dev eloper who retained more than 100 acres of un-developed

 During 2005/6 critical macroeconomic difficulties, the Chairperson of the Oversight Committee ordered directives to give The
Gateway Project priority in allocation of critical inputs to its civil works e.g. cement.



                                                               17
land at the Tema EPZ. In this rega rd, assessment of risk and mitigation measures is rated
moderately satisfactory.

2.1.5       Inadequate design of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

The selec ted indica tors for the rev ised re sult f ramework were de scriptive and lacked
quantitative targets and values. They did not allow proper monitoring of progress towards
PDO as they lacked baseline and target values.

2.2         Implementation

Factors that have positively contributed to project implementation.

2.2.1        Project Management Arrangement

The Ministry of Trade and Industry was th e m ain i mplementing agency, for which it
created a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) known as the Gateway Secr etariat and it had
fifteen5 staff m embers. The Gateway Secretar iat was well m anaged for a good part of
project's duration. The project     had seven beneficiary agen     cies critical for trade
facilitation and spanned the fields of i   nvestment prom otion, free zone m anagement,
customs, immigration, civil aviation, ports, e nvironment and the line m inistry. Activities
implemented by the sev en agencies were c oordinated by the Gateway Secretariat under
the supe rvision of the Gate way Oversigh t Co mmittee. Su ccessful perfor mance of the
project activities were uniformly characterized by relatively strong managerial leadership
and interest of the beneficiaries6.

2.2.2 Partnership between Government and private sector

GOG worked in partnership with the privat e sector during project im plementation. The
private sector was represented at the Project Oversight Committee. When it was clear that
the international private developer for the Tema EPZ was not perform ing; GOG awarded
part of the enclave to a national private developer who now have most of the 24 tenants.

2.2.3 Changes/Restructuring

The Gateway Project w as rest ructured in 2005 to m odify the DCA and am ended (i)
extension of project clo sing date b y 18 m onths to Decem ber 2007; (ii) reallocation of
credit proceeds; (iii) ap plication of the May 2004 Procurem ent and Consultan t Selection
Guidelines and increas e certain procurem ent thresholds, and (iv) revise the key
performance indicators.




5
    Of which 3 were consultants.

    In particular GIS, CEPS, EPA and GPHA.

                                              18
        The first key amendment of the D CA was on the PDO which was am ended to
        incorporate "on-site infrastructure" as an activity under component 1. GOG was
        also required to amend the EPZ Act to regulate the settlement of enterprises in the
        Tema zone and allow all categories of ente rprises to locate in the zone, including
        certified free zone companies and non exporters.
        The second major amendment to the DCA was related to the reconstruction of a
        bridge and approxim ately 4 km of acces s roads outsid e th e port of Tem a under
        Subcomponent B (1). It was proposed to increase the allo cation for civil works
        under Subcomponent B (1) to US$ 6.0 million for this additional activity.
        The third major amendment was to regularize funding of the Ghana Investment
        Advisory Council (GIAC) under a new Subcomponent A (6). The activities of the
        GIAC were core private sector development and investment climate/trade reforms.
        The fourth major amendment was related to the proposed transition to the new
        World Bank Procurem ent and Consultant Guidelines adopted in May 2004. The
        revised Guidelines aimed at streamlining the procurement function.
        The fifth major amendment was related to the revision of the key perf ormance
        indicators for the restructured Project and specified in a new Schedule of the DCA.
        Success of such a project, dealing with in stitutional and struc tural r eforms, is
        expected to become visible in the medium-long term.

Meanwhile the activities under Component 2: Trade Facilitation Capacity of Front
Line Institutions were largely left as is with th e exception of: (i) inc lusion of activities
of The Ghana Investm ent Advisor y Council ( GIAC) which was a consultative group
composed of private sector CEOs that act as a watch dog "custodians" and providers of
feedback on im plementation of governm ent trade facilitation and inv estment clim ate
reforms, as well as b     est pra ctices in in stitutional ref orms f rom a private se ctor
perspective; and (ii) cancellation of subcomponent 2.8: Preparation of Gateway II.

Factors that negatively affected implementation

2.2.4   Long duration of Project implementation

The project was im plemented over a period        of approxim ately elev en years, f rom
effectiveness in January 1999 to closing in December 2009 alm ost doubling the original
duration of the project. The long duration compromised the efficiency of use of economic
resources (see section 3.3) a nd required the GOG to com e up with a prolong period of
additional counterpart funds due to increased civil works under the project. Total project
cost am ounted to an estim ated US$52.5 million equivalent due to exchange rate
fluctuations against the SD R, approxim ately 3.2 percent higher than the appraisal
estimate of US$50.7 m illion equivalent. GOG' s contribution am ounted to US $4.4
million.

2.2.5   Continuous emphasis for an international private developer

After the MTR in 2002, it became clear that there was a need to secure another competent
and reputable developer for the enclave si nce Business Focus had failed to perform.

                                             19
GFZB was urged to term inate the lease ag reement with the non-perform ing developer
and it secured an agreem ent for a release of part of that deve loper's land. Since the
emphasis was still to look for an internat ional private developer, GFZB undertook a
second search for a private developer using an international competitive tender process to
develop the TEPZ and to market the available land in the Tema EPZ.

2.2.6    Lack of correctional actions after the Mid Term Review (MTR)

By MTR, the project had disbursed only 29 pe rcent of th e Credit p roceeds but the Bank
continued to rate project perform ance as satisfactory despite the substantial outstanding
issues. These issues cau sed delays in im plementation progress due to mostly lack of an
operational private developer for the EPZ, c ounterpart funds and input m aterials for the
off-site infrastructure. The MTR did not     recommended restructu ring of the pro ject
although the key perform ance indicators were far from being reached. T he proactivity of
the Project team led to comm ence project rest ructuring in 2004 a year before the project
was due to close.

2.2.7   Project at Risk

The project's DO rating was downgraded to "Unsatisfactory" in October 2004 due to (i)
lack of progress in termination of the l ease agreem ent with the non-perfor ming private
developer, (ii) slow progress wi th construction of the of f-site infrastructure, (iii) la ck of
development in on-site infrastructure, and    (iv) insufficient count erpart funding fro m
GOG. The GOG reacted quickly to the downgrad ing and initiated actions on all of the
issues which gave sufficient confid ence to the Bank to change the DO rating back to
"Moderately Satisfactory" by June 2005. This was later upgraded to          "satisfactory" in
December 2005 and the PDO has thereafter been rated satisfactory up to the closing of
the Project.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 M&E Design  indicators and data collection

The original M&E framework was well designed and could be monitored, but the revised
Result Fram ework lacked baselin e data and quantitativ e perfor mance indicato rs, which
were too descriptive and outputs not easily linked to the PDO. This created something of
a disconnect between the indicators and the P DO. Measu ring such indicators gives rise
to the question of attributi on for indicators trying to m easure export volum es, export
earnings and FDI. Measuring the impact of GIAC through Doing Busi ness (DB) Report
ratings is also another exam ple of unclear connection between the outcome and indicator
being used. This indicator was put in place to reflect the many reforms that were ongoing
and demonstrate their results by linking activities to the DB report and the Project. More
appropriate indicators to measure the PDO could have been : (i) increases in num ber of
firms operating in the TEPZ to measure the efforts and level of attracting the critical mass
of companies into the TEPZ; (ii) number of developers operating in the TEPZ; (iii) value
of exports produced from the TEPZ; (iv) number of jobs created by the operating

                                              20
companies in the TEPZ; (v ) es timated number of ind irect jobs created due to the
backward linkages to the TEPZ; (vi) annual in creased levels of investments in the TEPZ;
etc. This information was available but not reported in the Implem entation Status Report
(ISRs) because of the way the Result Fram ework was designed. Interm ediate Outcom e
indicators could have been better identified for each implementing agency to monitor and
collect data. Against this back     ground the design of M&E is rated         moderately
unsatisfactory.

2.3.2   Implementation and quality of data

The M&E was coordinated by th           e Gateway Secretariat which sub mitted quar terly
progress reports, including an annual operating plan describing the project activities to be
carried out during the next calendar year and an adequate justif ication and a com plete
appraisal of each new activity. Durin g the restructuring of the project in 2005, the Result
Framework in the Implementation Status Report (ISR) was revised by replacing the PDO
and Outcome indicators but these changes di d not produce the desire d results as it was
difficult to m easure the project' s attribution to e.g. percenta ge changes of the industry
sector to the GDP. The implementation of Result Framework was inconsistent as most of
the time it was not updated and the perfor mance indicators with data were discussed in
other sections of the IS Rs. However, the Gateway Secretariat and implementing agencies
continued to gather data on the original pe rformance indicators for their subcom ponents
and activities. To further facilitate proj    ect monitoring, bi-m onthly audio-conference
meetings were held b etween the Bank Team and the Gateway Secretariat.                 Bank
supervision m issions were regularly c onducted and the PDO and IP were rated
satisfactory except for October 2004 and June 2005 when the ratings were downgraded to
unsatisfactory and moderately satisfactory. In this regard, the im plementation of M&E is
rated moderately unsatisfactory.

2.3.3   Utilization

With a weak Result Fr amework, the Projec t t eam worked with what they had as the
quality of data was good and easily availa ble. The Progres s repo rts fro m the Gate way
Secretariat were sent to th e Bank and were utilized as background docum ents during the
supervision m issions. The Project did not fully utilize the M&E as a tool for decision
making with exception to reallo cation of funds between the two com ponents. In this
regard, the utilization of M&E is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Note of caution. In 1999 there w as less em phasis on designing of M&E and the log
framework was used as the result fram ework. However, the revised result fram ework as
approved by the Board in 2005 di d not provide baseline data or tim eframe targets or
values towards achieving the end of project targets. Even if the ind icators are considered
inadequate for today's standa rds, at the tim e of restructu ring th ey were accepted as
sufficiently appropriate to evaluate project outcome.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguard

The Ghana Gateway Project was classified as Category A due to the fact that it comprised
both off-site and on-site infrastructure deve lopment that included: (a) water connection;
(b) sewage and solid waste tre atment f or the EPZ; (c) e               lectricity link ; (d)
telecommunication link; and (e ) access roads to the P roject s ite. The Environm ental
Impact Assessm ent (EIA) study ca rried out during project prep aration stated that there
were no major negative environm ental pr oblems envisaged from the project. The
anticipated environm ental prob lems f rom c onstruction works (dust, noise from he avy
machinery) and other problem s expected duri ng project implementation were adequately
addressed in the study. Project prepara      tion, bidding and im plementation therefore
incorporate specific m easures to avo id negative impacts, and to im prove any inadequ ate
environmental conditions in the Project         area such as: (i) e    nvironmentally safe
construction m ethods and techniques; (ii) en vironmental and social criteria to avoid
environmental degradation of the Project si te; and (iii) improvem ent of solid waste
management in the final waste disposal sites in the Tema municipality. The EIA included
a costed Environm ental Mitigation Plan a nd Monitoring Plan (EMP) and an Industrial
Risk Contingency Plan, all of which clear ly identified the in stitutional arrangements for
the execution of the respective plans.

In order to ensure full implem entation of the EMP, the GOG transferred the com ponent
cost to the plan' s executing ag ency, the Env ironment Protection Agency (EPA). In
addition, GOG created a Gateway Environm ental Managem ent Offic e in Tem a and
ensured that the requisite hum an and institutional capacities were provided. The capacity
built in the EPA was adequate f or the management of environmental issues of the Project
to the exte nt the Bank environm ental spe cialists were no t always ne eded in all the
supervision missions. OP 4.12 Involuntary Reset tlement was triggered when the P roject
was to comm ence construction at the Tem a EPZ but this was reso lved by GOG prior to
project effectiveness. The EPA was able to im plement the EMP satisfactorily as required
by the Gateway Project. The perform         ance of safegua rd issues is therefore rated
satisfactory.

2.4.2. Financial Management

The Projec t com plied with the f inancial covena nts stated in the lo an ag reement and all
Audit reports were subm itted on tim ely manner. The overa ll performance of the Project
in financial management is rated satisfactory.

2.4.3   Procurement management

Overall, the perform ance of the procurem ent function under the Project was satisfactory
despite a fe w challenges it encountered at the beginning of project implem entation. The
Project complied with the specified procurement procedures and any procurem ent issues
were properly and tim ely handled by the Bank team . All the Pro ject procu rement

                                             22
processes and implementation activities were pl anned to be completed bef ore the Project
closing date of Dece mber 31, 2009. One excep tion was m ade for the financial audit for
the year 2009, which can only be started fo llowing the closing of the Project and the
completion of all its paym ents. The overall performance of the Project in procurem ent
management is rated satisfactory.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The Gateway Project supported th e GOG to establish its first EPZ/MPIP and at the same
time provide support to the overall Free Zone s program through GFZB. In this regard,
one has to distinguish the two aspects of the FZ program (i) single factory free zones and
(ii) free zone enclave. The FZ program also had focused on sectors i.e. agribusiness/agro-
processing sector and light m     anufacturing. The conclusion drawn from         the ICR
assessment was that the FZ program succeeded in attracting m ore single FZ en terprises
than FZ enclave en terprises and it also su cceeded to attr act m ore agribusin ess s ector
firms, in particular cocoa, while that of light m anufacturing e.g. textiles and electronics
was poor.

The development of the Tem a EPZ/MPIP accounted for almost 60 percent of the pro ject
proceeds. This was a training ground for GF ZB on m anagement of the FZ program and
the enclave. Sim ilarly, 40 percen t of the project p roceeds went to support ex isting
Government institutions responsible for tr ade facilitation and investment prom otion.
These institutions would con tinue with their ac tivities and will be fully funded by GOG.
In this regard, there are no transitional issues for the Gateway Project.

Most of the indicators were institutionalized and would con tinue to be m easured by the
respective institu tions; f or exam ple, CEPS would con tinue being IS O certif ied in its
administrative standards and proced ures; FDI flows would continue to be m onitored by
GIPC; GPHA would continue m onitoring the ef ficiency in goods clea rance at the ports;
GIS would continue to be m easured by the tim e it takes to issue approv al for visa etc. in
this regard the sustainability of the project achievements is high.

The Bank has recently engaged GOG on discussi ons to develop the western corridor.
Since GFZB has two areas iden tified for EPZ (Takoradi and Kum asi) and GPHA ha s
ports ope rations in T akoradi, th ere is a high probability of        rep licating s imilar
developments in the western region. Both institutions are confident to carry out a Phase
II of Gateway initiatives, in particular, now when there are oil operations prospects at the
western region.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

One of the pillars of the Government's overall econom ic strategy (GPRS) at the tim e of
project preparation was to s upport private sector developm ent and em ployment creation.
These goals were compatible with the Bank's CAS of 1998 as described in the two prong

                                            23
strategy: (i) m ore rapid, broa d-based, export oriented sustai ned growth; and (ii) social
sustainability. There w ere four operational sub-areas under the firs t strategic area: (a)
macro-economic stability, (b) private sector development, (c) supporting infrastructure,
and (d) rural developm ent. Pillar I of the Ghana Poverty Reduction S trategy II (GP RS -
2007) is Private Sector Competitiveness. The objectives supported by this project are still
relevant with the Governm ent's GPRS II and the Bank's 2007 Joint-CAS (G-JAS). The
GPRS II puts th e priv ate s ector d evelopment at the forefront to ach ieve h igher and
broader based growth. Moderniza tion of agricu lture and linkages to ind ustry are seen as
central to structural transfor mation of the economy that will be needed to sustain higher
growth and drive poverty reduction. This is       adequately reflected in the Ghana Joint
Assistance Strategy (G-JAS) 2007 covering th e period 2008 -11. Therefore, im proving
business environm ent, including trade and        financial services, facilitating regional
integration to stimulate productivity and trade links are key priorities for GOG.

The goals of the Gateway Project in terms of institutional and private sector development
were clear and appropriate concerning the prio rities of GOG in pub lic sector reforms, its
economy and political context. The design of the components was appropriate at the time
as the project was intended to suppor       t the Free Zone Program       of GOG through
establishment of a Tem a EPZ by providing re quired infrastructure with appropriate
environmental standards; strengthen institu tions which will m anage the Tem a EPZ
(GFZB and EPA); stren gthen institu tions invo lved in trade and trade f acilitation (G IS,
CEPS, GP HA, GIPC, GCAA); incorporate ke y stakeholders in                  project oversight
committee, both public and private representa tives to provide adequate feedback and
support to project m anagement under the Minist ry of Trade and Industry. The levels of
FDI continued to increase as m      ore com panies register under the EPZ fram          ework
therefore enabling GOG reaching one of its m ajor goals for econom ic growth. Based on
the experience of the Gateway project, GOG th rough GFZB is determ ined to establish
new EPZs in Takoradi in the western region        and Kum asi in the central region of the
country. For these reasons, the overall relevance of this project is rated high.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

PDO performance prior to restructuring

As designed during project preparation, the lin kages of the Project' s outputs to outcome s
occurred first, through institutional strengthening of the participating agencies and second,
through their project-speci fic activities in assisting the i nvestors establish in the country
and enter their respectiv e export m arkets. In this regar d, the relevance of project design
is high as the num ber and details of the components were appropriate using the right tool
to develop the EPZs. However, there was a            need t o rest ructure the project to m ake
provision for on-site inf rastructure which the international private developer failed to
provide and expanded access of Tema EPZ/MPIP to non e xport processing firm s. As a
result, the overall duration of the project was doubled and Project funds were disbursed at
a low average rate of 8 percent per annum . Although, it enabled th e completion of all
infrastructure and civ il works and institu tional capacity building unde r the pro ject there
was som e losses in efficien cy. Therefore, project im plementation before res tructuring

                                             24
was moderately satisfactory despite the near co mpletion of major off -site inf rastructure
activities.

Achievement of PDO after restructuring

The assessment of the extent to which the pr oject`s objectives were achieved should take
into consideration the fact that the PDOs while appropriate, were defined rather broadly.
According to ICR Gui delines, " ....whenever the stated PDOs           stated in the board
documents are so broad and/or vaguely worded as to preclude any meaningful evaluation,
intended ob jectives are inferre d by evaluator from key associated outcom e targets .." 7.
Therefore, consisten t with the appro ach recommended by the ICR Guidelines, the ICR
team built its assessm ent by (i) outlining logic al linkage be tween key indicato rs (revised
at restructuring) and pro ject objectives (see Table 2 below), and (ii) complem enting the
observation and assessment of the extent to which the key perform ance indicators were
achieved, w ith a qualitative and quantitativ e assessm ent of the outputs delivered under
the project (reference to Table 3 below a nd A nnex 2). Based on the above m ode of
assessment, the ICR team is of the view that the achievement of the project objectives can
be considered to be overall moderately satisfactory.

Qualitative Assessment of the Achievement of the PDO

In addition to the above assessm ent the ICR team was required to provide a m ore
qualitative assessm ent of the pro ject achie vements. By cross-referencing the f       ield
information with the information produced during implementation, the ICR team believes
that the project produced a reasonable satisfactory outcome. The provision of key off-site
and on-site infrastructure increased occupation of the Tema EPZ, eased logistics between
Team EPZ and Tem a Ports. GFZB and the developer utilize a score card to measure
level of satisfaction of tenants in the enclav e. The investm ent in Ghana's Customs
Management System (GCNet) as a joint effort between public and private sector, enabled
electronic flow of cust oms documentation and has reduced the tim e for processing
shipping documents from 14 days to half a day and customs clearance for ms have been
reduced from 15 to 1. In additi on, CEPS is also ISO 9000 certified. GIS processes Visa-
on-arrival applications on-line and response is given within 24 hours. Smooth Departure
and Arrival procedures at the Kotoka International Ai rport have been achieved. The
construction of the devanning area facilitated decongestion at the Tem a Port. The
provision of dual carriage access road resulted into reduced time in cargo clearance from
25 to 2 days. GIPC attracted private investment worth $12.6 billion between 1999 and
2009, derived from 3,214 projects w hich created 305,874 jobs for Ghanaians and almost
11, 000 for Non Ghanaians. Export oriented production in industry and m anufacturing
companies increas ed to US$ 3.0 billion in 200 7 while total exports were at US$ 4.2
billion. Critical mass of export oriented firms amounting to 260 firm s were registered at
generating 28,433 direct jobs of which 28 perc ent are in the Tem a EPZ/MPIP with an
estimated additional 30,000 indirect jobs.

3.3        Efficiency

Overall, the economic returns are 16.2 percen t with a negative Net Present Value (N PV)
of US$ 48.7 m illion which is much lower than the es timates at appraisal. This does not
mean that the Project is unprofitable, it inst ead demonstrates that the econom ic benefits
would have been of m ore value to the society if the Tem a EPZ/MPIP was completed on
schedule, fully occupied w ith a critical m ass of fir ms, and generating m ore export
products. The econom ic benefits in the an alysis were those accrued from foreign
exchange earnings from value added from exports and FDI flows as investm ents m ade
per firm in the EPZ. The benef its from institutional capacity building were not included
in the calculations. The job ge neration benefit was estim ated at 3,210 direct jobs by year
5 of Te ma EPZ/MPIP being operational but the actual is 8,000 by year 4 of Tem             a
EPZ/MPIP being operational. It is therefore es timated that by year 2013 there will be
over 85,000 direct and indirect jobs created around the Tema EPZ/MPIP.

The participating agencies were satisfied with the work performed by the consultants and
with the quality of the equipm ent purchas ed. The Gateway Secretariat tho roughly
reviewed all bids for co nsultant services an d for equipm ent purchases as revealed by the
Bank's procurem ent evaluations. Appropria te guidance was provi ded to the project
through the GOC and the Bank team provided appropriate and tim ely advice. Based on
these experiences of the project, efficiency is considered to be moderately satisfactory.

3.4        Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The develo pment obje ctives of the Gateway Proje ct re mained rele vant to G OG's
priorities and continue to be consistent    with the Bank's JAS. The Project showed
achievements of its developm ent objectives as de monstrated by Tables 2 and 3 and
Annex 2. The revised PDO KPIs were mostly met although there could be some question
of whether they could entirely be attributed to the project. GFZB a nd GIPC were able to
attract alm ost US $2.2 billion (of which 1.6 million is from EPZ) worth of private
investment which enabled the creation of 260 EPZ firms in the country and over 3,000
projects. The first two KPIs; industrial and exports outputs show that the EPZ firms have
contributed substantially towa rds the overall industr ial output and tota l exports of the
country. The EPZ program is responsible for almost 45 percent of Ghana's exports of
which 8% is from the Tema EPZ/MPIP. The Pr oject also satisfactorily achieved its third
PDO KPI by generating 8,000 jobs accounting for 9 percent of overall jobs created by the

                                                              28
EPZ firms. Institutional strengthening was achieved as all the six institutions dealing with
private investors and trade f acilitation were m odernized an d im proved their serv ices to
the satisfaction of investors as demonstrated in Table 3. The Bank team was proactive in
conducting the restructuring of the project which was necessary despite happening almost
at the end of the project. W ithout the re structuring, the PDO would not have been
successfully met. Disbursement was at 98 percent of the cred it proceeds. TAs mentioned
earlier, the efficiency o f use of project reso urces is reflected in a m oderate EIR R of
16.2%. The Gateway Project showed that, in          general, the resources were efficiently
utilized with an EIRR of 16.2 percent. In other circum stances the project would have
been rated satisfactory but for its longevity     issues, with a m oderately satisfactory
performance during the first 5 years of its life.    In this regard, therefore, the overall
outcome of the Project is rated moderately satisfactory.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The Gateway Project has been able to contribute towards GOG's 2020 Vision and GPRS
II where poverty reduction is a m ajor goal. The Proje ct was able to c reate more
employment than estim ated at appraisal. The econom ic analysis estim ates that
approximately 85,000 direct and indi rect jobs will be created in 15 years. This is due to
the fact that the Tema EPZ/MPIP will be fully occupied with approximately 80 firms.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

CEPS is now ISO 9000 certified on its adm inistrative procedures. The Gateway Project
was able to reengineer the institution with a new m ission and vision. As a result, the
simplification of its pro cedures ena bled Ghan a to be recorded as one of the top ten
reformers in the Africa in 2007 and 2008. The GCNet system for CEPS, it has enabled
flow of information among institutions e.g. GIPC and GPHA and as a result, clearance of
goods has improved trem endously from 25 days in 1999 to 14 days in 2005 to 2 days in
2009. The improved services have been c onfirmed by the ISO 9000 certification in
November 2009.

GIS: The Gateway Project initiated trade an d investment facilitation awareness and
modernization of GIS which included providing adequate capacity building activities and
technology equipm ent for the institution. It received a fu lly equipped Electronic Data
Management Centre from the gateway Proj ect which enabled GIS to process Visa-on-
Arrival applications on-line and to reduce the waiting peri od to less than 48 hours.
Additionally, there has been a trem endous improvem ent with Departure and Arrival
procedures at KIA. New st andard operational procedures for GIS were upgraded to
accommodate the expans ion in its mandate incl uding border patro ls. GIS is now a best
practice and has been recruited by other deve loping agencies to train other countries
immigration officers.

EPA was able to take this opportunity to de centralize its offices to Tem a. The EPA
Office in Tem a is well equipped and capable to addres s a ll environmental issues tha t
could occur at the enclave and it's environ.

GFZB is confident that it has bu ilt adequate in stitutional capacity to manage the Tema
EPZ/MPIP and would establish new ones in Sekondi/Shamaa and Takoradi.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Apart from job creation within the Tem a EP Z/MPIP and its neighboring township, the
companies in the enclave have engaged local farm ers for their inputs. This is the case for
the collection of Shea nuts which are an input for the production of Shea butter and other
cosmetic oils. The Shea nuts are collected by wo men in the villages and collected by the
contracted drivers to deliver to the plant at the E PZ. This line of product engages m any
villages including those from the neighbori ng countries. T his backward linkage has a
great impact in reducing income poverty, in particular, for the women.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A stakeholder workshop was held on Ap ril 14, 2010 to present overall GOG assessm ent
of implementation completion report. The workshop was attended by public and private
sector representatives. Major findings: the stakeholders felt that the impact of the project
was high and would be sustainable. The          capacity building activities were highly
appreciated for exam ple m ost of the project focal point staffs were promoted to higher
positions in CEPS. Among key Lessons Learned were (i) th at Monthly Technical
Committee helped project im plementation through continuous decisions m aking and
collaboration of implementation; (ii) Institutional capacity built from the projec t should
be maintained to b enefit other p rojects e.g. EPA office in Tem a. (iii) Accountability of
Project funds is high in Bank projects whic h is good. (iv) Extension of Project Closing
date has enabled funds to be disbursed up to 98 percent (even if it has a cost on duration
and efficiency) was seen as flexibility on the part of the Bank; and (v) targets and planned
activities w ere too ambitious  n eeded to h ave rea listic targ ets b ased on ex isting
capacities.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

The risk to m aintaining the Dev elopment Objectiv es is r ated moderate. The support

infrastructure had sound technical design. Based on the ICR findings during the site visits,
various types of arrangem ents and partne rships were f orged betw een the v arious
institutions and the Ministry of Trade and Industry and othe r private sector stak eholder
groups to continue m onitoring the quality of services for trade facilitation. Moreover,
GOG intend s to scale u p its EPZ activ ities by estab lishing additiona l sites in Takoradi

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The quality at entry of the Bank's perf ormance was rated satisfactory by the QEA . The
project was designed to reflect international best practice as well as experience with prior
Bank operations. Preparation was done in           a highly collaborativ e m anner with an
appropriate skill m ix in the team (includ ing in frastructure and environ ment sectors).
However, the Bank team should have put less emphasis on the role of the international
private developer for the succe ss of the Tem a EPZ althou gh it was b est pr actice at th e
time. Appropriate op tions would have been thought ou t as part of risk          m itigation
measures. In this regard, quality at entry is rated satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The quality of supervision is rated moderately satisfactory. The Bank undertook regular
supervision missions and in som e cases the m issions were intensified to ensure progress
in performance. There was effective and candid dialogue between GOG and Bank team.
The Bank team was quick to take action to re structure project after exhausting all options
to resolve issues, in particula r those rela ted with the inte rnational private developer and
provision of on-site infras tructure. The Team Leaders were supported by a team of
specialists, in particular, procurem       ent and financial m        anagement throughout
implementation. The cooperation, sharing of pr ogress reports, re-orientation of policies
and seeking im proved i mpact through cons tant innovation was greatly enhanced. The
presence of part of the team in the country office allowed for more continuous monitoring
and participation in the GOC m eetings. De spite the cooperation effort by both team s,
more attention should have been given to         the revised perform ance indicators during
project restructuring. Monitori ng of indicators was irregular even though m ost of the
indicators were difficult to measure or attribute to the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Overall Bank performance is rated         satisfactory. This takes in to c onsideration th e
satisfactory perform ance at qual ity at en try and m oderately satisf actory at superv ision,
the cooperation between the proj ect team and the GOG, the Bank' s ability to play a lead
role in coordinating private s ector developm ent, the achievem ent of a lmost all of the
project developm ent objectives, as well th e sustained policy di alogue with the GOG
leading to continuing Bank engagement in the sector.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

This project was conceived by the Governm ent with the d esire to build on previous
macroeconomic reforms to address key obstacl es to export growth. This policy initiative
had a high priority which translated into a fi rm commitment to the proje ct. The chan ges
in government did not disrupt th e support to the proj ect as its objectiv es were properly
aligned to government priorities and the GP RS 1 and II. The GOC wa s very active and it
met regularly with continued m embership and participation from the private sec tor. The
initial counterpart funds problem s were resolved and GOG contributed m            ore than
originally envisaged during appraisal. Government performance in this project is rated as
satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Gateway Secretariat was respon sible for a complex project with seven participating
agencies. The PCU was strong ly c ommitted to the deve lopment objec tives. The s enior
members of the s taff were high ly q ualified. The quality of m anagement practices were
reflected in the favorable outcom es of all operational and financial audits. The unit
effectively utilized periodic meetings with pa rticipating agencies to s erve as a forum for
discussion of im plementation issues and for cr oss-learning from individual experiences.
All project docum entation was well organized a nd maintained in the ar chives. Financial
management was m eticulous with tim ely repor ting of f inancial inf ormation in easy to
understand for mat. Project m anagement was consistently rated as satisfactory by most
ISRs starting in 2005. Quality of M&E was good and reports were av ailable on a tim ely
basis. This evaluation thus confirms the rating of satisfactory for I mplementing Agency
Performance.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Government's commitment and the high qual ity of staff coupled with their sustained
excellent performance were im portant factors in the overall perform ance of the project.
The overall Borrower Performance is thus rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
     Private Developers for EPZ do not have to be international. Attracting firms
       to the Export Processing Zone does not have to be led by an in ternational private
       developer. The international private deve loper failed to perform and the national
       developers took over and the EPZ is fully operational.

                                            32
       To attract a critical mass of firms into an EPZ all the facilities have to be
       functional. Firm s are n ow considering lo cating at the TEPZ since th e entire
       infrastructure and services are available.

       Strong Project Coordinating Unit is critical to Project's success. Monthly
       technical Comm ittee helped project im plementation substantially as decisions
       were made and collaboration was easy.

       Timely restructuring of a project can lead to a successful implementation of a
       project. When a project becom es very difficult to im plement it's usually a sign
       that there is a need to revisit the funda mentals of the design and its concepts to
       enable retrofitting or adjustments of key features of the project for it to work.

Major Assumptions

Simplifying assum ptions have been necess ary in verifying the econom          ic analysis
prepared during appraisal of the project. Efforts have been made not to be biased towards
social profitability of the EPZ. In this regard, assumptions are as follows:

               The Governm ent of Ghana' s was fully comm itment towards the Proje ct
               and continued im provement of the m             acroeconomic environm ent;
               especially in the reduction of the inflation and domestic interest rates;
               The firm s that en tered the EPZ wo uld have delayed their entry for three
               years without the zone;
               The identified basket of industries did not materialize;
               The national developer was in place during the fourth year of the project;
               The value added for export is betw een 10 -15 percent of total value of
               export sales;
               There was s ome "catalytic effects" fr om the existence of th e EPZ. These
               will be in activities like service businesses and other industries which will
               be suppliers of raw m aterials and other services, and thus creating a
               backward linkage to th e EPZ. Ther e will also be som e em ployment
               creation in these industries and creation of new ones;
               The m inimum wage rate for the EPZ is          be equal to th at of exis ting
               manufacturing firms; i.e. US$ 50.00 per month;
               It was assum ed that the EPZ firm s will export up to 100 percent of their
               production; and
               The num bers of fir ms i n the zone ar e actual including those outside the
               enclave.

Components of Cost- Benefit Analysis of EPZ

Six main benefits and types of costs have been quantified. These are as follows:

Employment Generation.            Based on the inform ation provided by the Gateway
Secretariat and the GFZB, about 8,000 jobs have been created from 24 fir ms within 4
years in part of the EPZ. A second national      private developer is expected to bring in
equal amount of firms or more. Adding the MPIP which has 19 firms under consideration,
the number of fir ms is expected to reach 80. In 15 years, it is, therefore, estimated that,
more than 40,000 jobs will be created in th e Te ma EPZ/MPIP. Fro m the basket of
industries operating at the enclave, 5 were in apparel but 3 closed due to global econom ic
crisis. These tend to create m ore jobs than other industries which could be highly capital
intensive e.g. seafood processing. However,        Ghana compares favorably with its
competitors in term s of labor cos ts. A sec ondary ef fect was expecte d in em ployment
creation which created additional jobs from ac tivities f rom the periph eral of the E PZ.

                                            41
These jobs have been estim ated at 140 percent of the total j obs created in the EPZ. Thus
within 4 years, 30,000 addition al jobs were created and by year 15 a total of 45,000 will
be created. The concern of m ost governments is to create jobs through the EPZ reflecting
the belief that the social benefits of creating additional jobs outweigh the costs.

Foreign Exchange Earnings. The foreign exchange earnings of foreign-owned EPZ
firms m erely constitu te transac tions betw een these f irms and f irms abroad. They,
therefore, have marginal direct effects on economic welfare of domestic nationals, except
for the m oney that is converted into dom estic currency to be spent on wages and
purchases from local econom y. The importance of this effect creates a net benef it to the
host country from these purchases. This econo mic analysis has quantified these benefits
to represent foreign exchange earnings from investment by the firms and value added of
exports.

Technology Transfer. EPZ norm ally involves labor-int ensive production and thus
promote technology in the host country. This constitu tes the most important externality
that com es with the presence of the EP       Z. In the long-run, the learning by doing
mechanism will com e into play through the "cataly tic effect" th at will result in gains in
managerial practices and notions of quality con trol transferred to local m iddle managers
employed by the EPZ firm s. This is expected to increase productivity and efficiency in
domestic firm s which would have otherwise not im proved without the influence of the
EPZ. This benef it is dif ficult to m easure a nd has thus not been in cluded in the cost-
benefit analysis.

Domestic Sales. EPZ firms will be perm itted to sell up a to maximum of 30 percent of
their output in any year on th e domestic m arket. Such sales are treated as im ports, and
duty is paid at norm al rate. The net value to the host country of the goods consumed is
the value of c.i.f. prices of the imports, which also the net p rice is actually paid by EPZ
firms. Thus, domestic sales have no net welfare effect and have been ignored by the cost-
benefit analysis.

Electricity. EPZ firms are heavy us ers of electricity. Thus, the cost-benefit analysis must
compare the tariff rates paid with estim ates of the long-run m arginal cost (LRMC) of
supplying the extra power. If the average tariff exceed the LRMC, the electricity u sed by
EPZ would entail net tax, or, in the revers e case, a net subsidy. There will be no special
tariffs for the EPZ. However, the cur rent utilities tariffs in Ghana are ex tremely low, but
EPZ pay in foreign cu rrency and thus there was no subsidy to the EPZ firm s. However,
these rates are currently being revised to reflect cost-recovery market rates. It is therefore
assumed that there are no net welfare effects to the economy, and thus, have been ignored
by the cost-benefit analysis.

Taxes. Although taxes raised from EPZ fir m t end to be sm all, they represent a clear
source of benefit for the dom estic econom y. Th ey would not have been received if the
EPZ firms were not present although fir ms which transfer to the zone from elsewhere in
the country are an exception. Taxes will, theref ore, be expected fr om wages of both EPZ
employees, EPZ firm s (after the expiration of the incom e t ax-holiday) and other taxes

                                             42
from domestic firms that will prov ide raw m aterials to the EPZ f irms as they provide a
backward linkage to the rest of the economy.

Infrastructure Costs. Public expenditures requ ired to set up the zon e represents a clea r
economic cost. Therefore, the off-site and on-s ite infrastructure investm ent costs will be
included as the major costs for the EPZ project.

Administrative Costs. The establishment of the zone site, its maintenance, and
administration all represents economic costs and in principle should be evaluated at
shadow prices. In the absence of data the financial costs will be used.

Economic Analysis Evaluation: Results

Experience in other countries suggests that th e main quantifiable benefits from EPZ are:
(i) foreign exchange earnings from value added of exports; and (ii) creation of additional
direct and indirect em ployment. However, this econom ic analysis uses value added of
exports from the EPZ to quantify the foreign exchange earnings. To measure this benefit
a set of figures generated by GF ZB for firm in the EPZ were used. The value of export
sales minus imported inputs which equals to value added. The value added for ms a mere
10-15 percent of the export values. Since th       e Project supports the acceleration of a
process that leads to an outcom e -- incr eases in exports -- the m ethodology adopted
assumed that the Project would accelerate th e increase in exports by three years. This
increase in exports would not have been ach ieved without the Project. Investments on the
off- site and on-site infrastructure for the encl ave completed at year four and five of the
Project but firm s have been registered and started operating elsewhere than the enclave.
Therefore, substantial benefits stream started in year five of the Project.

All project costs and benefit shave been consid ered over a period of 15 years. In the bas e
case, an EPZ firm was estim ated to invest at least $4 m illion and em ploy an average of
300 workers. The growth of EPZ firm has been steady at average of 33 firms a year due
to the successful prom otional cam paigns organized by both GFZB and GIPC. The net
value added of exports was taken from the act ual value of exports and multiplied b y 10
percent per annum. The EPZ is expected to create about 40,000 jobs and 45,000 indirect
jobs in the 15 years.

Based on the above stated assumptions, the      Project has ERR of 16.2 percent w ith a
negative NPV of US$ 48.7 million, which compares similarly with the rates of returns for
successful EPZ elsewhere. ERR on Penang         EPZ fir ms (Malays ia) is 28 percen t; 2 6
percent in Indonesia, 23 percent in Shenzhen (China); 15 percent in Korea and 18 percent
in Kenya). In this regard the project was ec onomical beneficial to the country. The main
reason for the very low then appraisal       estimates was due to the prolong project
investment period resulting into the econom y t o continue to incur costs as the benefits
were postponed.

Nonetheless, to conclude, the project has beat en all odds to becom e successful due to its
high levels of political stab ility, reasona ble stable m acroeconomic environm ent,

                                            43
availability of a cheap and large labor force with both skills and semi-skilled workers and
two credible national developers to manage the EPZ over the watch of GFZB.

Executive Summary

1.      The Im plementation of the Ghana Trade and Investm ent Gateway Project was
        for 7 years from January 1999 to De cember 2005 but was extended after project
        restructuring to close o n Decem ber 2009. Th e Gateway Project was m ulti-
        sectoral in nature and was implemented under the auspices of the MOTI  as part
        of a Governm ent (NDC 1) programme to "attract a critical m ass of Export
        oriented FDI into Ghan a  to accelerate export  led Growth of the National
        Economy".

       Please find attach ed th e Final Draft of the Project Com pletion Report (ICR)
       prepared by the Gateway Project Secretariat.

2.     The main project objective was the development of a 1200 acre Export Processing
       Zone (EPZ) near the port of Tem a through the provision of in ternational quality
       `off-site' infrastructure, limited `on-site' infrastructure and access road.

       The resulting Industrial Park called Tem a Export Processing Zone/Multi Purpose
       Industrial Park (TEPZ/MPIP) is being m anaged by the GFZB. In addition the
       project funded a variety of ` limited but high impact' in terventions to selected
       frontline Government Institutions for institutional strengthening, capacity building
       and in som e cases tech nical ass istance in the f orm of critical equ ipments  to
       enable these institutions improve the quality of s ervice rendered to Investors and
       the Priv ate Sector. T hese agencies were GFZB, CE PS, GIS, GP HA EP A,
       GCAA/GACL and the GIPC.
       The focus of this component of the pr      oject was to reduce the cost of doing
       business in Ghana and for targeted investment promotion by the GIPC.

3.     The project was f inanced with an I DA Credit of SDR37.6m illion an d Ghana
       Government contribution of US$3.2m illion over the extended project du ration of
       10 years from January 1999  December 2009.

At project closure in Decem ber 2009 the fo llowing amounts had been expended to fund
the various project activ ities  i.e. IDA Credit of SD R36.63million (US$49.20m illion)
representing 97.4% and GoG contribution ha s increa sed to US$4m illion (i.e. a 23%
increase)

below:



                                           50
4.1`GFZB    The Tem a Export Processing Zone TEPZ/MPIP developm ent has
             been com pleted with two m ajor private enclave develo pers 
             Messrs ILD C and OctoGlow deve loping and m anaging 240 acres
             and 240 acres respectively. An area of 179 acres was developed
             with project funds for the direct managem ent by the GFZB  in
             addition to GFZB regulatory and       monitoring functions for the
             whole enclave. The GFZB official report indicate occupancy and
             employment statistics are as follows:

             i. No. of functioning factories - 24
           ii. No. of firm s who have acquire d land and in the process of
                developing - 40
           iii. Direct Employment created - 8000
            iv. Indirect employment created - 30,000

           Challenges being encountered incl ude  irregular water supply and
           institution of an accepta ble arrangement for tariff setting and interna l
           electric power distribution.

4.2`CEPS   The Project has funded the developm ent of a new Ghana Custom s
           Management System ( GCMS) which has m            ade is possible to
           electronically process custom s documentation on a W         ide Area
           Network (WAN) platform  GCNet. This electronic system has greatly
           reduced the time for processing sh ipping documents. The full im pact
           of this breakthrough is yet to be   realized when GPHA and other
           stakeholders in the cargo clearance process also update and interface
           their systems with the GCNet.

           Additionally, unregulated charges by various operators have m ade the
           cost of clearing goods higher than was anticipated.
           CEPS has now acquired internationa         l ( service) qua lity assuranc e
           certificate i.e. ISO 9001- 2008 for thre e of its collections (accounting
           for 80% of CEPS revenue collection). This is expec ted to ins till a
           culture of continual improvem ent in CEPS operations. Sem i-annual
           mandatory Surveillance Audit by the Certification Agency is expected
           to ensure sustainable quality service delivery. It is essential that CEPS
           makes budgetary funds allocation f or undertaking this routine audits
           and to extend the certification to all other major collections.

4.3 GIS    The Gateway Project initiated      trade and investm ent facilitation
           awareness and m odernization proce ss in GIS. The service was also
           provided with a fully equipped Elec tronic Data Managem ent Centre.
           The GIS now processes Visa-on-          Arrival applications on-line.
           Additionally, there has been a        tremendous im provement with
           Departure and Arrival pr ocedures at KIA. Ne w standard operating



                                     51
                procedures for GIS are again be    ing revised to accommodate the
                expansion in the GIS mandate to include border patrols.

 4.4 GPHA The project has ass isted the Autho rity to construct a 3km dual carriage
          access road and two fly over bridges to facilitate the op erations of off-
          dock terminals.

               The GPHA has on its own undertaken    major physical infrastructure
               improvement at Tem a Port which far exceeds what which was
               envisaged under the Gateway Project.

               The GPHA is y et to a ccomplish the obje ctive of im plementing the
               proposed "L and Lord Port Act". T his notwithstanding the GPHA has
               undertaken a systematic unbundling of a variety of port activities to the
               private sector  under the existing port Law. However it appears the
               existing La w lacks the author ity r equired by GPHA to e ffectively
               regulate and set standards for the operations at the port.

4.5   GCAA/GACL
            The GCAA has been separated by Law into a purely civ il Aviation
            Regulatory Authority a nd a new entity  th e Ghana Airpor ts Company
            Limited (GACL) whic h is tasked to develop, m anage and operate
            airports in the country.
            The project has extended extensive c onsultancy services for St rategic
            Aviation S ector Studies and anot her consultancy study for post-
            separation restructuring and viabil ity options for the new G ACL. The
            two studies are exp ected to guid e th e future d irection of the aviation
            industry in Ghana.

               The project has also provided a 1000KVA sta ndby generator for the
               new Airport Com pany. The im plementation of the recomm endation in
               these two studies n eeds to be pu rsued diligently. The m anagement
               Aviation Authority is reported to be considering further separation of
               the "residual" GCAA into two new entities. It is recommended that this
               proposal should be programm ed to al low time for the consolidation of
               the original unbundling exercise.

4.6   EPA      The EPA has been a beneficiary           of a number of far reach     ing
               interventions which has successfully provided an Environmental Action
               Plan for the implementation of the TEPZ and for continued monitoring
               of the environm ental impact of the operations of the TEPZ  which is
               Ghana's first Industrial Estate. Th e EPA offic e set up at Tem a now
               has the capacity for m onitoring and regulation of other industrial parks
               elsewhere in the country.
               The project financed the         drafting of an     ENVIRONMENTAL
               PROTECTION AND POLLUTION CONTROL LEGISLATION which

                   is waiting to be passed into law to allow enf orcement of environmental
                   guidelines.

 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The key p roject objectiv e of creatin g a purpose-built Export Processing Zone (EPZ ) in
close proximity to the m ain entry port of Te ma Habour has essentially been achieved. In
addition, substantial progress has been made in strengthening and building capacity in the
selected Go vernment agencies to enable them im proves their serv ice deliv ery. W ith
respect to projec t im plementation, the in stitution of a monthly project technical
committee m eetings comprising all im plementing agencies to m onitor im plementation
progress, was found to be an invaluable tool and is recommended for other multi sectoral
projects.

Challenges encountered include the unrealization of planned system expansion of electric
power and water supply in the project area whic h needs to be tackled in order to realize
the full potential of Ghana's f irst Export Processing Zone. T he experience gained in the
design, im plementation and operatio n will be i nvaluable in the setting up of industrial
parks elsewhere in the country - especially in the em erging industrial focal area of the
Western Region for the downstream activities expected as a result of the oil find. It will
be desirable to start im mediately the initia l steps to create industrial parks elsewhere
outside the capital city and the western region, preferably in all the regions.

There is th e urgent need to ensu re that p lanned infrastructure sys tem (i.e. access ro ads,
electricity and water production and distribution networks, waste collection and treatment
plants) expansions in the targeted areas in clude the increm ental demand of the proposed
industrial developm ents. The li mited but targeted interventions undertaken by the
Gateway Project in various Governm         ent ag encies have been quite successful in
improving the quality of their service delivery . In som e cases the p roject kick-s tarted
modernization as well as changing the mind set of these institutions to providing quality
service and reorienting them to investm ent and trade facilitation and general custom er
care.

As the nation seeks to pursue the objective of accelerated development in a decentralized
democratic environment, it is imperative that attention be also directed to the following:-

    i.    Ensuring that the gains achieved with resp ect to the service delivery in frontline
          agencies are sustained and continually improved upon; and similar interventions
          designed f or identif ied f rontline agencie s which were excluded f      rom the
          Gateway Project.

   ii.    It is necessary that the level of service delivery achieved at the institutional Head
          Offices be imm ediately ex tended to the regional offices to supp ort th e
          decentralization process.

         It m ust be noted that over 80% of all i ndustries is concentrated in the Greater
         Accra area. This earth-quake prone area is also the hom e of a whopping 25% of

                                              53
Ghana's population. This situat ion is to say the least, very alarming. D efinitive
actions hav e to be tak en to accelerate the decentralizatio n process and spread
development throughout the country to        curb the influx of mass pools of
unemployed youth into this area.
