SUNMARY
i.        The Government established the Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB) in
1970 to finance public and private enterprises in industry, agriculture and
tourism. In February 1974, IDA granted a $6 million credit for TIB. TIB has
now almost fully committed the IDA credit and other foreign resources and has
requested a Bank loan.
ii.       Due to drought, increases in petroleum prices and inefficient utili-
zation of industrial capacity, Tanzania is experiencing severe economic prob-
lems.  To alleviate the problems, the Government has decided to increase
investment in productive enterprises. Priority has been given to increasing
industrial capacity utilization and expanding industries whose capacity is
fully utilized.
iii.      Five years after its establishement, TIB has emerged as an important
institution. Its operations have increased sharply and its financing now
accounts for about twenty percent of new industrial investment. Its involve-
ment in shaping projects has improved and its appraisal capacity has been
strengthened. TIB makes a comprehensive economic evaluation of projects,
thereby helping the Government in its drive to improve the efficiency of
the industrial sector. As a result of an increase in TIB's net worth, its
financing limit per enterprise will increase to Tsh 27 million by the end
of 1975. TIB, if necessary jointly with EADB or TDFL, can now finance almost
any size of project in Tanzania.
iv.       TIB has good management and its Tanzanian staff has improved as a
result of participation in training programs abroad. All of TIB's departments
are now managed by Tanzanians.
v.        TIB's major problem is its portfolio.  About half of the portfolio
is in arrears of more than three months. Most of the problem projects were
approved shortly after TIB's establishment. Most of them can still be
salvaged, if appropriate action is taken.  TIB has analyzed the problems of
these clients and, where necessary, taken the lead in restructuring the
companies. TIB has proposed a satisfactory plan of action during negotiations.
vi.       TIB's profitability is modest but is expected to increase according
to TIB's projections. TIB's debt/equity ratio is 1.1:1 and TIB's financial
condition is sound.
vii.      Given the availability of potential projects and the improved
capacity of parastatals to develop and implement projects, TIB's business
prospects are good and its forecasted operations reasonable. To finance its
projected commitments until the end of 1977, TIB needs Tsh 475 million inclu-
ding lsh 160 million for domestic expenditures and Tsh 315 million for
imports. TIB expects to cover its local resource requirements by cash genera-
tion from operations, foreign borrowings and an increase in the paid-in share
capital. Taking into account likely contributions from foreign sources other



than the World Bank Group, TIB's foreign resource gap remains at Tsh 107
million. It is recommended that the Bank fill the entire gap by a $15
million loan. The loan would cover 23% of TIB's resources requirements until
December 31, 1977.
viii.     The loan would finance the CIF cost of imported goods, including
permanent working capital, and the estimated import component of civil works
and imported goods purchased in Tanzania. It would be repaid according to a
flexible amortization schedule, conforming to the aggregate amortization
schedules of TIB's subloans, which have a maximum maturity of 15 years. TIB
will need the Bank's prior approval of each project using $400,000 or more
of the proposed loan and will not,be able to use more than $3 million in
total without the Bank's approval. TIB will on-lend the proceeds of the
loan at a minimum interest rate of 10% with the foreign exchange risk being
borne by the subborrower.



1.01      The Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB) was established in 1970.  The
Government owns 60% of TIB's share capital and two parastatal organizations
own the remaining 40%. The Bank has been in dialogue with TIB since its
establishment in 1970. In February 1974, IDA granted a credit of $6 million
for TIB. TIB has fully committed the IDA credit and has requested further
Bank assistance. This report appraises TIB for a $15 million loan.
1.02      The objectives of the proposed loan are twofold.  First, in line
with the Government's plans to reduce Tanzania's economic dependence by
increasing productive investment, the loan will provide resources for invest-
ment in industry, agribusiness and tourism. Second, the loan will support
TIB which has become an important institution, financing about 20% of new
industrial investment. Through its continued association with TIB, the
Bank can help TIB further improve its procedures and project selection.
II. THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
2.01      Tanzania has a population of 14 million.  With a GDP per capita of
$120, it is one of the twenty-five least developed countries. Ninety percent
of the population derives its livelihood from peasantry agriculture. The
agricultural sector constitutes 40% of GDP and 51% of exports. The industrial
sector accounts for 11% of GDP but is increasing in importance.
Economy of Tanzania
2.02      Tanzania continues to move towards a comprehensively centrally
planned economy. The Arusha Declaration of 1967 empowers the Government to
nationalize major economic activities including financial institutions, large
manufacturing firms and wholesale trading. Since 1967, the role of the
public sector has increased markedly and Tanzania has relied increasingly
upon central planning and direct controls to guide investments and to facili-
tate income distribution.
2.03      Due to Tanzania's centrally planned economy and its vigorous attempt
to mobilize domestic resources, domestic savings increased from 10% of GDP
during 1969-1970 to 18% in 1974. The level of investment reached 33% of
monetary GDP (23% of total GDP) during the second 5-year plan period (1969-
1974). Unfortunately, the high level of investment has not resulted in a
significant growth in GDP. During the second 5-year plan period, GDP increased
at an annual rate of 4.8% which was substantially less than the 6.5% envisaged
in the plan. The slow growth was due to an orientation of investments towards
infrastructure (specifically the investment of about $300 million in the
Tan-Zam railway) and social services. The agricultural sector's performance
was disappointing due to drought and lack of effective investment programs.
Also, the investments in the industrial sector remained underutilized. (See
para. 2.14).



Recent Economic Developments -
2.04      Although during the second plan the performance of Tanzania's economy
was poor when compared to the magnitude of the investments, its prospects were
considered promising. But the events of 1974 reversed the trend. Tanzania's
overall balance of payments, which was in surplus in 1972 and 1973, turned
into a deficit of Tsh 920 million (US $129 million). Despite higher world
prices of its main commodities, for example, cotton, sisal, and coffee,
Tanzania reported a trade deficit of about Tsh 2 billion (US $294 million).
Consequently, the foreign exchange reserves as of March 31, 1975, were only
US$59.2 million, covering less than one month of imports. The turnaround in
Tanzania's balance of payments was due to: (i) a threefold increase in
petroleum prices which raised the oil bill from Tsh 240 million to Tsh 639
million; (ii) stagnation in agricultural production in 1974 due to the drought
and weakness in agricultural development policy (Tanzania's food import bill
increased from Tsh 286 million in 1973 to Tsh 739 million in 1974); and
(iii) the sale of most export commodities by advanced contracts at low prices.
2.05      Due to strong credit expansion, the money supply (currency in circu-
lation and demand deposits) increased by 26.2% in 1974, compared to 19.2% in
1973. The expansion was due to unprecedented increases in borrowings of both
the Government and parastatals from the banking system. Government borrowings
from the banking system increased by Tsh 305 million, or 31.6%. Other borrow-
ings from the commercial bank, mostly by parastatals, increased by Tsh 857
million, or 62%. The rapid increase in money supply, shortage of supplies due
to drought, inefficiencies in the industrial sector, and world-wide inflation
resulted in sharp domestic price increases. The Retail Price Index for wage
earners living in Dar es Salaam rose by 28.1% during the year ended June 30,
1974, compared with an increase of only 6.7 in the previous year. The cost
of Living Index for middle-grade civil servants increased by 22.8% against
8.2% in the previous year. Most of the increases were due to rising food costs,
which constitute two-thirds of the indices, and the rate of inflation is
expected to decrease substantially as a result of increased food production.
2.06      It appears inevitable that Tanzania will continue to face economic
difficulties over the next few years. The balance of payments situation is
not expected to improve shortly. The trade deficit is expected to decrease
only slightly to Tsh 1.9 billion. Prices of most export commodities have
fallen rapidly while the costs of imports are estimated to stay the same.
2.07      In view of the economic difficulties which the country went through
in the last two consecutive years, the Government decided to postpone the
launching of the Third Five Year Plan until next year. This is intended to
give the Government ample time to assess the food situation in the country
for the current harvesting season and thereby enable the Government to re-
arrange its priorities accordingly. In the plan, the Government chose a basic
industry strategy which aims at a gradual structural transformation of the

tation Meeting on Tanzania," Paris, April 22-23, 1975.

economy by giving priority to industries that process domestic raw materials
for domestic consumption. Exports are seen as a logical extension of produc-
tion for the home market.  The Government's strategy now aims at increasing
agricultural and industrial production for exports through new investments and
better utilization of existing capacity. The strategy is translated into the
FY 1976 budget which envisages total expenditures of Tsh 6.2 billion out of
which Tsh 2.6 billion are for development expenditures. The estimated develop-
ment expenditures represent an increase of 10% over 1975 while recurrent
expenditures will increase by only 5%. The Government is expecting to finance
45% of the development expenditures from recurrent revenues and local borrowings
and the remaining 55% from external sources.
2.08      However, the success of the new intended Government policy of ensur-
ing efficient operation of all its parastatals requires detailed clarification
and definition of policy objectives of each parastatal and the establishment
of clear quantitative as well as qualitative targets by parent Ministries for
their parastatals over a given time span. The Government also needs to define
the roles of parent Ministries, Board of Directors and Management. A clarity
of function of these various bodies which have direct impact on the opera-
tions of parastatals is very important for accountability of success and fail-
ure of any given parastatal.
The Manufacturing Sector -I
2.09      In the Industry and Mining Sector Mission Report, which was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors in April, 1975, the Bank has raised a number
of issues concerning the productivity of existing manufacturing enterprises
and made suggestions for the efficiency of the public sector. The major
issues and the Bank's recommendations are summarized in the following para-
graphs. Tanzania's manufacturing sector has been the most rapidly growing
sector. During 1964-73, the average annual growth rate of value-added in
manufacturing was 9.5% in real terms; the sector's contribution to GDP
increased from 7% to 10%. Employment (in firms of over 10 employees) rose
from 28,100 in 1965 to 59,100 in 1972, an annual increase of 11.2%. In 1973,
about 15% of Tanzania's wage earners were employed in the sector. Invest-
ment in the sector hovered between Tsh. 100-200 million (US$12-28 million)
per year during the 1966-72 period.
2.10      Structure of Industry.  Tanzania has thus far followed a typical
pattern of industrial development by concentrating on import substitution
industries, mainly consumer goods. The share of non-food consumer goods
industries in total manufacturing value-added increased from 22% in 1965 to
41% in 1971. Textile and garment industries, breweries, the cigarette factory,
and radio assembly recorded the strongest expansion. The share of intermediate
goods industries remained stable at around 30%. The principal growth indus-
tries in this category were: petroleum refining, printing and publishing,

latest report: "Tanzania: Industrial and Mining Sector Survey,"
No. 647-TA, March 31, 1975.



glass, cement, and fabricated metals.  During the same period, the shiare o.
the capital goods industry in manufacturing value-added rose from 2.7,O to 4.4Z'9
while its share in the manufacturing output increased from 1.3% to 7.5%. Al-
though the capital goods industry appears to be growing, it is still smalL and
consists mostly of commercial vehicle assembly, repair and body construction
plants and a few workshops. The food processing industries declined from
36.3% of total gross output in 1965 to 31.4% in 1971. The Government is now
committed to increase production in this subsector.
2.11      Public Sector.  Since the Arusha Declaration in 1967, Tanzania has
developed a unique three-tier system to manage the industrial sector. The
system consists of 3 parent ministries, 1/ 11 holding companies 2/ and about
72 operating companies.  Annex 1 provides a summary of all parastatal organi-
zations involved in Industry as of January 1, 1975.  The Government owns 50%
or more of the shares in all but 5 of the operating companies. In 1974,
parastatals accounted for an estimated 75% of the value-added in the manufac-
turing sector and 90% of new capital formation. During the 1967-72 period,
total revenue of manufacturing parastatals amounted to Tsh 4,611 million
(US$646 million), or 25% of all parastatals' revenue. Manufacturing parasta-
tals appear more profitable than other parastatals. Their 7.3% net profit
margin as percentage of sales was substantially higher than 5.4% of all paras-
tatals.
2.12      Private Sector.  Although Tanzania's economy is dominated by the
public sector, the share of the private sector is still significant. Current-
ly, it accounts for 25% of the value added and almost 50% of employment in
the manufacturing sector. Of the total 500 registered manufacturing estab-
lishments (employing 10 or more), 430 are privately owned. These include a
few relatively large ones, such as a Danish sugar factory (employing about
200), a radio and gramophone assembly plant (employing 140), a glass hollow
ware factory (employing 270), and a metal furniture factory (employing 325).
2.13      Lack of adequate policies prevent any significant private invest-
ment. Its role is not clearly defined and the last guide to investors,
issued in January 1971, has become obsolete because of the number of changes
concerning price control, import licensing, dividend transfer control and
income taxation. Since Tanzania urgently needs foreign capital and know-how
to increase production, it may be timely to consider establishing more joint
ventures between parastatals and multinational corporations as the Government
has already done in the petroleum and mining sectors.

2.14      Stagnation in 1974.  Industry, previously the fastest growing sec-
tor, stagnated in 1974. The stagnation was apparently not due to the lack
of demand. The demand for simple consumer goods increased rapidly because
of the increases in the minimum wage from Tsh 68 a month in 1967 to Tsh 340
in 1974. The Industrial Sector mission estimated that monetary disposable
income of the public rose by at least 20% both in 1973 and 1974. While
demand increased substantially, supply increased only marginally as a result
of: (i) a decline in productive investments by the private sector; and (ii)
the low capacity utilization in industry due to a number of factors such as
supply disruptions (water and power), shortage of spare parts, lack of skilled
manpower, factory layout problems, labor unrest, inadequate management and
price controls.
2.15      Price Control.  In order to protect consumers against excessive
mark-ups, a National Price Commission (NPC) was established in 1973. NPC
has a staff of about 18 and is responsible for monitoring the prices of over
1,000 types of goods and commodities. The Industrial Sector Mission observed
a conflict between the Government's desire to keep the prices low to the
consumer and the need to build up savings (equity) of operating companies
for financing expansion. Also, as prices are based on the cost of production
plus a certain profit margin, consumers often end up paying more because
ex-factory prices are set on the basis of cost of the most inefficient opera-
tions plus a fixed margin. This takes away any incentive for management to
reduce cost and improve productivity and builds inflationary pressures into
the system as profit margins increase with the cost of production. To check
the efficiency of domestic production, the Industrial Sector Mission recom-
mended that the NPC base ex-factory prices on international prices, possibly
plus a margin needed to stimulate domestic industries. The Government is
still considering the mission's recommendations.
Financial Institutions
2.16      Tanzania's financial system consists of a Central Bank--The Bank
of Tanzania--and, in addition to TIB, six Government-owned specialized
institutions: the National Bank of Commerce for commercial banking; the
National Insurance Corporation; the Tanzania Rural Development Bank; the
Tanzania Housing Bank; the National Provident Fund; and the Tanganyika Post
Office Savings Bank. Two other development banks operate in Tanzania: the
East African Development Bank, which is owned by the Governments of the East
African Community countries; and the Tanganyika Development Finance Co.,
Ltd. (TDFL). TDFL is owned in equal shares by the Tanzanian Government
(through the Tanzania Investment Bank), and aid agencies from Germany, the
Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The following is a summary describing
all of the financial institutions. Annex 2 provides a summary of the interest
rates structure in Tanzania.

2.17.     The National Bank of Commerce (NBC) is the only commercial baak
operating on the Mainland. 1/ NBC was established in 1967 when, following
the Arusha Declaration, eight private commercial banks were nationalized and
merged into a single bank.  Until 1970, NBC also provided medium and long-
term financing to industry, but after TIB was established in 1970, NBC dis-
continued this activity and transferred its entire term loan portfolio to TIB
(see para. 4.09). NBC now only provides short-term financings and some working
capital on a roll-over basis. NBC owns 30% of TIB's shares. As of June 30,
1974, NBC's total assets amounted to Tsh 3.1 billion. Despite the stagnation
in the economy, NBC's net profit after tax increased in 1974 by 77% to
Tsh 52.7 million. Total deposits increased by 27% during the year to Tsh 2.7
billion; 55% of total deposits were from the private sector. During the same
year, loans outstanding increased by 62% to Tsh 2.2 billion; 84% of NBC's
loans were to the public sector. Parastatals borrowings increased from Tsh 0.9
billion to Tsh 1.6 billion. Loans to the mining and manufacturing sector
increased by 110% to Tsh 558 million and accounted for 25% of NBC's loan port-
folio as of June 30, 1974. During 1974, NBC opened 15 new branches and 71
agencies (mobile branches) raising the total to 65 branches and 220 agencies.
Consequently, the number of savings accounts increased by 66,942 to a record
level of 301,539. Savings deposits rose by 19% to Tsh 362 million. The
interest rate on savings deposits is 4%. NBC charges 5 to 10% on its loans;
most loans are made at 8-10%.
2.18      The National Insurance Corporation (NIC) is the only insurance
company in Tanzania. It is primarily a property and casualty company. It
owns 10% of TIB's paid-in capital. As of December 31, 1973, NIC's total
assets stood at Tsh 196 million and its investments amounted to Tsh 169 mil-
lion. NIC had invested most of its funds in Government securities (about
45%), building projects (23%), and short-term deposits (23%). During 1973,
investments increased by Tsh 38 million mainly in Government securities. Due
to a stop in commercial construction, NIC's opportunities for investment in
real estate are limited. However, it can play an active role in industrial
development, by providing financing for industrial buildings.
2.19      The Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB) was established in 1971
with an authorized capital of Tsh 300 million, of which Tsh 113 million has
been paid-in. TRDB has offices in all except 2 of the country's 18 regions.
In 1974, TRDB approved 219 loans amounting to Tsh 161 million, a 49.3%
increase over 1973.  The bulk of the loans were for seasonal inputs.  As of
June 30, 1974, its portfolio stood at Tsh 154 million. Cooperative societies,
Ujamaa Cooperative Societies and the District Development Corporations
accounted for 58% of the loans. TRDB's main sources of funds are bilateral
donors and international agencies. IDA has used TRDB for most of its agri-
cultural projects. TRDB has financed some small-scale industries, including
1/   Zanzibar has its own commercial bank, the People's Bank of Zanzibar
which is not required to surrender its foreign exchange to the Bank
of Tanzania.



some sawmills and a number of grain mills. Its lending rate is 8.5% for
short-term and 7.5% for long-term loans.
2.20      The Tanzania Housing Bank (THB) is the main source of funds for
construction of commercial and residential buildings, including low cost
housing. It derives its resources primarily from public deposits on which
it pays between 4.5% to 6% interest. IDA has provided $2 million to THB as
part of the site and service project. 1/ Total assets as of September 1973,
were Tsh 105 million, of which Tsh 77 million were in the forms of commercial
loans. Deposits as of the same date were Tsh 71 million.
2.21      The National Provident Fund (NPF) is concerned with pensions and
had assets amounting to Tsh 482 million as of September 1973. These were
mainly held in the form of Government securities. During the year, these
holdings increased by Tsh 86 million to Tsh 416 million. Members' contri-
butions as of September 1973, amounted to Tsh 369 million. NPF is the
second largest holder of Government securities after the National Bank of
Commerce.
2.22      The Tanganyika Post Office Savings Bank (POSB) is used mainly by
small urban savers wishing to remit savings to their families in other parts
of the country. The number of depositors has been growing rapidly and there
are now approximately 330,000 accounts. As of June 30, 1974, total deposits
in these accounts amounted to Tsh 69 million.
2.23      The East African Development Bank (EADB) was established in 1967.
It finances only industrial projects but no tourism or agricultural projects.
The World Bank provided EADB with a first line of credit of US$8.0 million
in 1972 and is presently considering a second loan. In 1974, EADB approved
3 projects for a total of Tsh 27.0 million in Tanzania, compared to 27 projects
for a total of Tsh 100 million by TIB. As of March 31, 1975, EADB's cumulative
disbursements in Tanzania amounted to Tsh 74.4 million, compared to Tsh 99.7
million for TIB. EADB's upper financing limit is Tsh 24.0 million and a large
part of its operations in Tanzania consist of large projects jointly financed
with TIB (3 of TIB's projects are also financed by EADB). EADB presently
charges an interest rate of 10% p.a. plus an appraisal fee of 1% (for projects
which are ultimately approved) and a commitment charge of 1% p.a.
2.24      The Tanganyika Development Company Ltd. (TDFL) was established in
1962 with a paid-in capital of Tsh 40 million. TDFL is equally owned by the
Government (through TIB) and three bilateral aid agencies (United Kingdom,
the Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands). TDFL's shareholders
have also subscribed Tsh 60 million of income notes. TDFL has played an im-
portant role in project promotion and financing of projects in the manufactur-
ing sector. In 1973, it approved 10 projects for Tsh 18.5 million. Forty
percent of TDFL's commitments are for equity investments. The future growth of
TDFL's operations is limited by resources constraints. Until recently TDFL
financed only private projects but TDFL has now changed its policies regarding
the financing of parastatals and is expected to do a few joint financings with
1/   Credit TA-495



TIB this year.  TDFL's maximum commitment to a single enterprise is 10% of
its net worth or Tsh 6 million. It currently charges 10-10.5% interest rate
plus 1% commission fee and a commitment fee of 1% per year.
Institutions for Industrial Promotion
2.25      To promote the development of small-scale industry, the Government
established in 1973 the Small Industries Development Organization (SIDO). So
far, SIDO has concentrated on extension services. It already has a staff of
150, half of whom are field officers. The other half consists of specialized
support staff in Dar es Salaam. SIDO planned activities include providing
technical and managerial consultancy services, establishing industrial estates,
conducting training programs, providing marketing services and supplying
machinery on a hire purchase basis. During its first year of operations, SIDO
made available machinery for Tsh 1 million. SIDO's plans are ambitious and
its success will largely depend on the quality of its staff. The proper
arrangements for financial support to small scale industries are still under
study. The Government has established a special fund of Tsh 5 million in TIB
for financing small scale industries (see para. 3.04).
2.26      The Industrial Development Center (Indcenter) is a UNIDO sponsored
institution to promote private and public industries. It started operations
in 1966 and has continuously been staffed by five UNIDO experts and five
Tanzanians. Indcenter has mainly made feasibility studies but has had little
success in getting them implemented. The Government plans to transform
Indcenter into a parastatal consultancy organization when the contract with
UNIDO expires.
III. THE INSTITUTION
Ownership and Functions
3.01      The Tanzania Investment Bank was established in November 1970 to
provide medium and long-term financing for industrial development, including
agricultural processing and tourism. By statute, TIB's share capital must
be owned proportionately by the Government (60%), the National Bank of Commerce
(30%), and the National Insurance Corporation (10%); both the National Bank of
Commerce and the National Insurance Corporation are wholly owned by the Govern-
ment. TIB's authorized capital is Tsh 200 million. The paid-in share capital
will be increased from Tsh 70 million to Tsh 100 million before December 31,
1975.
Type of Activities
3.02      According to TIB's Act, TIB can make medium- and long-term loans,
underwrite securities, guarantee debts, and invest in equity of enterprises.
So far TIB's financing has mostly consisted of loans. Under the three-tier
system parastatals are primarily responsible for project promotion, implemen-
tation and management through equity financing, while TIB is expected to



-9-
provide an independent check on these investments through its loan finiancing.
Many parastatal projects receive an equity allocation from the Government
before they apply for loan financing from TIB. To get TIB involved earlier
in projects, the Bank had recommended that TIB get more leeway in making
equity investments.  The Government has now amended the Act and raised the
limit for TIB's aggregate equity investments from 10% to 40% of TIB's net
worth. Meanwhile, TIB has been able to work more closely with its borrowers
w         and get involved in projects earlier than before.  TIB's Act also empowers
it to promote projects and provide technical assistance to its borrowers.
TIB has a special department for the latter functions (see para 3.17).
Administration of Agency Funds
3.03      TIB's Act and Statement of Policies require that TIB must follow
sound banking policies and finance only projects which are technically
feasible, financially viable and economically sound. Therefore, TIB is not
expected to finance unviable projects at its own risk. Because TIB operates
in a centrally planned economy, it may at times be asked to finance projects
that do not meet its normal lending criteria. For such operations, TIB can
use agency funds, which TIB administers on behalf of the Government; the
Government takes the risk on them and TIB receives an unconditional manage-
ment fee of 3/4% per quarter on the outstanding balance which is reasonable
in comparison with TIB's expenses.
Assistance to Small-Scale Industry
3.04      TIB has recently established a special fund for Small-Scale Indus-
tries. The initial contributions to the fund consist of a Tsh 5 million
grant from the Treasury and a DM 2 million (Tsh 5.8 million) grant from KfW.
To date, the smallest loan made by TIB was Tsh 300,000 (US$42,000) for a wheat
production scheme. Because it does not have a branch network, TIB intends,
at least initially, to limit its assistance for small enterprises to indus-
trial estates and areas where it has larger operations. TIB is also planning
to assist the District Development Corporations and Cooperatives in preparing
projects on a case-by-case basis. Unless TIB establishes a branch network,
it is unlikely to play a major role in the development of small industries.
For the time being this assistance can better be provided by TRDB in coopera-
tion with SIDO.
Investment and Financial Policies
3.05      TIB's statement of Investment and Financial Policy is provided in
Annex 3.  TIB's minimum commitment for TIB's normal operations is
Tsh 100,000 (US$14,000). Its maximum exposure in a single enterprise is 20%
of its own net worth (Tsh 127 million at present) as long as it does not exceed
75% of the total fixed investment costs of the project; normally, TIB does
not finance more than 60%.
3.06      Although TIB's appraisal includes a thorough analysis of the per-
manent working capital requirements of its clients, TIB does not as a practice



finance working capital.  According to the institutional set-up in i
the NBC is responsible for working capital financing. Especially in view of
substantial cost overruns, many projects have run into working capital
shortages. While these shortfalls have rarely been the only difficuLty, LIney
have added to the problems of many TIB clients. TIB will therefore before
committing itself to a project obtain assurances from NBC that working capital
financing will be available in appropriate amounts.
Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Risk
3.07      It is TIB's policy to charge a minimum lending rate which will subs-
tantially reflect the cost of capital in Tanzania. Recently TIB has raised its
minimum lending rate from 9% to 10% per year. This rate applies to all of
TIB's operations except for operations financed from special funds, which are
for specific purposes, such as small scale industry, and at concessionary
terms. TIB also charges an appraisal fee of 1% (for projects which are ultLi-
mately approved) and a commitment fee of 1% per year. Despite high inflation
in 1974 (28% measured by the Retail Price Index), the mission considers TIB's
lending rate adequate for the following reasons:
(i) The price increase during 1974, was largely due to the drought
which forced Tanzania to import food grains and sugar at very
high international prices. The Government has made vigorous
attempts to increase food production and inflation is expected
to decline to 10-15% in the next year and a lower rate there-
after. TIB's lending rate is expected to exceed the inflation
rate over the life of the loan;
(ii) TIB's lending rate is in line with other lending rates in
Tanzania. For instance, the Tanganyika Development Finance
Company charges 10-10 1/2% for medium- and long-term loans
and the National Bank of Commerce charges between 8 and 10%
on most overdrafts;
(iii) Tanzania has a high domestic savings rate. In 1973, domestic
savings amounted to 18% of GDP; in 1974, savings deposits with
the National Bank of Commerce increased by 19%. NBC's branch
network rather than the interest rate is considered the major
constraint on further increases in savings;
(iv) Interest rates play a relatively minor role in resource alloca-
tion in Tanzania's centrally planned economy with comprehensive
price controls and import licensing. Investment decisions are
only partially based on financial returns. Following the Bank's
advice, TIB uses the economic rate of return as the primary
criterion for project selection and a higher lending rate would
probably not change project selection.



3.08      Except for IDA-credit 460-TA and the loan from the African Deveiop-
ment Bank, all foreign loans have been passed on to TIB are denominaced in
Tanzanian Shillings.  TIB will also pass-on the foreign exchange risk on ttPe
proposed Bank loan to sub-borrowers.
Board of Directors
3.09      TIB's Board is chaired by the Managing Director, who is appointed
by the President, and has eight other members. Five of the members are
nominated by the Minister of Finance, two by the National Bank of Commerce
and one by the National Insurance Corporation. Annex 4 provides a list
of current Board members. They include the Principal Secretaries of Finance,
Economic Affairs and Development Planning, and Commerce and Industry. TIB's
Board meets bi-monthly and holds active discussions on policy matters and
all proposed projects. It has the sole power in approving loans and equity
investments and authorizing rescheduling.
Management
3.10      TIB's management consists of a Managing Director and a
General Manager. The Chairman and Managing Director is Mr. Mbowe.
He is a Director of several important parastatals, the East African Development
Bank and TDFL. He is responsible for policy matters and TIB's external
affairs. TIB's General Manager is appointed by the Minister of Finance and
is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Bank. Since the former
General Manager left last November, Mr. Mbowe has also acted in his capacity.
The Government plans to nominate a new General Manager, however.
3.11      TIB's management is assisted by two major committees:  a Loan
Committee and a Management Committee. The Loan Committee consists of the
General Manager, all Department Directors and a Legal Advisor. It meets
twice a month and decides on financing proposals submitted by the Ope-rations
and Development Planning Departments. No loans can be presented to Lhe
Board without clearance of the Committee. The Management Committee is chaired
by the General Manager and includes all Department Directors. The committee
makes rulings on all internal administrative matters. The same members
constitute five other committees: an appointment committee, a housing
committee, an education committee, a promotion committee and a committee on
the employment of expatriates.
Organization and Staff
3.12      TIB is organized along functional lines.  Annex 5 provides TIB's
Organization Chart, illustrating the Departments and professional staff in
each Department. TIB has four departments: Operations, Planning and
Development, Finance, and Administration and Legal. Tanzanians head all
these departments.



3.13      As of June 1975, TIB's total professional staff numbered          1   's,Cu
nine were expatriates.  While most of the expatriates are made avail-le. a
foreign aid, TIB must pay the Treasury the equivalent local salary. T11hi
an excellent training program for its staff (see para. 3.21), and is
active use of training program abroad; 3 officers will return from train_`   in '
1975.  While TIB has made marked improvement in strengthening its Taizarian
staff, it will continue to use expatriates in areas in which it lacks ex-
pertise. Several bilateral aid agencies have indicated their interest in
continuing such assistance, if requested.
3.14      The Operations Department is responsible for appraisal and follow-
up. It has a staff of 12, including 5 expatriates.
3.15      Appraisals.  The appraisal division has eight professionals, half
of whom are expatriates. The financial and economic analysis of TIB's
appraisals are good. TIB has no separate engineering department and
engineers form part of the appraisal teams. TIB's technical evaluations
are satisfactory. Despite TIB's good appraisals, several of TIB-assisted
projects have run into difficulty because the appraisal assumptions proved
to be wrong. To avoid similar cases in the future, TIB will more critically
review the projection assumptions and test the potential impact of cost
overruns, delays in implementation, and different product prices through
sensitivity analysis.
3.16      Follow-up Division.  TIB has commenced systematic follow-up activi-
ties. Management has recognized the paramount importance of this function in
view of the problems with TIB's increasing portfolio. The Division is tempo-
rarily headed by an expatriate and employs three Tanzanians with overseas
training. In view of the serious condition of the portfolio (see para 4.07)
TIB intends to further strengthen its follow-up role and to transform the
follow-up division into a separate department at an appropriate time in the
future.
3.17      The Development and Planning Department, which consists of 9
professional staff, including four expatriates, is primarily involved in
promoting projects. TIB has recently financed the first projects promoted
by this department and TIB expects that several will follow in the next
year. Given the similarity of staff in this department and the Operations
Department and in view of the manpower constraints and the shortage of
qualified Tanzanian staff in the Operations Department, TIB's management
intends to use the staff in this department flexibly.
3.18      Finance Department.  TIB's accounting and financial management,
which have been weak, have improved recently.  TIB plans to further strengthen
the Finance Department by recruiting an experienced financial analyst for it.
The bank has offered its assistance in finding a suitable candidate.
3.19      Internal Auditing Department.  TIB activated its internal auditing
function last September in response to the recommendation of the Tanzania Audit
Corporation. The department is headed by a qualified accountant, who reports



directly to the Chairman and Managing Director. The main tasks of the Deparc-
ment are:  (i) to strengthen the accounting system; (ii) to improve TIB's cash
flow management; and (iii) to identify and report weaknesses in operations of
various departments of TIB.
3.20      Administration Department.  This Department is in charge of adminis-
tering legal matters, the Board Secretariat, Personnel Management and General
Services.
3.21      Staff Development.  TIB has an excellent training program.  The
training is divided into two main phases. The initial training which takes
about one year and includes: on-the-job training with all departments in
TIB, a project appraisal course at the Institute of Finance Management in
Dar-es-Salaam, and on-the-job training with one of the parastatals. Once
a new recruit completes this initial training, he will be given professional
staff status. After spending a year with TIB, he can qualify for advanced
training overseas. TIB's training outlets overseas include: Arthur D.
Little (nine months), the Institute of Social Science in The Hague,
Netherlands, and other development finance companies, such as, ICICI and
PICIC. 1/ Ten of TIB's staff have already completed one or more of these
programs and five more are enrolled in them at present.
Procedures
3.22      Legal.  TIB's legal work is performed satisfactorily by the Tanzania
Legal Corporation, a Government legal services agency. Due to implementation
of a standard loan agreement and resolution of most issues before loan approval,
the time lag between the approvals and commitments has been reduced to an
average of 2 months. TIB's Board has also passed a resolution that TIB has
the right to cancel the loan if the loan agreements are not signed within six
months after the Board's approval. TIB's standard loan documents are
satisfactory.
3.23      Procurement and Disbursement.  Although TIB normally requires inter-
national tendering for all items above Tsh 100,000 (US$14,000), it may waive
this requirement if local contractors or suppliers are available. Procurement
procedures also require that TIB must be consulted before contracts for goods
or services to be financed by TIB are awarded. TIB's disbursement procedures
are adequate.
3.24      Audit.  By statute, TIB must be audited by the Tanzania Audit Corpo-
ration (TAC), which is owned by the Government. TIB's FY 1975 audit is
satisfactory. Compared to earlier audits, TIB's FY 1975 audit has improved
markedly because of improvement in TIB's accounting system and the re-
organization of TAC. TAC's new management has developed a comprehensive
1/   Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Ltd., and Pakistan
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation.



program to strengthen TAC by training its staff in Tanzania, Kenya, and
abroad, while employing expatriates in the meantime.  UNDP has agreed to
finance the program.
IV. RESOURCES, OPERATIONS, PORTFOLIO AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Resources
4.01      As of June 30, 1975, TIB's domestic resources consisted of its
paid-in share capital accumulated reserves (Tsh. 7.9 million) and grants from
the Government (Tsh 7.7 million) 1/. Foreign resources consisted of
Tsh. 212.2 million in untied funds from SIDA, ADB, IDA, KfW, CIDA and NORAD.
In addition, TIB had committed Tsh. 20.0 million of tied funds from CIDA,
the Netherlands and Finland. Annex 6 provides the amount, terms and conditions
of each foreign credit line. Except for the ADB loan and the IDA credit, all
foreign credit lines have been made to the Government and passed on in local
currency to TIB through the Umbrella Agreement. The ADB loan was made directly
to TIB; the IDA credit was passed on to TIB through a subsidiary loan agree-
ment.
Operations
4.02      TIB is now the principal institution for medium- and long-term
financing in Tanzania. TIB' s operations have increased rapidly. During
FY 1975, TIB approved loans for Tsh. 129 million, almost equalling the total
amount approved during the previous four years, and representiug 15% of total
parastatal investments of Tsh. 900 million.
4.03      A summary of TIB's operations since its inception is provided in
Annex 7. As of June 30, 1975, TIB had approved 79 loans for a total of
Tsh. 318 million and 8 equity investments for a total of Tsh. 10.6 million.
All approvals, except for Tsh. 19.8 million of cancellations, have been
committed. The time lag between approvals and commitments has declined to
an average of 2 months and is satisfactory. As of June 30, 1975, TIB's
total disbursements amounted to Tsh. 135 million. TIB's disbursement rate
has improved marginally. The main causes of the lag in disbursements are:
(i) the time lag in obtaining machinery from abroad; (ii) delays in implemen-
tation of projects due to building material shortages; and (iii) difficulties
in finding qualified management needed to implement the projects. TIB has
approved some loans before identifying management; it has now corrected this
and usually requires proper management arrangements before approving the
project and reserves the right to approve project management prior to dis-
bursing funds. TIB plans to further speed-up disbursements by improving its
follow-up during project implementation.
1/   In addition, TIB received Tsh. 41.7 million grants from SIDA.



- 15 -
4.04      Annex 8 provides a breakdown of TIB's loan approvals since its
inception by size, maturity, interest rates, economic activity and location.
The average size of loans has increased from Tsh. 1.7 million ($238,000) in
1971 to Tsh. 4.5 million ($629,000) in 1975; half of all approved loans are
for less than Tsh. 3.6 million ($500,000) but one fifth of the loans were
over Tsh. 7 million ($1 million) and accounted for half of the amount. The
average maturity is 9 years. The average interest rate is 9.2%, TIB charges
10% on new loans. Most TIB assisted projects use domestic raw materials.
The three most important subsectors were food and food processing (30%);
wood and wood processing (13%); and tanneries and leather processing (10%).
Other important subsectors were textile (6%), tourism (6%), and transport (12%).
TIB's loans were concentrated in 3 major urban areas: Dar es Salaam (37%);
Arusha (18%) and Mwanza (12%). This was mainly due to the pattern of infra-
structure development in Tanzania. TIB is making efforts, however, to
expand its activities throughout the country.
4.05      Annex 9 provides a list of all equity investments approved as of
June 30, 1975. The list includes seven equity investments totalling Tsh.
9.1 million, out of which Tsh. 6.4 million were disbursed. In addition,
TIB--with grants from the Treasury--has invested Tsh. 10 million in TDFL's
equity and Tsh. 7.9 million in its 8% income notes. Except for the interest
income from TDFL's income notes, TIB has to date not received any returns
from its equity investments. Three equity investments amounting to Tsh. 4.5
million (67% of equity portfolio excluding TDFL) are in companies with serious
problems. These enterprises are: Tanzania Navy Beans, National Engineering
Company, and Mtibwa Sugar (see para. 4.07 and Annex 11). Based on TIB's
present net worth, the aggregate limit of its equity investments is Tsh. 51.0
million.
4.06      Annex 10 provides a summary of key economic indicators of all
projects approved during the first 9 months of FY 1975. During the period,
TIB approved 16 loans to 15 enterprises for a total of Tsh. 79 million.
Nine loans were for new projects. TIB's loans accounted for 41% of total
-project costs of Tsh. 194 million. Based on TIB's appraisals, these invest-
ments will create 2,400 direct jobs at an investment cost per job of US$11,000
which is low.  Two-thirds of the projects are for import substitution.  All
except three projects use domestic raw materials. TIB estimated that the
export projects will generate annual exports of Tsh. 97 million. The
average estimated financial, rate of return is 19% and the economic rate of
return 31%. Forty percent of TIB's approvals were in the agro-industry. This
was in response to the Government's policy of increasing food production.
The other major sectors which received financing from TIB were textiles (13%),
tanneries and leather (11%), and wood products (5%). TIB made loans to a few
new sectors including metal products and construction.



TIB's Loan Portfolio 1/
4.07      As of June 30, 1975, TIB's loan portfolio consisted oL 37 proiecii
for a total of Tsh. 122 million.  Fifteen loans accounting for l'sh. > )i
million (53% of the portfolio) were in arrears over 3 moncihs. wo projects
accounting for 11% of the portfolio have settled their overdues since.
Annex 11 provides a detailed analysis o. TIB's portfolio, and a su=m'ary o,
the condition of all problem projects.  For the analysis, TIB's portfvliAL.
has been divided in the following four categories (amounts in Tsh. million):
No. of                    % of
Projects    Amount           total
A.   Operating companies in difficulty,
with uncertain prospects              5        23.1             18.9
B.   Operating companies in difficulty,
but with reasonable prospects        4         13.7             11.2
C.   Problem free operating companies   13            49.6            40.6
D.   Projects under construction           15         35.8            29.'
Total                      37       122.2            100.)
The projects in category A are all in arrears for more than three monoths.
They have generally technical as well as market problems, are overburdened
with short-term debt and have grim short-term prospects but may be salvaged
if appropriate action is taken. When necessary, TIB has taken the lead in
analyzing the problems of these clients and steps are being undertaken to
solve the problems of these companies. In this regard, it is useful that
TIB is represented on the Boards of most of its clients. Most of the projects
in Group B are in arrears and face problems in the short run, but h.ve
reasonable prospects. Nevertheless, TIB needs to watch them closely. Some
of the projects under implementation have potential problems; for Imost it
is too early to make a judgment on their prospects. TIB has analysed each
problem project and satisfactory actions to solve their problems are being
undertaken.
4.0      The problem projects were among the first to be approved by TIB.
Although TIB's appraisals have improved considerably since, the condition
of the portfolio highlights the need for TIB to review critically the pro-
jection assumptions and the technical aspects of the projects. TIB has
already started doing sensitivity analysis on the critical project variables.
1/   Paras. 4.07 to 4.08 deal with TIB's portfolio; the NBC portfolio is dealt
with in para. 4.09.



- 17 -
TIB is aware of the need to realistically assess whether the implementation
schedules, the contingency allowances and the capital structure are reasonable
in order to avoid shortages in working capital.
NBC Portfolio
4.09      In 1971, NBC's term portfolio, consisting of 37 outstanding loans
amounting to Tsh. 100.2 million, was transferred to TIB.  TIB purchased this
portfolio at face value for which it received a loan from NBC in an equal
amount.  TIB pays NBC 5-1/2% in interest plus a guarantee fee of 3/4 of 1%
on the outstanding balance.  In addition, NBC charges 1/16 of 1% on any
amount which it collects on TIB's behalf.  NBC guarantees the outstanding
loans unconditionally.  The average yield of the portfolio is 7-1/2%.  Thus,
TIB earns a spread of 1-1/4%. As of June 30, 1975, the NBC portfolio had
been reduced to 14 loans amounting to Tsh. 38.1 million. Five loans
amounting to Tsh. 24.2 million or 63% of the portfolio were in arrears for
more than three months. The loans include a Tsh. 20 million loan to
Serengeti Safari Lodge.
Financial Position
4.10      TIB's audited balance sheets are shown in Annex 12.  As of June 30,
1975, TIB's total assets amounted to Tsh. 265 million, including TIB's loan
portfolio (46%), TIB's equity portfolio (9%), current assets (30%) and the
NBC portfolio (14%). TIB is relatively liquid; it had Tsh. 74 million in
net current assets as of June 30, 1975. TIB's liquidity is due to the fact
that many of its creditors disburse to TIB when they approve a subproject
but before TIB needs the funds for disbursement to its clients. TIB's
financing consists of Tsh. 125 million of long-term debt (including the NBC
loan of Tsh. 38 million) and a net worth of Tsh. 127 million. Its long-term
debt/equity ratio including the NBC loan was 1.1:1. Since the NBC loan is
supported entirely by the unconditionally guaranteed NBC portfolio, it is
conservative to include the NBC loan in TIB's long-term debt. Excluding
the NBC loan, TIB's long-term debt/equity ratio is only 0.7:1 which is well
below the limit agreed with IDA of 3:1. Although the auditors consider TIB's
provisions of Tsh. 1.2 million adequate, they appear rather low in relation to
the size and condition of TIB's portfolio. However, TIB does not plan to
distribute dividends and TIB's general reserves together with provisions are
adequate to cover potential losses. TIB is therefore creditworthy.
Financial Results
4.11      Annex 13 provides TIB's income statements, and Annex 14 shows some
selected financial ratios. In FY 1975, TIB earned Tsh. 3 million, or 3.4%
on its average net worth, compared with Tsh. 1.2 million in FY 1974. Interest
income from the NBC portfolio, which accounted for 75% of total income in
1971, now accounts for only one fourth of TIB's revenue. Administrative
expenses as percentage of average total assets declined from 2.0% in FY 1974
to 1.6% in FY 1975. This is reasonable.

V. PROSPECTS
TIB's Operational Strategy
5.01      In line with the Government's intention to increase investment in
the productive sectors, TIB plans to continue expanding its lending operations.
Through further improvement of its relations with parastatals, TIB expects to
become involved earlier in parastatal investments and enhance its role in
developing projects. TIB expects that its promotional efforts, which started
a few years ago, will soon bear fruits. By strengthening portfolio supervi-
sion, TIB plans to play a constructive role in improving the problem projects
in its portfolio. TIB is keen to support the Government's plans for small-
scale industry and intends to gain experience in this field by financing small
industries in selected areas. To achieve these ambitious objectives, TIB will
further strengthen its staff and reduce its dependence on expatriates by
continued training.
Business Outlook
5.02      Many promising investment opportunities in the industrial sector
exist. In 1974, an industrial sector mission of the Bank 1/ identified a
large number of projects with a total investment cost of Tsh 7 billion. The
projects belonged to various sub-sectors in which Tanzania can be competitive,
such as sugar processing, textiles, leather processing, pulp and paper, wood
working, cashewnut processing, sisal spinning and cement. In the past, the
limited capacity of most parastatals to make detailed feasibility and engineer-
ing studies has constrained project development. The parastatal capacity has
improved and, in the future, project development will also be aided by the
establishment of a parastatal consultancy firm (see para. 2.26) and a pro-
posed IDA project to finance feasibility and engineering studies of industrial
projects by foreign consultants.
5.03      Given (i) the shift in Government emphasis to the productive sectors,
particularly manufacturing, mining and agro-industry; (ii) the availability
of potential projects; (iii) the improved capacity of parastatals to develop
and implement projects; (iv) the emergence of District Development Corpora-
tions 2/ as a new class of borrowers; and (v) TIB's increased ability to
appraise projects, TIB's business prospects are good. In June 1975, the
Government and TANU 3/ agreed to postpone the third 5-year plan (July 1,
1/ See Tanzania: Industrial and Mining Sector Survey, Report No. 647-TA,
March 31, 1975.
2/ In 1974, as a part of its decentralization policy, the Government estab-
lished development corporations in each district of the country.

- l9 -
1975 - June 30, 1980) because of financial constraints. In turn, an annual
plan aimed at increasing production and improving the efficiency of existing
operations has been launched. The 1976 plan envisages total expenditures
of Tsh 6.2 billion out of which Tsh 2.7 billion or 44% are developmental
expenditures. Parastatal organizations, mainly in the manufacturing, mining
and agricultural sectors, would receive Tsh 958 million (US$134 million), or
35X of total developmental expenditures. TIB is expected to finance between
15-20% of these new investments. TIB may also administer a substantial
amount of developmental expenditures on behalf of the Government.
5.04      As of June 30, 1975, TIB's project pipeline consisted of 20 projects
with total costs amounting to Tsh. 541 million, out of which TIB expected
to provide about Tsh. 156 million. Annex 15 provides a list of these projects.
TIB approved 3 projects amounting to Tsh. 30 million from this pipeline
in August. The projects appear well conceived and cover various sub-sectors
including textile, food processing, wood products, chemicals and small-scale
industries. All except two of the projects are for import substitution.
Nine of the projects are new. Typically, TIB's financing is matched by new
equity provided by the Government through budget allocations. One large
project (cashewnuts) is co-financed by the Bank and the Government who will
provide together Tsh. 208 million. Two other projects are expected to be
co-financed by TDFL. Three new projects are private. TIB expects to approve
all projects in FY 1976.
Resource Requirements
5.05      TIB's projected operations during the next five years and the
underlying assumptions are provided in Annexes 16 and 17. TIB expects to
approve Tsh. 160 million in FY 1976, Tsh. 200 million in FY 1977, and
Tsh. 240 million in FY 1978. For the larger projects TIB's financing will
have to be supplemented by financings from EADB and TDFL. Given TIB's pipe-
line and the Government's emphasis on expansion of the industrial sector,
the projected operations are reasonable, provided TIB has adequate resources.
Its resources requirements until December 31, 1977 and the proposed financing
plan are as follows (amounts in Tsh. million):

expenditures.
5.06      TIB needs Tsh. 475 million (US$66.5 million) to cover its commit-
ments until December 31, 1977. Out of this amount, Tsh. 315 million or about
67% would be needed for foreign expenditures. As of July 1, 1975, Tsh. 43
million of foreign resources was still available for new commitments while
uncommitted approvals were Tsh. 51 million. TIB's foreign donors and creditors,
including CIDA, SIDA, NORAD, KfW, and ADB, have indicated their willingness
to provide a total sum of Tsh. 225 million to cover TIB's requirements until
1978. Assuming that TIB can use 25% of new foreign resources for local costs,
TIB remaining foreign resource gap would be Tsh 107 million (US$15 million).
It is proposed that the Bank cover this gap with a $15 million loan. The Bank
loan would meet 23% of TIB total resource requirements.
Projected Financial Results
5.08      Annex 18 provides TIB's projected balance sheets.  TIB's total
assets are expected to increase from Tsh. 265 million at the end of FY 1975
to Tsh. 931 million in FY 1980, reflecting the envisaged growth of TIB's
operations. TIB's long-term debt/equity ratio is expected to remain below
3:1 until FY 1980 when it will climb to 3.2:1. Even if forecast collections



- 21 -
are reduced to allow for sizeable reschedulings. TIB's debt service coverage
is estimated to remain above 3 throughout the projection period.
5.09      TIB's projected income statements and changes in TIB's financial
position are shown in Annexes 19 and 2(. Annex 14 shows relevant financial
ratios. The projections show that TIB's profits after tax are expected to
increase to Tsh. 18.1 million in FY 1980. The figures allow for increases
in provisions equal to 3% of new disbursements. Provisions would increase
to 2.5% of the outstanding loan and equity portfolio in FY 1980. Net
profit as a percentage of average net worth is estimated to increase from
3.4% in FY1975 to 8.7% in FY 1980.   The projected improvement in TIB's
profitability is due to: (i) a substantial increase in TIB's portfolio and
leverage; (ii) an increase in spread between the cost of borrowed funds and
the yield on loans; (iii) economies of scale reflected in lower administrative
costs as percentage of average total assets. Administrative expenses as
percentage of total assets are expected to decline from 1.6% in FY 1975 to
1.0% in FY 1980, which is reasonable.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMMNDATIONS
6.01      TIB has become the major institution for medium and long-term
financing of industry, large-scale agriculture and tourism. Its top manage-
ment is able and influential. Its staff has improved considerably and
Tanzanians now occupy all management positions. The quality of its appraisals
is good and systematic follow-up activities have started. Its volume of
operations has increased sharply and now accounts for about 20% of new indus-
trial investments. Because of its improved relations with parastatals and
its increased appraisal capacity, TIB is becoming more influential in develop-
ing and selecting parastatal investment projects.
6.02      To alleviate Tanzania's severe economic problems, resulting from
increases in petroleum prices and stagnation in the agricultural sector,
the Government has given priority to industry for future investments. A Bank
industrial sector mission has identified a large number of promising invest-
ment opportunities. Given the improved capacity of parastatals to develop
and implement projects and TIB's increased ability to appraise them, TIB's
business prospects are good.
6.03      TIB's major problem is the condition of its portfolio.  During
negotiations, TIB has outlined a satisfactory plan of actions it intends to
take to solve the problems of the most troublesome projects.
6.04      Taking into account expected funds from other creditors, TIB needs
Tsh 107 million in foreign resources to cover its projected commitments until
the end of 1977. A Bank loan of $15 million is recommended. The loan would
fill TIB's remaining foreign resources gap and cover 23% of TIB's commitments
until December 31, 1977. TIB's plans to obtain local resources are adequate.



- 22 -
6.n0      The objective of the proposed loan is to support the Government in
its plans to increase productive investment, especially in industry.  It wi-
also enable the Bank to help TIB further improve its procedures and project
selection.
6.06      The proposed loan will finance thie cif cost of imported goods arin
the estimated import component of civIl works and imported goods purchased
in Tanzania. It will be repaid according to a flexible amortization schedJule,
conforming to the aggregate amortization schedules of TIB's subloans, whic!'
have a maximum maturity of 15 years. TIB will need the Bank's prior approval
of each project using $400,000 or more of the proposed loan and will not fie
able to use more than $3 million in total without the Bank's approval.  711B
will on-lend the proceeds of the loan at a minimum interest rate of 10% with
the foreign exchange risk being borne by the subborrower.

TIB'S STATEMENT OF
INVESTMENT AD FINANCIAL POLICY
The Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB) was created by an Act of the
Tanzania National Assembly which came into effect on November 16, 1970.
The Objects of the Bank
TIB will extend its assistance on the basis of national priorities
for economic and social development as laid down in the current and future
national development plans. In this respect, TIB will:
(a) make available long and medium term finance for:
(i) the development of manufacturing, assembly
and processing industries including industries
engaged in the processing of products of agri-
culture, forestry or fishing;
(ii) the development of engineering, construction,
transport, tourist and mining industries; and
(iii) the development of large-scale corporate agricul-
ture, ranching, forestry and fishing.
(b) provide technical assistance and advice for the purpose of
promoting industrial development;
(c) administer such special funds as may from time to time be
placed at the disposal of the Bank; and
(d) undertake such other activities as may be necessary or
advantageous for the purpose of furthering the foregoing
objectives.
A.   General Policy
1.  As a national development institution, TIB will lend its
assistance to the development of soundly managed enterprises
in the United Republic of Tanzania in all the sectors of the
economy specified in the Act.
2.   TIB will extend its assistance on the basis of national
priorities for economic and social development as laid down
in the current and future development plans. TIB will only
finance projects which are technically feasible and economically
sound and financially viable. TIB's economic evaluation will



Page 2 o` 7
take irnto account, among others, the foreign excaiange savirgs
or earnings, the develop.ment of manpower skille, employment
opportunities and the spread effects on the rest of the
economy, as well as the effect on government budget.
3.   TIB will in the framewotl. of the national development
strategy give priority to public sector projects.
4.   TIB will not subsidize znterprises or projects whether
in the public or pri-vate sector. In the case of projects
which are less than financ'Lally viable the decision on their
implementation because of tr.e overall development effect,
should be taken by the national planning authorities with
appropriate recommendations for Government subsidies.
5.   TIB will prepare broader studies of the sectors where
importarnt applications for TIB finiancing are on hand or
expe2ted In order to ensure a thorough and comprehensive
e7aluatiovi of such applications.  It will also prepare such
other studies which will facilitate the analysis of TIB's
-ole in the development policy of the country and which will
make TIB an active partner in. the national planning effort.
6.   TIB will take the lead in identifying and appropriately
publicizing investment opportunities in all the productive
sectors of the econo-iy. It will, where appropriate, extend
technical assistance and adiice to its clients in matters
of project planning, organization and financing. It will
also place emphasis on the tise of suitable modern management
techniques amrong its customers.
7. All ap,pl!Lcations for TIB assistance must be formerlly submitted
to it In writing through the applicants' Board of Directors.
All applications must be accompanied by written confirmations
of rele-vant Ministries that the project in question is in line
with national development objectives.
B.   Inves ment ?olicy
1.   rIB wiAl grant mediun and long term loans whose terms and condi-
Lions, sutcc <*s re;nayment periods, interest rates, commitment
fees, and g,ricc periods, will vary with the requirements of
each .roi(eat. taking into account relevant Government policies
as well, fit tkill also invest in the share capital of enter-
prises, n.Jerwrite securities and guarantee debts as appro-
Priate.



ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 7
2.   TIB's financially assistance from the ordinary resources will
not normally amount to less than Shs. 100,000. However, TIB
will be prepared to consider requests for financing of projects
which, although requiring a smaller amount, nevertheless
present a definite economic interest.
3.   TIB will seek to diversify its portfolio in order to maintain
a reasonable level of risk. In this respect and as a general
rule the total outstanding commitments granted by TIB on its
ordinary resources in favour of a single project shall not
exceed 75% of the value of the total investment in fixed
assets and capitalized services (i.e., excluding current
assets/working capital). This means that TIB can wholly
finance a project which is an extension, provided the total
involved does not exceed 75% of the total fixed investment
programme. Under normal circumstances a figure of 60% shall
be an acceptable target.
4.   As a rule, the total outstanding commitments granted by TIB
in favour of a single project shall not exceed 20% of TIB's
net worth.
5.   The restrictions laid down in paragraphs (3) and (4) above may
be waived in cases where TIB is acting as a trustee, on behalf
of the Government or one of its agencies, for the channelling
of foreign funds to a specific project and where TIB's liability
towards the foreign agency or lender is fully and unconditionally
covered by a guarantee from the Government or the agency con-
cerned.
6.   Under normal circumstances, TIB's total investments in the form
of equity participation may not exceed 40% of its paid in share
capital, unimpaired reserves and grants.
7.   TIB will not grant loans for the purpose of refinancing projects.
8.   In principle, TIB will participate in the financing of such
projects only where the procurement of plant and machinery,
contractors and services is made by way of the most widely
spread tenders. As a rule, international tendering will be
required, but in cases where local contractors or suppliers
are available, local tenders may be considered sufficient.
At all events procurement of goods and services or the award
of contracts for the total or partial financing for which
TIB's assistance is being sought must not take place before
or without the Bank having been consulted by the applicant or
project promoter. The Bank will also require minutes of meetings
of boards or committees where offers have been discussed and



ANN`X 3
Page 4 of 7
decisions taken with respect to suppliers, contractors, etc.
Such decisions must be well documented in a comparison of the
various offers received and all reasons for the choices made
must be given therein.
9.   In cases of single items constituting the object of TIB's
financing, and whose value does not exceed Tshs. 100,000 per
item, a reasonable number of different proforma invoices from
various suppliers may be accepted by the Bank instead of a full
tender. For the selection process the last sentence of para. 8
above applies.
10.   TIB will not finance infrastructure projects such as roads,
buildings, etc. except insofar as such infrastructure is
required as part of a project which does come within TIB's
terms of reference.
11. Where appropriate TIB will join with other financing institu-
tions, local or foreign, in financing projects.
12.   TIB will endeavor to maintain a well-balanced loan portfolio
by distributing its commitments--i.e., loans, guarantees and
participations--prudently among the sectors of the economy
falling within the range of its objects.
C.   Financial Policy
1.   It will be the general aim of TIB's financial policy of maintain
the value of its own capital, to manage its funds in such a way
that it is at all times able to honor its obligations and to
achieve a profit margin that enables it to cover its operating
costs, build up adequate provisions and reserves, and remunerate
its share capital.
2.   TIB will maintain a satisfactory balance between the maturities
of its own obligations and those of the loans it grants.
3.   In cases where loans are made in currencies other than Tanzanian
Shillings, TIB will not accept any exchange risks. This will
have to be borne by the borrower or by the Government.
4.   The minimum interest rate charged by TIB will substantially
reflect the cost of capital in Tanzania, but will normally not
be less than 10%.
5.   In addition to interest, TIB shall charge a commission of 1%
on the total loan at the time of first disbursement.
6.   A commission in terms of a percentage of outstanding loans or
participation amounts will be charged in return for particular



ANNE" 3
Page 5 o r7
and specified services, such as one time or continuous provision
of technical assistance by TIB (organizational, planning) or the
negotiations and arrangement of finance from other sources.
The size of the commission will have to depend on the work and
effort involved for TIB, it should, however, normally not exceed
2% of the amount upon which it is charged.
7.   The fee to be charged by TIB for the granting of a guarantee
to a supplier or tenderer will depend on the nature of the
project, the general present and expected future standing of
the borrower's business, the extent of the commitment entered
into, the size of the amount guaranteed and the duration of
the guarantee commitment. It will normally not be less than
1-1/2% p.a. on outstanding amounts.
8.   On all loans a commitment fee will be charged at the uniform
rate of 1% p.a. on committed but undisbursed balances. Such
commitment fee will accrue from the date of the completed
signing of the loan agreement, but not later than from a date
30 days after receipt by the Borrower of the Bank's written
decision to grant the loan.
9.   The maximum term of a loan or guarantee will be 15 years counted
from the date of the loan agreement until the date of the last
repayment instalment. The maximum grace period--with interest
due and payable--will be five years counted from the date of
the loan agreement. The validity of Board's approval for each
loan shall not exceed 6 (six) months counting from the date on
which the decision was made.
10.   All charges, i.e., legal fees, bank charges and commissions
and all appraisal costs other than those normally incurred by
the Bank, will constitute recoverable items of expenditure under
the application and the loan agreement.
11.   TIB will seek adequate security for its lendings, such as
debentures, mortgages, promissory notes and guarantees. The
kind and amount of security required will depend on the nature
of the assets charged as to their degree of liquidity, the
standing of the guarantors and other considerations having
regard to the future expectations from a project.
12.   In addition TIB will, in full awareness of the relative value
of any type of classical security (except for a first-class
guarantee) under present circumstances, incorporate in its
loan or guarantee agreements all those conditions which in the
Bank's opinion are designed to improve the borrower's manage-
ment and organizational set-up with a view to improved project
viability. Areas of consideration in this respect will be



^AENNX 3
Page 6 otf 7
(a) the selection of plant and equipment, (b) plant location,
(c) technical organization, (d) cost accounting, (e) product
mix, (f) marketing and (g) financial policies, procedures and
practices.
13.   The Borrower has the right, upon not less than 30 days notice
and upon payment of all accrued interest, commitment fees,
charges and commissions to repay all or any installments of
the loan in advance of maturities, provided that 25% of the
amoung of the interest saved by the borrower through such
repayment in advance shall be paid to the Bank as a premium.
14.   Under certain specified conditions such as failure to make repay-
ments or non-fulfillment of loan conditions, the Bank may, by
notice to the Borrower, suspend wholly or in part the right of
the Borrower to disbursements from the loan account.
15.   TIB will make adequate provisions against potential losses
and build up reserves to a level consistent with sound financial
practices, taking into account the size and quality of its
portfolio of loans and investments as well as the need to pay
adequate dividends to shareholders.
16.   Whenever it considers it necessary to broaden its own facilities
for operations, TIB will obtain funds locally or abroad by the
issue of bond loans and/or by entering into loan agreements.
In this connection, the Bank will follow a prudent policy as
far as debt acquisition is concerned.
D.   Relationship with Enterprises Financed
1.   TIB will not seek by the making of equity investments, to
obtain a controlling interest in a project or enterprise.
It will also generally avoid assuming management responsi-
bilities in such projects or enterprises. This will not,
however, preclude TIB from requiring membership on the Board
of Directors of any or all enterprises in which it has
outstanding loans or guarantee arrangements or in which it
has equity participation.
2.   When deciding upon the amount and the form of financial
assistance it will provide, TIB will take into account all
the financial requirements of the project and the general
financial situation of the borrowers in question.
3.   In accordance with normal banking practices, TIB will
require its borrowers to provide and to maintain adequate
security, to keep records and accounts in accordance with



AXNNX 3
Page 7 of 7
sound accounting practices and to furnish whatever informa-
tion on their operations and accounts TIB deems desirable.
TIB will have the right to inspect the enterprises it finances
as well as their operations and accounts.
4.   Business secrets and other information furnished by applicants
or clients will be treated as confidential by TIB.

2.        The projects in category A are all in arrears for more than three
months, have generally technical as well as market problems are overburdened
with short-term debt and have grim short-term prospects, but may be salvaged
if appropriate action is taken. Most of the projects in category B are in
arrears for more than three months, but have reasonable prospects. Some of
the projects under implementation have potential problems in particular cost
overruns; for most it is too early to make a judgement on their prospects.
3.        Following are summaries of the conditions of projects in categories
A and B. Figures appearing before the description of the projects, are as of
June 30, 1975, and "arrears" indicate obligations overdue for more than 3 months.
A.   Operating Companies in Difficulty, with Uncertain Prospects:
Mtibwa Sugar Estates Ltd.
TIB's equity investment              :   Tsh 3.34 million
Percentage of share capital          :    6.8%
Undisbursed equity commitments            Tsh 160,000
TIB's loans outstanding              :   Tsh 7 million
Percentage of TIB's loan portfolio        7.7%
Undisbursed loan commitments         :   None
Arrears                              :   Tsh 1.1 million in interest
Other long-term loans outstanding  :   Tsh 10 million from EADB;
Tsh 3 million from TDFL
4.        Mtibwa accounts for 10% of the Tanzanian sugar production.  The
company has a weak capital structure (debt/equity ratio of 5.1) and needs
badly an increase in working capital (current ratio 0.5). The reasons for
its problems have been: (i) high indirect taxes (64% of wholesale price),
(ii) drought and low yields, (iii) bottlenecks in the factory and (iv) lack
of effective management.
5.        To alleviate Mtibwa's immediate problems the following measures have
been taken: (i) the ex-factory price has been increased from Tsh 1,630/ton to
Tsh 2,140/ton, (ii) equity has been increased by Tsh 27 million to remove
bottlenecks in the factory and to provide for some irrigation, and (iii) HVA
of Holland has been engaged to manage the company and to study the necessary
rehabilitation of the factory and fields.
6.        To solve Mtibwa's problems in the long run, the fields, factory
and transport equipment should be rehabilitated and an irrigation system
should be constructed. HVA has estimated preliminary a cost of Tsh 110
million. The Danish Government is considering to finance the irrigation
program; the rest of the financing will have to come from new equity and
long-term loans. A financing program should be prepared soon by TIB and the
Sugar Development Corporation.

7.        Since Tanzania is presently a net irporter of sugar and iS :acin`
severe balance of payments problems, it is in the country's interest to
salvage Mtibwa sugar.
Fibreboard Africa Ltd.
TIB loans outstanding                     Tsh 6 million
Percentage of TIB's portfolio             4.9%
Undisbursed commitment                    Tsh 2 million
Arrears                                   Tsh 290,000 in interest
Other long-term debt                      Tsh 6 million from EADB
8.        The company, which produces fibreboard, has had managerial, tech-
nical, and marketing problems since the beginning. Due to technical problems,
the plant has operated far below capacity (45% in 1974), and the poor product
quality has caused marketing problems. As of December 31, 1974, the company's
accumulated losses amounted to Tsh 9.5 million (73% of share capital) and the
D/E ratio was 5.9. The company can only be salvaged if bottlenecks of the
existing plant are removed and if the company is financially restructured.
To solve the technical problems, Tsh 4 million must be invested in additional
equipment and vital spare parts. TIB has granted an additional loan of Tsh 2
million and TWICO has provided Tsh 1 million more. To alleviate the company's
working capital problems, NBC is considering to convert its Tsh 3.5 million
overdraft into a medium-term loan and EADB has been requested to reschedule
its Tsh 6 million loan. One of Fibreboard's problems has been that T'WICO
handled the marketing and controled the sales receipts. TWICO has now given
Fibreboard automy in its marketing.  Also, the company has arranged a manage-
ment contract with a reputable Finnish firm.
Nyanza Salt Mines Ltd.
TIB loan outstanding                      Tsh 4.5 million
Percentage of TIB's loan portfolio        3.7%
Undisbursed commitments                   None
Arrears                                   Tsh 400,000 in interest
Other long-term debt                      Tsh 14.2 million from EADB
9.        The company produces salt from an old thermal plant and a newly-
installed solar plant. The thermal plant operates at full capacity and is
profitable. Due to technical problems, the solar plant produces only 2,000
tons/year compared to full capacity of 60,000 tons/year. High overheads and
high variable costs, due to continuous breakdowns, have caused losses in
recent years. As of December 31, 1974, accumulated losses amounted to Tsh
5.2 million, offsetting most reserves; the debt equity ratio was 5.7 and the
current ratio only 0.77. To eliminate technical bottlenecks, Tsh 2.2 million
are needed for completion of the crystallizer section of the solar plant and
increasing the pumping capacity. If work on the solar plant starts now, it
can be completed by mid-1976.



Page 5 of 8
10.       Recently, the price of salt has been increased from Tsh 370/ton to
Tsh 535/ton. Despite the higher price, local sales have increased. With
the new price, the company expects to have a positive cash flow of Tsh 1.5
million. This would allow the company to increase its current ratio to 1
(by paying off current liabilities), but still would be insufficient to
finance the additional investments needed (Tsh 2.2 million). TIB has agreed
to provide Tsh 2 million in preferred shares if the parent company provides
some additional equity to further alleviate working capital shortages. TIB
will also prspose E&DB to reschedule its Tsh 14 million loan,
Tanzania Navy Beans Ltd. (TNBL)
TIB loans outstanding                     :   Tsh 3.8 million
Percentage of TIB's loan portfolio             3.1%
UIndisbursed conmitments                  :   Tsh 8.1 million
Arrears                                   :   Tsh 400,000 in principal
and Tsh 135,000 in interest
TIB equity investment                     :   Tsh 200,000
Percentage of share capital               :    8.7%
11.       The company, which is wholly-owned by the National Agricultural
Food Corporation (NAFCO), grows, buys, and processes navy beans for exports.
TNBL is in a very difficult situation due to low production yields and lack
of export markets. Average production costs are 1.7 times the present inter-
national price of processed beans, and expected losses for 1975 are Tsh 3.4
million. These losses will further weaken the financial condition of the
company. As of December 31, 1974, the company's current ratio was 0.75 and
its paid-in share capital was completely wiped out by accumulated losses.
12.       TIB has approved a Tsh 10.7 million loan to finance an increase in
the company's nucleus farms and factory capacity. Because of the marketing
problems, high production costs and large cost overruns of the expansion
program (Tsh 24 million compared to the original estimate of Tsh 12 million).
TIB has suspended disbursements and is reappraising the project. As part of
the reappraisal, TIB plans to study the feasibility of a canning plant to pro-
cess some of the beans. The company is also actively pursuing export possi-
bilities which will greatly depend on the harvest of beans in other parts of
the world.

Although NECO has a good market, it is presently facing a serious crisis due

to lack of management. Besides new management, the company needs technlca!
personnel and a financial restructuring:
(1) The present management, whose share in the company's equity has
declined from 100% to 27%, has lost interest in the company. The other share-
holders of the company are the Workers Development Corporation (40%) and TIB
(33%). The National Development Corporation (NDC) is presently considering
to take over the remaining shares of the former owners. The machinery that
was financed by TIB, arrived a long time ago, but has not yet been installed,
due to the management problems. It will probably be difficult to find proper
management until the future ownership of the company has been clarified.
(2) In the last two years, NECO lost the eight top technical staff
(including the Chief Accountant, the Structural Engineer, the Pattern
Engineer, and the Foundry Engineer), probably due to the new income tax system
in the country. Recently, the company has recruited a qualified chief account-
ant and structural engineer and a new General Manager has been designated.
The company also has obtained foreign aid for recruitment and financing of a
pattern maker and a foundry engineer.
(3) Although accounts for 1974 are not available, the company is known
to have financial problems. Overdrafts with NBC are exceeding Tsh 1.2 million
and shortages of working capital prevents the company from acquiring enough
raw materials.
B.   Operating Companies in difficulty, but with reasonable prospects
National Cold Chain Operations (NCCO)
TIB loans outstanding                           :   Tsh 6.9 million
Percentage of TIB's loan portfolio                   5.6%
Undisbursed commitments                         :   Tsh 3 million
Arrears                                              Tsh 60,000 in interest
14.       The company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the National Agricultural
Food Corporation (NAFCO), started a project in 1973 to transport frozen and
refrigerated goods, especially New Zealand meat, to Zambia.  NCCO's main
problem is the lack of markets. Export operations failed, because Zambia
is importing meat from Botswana at a lower price than the New Zealand meat
ara with higher quality than the Tanzanian meat. Therefore, NCCO's opera-
tion~. are based on relatively small fish exports and domestic distribution of
fruits and vegetables.
15.       Althou2li the Present financial position of the company is still
reasonable, it could deteriorate if new markets are not found. In 1974,
revenues were Tsh 9.5 million and losses Tsh 1.5 million. However with
depreciation of Tsh 1.6 million, NCCO broke even on a cash basis. As of
March 31, 1975, accumulated losses amounted to Tsh 2 million (13% of paid-in
share capital), but the debt/equity ratio (0.54), and the current ratio
(1.06) are still reasonable.

16.       NCC0 has contracted new management (a Dutch firm) to develop new
operations and new markets. It has prepared an expansion program, with
a total cost of Tsh 32 million, and has requested TIB for a new loan of Tsh
16.5 million. TIB should appraise critically whether new markets will be
available, and how the expansion program will solve the existing problems
of NCCO.
he             Dar Es Salaam Motor Transport Co. (UDA)
NBC po
TIB loans outstanding                     :   Tsh 5.6 million
Percentage of TIB's loan portfolio        :   4.6%
Undisbursed commitments                   .   Tsh 1.87 million
Arrears                                   :   Tsh 1.4 million in principal
17.       UDA provides bus services in Dar es Salaam.  The company has not
met its obligations with TIB. In 1974, UDA lost Tsh. 3.9 million, because
operating costs kept increasing while fares were fixed by the Government, and
because UDA's fare collection system is poor. Although the cash flow was
positive (depreciation amounted to more than Tsh 5 million), UDA did not pay
TIB, because available funds were used to complete a new maintenance workshop.
18.       The prospects for the company seem reasonable, because:  (i) In
September 1974, fares were doubled, and UDA during the last two months of
1974 made profits of Tsh 800,000 per month; (2) the company was reorganized
in a more appropriate way: the rural and country services were transferred
to another company (Kamota), and UDA will serve only urban areas; (3) a new
manager was appointed in May 1975; (4) in a few months the construction of
the workshop will be completed which will improve the maintenance of the
buses. If the company improves its fare collection system and is able to
maintain the level of profits at Tsh 800,000 per month, as in the last two
months of 1974, it will be able to repay TIB. UDA, therefore, seems to have
reasonable prospects.
Mwananchi Construction Company (MECCO)
TIB loans outstanding                     :   Tsh 734,000
Percentage of TIB's portfolio             :   0.6%
Undisbursed commitments                   :   Tsh 6.8 million
Arrears                                   :   None
19.       NECCO is a construction company wholly owned by the Ministry of
Works that started having losses in 1971 and faced a serious crisis at the
end of 1973. In 1974, the Ministry of Works, decided to restructure MECCO
financially: the NBC overdraft was converted into equity (Tsh 18.5 million),
additional equity was invested by the Ministry (Tsh 10.0 million), and a loan
of Tsh 7.5 million was approved by TIB to finance MECCO's expansion program.
The company is still in a difficult situation, however, because of market and
management problems: (i) Markets for NECCO are tight as a result of the low
priority given by the Government to building construction, and because a new



' hNEX   S
Page & of 8
company (TECCO, a joint venture between the Tanzanian Government and a
Yugoslavian firm) with enter the market, reducing MECCO's work volume. To
meet this problem, MECCO intends to change from constructing buildings to
water and sewerage projects; (ii) MECCO lost three managers in March 1975 and
will lose three expatriate engineers by September 1975. The accounting system
is poor, and no financial accounts for 1974 were available in June 1975.
20.       During 11974, MECCO lost Tsh 6 million and during 1975 losses may
continue, due to the low volume of contracts. The prospects of MECCO are
poor, unless the Ministry of Works supports the company by increasing the
volume of contracts. TIB has disbursed only a small portion of its committed
loan and, in its own interest, should review the market and management problems
of the company to determine whether MECCO's expansion project is still profit-
able under the new conditions.
Tembo Chipboards
TIB loans outstanding                          :   Tsh 479,000
Percentage of TIB's loan portfolio                  0.5%
Undisbursed commitments                        :   None
Arrears                                        :   Tsh 400,000 in principal
21.       The company produces timber and chipboards for the domestic and
export markets. Tembo Chipboards had production problems due to shortage
of imported chemicals, lack of spare parts and frequent power cuts. The
company was in a tight liquidity position and was not able to repay its
obligations to TIB. However, bottlenecks have been removed and during 1974,
the company increased sales of timber and chipboards by 50%. Around 60% of
chipboards were exported, and the market potential seems good for the company.
Financial accounts for 1974 were not available, but given the increase in
production and exports, it is expected that Tembo Chipboards is operating
profitably. However, TIB should verify this and determine whether the company
can start repayments.
