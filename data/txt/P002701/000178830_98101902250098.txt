REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
TANZANIA INVESTMENT BANK
WITH THE GURANTEE OF THE
UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Tanzania Investment Bank with the guarantee of the United
Republic of Tanzania for the equivalent of US$15 million to help ifinance
the foreign exchange component of investments of this development finance
company in Tanzania. The interest on the loan would be 8-1/2% per annum.
Amortization will conform substantially to the aggregate of the amaortization
schedules applicable to the specific investment projects financed out of the
proceeds of the loan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       The last full economic report on Tanzania (AE-26) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on May 22 and June 22, 1972. This was followed
by an Economic Updating Report (30-TA) distributed on December 11, 1972. A
basic economic mission is scheduled for 1976. An agricultural sector report
was issued on December 10, 1974. An industry and mining sector report and a
report on the fiscal aspects of Tanzania's recent decentralization of Govern-
ment were distributed in April 1975.   The Consultative Group for East Africa
met in April 1975 to discuss the progress and prospects of the Tanzanian
economy and the need for additional resources to support the Government's
development program. Country data are provided in Annex 1. Tanzania is one
of the 25 least developed countries as defined by the United Nations.
3.       The TANU Party, under the leadership of President Nyerere, has been
the guiding force in Tanzania's political evolution since the 1950's. Over
the years following independence the political leadership has developed a
philosophy of egalitarian socialism which has been articulated in many docu-
ments, most central of which is the Arusha Declaration of 1967. Ln restruc-
turing the political, economic and social life of the country the leadership
has introduced an impressive series of far-reaching institutional reforms.
For the past decade Tanzania's social and economic policy has been guided by
three fundamental objectives: (a) the achievement of a paticipatory, decen-
tralized socialist economic order; (b) the eradication of absolut,e poverty
and progress toward greater income equality; and (c) more rapid long-term
economic growth with full participation of all regions and population groups
in the development process. Some of the Government's most significant
decisions have been in the area of incomes policy; however, while considerable
progress has been made toward reducing inequality within the category of
employed workers, large gaps still exist between urban and rural standards
of living.



-2-
4.       Tanzania is one of the three Partner States belonging to the
East African Community. The 1]967 Treaty for East African Cooperation is
one of the most far-reaching and comprehensive economic cooperation agree-
ments in existence among sovereign states. However, in practice the degree
of economic integration and cooperation among the Partner States is much less
than what was envisaged in the Treaty. Political developments in the
Partner States have created tensions within the Community and impaired the
growth of interstate trade. These difficulties have been compounded by the
balance of payments crisis which currently faces all three Partner States.
5.       Between 1968 and 1973, Tanzania's GDP increased 4.6% per year in
real terms. Exports of goods and services in constant prices grew 2.8% per
year during the same period. Domestic savings were maintained at about
18% of GDP. Investment increased from 19% of GDP to 23% with public sector
investment rising to 80% of the total investment in 1973. Annual price
increases were moderate to low. Current Government receipts more than
doubled, but current expenditures increased at similar rates so that budgetary
savings stagnated. Although the level of domestic savings and investment
were substantial, the growth of GDP was probably not commensurate with the
investment effort. This was largely due to the high proportion of investment
that went into slow gestation infrastructure and social services, and to the
difficulties encountered in expanding production in agriculture. The stag-
nation of agricultural export volumes and very slow growth in food production
were the most worrisome problems. However, prudent domestic financial
management, and an increasing inflow of external aid on concessionary terms,
together with a rather sharp terms of trade improvement in 1973, made it
possible to maintain a high investment rate. Reserves at the end of 1973
stood at a healthy $145 million which was then the equivalent of four months'
imports. Indeed, the economy appeared in relatively good shape before the
events of the winter of 1973-74.
6.       Events occurred then which resulted in a drastic change in the
overall balance of payments of Tanzania. Import prices rose sharply and in
1973 and 1974 rains failed in many parts of the country necessitating subs-
tantial increases in imports of basic food items. As a result, Tanzania's
foreign exchange reserves declined by about $90 million in 1974 to a level
representing about three weeks' imports and have remained at about the same
level since. Tanzania has been able to cover the 1975 foreign exchange gap
by curtailing imports to the bare minimum and by securing substantial program-
type assistance including a $30 million Program Loan (No. 1063 TA) from the
Bank and drawings on the second IMF credit tranche and the IMF special oil
facility approved in August 1975.
7.       In order to close the gap in the longer term the Government has
begun a program of investment restructuring, improvements in the incentive
framework, administrative changes, and reduction in the rate of growth of
consumption. Under this program, the Government is reallocating public
investment from infrastructure development to the directly productive sectors
of agriculture, industry and mining. Actual public investment for directly



- 3 -
productive sectors is estimated at 41% of the total in 1974-75 and it is
planned to rise to 48% in 1975-76. Although the Government has made subs-
tantial progress in this endeavor, high level manpower constraints have
inhibited both project preparation and execution. The single largest
economic weakness is the slow growth of agricultural production. Several
steps have been taken to increase output. The Government has raised
producer prices to levels approaching world parity so as to provide greater
incentive. The steeply progressive export tax on coffee, which had an
average rate of 30%, has been reduced to an ad valorem rate of 12-1/2% to
provide further incentives to farmers. The overall planning capability of
the Ministry of Agriculture is being improved and a project coordination unit
to improve implementation has been established in the Ministry. The negative
impact of villagization on output is being reduced through more careful plan-
ning. The Government is reducing unnecessary non-development related recurrent
expenditure and is using taxation and wage/price controls to reduce the rate
of growth of private consumption.   The Government's progress in implementing
policies and programs designed to close the balance of payments gap in
accordance with understandings relating to the program loan was the subject
of a memorandum (see M75-687) from the Secretary to the Executive Directors
dated September 25, 1975.
8.       The program of economic restructuring initiated by the Tanzanian
Government to cope with the economic crisis will generate benefits which
will be spread out in time. Viewed negatively this means that the immediate
barometers of economic health, such as the balance of payments, will remain
weak in the short run. The positive corollary is that Tanzania will have a
basically stronger economy at the end of the restructuring process. The
crisis acted as a catalyst in inducing significant policy shifts which were
diagnosed as necessary beforehand but which did not command urgency until it
struck. Not only did this hasten reallocation in the current Development
Budget and Annual Plan, but it is also likely to have a substantial impact
on the forthcoming Third Five-Year Plan. For the long run the most encouraging
aspect of the Government's response was the demonstration that Tanzania re-
tains the ability to push through necessary but unpopular policy measures
over a wide front. It is this characteristic of a "hard state", together
with the basically sound program of economic restructuring, which holds
promise for the future.
9.       The Tanzanian balance of payments will remain under severe pressure
until more of the favorable balance of payments effects of recent policy
changes can make an impact. Accordingly, Tanzania will require additional
balance of payments assistance in 1976 and 1977. A gap of about $100 million
is anticipated in 1976 after allowance for the balance of the IMF second
credit trance (paragraph 6 above) has been made. In this connection, a
proposed second Bank program loan is under active consideration. In
addition, a continued capital inflow in excess of the foreign exchange c6m-
ponent of high priority projects will also be required if Tanzania is to
achieve its development targets. FirLancing of some local expenditures will,
therefore, be justified.

10.      In terms of debt outstanding and disbursed, the Bank Group is
Tanzania's second largest creditor after the People's Republic of China.
Other major lenders are Sweden, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and the
Federal Republic of Germany. The current low overall debt service ratio
of about 7% is expected to rise to about 9% by 1980 and remain at about
that level throughout the 1980's. Including a notional one-third share
of the debt of the East African Community Corporations, the IBRD is pre-
sently holding 13% of Tanzania's outstanding external debt and IDA 10%;
the IBRD share is expected to rise to about 23% in the next five years, and
the IDA share to rise to about 13%. Debt service payments to the Bank are
about 13% of total debt service payments; the corresponding share for IDA
is about 3%. These two figures are projected to rise to about 25% and 3%,
respectively, by 1980. The debt service ratio of Bank loans to exports
is expected to rise to about 2% by 1980. The Bank's exposure is high because
several major donors are now making their aid available either on grant basis
or very concessional terms and because as a result of prudent debt manage-
ment suppliers' credits have been kept to a minimum. The average interest
rate on loans to Tanzania outstanding at December 31, 1974 amounted to only
2.4% and the average term was 22 years.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TANZANIA
11.      Tanzania joined the Bank, IDA and IFC in 1962.    Beginning with an
IDA credit for education in 1963, 20 credits and eight Bank loans amounting
to $299.8 million have so far been approved for Tanzania. In addition,
Tanzania has been a beneficiary of nine loans, totaling $229.8 million, which
have been extended for the development of common services operated regionally
by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda through their associations in the East African
Community.  The only IFC investments in Tanzania to date, totaling $4.7
million, were made in the Kilombero Sugar Company in 1960 and 1964. This
Company encountered financial difficulties and in 1969 IFC and other investors
sold their interest in the Company to the Government.    Annex II contains
summary statements of Bank loans and IDA credits to Tanzania and the East
African Community organizations as of August 31, 1975 and notes on the
execution of on-going projects.
12.      In keeping with Tanzania's overall development strategy our lending
operations are increasingly focusing on the rural sector and directly pro-
ductive projects. Up to the end of FY72 10 out of 14 loans and credits
made directly to Tanzania had been for infrastructure. Of the 11 Tanzania
operations approved since then all but three, Urban Sites and Services
(Credit No. 495 TA), Highway Maintenance (Credit No. 507 TA) and Education V
(Credit No. 371 TA), were for directly productive projects.    These projects
are supporting both the agricultural and industrial sectors including an
integrated Rural Development project (Credit No. 508 TA) and our first
direct lending for an industrial project, Mwanza Textile (Loan No. 1128 TA).



- 5 -
In addition, projects to support fisheries development, maize production
and a proposed technical assistance credit are expected to be ready for
consideration by the Executive Directors in the near futute. A forestry
project and a project to support selected industries and a related estate
development at Morogoro are currently being appraised and a second rural
development project is expected to be appraised in the field shortly.
As far as infrastructure development is concerned, a third power project
and a fifth education project are expected to be presented to the Exe-
cutive Directors for their consideration in the near future and a proposed
water supply project will be ready shortly for field appraisal.
13.     While it should be borne in mind that over one-half of total
Bank Group lending to Tanzania has been approved in the last two fiscal
years and that initial start-up difficulties are perhaps inevitable,
the project implementation difficulties referred to in Annex II of this
report have been greater than anticipated. Some of these problems stem
from the scarcity of suitably trained and qualified manpower, some reflect
the understandable reluctance and apprehensions of an essential:ly con-
servative traditional sector to adopt the new "technology" and others
are undoubtedly a reflection of the strains created in a society which
is attempting a unique traverse from one set of economic, institutional
and political rules to another. The Government has become extremely
conscious of these implementation issues and is taking steps to resolve
these problems. An earlier reluctance to recruit technical assistance
for planning and implementation has been replaced by a greater willingness
to utilize such assistance whenever it is demonstrably necessary. At the
request of the Government about 15 technical staff have been supplied by
ADS(Agricultural Development Services) and a Bank staff member has recently
been seconded to the newly established Project Implementation Unit in the
Ministry of Agriculture. In a longer term attempt to alleviate the human
resource constraints our lending is expected to increasingly em?hasize
formal and non-formal training. Furthermore, a conscious attempt is
being made to develop less complex projects.
14.     The difficulties facing the East African Community Corporations
referred to in paragraph 4 above have affected the Bank's lending program
for the Community. The East African Railways Corporation (EARC) has been
the most severely affected. As a result of long delays by the Partner
States in approving increases in tariffs and restrictions on the inter-
state transfer of corporate funds, EARC was unable to order essential
spare parts and supplies with the result that its operational capacity
has deteriorated considerably. In July 1974 the Partner States agreed,
with Bank assistance, on a package of financial measures to rehabilitate
the EARC including interstate transfer of funds and injection of additional
capital. However, this agreement was never fully implemented and as a
result disbursements under Loan No. 674 EA (Third East African Railways
Project) were suspended in February 1975.



15.      A Bank mission whic:h visited East Africa in July 1975 was
able, after meeting the Heads of State and other important officials; in
the three countries, to bring about an understanding on both the short-
and long-term problems of the East African Community.   On the general
question of the future of the EAC, a decision was made to review various
aspects of regional cooperation as now incorporated in the 1967 Treaty.
It is anticipated that this review would begin before the end of the
year and take 18-24 months t:o complete. It would be undertaken by a
commission consisting of nominated representatives from each member
country. To address the immediate financial and managerial problems
that will remain pending agreement on the long-range form of the CoTa-
munity, the Partner States reached three major accords. To deal with the
transfer problem, an agreement was reached on the mechanism for the transfer
of funds from the regions to the Corporation headquarters. To ensurce a
workable plan for railway detcentralization, a draft Consultancy Services
Agreement on studying decentralization was adopted and will be financed
under Loan No. 674 EA, the suspension of which has been lifted. Finally,
the Partner States approved the appointment of financial consultants
who will undertake a study of the assets, liabilities, debts and financial
condition of each of the three Corporations on a regional basis. This
is viewed as a necessary step in providing the basis for the decent:rali-
zation of the Corporations and is expected to be financed by the UK.
16.      It is expected that this broad agreement between the Partner
States will provide a basis on which the Community can efficiently
operate. Payment for past due loans has been received and all the
actions reviewed above have been initiated. While further problems can
be anticipated, it is expected that they can be solved through the joint
efforts of the Bank and the Partner States. The dangers implicit ia the
possibility of operating difficulties growing in all the Corporatioas is
fully recognized and a strong desire to control this situation is evident.
In addition, a general but consistent commitment to the Community has
been noted in the discussions with the Parnter States. The Bank's role
as an "honest broker" has been fully accepted and endorsed by the Partner
States and this role could be used effectively to help in the smooth
transition in the Community's structure.
PART III - INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL EN?VIRONMENT
Ividustrial Sector
17.      The manufacturing sector in Tanzania accounts for only 10% of
GNP but is increasing in importance.   The average growth rate of value
added by the sector fron 1964-72 was 9.8%. The share of manufacturing
employment in total non-agricultural wage employment increased from
12.5% in 1964 to about 19% in 1971 and the total number of jobs in
registered manufacturing enterprises employing 10 or more was about



55,000 in 1971. Industrial investment increased from T Sh 150 million
in 1966 to T Sh 157.2 million in 1971. The contribution of the mining
sector to gross national product, exports and wage employment is at
present small and measures approximately 2%, 8% and 1%, respectively.
18,     Since independence in 1962, Tanzania has followed a pattern
of industrial development concentrating on establishing or expanding
industries for import substitution. Examples include textile, beer,
cigarettes, radios, glass, cement and metal products. As a consequence
of this strategy, imports of consumer goods in particular, had been
reduced from 54% of total commodity imports in 1961 to 27% by 1971.
As the opportunities for import substitution have become exhausted,
the Government has been reviewing its industrial development objectives
and has now chosen the so-called "basic industrial strategy."
19.     In essence, the basic strategy aims at a gradual structural
transformation of the economy by giving priority to industries that
process domestic raw materials for consumption in the home market
and by requiring that traditional exports are locally processed
as far as can be economically justified. The strategy aims at promoting
harmony between the pattern of production and the pattern of domestic
consumption, while the promotion of newly manufactured exports is
seen as a logical extension of production for the home market. The
strategy also emphasizes the development of domestic machine tool
manufacturing and maintenance capacity. Hence, the promotion of
metal engineering industries and the training of industrial engineers
will receive special attention. A key component of the strategy will
be the establishment of an integrated steel mill of as yet an undetermined
size based on domestic coal and iron ore.
20.     In the Industry and Mining Sector Mission Report, which was
distributed to the Executive Directors in April 1975, the Bank has
raised issues concerning the improvements required in the productivity
of existing state manufacturing enterprises and the need for increasing
the efficiency of the public sector. There is also the need for the
Government to specify the exact role of the private sector. Since the
Arusha Declaration (1967) and the acquisition by the Government of a
majority interest in all important manufacturing enterprises, mining
and financial institutions,most industrial and mining activity is
now in the public sector. All major projects started after 1967
have been in the public sector. Nevertheless the contribution of
private firms is appreciable and accounts for about 25% of the value
added and 50% of the employment in the sector. There is need, therefore,
for the removal of uncertainties to the future role of private
investment so that this sector, which has considerable potential,
can also assist in industrial development. This is particularly
important in the mining sector where cooperative ventures between
the Government and private mining companies could be mutually 'beneficial.
The Government has adopted this approach in one or two cases but the
principles have not been embodied in legislation and thus the rules
of the game are not known to potential participants.



After the Arusha Declaration, nationalized industrial ent:er-
prises were regrouped in the National Development Corporation (NI)C).
Subsequent to 1970 the Government split several state corporations
from NDC including those dealing with agricultural processing, tourism,
forestry and textiles. These have been grouped into holding companies
which manage existing enterprises and promote new projects through
equity investments in their respective sectors. This step towards
decentralization has helped in reducing delays and in developing
responsible management at the parastatal level but further steps need
to be taken to strengthen. management at the firm level to bring
about the further devolution of responsiblity to this level. The
critical shortage of competent and experienced middle-level Tanzanian
managers is a perennial problem and a large number of enterprises
are still dependent on expatriate personnel. This dependence is
expected to continue beyond 1980 which was originally the target
year for national self-sufficiency in technical manpower. However,
with the intensive programs under way in the different parastatals
as well as the seven management training institutions for different
levels of skills, effective steps have been taken to train sufficient
Tanzanians to reduce the present dependence on expatriate management.
Financial Insitutions
22.      Tanzania has several financial institutions.   At the apex of
the financial system is the Bank of Tanzania which is the central. bank.
In addition to the Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB), there are six Govern-
ment owned specialized institutions. The National Bank of Commerce (NBC)
in the only commercial bank and was established in 1967 when eight private
commercial banks were nationalized and merged into the NBC. Until 1970,
NBC also provided medium- and long-term financing to industry, but after
TIB was established in 1970, NBC discontinued this activity and trans-
ferred its entire term portfolio to TIB. NBC now provides only short-
term financing and working capital on a roll-over basis. The Tanzania
Rural Development Bank (TRDB) provides the bulk of the credit for the agri-
cultural sector and has been the channel for onlending for all the
Bank Group projects for agriculture. TRDB has also financed some
small-scale industries including saw mills and grain mills but does not
finance medium and large industries. In addition there are the following
four specialized institutions: the National Insurance Corporation,
the Tanzania Housing Bank, the National Provident Fund and the Tanganyika
Post Office Savings Bank. These institutions have few activities in
the industrial sector.
23.     There are two other development banks which operate in Tanzania:
the East African Development Bank (EADB) which was established in
1967 by the three member Governments of the East African Community
and the Tanganyika Development Finance Company Limited (TDFL) which
is owned in equal shares by the Tanzania Government and three bilateral
aid agencies. EADB finances only industrial projects but no tourism
or agricultural projects. Until a few years ago EADB was the
more important source of industrial investment but TIB has now



-9-
surpassed EADB's operations in Tanzania. EADB however continues to
play an important role in Tanzania by financing projects designed
to make the economies of the Partner States increasingly complementary
and also by financing jointly with TIB projects which are too large
for TIB to handle alone. The Bank had provided an $8 million line
of credit to EADB in 1972 and is presently considering a second loan.
The Tanganyika Development Finance Company Limited (TDFL) established
in 1962 is smaller than TIB and is the principal banking source for
private investment. In 1973, TDFL approved 10 projects for T Sh 18.5
million. TDFL's financing is limited to T Sh 6 million per project.
In spite of its modest size, TDFL has played an important role in the
Tanzanian manufacturing sector. A recent change in its policy now
enables TDFL to also finance parastatals and TDFL is expected to
finance several projects jointly with TIB.
Small-Scale Industries
24.     The overall responsibility for small-scale industry development
has been entrusted to the Small Industries Development Organization
(SIDO) which was especially created in 1973 for this purpose. SIDO's
activities include providing technical and managerial consultancy
services, establishing industrial estates, conducting training programs,
providing marketing services and supplying machinery on a hire-
purchase basis. During its first year of operations SIDO made available
machinery worth T Sh 1 million. Because it is not in a position to
give substantial financial assistance its impact on the development
of new small-scale industries has been very limited so far. rhe
Government has still under study proper arrangements for financial
support to small-scale industries and in the meanwhile TRDB has been
extending credit for small agro-based industries (grain milling,
saw mills). The Government has recently established a special fund of
T Sh 5 million in TIB for financing small industries. TIB intends to
concentrate initially on small-cale industry activities in industrial
estates and areas where it already has other operations.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.     A report entitled "Tanzania - Appraisal of the Tanzania Invest-
ment Bank" (No. 849-TA, dated October 6, 1975 ) is being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors. The project was appraised in
June 1975. A loan and project summary is provided in Annex III.
Negotiations were held in Washington D.C. on September 11 - 12, ]q75.
The Tanzanian delegation was led by Mr. George Mbowe, TIB's Chairman
and Managing Director.

Background
26.     The Tanzanian Investment Bank was established in November 1970,
to provide medium- and long-term financing for inclustrial development,
including agricultural processing and tourism. By statute, TIB's share
capital must be owned proportionately by the Government (60%), the National
Bank of Commerce (30%), and the National Insurance Company (10%):, both
institutions are wholly owned by the Government.    TIB's authorized capital
is T Sh 200 million and T Sh 70 million has been paid-in. TIB's paid-in
share capital will be increased to T Sh 100 million by December 31, 1975.
Five years after its establishment, TIB has emerged as an important
institution.  Its operations have increased sharply and its financing now
accounts for about 20% of new investments in the manufacturing sector of
Tanzania. The Bank has hadl a continuing dialogue with TIB since its
inception. In February 1974, IDA granted a credit: of $6 million for TIB
which has now been fully committed.
27.      The objectives of theproposed loan for TIB are twofold.    First,
in line with the Government's plan to reduce Tanzania's economic depend-
ence by increasing productive investments, the loan will provide resources
for investment in medium and large scale industries, agro-business and
tourism. Second, the loan will make it possible for the Bank to support
TIB in further improving its procedures and project selection.
Board of Directors, Manaeement and Organization
28.      TIB's Board is chaired by the Managing    Director, who is
appointed by the President, and has eight other members. They include
the Principal Secretaries of Finance, Economic Affairs and Development
Planning, and Commerce and Industry. TIB's Board is active and has the
sole power in approving loans and equity investments. TIB's senior
managers are all Tanzanians. Its top management consists of a Managing
Director and a General Manager. TIB's Managing Director is a Director
of several important parastatals. TIB has no General Manager at present
but the Government plans to nominate one in due course. TIB is organized
along functional lines and has four departments: Operations, Planning
and Development, Finance and Administration. Tanzanians head alL these
departments. As of June 1975, TIB's total professional staff numnbered
31, of which nine were expatriates. TIB is keen to reduce its reliance
on expatriates and has developed an excellent training program for its
staff and is also making active use of overseas training programs. Ten
of its staff have already completed overseas training and five more are
enrolled in training programs abroad.
29.      TIB's project appraisal work is good and includes comprehensive
financial and economic analyses. Recently, TIB has also commenced
systematic follow-up activities on all its portfolio. Its management
has recognized the paramount importance of this function in view of
problems with TIB's increasing portfolio and plans to further strengthen
the follow-up staff. TIB's FY1975 audit is technically satisfactory.



Compared to earlier audits, the FY1975 audit improved markedly because
of improvement in TIB's accounting system and the reorganizatLon of the
Tanzania Audit Corporation. TIB's financial management has improved
recently but needs to be strengthened and in this connection a financial
adviser is to be recruited. The Bank is helping TIB in findi:ng a suitable
candidate.
Operating Policies
30.      According to TIB's Act, it can make medium- and long-term loans,
underwrite securities, guarantee debts, and invest in equity of enter-
prises.  TIB's financing so far, however, has consisted mostly of loans.
Under Tanzania's centrally planned economy, parastatals are primarily
responsible for project promotion, implementation and management,
while TIB is expected to provide an independent check on these invest-
ments through loan financing. TIB's Act requires that it must follow
sound banking policies and finance only projects which are technically
feasible, and financially and economically viable. But in Tanzania's
centrally planned economy, TIB may be asked to finance projects that do
not meet its normal lending criteria. TIB has agreed to finance them
with the "agency funds" which TIB administers on behalf of t'he Govern-
ment; the Government takes the risk for these operations and rIB receives
an unconditional management fee of 3/4% per quarter on the outstanding
balance.
31.      TIB's maximum commitment in any single project or enterprise is
limited to 20% of its own net worth (T Sh 127 million at present) and
as long as it does not exceed 75% of the total fixed investment costs
of the project. TIB is required to follow a prudent policy in debt
acquisition and will not incur debt in excess of three times its net
worth. It is TIB's policy to charge a minimum lending rate which will
substantially reflect the cost of capital in Tanzania. Recently, TIB
has raised its minimum lending rate from 9% to 10% per year. This rate
normally applies to all of its operations. TIB also charges an appraisal
fee of 1% (for projects which are ultimately approved) and a zommitment
fee of 1% per year. TIB can lend up to a maximum of 15 years. This
lending rate is in line with other lending rates in Tanzania. For
instance, the Tanganyika Development Finance Company charges 10-10.5%
for medium- and long-term loans and the National Bank of Commerce
charges between 8% and 10% on most overdrafts.
Operations and Portfolio
32.      TIB's operations have increased rapidly,   As of June 30, 1975,
TIB had approved 79 loans for a total of T Sh 318 million and seven equity
investments for a total of T Sh 9 million. All approvals, except for
T Sh 20 million of cancellations, have been committed. The time lag
between approval and commitment has declined to an average of two months
and is satisfactory. As of June 30, 1975, TIB had disbursed r Sh 135
million. By improving its follow-up during project implementation TIB



- 12 -
would be able to increase t:he disbursements rate appreciably. The
average size of TIB's loans approved in FY1975 is $629,000. Most
TIB assisted projects, use domestic raw materials. The three mosi:
important sub-sectors are food and food processing 30%; wood and wood
processing 13%; and tanneries and leather processing 10%. Projects
approved in FY1975 are expected to create 2,400 new direct jobs al: an
investment cost per job of $11,000 which is low. The projects approved
during FY1975 have an average estimated financial rate of return of
19% and an economic rate of return of 31%.
33.      TIB's major problem is its portfolio.   As of June 30, 1975,
TIB's loan portfolio (those loans on which disbursements have coimenced)
consisted of 37 projects for a total of T Sh 122 million out of which
T Sh 65 million (53%) was affected by arrears over three months.
Two projects, accounting for 11% of the portfolio have settled tlleir
arrears since. Five projec:ts accounting for 19% of the portfolio, are
in serious difficulty. They have generally technical as well as market
problems, are overburdened with short-term debt and have very poor
short-term prospects but may be salvaged if appropriate action is taken.
Most of these projects were approved shortly after TIB's establishment
and do not reflect TIB's present appraisal standards. TIB has analyzed
each problem project and satisfactory actions to solve their problems
are being undertaken.
Financial Condition
34.      As of June 30, 1975, TIB's total assets amounted to T Sh 265
million, including a loan portfolio (60%), an equity portfolio (9%), and
current assets (30%). TIB is relatively liquid. TIB's financing consists
of T Sh 125 million of long-term debt and a net worth of T Sh 127 million.
Its long-term debt equity ratio was 1.1:1. Although TIB's auditors
considered TIB's total provisions of T Sh 1.2 million adequate, they
appear low in relation to the size and condition of TIB's portfolio.
However, TIB does not plan to distribute dividends and its general
reserves together with provisions are considered adequate to cover
potential losses. TIB is, therefore, creditworthy. In FY1975 T[B
earned T Sh 3.0 million, or 3.4% on its average net worth. TIB's admi-
nistrative expenses were 1.6% of total assets on an annual basis and
are reasonable.
TIB's Operational Strategy
35.      In line with Government's intention to increase investment in
the productive sectors, TIB plans to continue expanding its lending
operations. Through further improvement of its relations with parastatals,
TIB expects to become involved earlier in parastatal investments and
enhance its role in developing projects. By strengthening portfolio
supervision, TIB plans to play a constructive role in improving 1:he
problem projects in its portfolio. TIB intends to gain experience in
financing small scale industries by financing industrial estates in
selected areas in cooperation with Small Scale Industries Development
Corporation (SIDO).

Business Outlook
36.      TIB's business prospects are good as many promising investment
opportunities in the industrial sector exist. The 1974 Bank industrial
sector mission identified a large number of projects with a tDtal
investment cost of T Sh 7 billion ($1 billion) in various sub-sectors
in which Tanzania can be competitive. The parastatal capacity to
prepare and implement projects has improved substantially and, in the
future, project development will also be aided by a proposed IDA credit
to finance feasibility and engineering studies of industrial projects
by consultants. In FY1976, new investments of manufacturing, mining
and agricultural parastatals are estimated at $134 million. TIB is
expected to finance between 15%-20% of these new investments. As of
June 30, 1975, TIB's project pipeline consisted of 20 projects with
total financing requirements of $76 million, out of which TIB is
expected to provide about $22 million. These projects appear well
conceived and cover various sub-sectors. TIB expects to apprDve-T Sh 160
million in FY1976, T Sh 200 million in FY1977 and T Sh 200 million in
FY1978.  Given TIB's pipeline and the Government's emphasis on ex-
pansion of the industrial sector, the projected operations are reasonable.
Projected Resource Requirements
37.      As of June 30, 1975, TIB's domestic resources consisted of
its net worth of T Sh 127 million. Foreign resources consisted of
T Sh 212 million ($29.7 million) in untied foreign funds from a number
of bilateral and multilateral aid agencies. In addition, TIB had
committed T Sh 20 million ($2.8 million) of tied foreign funds from
CIDA, the Netherlands and Finland. As of June 30, 1975, TIB had
T Sh 58 million ($8.1 million) available in total resources for new
commitments. To cover its projected commitments until December 31, 1977,
TIB would need T Sh 475 million ($66.5 million) in new resources in-
cluding T Sh 272 million ($38 million) in foreign exchange. Taking into
account likely contributions from other sources, TIB has a foreign re-
source gap of T Sh 107 million ($15 million) to cover the import com-
ponent of its projected commitments until December 31, 1977. A loan
of $15 million is proposed therefore filling TIB's remaining foreign
resource needs and covering 20% of TIB's overall resources requirements
until December 31, 1977. Given share capital increase of T Sh 30 million
in FY1976, TIB's local resources are adequate.
Projected Financial Results
38.      TIB's net profit as a percentage of average net worth is
estimated to increase from 3.4% in FY1975 to 8.4% in FY1980. The
projected improvement in TIB's profitability is due to: (1) a subs-
tantial increase in TIB's portfolio and leverage; (2) an increase in
spread between the cost of borrowed funds and the yield on loans; and
(3) economies of scale reflected in lower administrative costs which
are expected to decline from 1.6% of total assets in FY1975 to 1.0% in
FY1980. TIB's long-term debt/equity ratio is expected to remain below



- 14 -
3:1 until FY1980 when it will climb to 3.2:1. TIB's debt service
coverage is estimated to remain above three throughout the period,
which is adequate.
Terms of Proposed Loan
39.      The proposed loan would be disbursed against foreign excbange
requirements, i.e. the foreign cost of imported goods, 65% of the invoice
price of goods purchased in Tanzania but previously imported into Tan-
zania and 40% of the cost of civil works (Loan Agreement Section 2.02(b).
It would be repaid according to a flexible amortization schedule, con-
forming to the aggregate amortization schedules of TIB's subloans,
which have a maximum maturity of 15 years (Loan Agreement Section 2.08(b).
TIB will need the Bank's prior approval of each project using more than
$400,000 equivalent of the proposed loan and will not be able to use
more than $3 million equivalent in total without the Bank's approval
(Loan Agreement Section 2.02(c). The foreign exchange risk of TIE's
loans will be borne by the sub-borrower.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Tanzania
Investment Bank, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the United Republic
of Tanzania and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
41.      Features of the Loan Agreement of special interest are referred
to in paragraph 39 of this report. There are no special conditiorns of
effectiveness.
42.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
43.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

(-. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION I'
(As of September 30, 1975)
There are currently 17 projects under execution in Tanzania.
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Credit No. 217 TA - Tobacco Project: $9.0 million Credit of October 9,
1970; Closing Date - September 30, 1976
As a result of the Tanzania Government's intention to complete
its villagization program by 1976, the process has been accelerated and
a total of about 7,200 families have been moved to villages in the
tobacco complexes, bringing the number of project farmers to 10,000.
As a result of these vigorous efforts, it is now likely that thie appraisal
target of 15,000 farmers will be reached in 1975. Strict measures to
enforce minimum tobacco acreages per family are expected to contribute to
increased tobacco production. However, yields per hectare and quality of
leaf have been below anticipated levels. Improvements are required to
strengthen the extension and cooperative services. Provision Df water
supplies and social infrastructure is progressing well.
Credit No. 287 TA - Smallholder Tea Project: $10.8 million Credit of
March 3, 1972; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
After initial serious management problems the Tanzania Tea
Authority (TTA) has now finally reached a satisfactory level oF senior
staffing and this has had a clear impact on the working of TTA and a
definite improvement in the control over the field activities. The
completion of 956 ha of new planting during 1974/75 brings the total
project planting to 5,086 ha or 61% of the total target area. A further
500 ha is planned for 1975/76 season. The past lack of techni,-al,
administrative and financial control over the four widely dispersed project
areas is reflected in TTA's current financial problems. A special super-
vision mission has been scheduled to examine these problems and propose
remedial measures.
1/    These notes are designed to inform the Executive. Directors
regarding the progress of projects in execution, and in par-
ticular, to report any problems which are being encountered,
and the actions being taken to remedy them. They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Page 4 of 9
Credit No. 382 TA - Second Livestock Development Project: $18.5
million Credit of May 23, 1973; Closing Date - December 31, 1977
The credit was declared effective on September 28, 1973 but so
far implementation has been extremely slow. IDA disbursements to date
have been limited to technical services and it is only during the past
half year that the development of cattle ranching and marketing has
started to get underway.    The meat processing component of the project
was recently scaled down by almost a third of appraisal proposaLs because
of increases in cost. However, overall progress should improve :1ow that
responsibility for project implementation has been transferred to the
newly established Livestock Development Authority and construction of the
meat processing plants is underway.
Credit No. 454 TA - Geita Cotton Project: $17.5 million Credit of
January 17, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1982
The conditions in which the project is operating were radically
changed by the 1974 decision that farmers throughout the district should
move into villages and by relative price changes in the producer prices
for maize and cotton which occurred in 1974 and 1975. In addition management
problems have slowed project implementation. For the 1975/76 cropping
season the project is focusing on twenty selected villages.
Loan No. 1014 TA - Cashewnut Development Project: $21.0 million
Loan of June 24, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1981
The lowest bids for the five processing facilities to be
constructed under the project were considerably in excess of the appraisal
estimate for the project component. Following detailed discussions
between the Government and contractor, the cost was considerably reduced
by deletion of non-essential items. Construction of the processing facili-
ties is proceeding well.
Credit No. 508 TA - Kigoma Rural Development Project: $10.0 milLion
Credit of August 21, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1980
The credit became effective in November 1974.   By July 1975
progress on the project appeared to be generally satisfactory. All staff
to be posted under the Project Management Executive (PME) had been
appointed. Planning of project villages had begun through the preparation
of viability reports (VSFR's) and land-use maps based on recent aerial
photographs. A first training seminar of one month had been given to
village-level bookkeepers in a new simplified bookkeeping system. Condi-
tions were therefore such that the last supervision mission couLd agree to
inclusion of 23 villages for project financing during the current fiscal
year, requiring investments of TSh 4.9 million for agricultural inputs
and TSh 5.6 million for social infrastructure. Progress on this proposed
investment program would depend particularly on project organization and
management. However, the institutional arrangements following elimination



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 9
of the Kigoma Cooperative Union (KCU) still remained unsatisfaci:ory. It is
anticipated that the supervision mission scheduled in December will be able to
resolve this issue. A preparation team, eventually to number four full-time
expatriates, was recently installed in Mwanza to prepare integrated rural
development projects for Mwanza and Shinyanga Regions, and the existing
and future information base and supporting activities appear promising.
Credit No. 513 TA and Loan No. 1041 TA - Kilombero Sugar Development
Project: $9.0 million Credit and $9.0 million loan of September 27,
1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1979
Estate field development is ahead of schedule with 2,740 ac of
sugar cane planted during 1974/75 (about 500 ac over the target) outgrowers
planting of 400 ac is about 200 ac behind schedule. Construction of the
new sugar mill, financed by Dutch and Danish loans, is on schedule and
should be completed by July 1976. Procurement of field machinery and
equipment and supporting project activities are progressing reasonably well.
Due to cost escalation of the housing and community development component,
detailed cost reviews were undertaken and the project managemeni: expects
that the anticipated cost overruns of about TSh 21.5 million (US$ 3 million)
will be offset by savings on other components and by partial lowering of
standards.
Credit No. 580 TA - Dairy Development Project: $10.0 million Credit of
August 15, 1975; Closing Date - April 30, 1981
The credit is not yet effective. The Government is proceeding
with the recruitment of key personnel.
EDUCATION SECTOR
Credit No. 149 TA - Second Education Project: $5.0 million Credi"t
of May 29, 1969; Closing Date - December 31, 1975
Most project schools are completed. Schools are adequately
furnished but not yet fully equipped. Procurement and installation of the
remaining furniture and equipment is in progress. The project has experienced
a minor overrun of $0.4 million.
Credit No. 232 TA - Third Education Project: $3.3 million Credit: of
February 5, 1971; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
Construction on all 13 project sites is in progress, seven project
institutions are almost completed, three will be completed by October 1975
and the remaining three by December 1975. The Government has agreed to
start construction on boarding facilities with an estimated completion date
of September 1976. All furniture and equipment contracts have been awarded,
but the four apricultural education specialists have not vet arrived in the
country.



ANNEX II
Page. 6 of 9
Fellowship training is satisfactory, two have already returned and taken
up their duties. Disbursements have increased substantially but: as a
result of the start up problem the Closing Date of the project has been
extended for 18 months, up to December 31, 1976. A cost overrun of
about $.45 million is expected.
Credit No. 371 TA - Fourth Education Project: $10.3 million Credit of
April 13, 1973; Closing Date - June 30, 1978
Design work of all project institutions, except for the three
secondary schools eliminated because of cost overruns, will be completed
end 1975. Out of 18 project institutions construction works had. started
on 8 sites only. All construction work is scheduled to be completed in the
beginning of 1978. Furniture and equipment lists should be completed for
tender by the end of 1975. The project unit is now working satisfactorily and
a new project coordinator has been appointed by the Government.   Estimated
project cost, prepared last May by the project unit, came to about US$22
million, excluding the three secondary schools, a cost overrun cf about 15%.
While disbursements are expected to increase substantially the Closing Date
now is projected for late 1978.
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Credit No. 460 TA - Tanzania Investment Bank Project: $6.0 million Credit
of February 13, 1974; Closing Date - June 30, 1978
The credit has been fully committed.
Loan No. 1128 TA - Mwanza Textile Project: $15.0 million Loan of June 19,
1975; Closing Date - July 1, 1979
The loan became effective on October 6, 1975. The Textile
Corporation of Tanzania (TEXCO) has appointed the project engineers and
technical advisors and procurement documents are under preparation. For
the study to be undertaken as part of the project several consultants
have already been contacted by TEXCO and proposals are expected shortly.
POWER SECTOR
Loan No. 715 TA - Kidatu Hydroelectric Project: $30.0 million Loan of
December 14, 1970 and $5.0 million Supplementary Loan No. 712-2 TA of
June 24, 1971; Closing Date - June 30, 1976
Construction work for this project is nearly complete. The
project is on schedule and the first and second unit came on stream in
March 1975 and July 1975 respectively. A mission visited Tanzar,ia in
April 1975 to appraise the second stage Kidatu power project for which
a loan is expected to be recommended to the Executive Directors shortly.

TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
Credit No. 265 TA - Third Highway Project: $6.5 million Credit of August 6,
1971; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
After long delays in completing tender arrangements, the contract
for the Mtwara-Masasi road was made at nearly three times the appraised cost.
Most of the overrun is covered by a $4.4 million loan from ADB and use of
the $1.8 million balance from the Bank's Second Highway Project (Loan No.
586 TA). Construction of this road is proceeding satisfactorily.
Execution of road betterment works in two agricultura]. areas
commenced about a year ago and is progressing satisfactorily in one area
but is behind schedule in the other.
Preinvestment studies for Kilombero and Kilimanjaro areas have
been completed and final reports are expected in November.
Credit No. 507 TA - Highway Maintenance Project: $10.2 million
Credit of August 21,1974; Closing Date - June 30, 1979
The project was declared effective on November 20, 1974. Contract
for the recruitment of expatriate engineers required for project: implementa-
tion is under discussion by the Government with the Crown Agents. A study
on the road transport industry in the country was started by consultants
in April and is expected to be ready before the end of this year.
URBAN SECTOR
Credit No. 495 TA - Sites and Services Project $10.0 million
Credit of July 12, 1974; Closing Date - December 31, 1978
The project was declared effective in October 1974 ancL is proceed-
ing very well. Contracts for infrastructure construction at all, seven sites
have been awarded and construction is underway on six sites. Tender documents
for community facilities are being prepared and tender award is scheduled
for October 1975. Other components of the project i.e. training, monitoring/
evaluation and nutrition studies are progressing satisfactorily.

There are currently six projects under execution by the East
African Community.
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
Loan No. 674 EA - Third Railways Project: $42.4 million Loan of May 25,
1970; Closing Date - June 30, 1976
The suspension of this Loan was lifted on September 5, 1975. The
reasons for suspension and its lifting are discussed in paragraphs 14 and 15 of
this report. It is now planned that part of the proceeds of the Loan will
be used for consultancy services to assist in the reorganization of Railways
Corporation (paragraph 15). Meanwhile the Corporation is now finalizing
a plan to meet its emergency investment requirements.
Loan No. 638 EA - Second Harbours Project: $35.0 million Loan of August 25,
1969; Closing Date - December 31, 1975
The Harbours Corporation is in a healthy cash position although
there have been problems in transferring funds from regional offices to head-
quarters. Damage to a partially completed pier has delayed project imple-
mentation. It is now expected that the construction will finish. in mid-1975.
Legal questions resulting from the damage are under study by the Corporation.
Loan No. 865 EA - Third Harbours Project: $26.5 million Loan of December 18,
1972; Closing Date - June 30, 1976
A delay of six months is expected in completing civil works under
this project. Cost overruns have been experienced in some project items.
The situation is under study by the Corporation, which will shortly issue a
plan for speeding implementation.
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Loan No. 843 EA - East African Development Bank Project: $8.0 million Loan
of June 28, 1972; Closing Date - May 31, 1976
Operations of the Bank have been decentralized and the newly formed
regional office teams are now competent in dealing with all aspects of
development financing operations. The entire first loan has now been
committed by EADB.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Loan No. 675 EA - Second Telecommunications Project: $10.4 million
Loan of May 25, 1970; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
The project is complete. The closing date of the Loan was
extended from June 30, 1975 to December 31, 1975 to enable final payments
to be made from the loan account.



ANNEX II
Page of 9 of 9
Loan No. 914 EA - Third Telecommunications Project: $32.5 million
Loan of June 22, 1973; Closing Date - December 31, 1976
Problems within the EAC have only marginally affected the Posts
and Telecommunications Corporation due to the considerable exis: ing
decentralization of operating authority. Deterioration of the corporate
cash position and rate of return has been slight in comparison ,o other
Community Corporations and the situation improved by a rate increase
allowed by the Community in February 1975.
All major works have been completed, except two microwave links
which, due to long lead time for delivery, will be delayed by 1 2 months.
