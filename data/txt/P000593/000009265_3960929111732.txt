MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE FEDERAL ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF COMOROS
FOR A HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
1.   The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Federal Islamic Republic of Comoros for SDR 4.6 million
(US$6.6 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. Part I of the
document discusses Comoros' development prospects and economic performance,
and the Bank Group's assistance strategy. Part II describes the proposed
credit.
PART I - COUNTRY POLICIES AND BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
2.   A report entitled "The Comoros - The Arduous Path to Economic Growths
The Need for Adjustment' (Report No. 6690-COM) wa.s distributed to the
Executive Directors in August 1987. Since then, economic work has been
carried out as part of the Bank's effort to help the Comorian authorities
prepare a Policy Framework Paper (PFP).  Negotiations of the PFP, planned
for December 1989, were cancelled due to the assassination of the President
of the Republic on November 26, 1989.  A new, elected government was
installed in March 1990.  At the request of the new government, a joint
IMF/Bank mission visited the Comoros to discuss the PFP in December 1990.
3.   This section reviews recent economic developments, including
government initiatives on the adjustment front, and assesses the medium-
term outlook. Against this backdrop, it also highlights the major elements
of the Bank's assistance strategy and aid coordination role. Country
economic and social indicators are in Schedule E.
Background
4.   The Federal Islamic Republic of Comoros became independent in 1975.
With a GNP per capita of US$460 in 1989 and a population of 456,000, the
Comoros is classified by the United Nations among the least developed
countries. The country faces structural problems that severely hinder its
economic development: (a) small domestic market; (b) remoteness of the
country and its segmentation over several islands; (c) limited natural
resources; (d) dependence of the economy on three export commodities
(vanilla, cloves and ylang-ylang) facing a volatile world market;
(e) population growth of 3.3 percent a year, which puts additional pressure
on the already serious environmental degradation; and (f) high unemployment,
with a large surplus of unskilled manpower. Comoros is predominantly a
rural economy, highly dependent on external trade. Because of rudimentary
agricultural practices and an inadequate marketing system, food production
is insufficient to meet local requirements and the country has been
importing large quantities of rice and meat. The manufacturing sector is
modest, consisting primarily of the processing of export crops and a few
small factories supplying the domestic market. Tourism is still at an



- 2 -
incipient stage. The transport system has been improved with the completion
of several infrastructure projects, including inter-island shipping.
5.    The Comoros has undergone profound political change since the
assassination of the former President in November 1989. A multiparty system
was introduced and a coalition government, consisting of leaders of major
political parties, was named. Given the severe deterioration of the
economic and financial situation, a consensus has emerged across the
political spectrum on the need to adopt a reform program to address the
country's structural problems. The new authorities have repeatedly stressed
the importance of Bank and IMF assistance, in the context of an adjustment
program, to help restore financial equilibrium and improve conditions for
growth.
Assessment of Performance
6.   After a relatively rapid economic growth in the early 1980s (over 4
percent a year), which was achieved mainly through an ambitious externally-
financed public investment program, the economy faces serious structural and
financial constraints. Since 1985, real GDP growth slowed gradually from
nearly 3 percent to reach an estimated 0.4 percent in 1989. The impact of
the reduction in construction due to the completion of several large
infrastructure projects could not be compensated by the modest increase in
agriculture output. The decline in economic activity combined with a
deterioration in the terms of trade, led to a severe drop in per capita
consumption (a decline of 14 percent between 1985 and 1990). A modest GDP
growth of about 1.5 percent has been provisionally estimated for 1990 owing
to a partial recovery in vanilla crop production and a slight pick-up in
housing, construction and trade. In the external sector, export earnings
have been adversely affected by a sluggish world demand for vanilla and
cloves and the appreciation of the Comorian franc (pegged to the French
franc) vis-a-vis the US dollar. In 1989, the current account balance
improved; this was due largely to increase in ylang-ylang exports and a
significant decline in imports due to the contraction of the economy.
Although the balance of payments situation in 1990 is uncertain, it is
likely to deteriorate on account of higher oil prices as a result of the
Gulf crisis. The direct negative impact of the Gulf crisis on Comoros could
represent between 1.5 and 2 percent of GDP, at prevailing oil market prices.

7.   The overall budgetary deficit declined from 16 percent of GDP in 1985
to 6.2 percent in 1989, or 38 percent and 21.5 percent, respectively, If
grants are excluded. This mainly reflected a sharp cutback in capital
expenditures in response to a fall in external aid. In 1990, the deficit is
expected to improve further to 2 percent of GDP owing to government's effort
to collect taxes and customs duties (as a condition of an agreement with
France for the release of exceptional budgetary financing provided during
the year) and to large transfers to the budget of the dividends of the two
profitable public enterprises, the rice importing monopoly and the petroleum
import company. Despite these improvements, the public finance situation
remains difficult: there are chronic delays in meeting civil servants'
payroll (about 10 percent of GDP) and domestic and external arrears are
accumulating. By end-1989, domestic arrears reached nearly US$21 million
and those on external debt amounted to about US$29 million, representing,
respectively, 97 percent and 105 percent of budgetary revenue (excluding
grants). The accumulation of domestic arrears is due primarily to lack of
Treasury funds to pay private suppliers for goods and services provided to
government and to meet withdrawals by private individuals from their deposit
accounts at the Treasury. Moreover, the situation of the public enterprises
has also become a cause for concern due to lack of sound financial accounts,
weak management and the overall contraction of the economy.
8.   As a consequence of the surge in public investment in the early 1980s,
total debt increased rapidly from US$129 million in 1985 to about US$188
million at end-1988.  As a result of the Dakar Agreement, France has
recently cancelled its debt to Comoros for an amount of approximately US$29
million, thus reducing total debt to around US$162 million at end-1989 (over
80 percent of GDP). With this cancellation, the debt owed to countries and
institutions participating in the Paris or the London Clubs is minimal.
Nearly 47 percent of the debt is owed to Arab donors, 23 percent to the
African Development Bank and 22 percent to IDA; external debt arrears have
accumulated to the Arab creditors (60 percent) and the African Development
Bank (23 percent). Because of the country's difficulty in keeping up with
its external debt service obligations (scheduled debt service ratio is about
27 percent), disbursements from external credits have virtually dried up.
Gross disbursements dropped sharply from US$22 million in 1985 to US$5
million in 1989. A resumption of assistance by the international community
hinges on (i) the confidence that the new government is able to generate;
(ii) the adoption of an adjustment program, supported by the Bank and the
Fund; and (iiI) a resolution of the arrears problem.
Adiustment Initiatives
9.   The Comoros' development efforts are hampered by inefficient
management of public resources, a heavy debt burden and a poor investment
climate. While stabilization measures are essential for restoring public
finance equilibria, a comprehensive adjustment program is needed to create
the basis for accelerated economic growth with equity. The medium-term
objectives of the adjustment program should be to (a) significantly reduce
financial imbalances concurrent with efforts directed at clearing the
arrears and at restoring normal relations with concessional donors; (b)
create an environment that will foster increased private investment and
employment; (c) promote diversification of new sources of foreign exchange
earnings; and (d) strengthen the institutional capacity of the government in
economic planning and management and in social service delivery. In this



- 4 -
context, the government has started to implement, at its own initiative, a
number of reform measures, aiming basically at strengthening public
finances, liberalizing trade and promoting growth.
10.  As regards public finances, the government has intensified efforts to
improve tax collection through reorganization of the customs and tax
offices, abolition of certain tax exemptions and installation of a
computerized system for customs. In addition, the government plans to
decentralize the tax administration and further strengthen collection
capacity with assistance from UNDP and France. On the expenditure side, the
government has improved financial control with the appointment of an
expenditure controller. In addition, a number of measures are being
undertaken to reduce current expenditures: a census of civil service being
carried out with assistance from France should help the government reduce
civil service wage bills; civil service allowances (e.g., for housing, cars,
utilities) have already been reduced; and new recruitment has been limited.
11.   In the parapublic sector, the government has taken concrete steps
toward the reform of public enterprises. With assistance from UNDP and
France, audits of 11 enterprises have been completed and rehabilitation/
restructuring plans are being prepared. To improve the transparency in the
use of funds, surpluses from the rice importing monopoly and the petroleum
import company have been incorporated into the budget. In addition, the
government has liquidated the cigarette importing monopoly and is seeking to
privatize the state-owned hotel. Finally, a decree was enacted for the
adoption of a uniform accounting system for all enterprises.
12.  To improve the competitiveness of its exports, the government has
reduced by 50 percent export taxes on vanilla and eliminated those on cloves
and copra. Moreover, with the abolition of the Stabilization Fund in July
1990, levies on all export crops by the Fund have been eliminated. At the
same time, the government has increased competition in vanilla export by
reducing the entry limit to the export market from 15 to 5 tons. To further
stimulate crop production, the government has raised the producer price for
vanilla and undertaken a major agricultural strategy study with UNDP and
Bank assistance. This study would provide a basis for new policies to
improve agricultural production and marketing as well as to preserve the
ecological environment.
13.  Poverty alleviation and human resources development.  To improve the
protein consumption of the population, the government has actively
encouraged an expanded involvement of the private sector in domestic
production of poultry and small ruminants and supported artisanal fishing
through provision of fiberglass canoes to fishermen at affordable prices.
At the same time, the government has reviewed the composition of food aid
and the conditions for its distribution with a view to eliminating
disincentives to domestic production of traditional foodstuffs, preventing
soil degradation and maximizing the benefits of external assistance.
Moreover, there has been a breakthrough in the government's attitude toward
population issues; the spacing of births is now encouraged. Finally, in
education and training, a program is underway with IDA and bilateral support
to upgrade manpower skills and further encourage family planning.
14.  To protect the environment, the government has also taken measures to
prevent further soil erosion and prepared a ten-year action program for soil



- 5 -
conservation and reforestation for the island of Anjouan. The price of
kerosene has been substantially reduced to discourage consumption of a
dwindling fuelwood supply.
15.  While these initiatives are encouraging, more comprehensive measures
are needed to improve the economic and financial situation. The government
recognizes the need to deepen and broaden the scope of economic reform and
is collaborating closely with IMF and Bank staff in the formulation of an
effective adjustment program, which could be supported by both institutions.
In support of its adjustment efforts, the Comoros will require external
financial assistance. A satisfactory resolution of the arrears problems is
a prerequisite for mobilizing this assistance. Moreover, the adjustment
measures, in particular those in the fiscal area, are expected to have an
adverse short-term impact on empl-,ywent, particularly in the civil service.
Accordingly, the government has sougkt, with support from donors, effective
means to cushion this impact and to provide appropriate relief to those who
will be severely affected; the Bank is playing a lead role in this area.
Medium-Term Outlook
16.  The Comoros' economic prospects are poor and the outlook will be
largely shaped by the government's efforts to pursue financial discipline
and its willingness to engage in a comprehensive adjustment program. Policy
reform measures should focus on diversification of export-crops and
improvements in crop productivity and marketing. Promotion of export-
oriented manufacturing could constitute a major source of economic growth in
the long-term, but given the shortage of qualified manpower and the
country's high cost structure, it will require vigorous effort --and time--
to materialize. Tourism has some potential, but its economic impact may be
limited due to the large investments that would be necessary and the low
value-added for L1e country. Growth in tourism will depend largely on an
effort by the two hotel companies to increase the occupancy rate by
encouraging tour operators in the Indian Ocean to market the Comoros as a
tourist destination. Given these conditions, in the absence of effective
measures to increase external competitiveness and to vigorously promote
export diversification, long-term sustained growth would be difficult to
achieve. However, some GDP growth of about 2.5 to 3 percent over the next
few years is possible if the government adopts strict budgetary discipline
and necessary measures to compress wages and salaries both in the public and
private sectors, provides appropriate incentives to stimulate production and
exports and exercises sound judgement in selecting investment projects.  In
the absence of a reform package, the medium-term economic prospects are
substantially worse.
17.  The public finance situation is expected to improve as a result of
stabilization measures. On the revenue side, a tariff reform to simplify
the structure of import taxes and duties, in addition to a concerted effort
to bolster revenue performance, should yield additional revenues. On the
expenditure side, the government is aware of the need to bring down
spending. Since there is little room to cut expenditures on goods and
services without disrupting essential services, the required reduction is
expected to be borne by expenditures on wages and salaries. In addition to
reduction in the number of civil servants, the program will require a
continuation of the freeze on salary increases linked to promotions,
rigorous enforcement of retirement policies, monthly limits on allowances



- 6 -
and strict curtailment of spending under exceptional procedures. As regards
public investment, a rise from its current low level (about 4 percent of
GDP) is expected once relations with creditors are normalized in order to
stem the deterioration of the country's infrastructure and allow for a
modest increase in capital stock to support the private sector. The
improvement in budgetary performance should enable the government to avoid
accumulating domestic arrears including overdue wage payments, and also to
make the budget a more effective tool for promoting development.
18. The Comoros' balance of payments position for the coming years is
likely to remain constrained. The volume of exports is expected to increase
moderately given the constraints of limited world markets, in addition to
the difficulties and time required to achieve meaningful export
diversification. Export prices for vanilla and cloves are expected to
stagnate partly because of a global oversupply of these products. However,
export price for ylang-ylang is likely to increase owing to favorable world
market conditions and Comorian efforts to improve quality control of the
product. Meanwhile, imports of food, intermediate and capital goods are
likely to rise in line with population growth and investment levels.
19. The fiscal and balance of payments position will remain highly
dependent on substantial inflows of concessionary assistance in the form of
grants and loans. These inflows will need to be complemented by
consolidation and restructuring of accumulated external arrears and
considerable debt relief or exceptional financing to permit the expected
external financing gap to be closed. Over the next few years, the gross
external financing required to close the gap including the settlement of
external debt service arrears and the maintenance of foreign exchange
reserves at about three months of imports is estimated at about
US$75 million a year (compared with about US$55 million a year in 1986-89).
The debt service ratio is expected to rise from the current 27 percent in
1990 to 35 percent in 1995. Further debt relief as expected, particularly
in connection with the settlement of external arrears, would ease the debt
servicing burden on Comoros' export earnings.
State of the Policy Dialogue
20. Following a recent Bank/Fund economic assessment mission in August
1990 and during the 1990 Annual Meetings, the authorities reiterated their
request to both the Bank and the IMF to help prepare an adjustment program
to be supported with a possible IDA credit and a SAF operation. There is
broad agreement on the priorities that such a program would need to address,
namely: (i) improvement of public finance management and the efficiency of
public enterprises; (ii) development of a medium-term incentives program to
promote growth in the productive sectors, in particular agriculture; and
(iii) protection of the environment. A draft PFP, prepared last year, is
being updated by the Government along the lines of recommendations made by
the August mission.
Bank Group Strategy and Priorities
21.   The Comoros joined the Bank in December 1976 and the Association ;
December 1977.  To date, it has received eight IDA credits totalling USs3.
million, of which five have been closed. IFC has not yet made any
investments in the Comoros. Implementation of on-going projects is



- 7 -
generally satisfactory, although two problems have been identified.  First,
experience has shown that substantial institutional support is needed for
project management (as under the First Education and Road Rehabilitation
projects). Second, implementation of projects (such as the Coconut
Rehabilitation, First Education, and Health and Population) has been
frequently disrupted by a shortage of counterpart funds and lack of
qualified counterpart staff, the former on account of the tight public
finance situation. Past efforts on the part of the Bank and the IMF to
encourage the previous government to embark on the road to adjustment were
not successful, although conditions for agreement on a program had improved
considerably, when the tragic events of November 1989 forced a temporary
pause in the process. These unsuccessful efforts and the concomittant
deterioration in the public finance situation of the country made it
difficult for the Bank to provide a higher level of project assistance in
the past.

22.   The Bank's objectives in the Comoros are:  improved macroeconomic
management and the development of options for long-term growth with equity.
The main development issues are: (i) identifying a realistic growth
scenario in view of the severe distortions in the economy, including a high
cost structure; (ii) limited institutional capacity; (iii) severe pressure
on the environment; and (iv) fragile political environment impacting on
economic management. Following the change in government in early 1990,
prospects have substantially improved for an adjustment program, which would
focus on measures aimed at restoring financial equilibrium, improving the
country's external competitiveness and increasing efficiency in resource
utilization and allocation.
23.   Specifically, the Bank's country assistance strategy is to:
(a)   assist the government in the preparation of comprehensive policy
reforms aimad at export growth and diversification, improving the
fiscal situation and the management of financial resources and
institution-building;
(b)   rationalize the role of the state by encouraging retrenchment from
productive and commercial activities and strengthening its role in
social service delivery;



- 8a 
(c)   encourage private sector development by improving the investment
climate and infrastructure supportive of private initiative;
(d)   assist the government in the formulation of an action program to
develop the agriculture sector and provide active support for its
implementation;
(e)   strengthen the human resource development process with emphasis on
financing, planning and management issues, on family planning
support, on the quality of education and on vocational training;
(f)   help the government mobilize external assistance, including non-
project aid and debt relief; and
(g)   support the government's effort in protecting the natural
environment.
24.   The current lending protram consists of one operation every two years,
including a proposed macroeconomic management credit which would provide
support for building institutional capacity and quick disbursing assistance
in support of the government's adjustment program. In addition to the
proposed road maintenance project and a health/population project in the
lending program, a multisector project, now in reserve status, could be
quickly activated in the event of agreement on an adjustment program. The
Bank's program of assistance could be further expanded in the light of
actual progress on the adjustment front; in the meantime, the Comoros could
be made SPA-eligible. Progress would be evaluated on the basis of the
execution of the 1991 budget, improved management of public resources,
clearance of both domestic and external arrears and implementation of a
realistic three-year PIP. The proposed macroeconomic management credit
would contribute to the restoration of financial equilibria, support
increased efficiency in resource allocation and utilization, strengthen the
country's institutional capacity, improve conditions for a resumption of
growth, protect the environment and address the social impact of adjustment.
Bank and IMF support for the government's adjustment efforts should also
lead to a resumption of international aid flows to Comoros, a cornerstone of
the proposed strategy.
25.  As regards economic and sector work, priority will be given to the
preparation--with the participation of other donors--of an action program in
the agricultural sector, a health cost-recovery study and a review of the
public expenditure program. The review of the public expenditure program
would constitute a major element of the adjustment program with a view to
improving the efficiency in public resource allocation.
Aid Coordination and relation with the IMF
Z6.  The Bank has been working closely with the IMF, UNDP, France, EEC and
other donors to assist the government in its efforts to undertake a major
adjustment program and to identify key areas of capacity building where
donors support is needed. In the event that an adjustment program is agreed
with the Bretton Woods institutions, the Bank would be prepared to help the
government to organize a special donors' meeting to mobilize quick-
disbursing financial aid and to coordinate technical assistance in support



- 9 -
of the program. The UNDP has indicated its willingness to assist the
government in organizing a Round Table meeting to mobilize assistance for
the government's public investment program. The government has also
expressed a keen interest in organizing, with Bank assistance, a meeting to
seek a resolution of the external debt arrears to Arab donors.
27. Bank and Fund collaboration on Comoros has been close. Past efforts
to induce the government to embark on an adjustment program were closely
c4.z.-dinated both as regards substance and timing, and discussions with the
authorities were often carried out jointly in the field or at headquarters.
A recent Bank assessment mission in August 1990 was carried out in parallel
with an Article IV Consultation mission and a joint mission visited Comoros
in December 1990 to pursue discussions on a Policy Framework Paper.
Summary Assessment
28. In view of the significant reform measures that have already been
undertaken and the government's clear intention to pursue the adjustment
effort, conditions appear favorable for an adjustment program to be
supported by the Bank and the IMP. Recently implemented reforms
notwithstanding, more comprehensive measures would be needed and assistance
from both the Bank and IMF is crucial for the Comoros to normalize its
relations with creditors including a satisfactory resolution of the external
arrears problems and to return to a growth path. Although economic
prospects are poor, some economic growth would be possible once the
financial equilibria are restored and an appropriate incentives system is in
place to stimulate production and promote private investment and exports.
In the meantime, technical assistance would continue to be needed to
reinforce capacity building in the country; this would require close
coordination among major donors to ensitrs adequate provision of assistance
in the critical areas.
29.  Beyond an agreement on the PFP, the Bank's contribution to the
adjustment process would be through a hybrid operation (m=.:roeconomic
management credit) focussing on policy reforms as well as key areas where
institutions can be strengthened to ensure successful implementation of the
adjustment program. Aside from this operation, the Bank's lending program
includes the proposed road maintenance project and a health/population
project. Should a SAF program be concluded with the IMF and an adjustment
program agreed with the Bank, a multisector project, now in reserve status
could be activated; in the meantime, Comoros could be made SPA-eligible.
Progress on the adjustment efforts would be evaluated on the basis of the
execution of the 1991 budget, improved management of public resources,
clearance of both domestic and external arrears and the implementation of a
realitic three-year PIP. The Bank expects to play an increasing role in the
mobilization and coordination of financial assistance to Comoros.

PART II - THE CREDIT
30.   The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years
maturity and would help finance a highway maintenance project. There are
two cofinancierss FAC (US$2 million equivalent) and UNDP (US$700,000
equivalent).
Background
31. The geography of the Comoros imposes severe problems for both domestic
and international transport. The islands are mountainous and the rugged
terrain makes road construction expensive. The volcanic soils and the heavy
rainfall result in the rapid deterioration of low-cost, unpaved roads.
Shipping is essential for both domestic and international trade but the
rocky coastlines provide no natural harbors.   The limited volume of
international trade and the country's isolation from the main shipping
routes severely restrict the frequency of scheduled shipping services.
32.   Since independence in 1975, substantial improvements have been made to
both the size and quality of the transport infrastructure. In particular,
the road network has been extended on all the islands and most areas are now
either connected to the network or within reasonable walking distance.
Although the Government must now focus its intervention on the maintenance
of this infrastructure, it has not fully met this priority because of
insufficient budgetary allocations. Therefore, the road network shows signs
of rapid deterioration. Government revenue is generated for the road sector
through specific taxes on fuels which are allocated to a Road Fund (FER).
Annual FER revenues amount around FC 170 million, well below the annualized
routine and periodic road maintenance costs of FC 500 million, of which
FC 110 million needed for routine maintenance.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
33.   The Association's assistance to the road sub-sector aims at preserving
existing assets by ensuring the periodic and routine maintenance of the
paved road network. This intervention is important at the present time in
order to stem the rapid deterioriation of this network and thereby, reduce
future maintenance and rehabilitation costs.
Prolect Objectives
34.   The project's objectives are to: (i) stem the deterioration of the
paved road network, about half of which is already in serious need of
periodic maintenance; (ii) improve road safety; and (iii) continue the
efforts started under the first and second highway projects to strengthen
road maintenance operations, with greater emphasis in the proposed project
on private sector participation.

Proiect Description
35.   The proposed project would consist of:
(M)       a 3-year road maintenance program for (a) the periodic
maintenance by contractors of a significant part of the
paved road network (226 km); (b) the improvement and
reconstruction of unsafe bridges and retaining walls by
contract; (c) the routine maintenance of the entire paved
road network (467 km) partly by force account and gradually
by contractors; (d) the repair of the earth road network
(268 km) to keep it open to traffic;
(ii)      improvement of road safety through road marking and
signing;
(iii)     institutional support to the General Public Works
Directorate (DGTP) including (a) technical assistance to
help implement the physical components of the project; (b)
assistance in creating a planning and study unit; and (c)
training.
Most of the project-financed works would be contracted out to either
domestic or foreign contractors. The project would also finance spare parts
and partial renewal of maintenance equipment to be utilized in force account
operations.
Works in (i) above comprise a core program which will be totally
financed by external funds (IDA mainly) and an additional program to be co-
financed by IDA and the government, but to be undertaken only as and when
local funding is made available.
36.   The total cost of the project is estimated at US$ 11.3 million
equivalent, with foreign costs of US$ 7.9 million and local costs of US$ 3.4
million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Comoros are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Country economic and social
indicators are shown in Schedule E. Three Maps showing the road system of
each island respectively, are also attached at the end of the present
documents. The Staff Appraisal Report, dated December 26, 1990, is being
distributed separately.
Actions aareed
37.   Assurances were given at negotiations that the government would: (i)
revise and reduce the staffing of the central and regional directorates of
DGTP; (ii) confirm the amounts (+ FC 170 million) of local funding which
would be made available to road maintenance operations on an annual basis;
(iii) ensure that revenues for the Road Fund are sustained at their 1989
level (+ US$500,000) in real terms; (iv) set up and enforce import
regulations regarding axle weight limitation for trucks and buses; and (v)
give priority to road maintenance rather than new construction and

establish adequate sectoral planning proceduros to prepare rolling three-
yent sectoral public investment and expenditure programs.
Belief ItLs
38.   Periodic and routine maintenance of paved roadts would lower transport
costs and prevent deterioration which would result in the need for premature
reconstruction or rehabilitation. The repair of eartlh roads and bridges
would avoid the cost of toad closures, reduce transport costs and increase
the reliability of service.  The project would also support the repair of
road drainage facilities, which should reduce erosion and flood risks.  With
the assistance of technical experts, the project would develop and enforce
ntandtvrds for limiting the potential negative impact of road works on the
environment, especially those carried out by force account.  Trnffic volumes
vary fromu 1,000 vpd down to 80 vpd, and tlhe overall rate of return is 24%,
which is acceptable for a higlhway maintenance project.  It in duo to a
relatively low cost of periodic and routine maintenance compared to highl
savings in vehicle operatlng costs.  The project is relatively sensitive to
posslble changes in the level of couts and benefits.  An increase of 25% in
project costs and a reductionA of 25% in project benefits would reduce the
rate of return from 24% to 14%.
Ritnks
39.   The risks involved are (i) the ability of the government to provide
Ito financial contribution to the project and (ii) the ability of DGTP to
lmpletment the project. The first risk is minimized through the fact that a
portion of the program (core program) is financed at 100% by external
donors, while the othor portion (additional program), which will be
undertaken only if adequate local counterpart funding is available, in in
line with the demonstrated financial capacity of the government.  The second
risk is addressed through use of contractors for the major road works and
une of technical assistance to compensate for the staffing weaknesses of
DGTP in monitoring contractors and organizing works by force account.
Envlronmental Aspects
40.   An assessment was made at appraisal of the potential environmental
impact of the proposed project as well as of environmental issues to be
included in future feasibility or engineering studies of the road sector in
Comoros. The project will have a positive impact on the environment by
repairing road drainage, which is currently in bad shape and thereby
increases erosion and flooding risiks. Otherwise, road works will follow the
existing alignment and will have no effect on current land use. Road safety
was identified as an issue and has been specifically addressed through a
project component. Future feasibility studies would cover such
environmental issues as erosion, resulting from road drainage as well as
from changes in land use patterns. In future feasibility studies for road
widening, potential relocation impacts would be considered. As for detailed
engineering studies, the project will develop and help apply guidelines and
standards for dimensioning the road network to match the traffic with a view
to limiting the potential adverse impact on the environment. Technical
assiatance to DGTP will assist in developing a local capacity to evaluate



- 13 -
the potential environmental impact of road works carried out by force
account and to design appropriate remedies. In addition, suitable
safeguards will be incorporated in bidding documents and contracts to
minimize potential environmental damage caused by road works, especially
regarding drainage facilities and erosion.
Recommendation
41.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.
