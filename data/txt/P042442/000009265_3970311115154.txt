SIERRA - NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND
POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1          Peru's twenty-three million people live in an area of 1.3 million km2.
About 10 percent of the land area is located along a narrow desert-like coastal strip
(Costa) between the Pacific Ocean and the foothills of the Andes; 30 percent is
mountainous (Sierra), made up of the valleys and western plateaus of the Andes; and
60 percent lies in the Amazon watershed (Selva), comprised of the valleys and eastern
plateaus of the Andes and the Amazon jungle. The coastal desert holds 53 percent of the
population, including the capital Lima which accounts for about a third of the population.
1.2          From the late 1960s until about 1990, economic and agricultural policies in
Peru were characterized by heavy Government intervention. Since 1990, the Government
has taken measures to liberalize the economy. Price controls, negative interest rates and
preferential exchange rates have been eliminated. The agrarian reform law has been
repealed to allow for the opening of a land market. Import duties for agricultural products
are being reduced. The Government has embarked on a massive land titling process
scheduled to be finalized by the year 2000. The land and water law, proposed to
Congress, would give private property rights to water and other natural resources. The
financing of the rural sector would be channeled through COFIDE (as second-tier bank),
the private banks and the loan and savings societies.
1.3          In November 1994, the Government requested the Bank to prepare and
finance part of an overall plan tackling the water and natural resources management
problems in the Sierra. The proposed project would focus on the seven most poverty
stricken departments in the country, leaving room for other donors to finance similar
activities in other departments. A parallel project would be financed by the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan. The Swiss Government and CARE are also
financing parts of the program. Project preparation missions took place in August and
October 1995, pre-appraisal in February/March 1996 and appraisal in May/June 19961.
The loan was negotiated in November 1996.
This project has been prepared by Mr. P. Werbrouck (Sr. Agricultural Economist - LA3NR),
Mr. I. Marzall (Agronomist - FAO/CP), Mrs. M.E. Castro (Social Scientist - LA3HR), Mr. M. Asad
(Economist - LA3NR), Mrs. S. Raswant (Financial Analyst - Consultant) and Tng. J. Escurra
(Consultant). The project has been appraised by Messrs. P. Werbrouck, I. Marzall and J. Escurra.
Ms. G. Sakata and Ms. A. Domenech assisted with the production of the report. Mr. J. Parker is the
acting Division Chief and Mr. P. Isenman is the Department Director.

2. BACKGROUND
A. THE MACRo-ECONOMIC SITUATION
2.1         Over the last five years, the orientation of the Peruvian economy has
dramatically changed from the dominance of the state to the private sector, with the state
retaining and strengthening its role as regulator. Reforms included: a sweeping
privatization program, trade liberalization, the removal of most state intervention in
banking services, and elimination of price controls and public monopolies. The economy
has reacted positively to the reform program. Inflation decreased from a high of 7,650
percent in 1990 to 12 percent in 1995. The economy grew by 12.9 percent in 1994 but
economic growth declined to 7 percent in 1995. Population living in poverty declined
from 55 percent in 1991 to 49.6 percent in 1994. Although the income distribution has
improved during the past two years, it is still worse than the Latin American average. The
1994 income per capita is estimated at US$1,890.
2.2         Much remains to be done to ensure that the benefits of economic reforms
continue. Further steps are needed toward trade liberalization. Public institutions need to
be further restructured and strengthened at the central level to act as promoters and
regulators of the provision of public services. Local governments need further autonomy
in decision-making, with adequate financial arrangements that match responsibilities for
service provision. Structure and enforcement of tax collection need to be further
improved. Public sector accountability need to be further increased. And greater efforts
in human capital development through education and health are necessary to sustain
private sector development and decrease poverty.
2.3         Poverty is still widespread in the Sierra and in urban slums. In the face of
overwhelming problems in the social sectors, particularly for the indigenous community,
the Government established in 1990 a social emergency program to provide direct food
and health assistance to the poor. The program was replaced in 1991 by FONCODES
(the National Fund for Social Compensation and Development), a mechanism for
channeling Government and donor resources to labor-intensive projects. FONCODES has
become Government's main instrument to reduce rural poverty from 20 to 15 percent in
1995. The results of FONCODES and the Bank-financed Social Development and
Compensation Fund Project are encouraging: projects have been targeted to poor areas,
demand-driven and executed locally.
2.4         The incidence of rural poverty is the highest in the rural Sierra, which is
estimated to contain the largest number of the poor (1.6 million people).2 Two-thirds of
the Sierra households are poor and 47 percent are extremely poor. Poorer households in
the Sierra tend to be involved in agriculture. Land titling, small-scale irrigation works, and
measures to increase crop and livestock productivity have yielded strong contributions to
poverty alleviation.

B. THE RURAL SECTOR
2.5          Agriculture is not the main engine of growth in Peru. The potentially
cultivable area is estimated at only six percent of the total area. Per capita availability of
cultivable land is only 0.13 ha, less than one-third the average in South America. An
additional 14 percent is suitable for livestock and 38 percent for forestry. The remaining
42 percent is either desert, mountains or protected land. The coastal area has only
21 percent of the cultivable land but produces 60 percent of the agricultural GDP.
2.6          Peru's most important crops, in terms of production value, are rice, cotton,
sugarcane, coffee, meat, eggs and milk. Coffee, sugar and cotton are exported. They
amount to eight percent of total exports. Agriculture and livestock represent about
13 percent of GDP, employ 35 percent of the active population and grow at an annual
average rate of 2.8 percent since 1980 (13 percent in 1994 and 7.4 percent in 1995).
2.7          Production in the Sierra consists mainly of potatoes, corn, quinoa cereals
and livestock (cattle and llamas). Productivity is very low because of the erratic climate,
steep topography, irregular rainfall and traditional production technologies.
C. RURAL POLICY AND STRATEGY
2.8          The main rural policy objective of the Government is to convert the present
subsistence agriculture into a modern and competitive sector to stimulate rural income and
economic growth. To achieve this objective, the Government intends to encourage the
integration of the farming community in the market economy by attracting private
investment in agriculture and stimulating creation of rural communal enterprises.
Government would fulfill a normative role, in directing and promoting agricultural
investment, and creating a stable juridical framework with clear rules to promote
productive activities, intervening with transparency and punctually only when the market
does not operate adequately.
2.9          To implement this policy Government has adopted the following economic
principles: (i) macroeconomic stability; (ii) flexible labor markets; (iii) restructuring of the
financial system including development finance; (iv) elimination of all subsidies and state
intervention in the produce and input markets; (v) liberalization of imports and exports
and elimination of tariffs on international trade; (vi) elimination of state monopolies in
produce and input marketing; and (vii) repeal the Agrarian Reform Law.
2.10         The Government has elaborated a strategy to prepare the sector for the
next century3. In broad terms, it would: (i) promote producer-owned commercial
organizations (Empresas Comunales y Multicomunales), savings and loan associations,
marketing and service cooperatives and similar organizations; (ii) title and register land
properties and create an active land market; (iii) create rural finance mechanisms on

Ministerio de Agricultura, May 1995.

commercial terms involving the savings and loan associations providing credit to
medium-sized entrepreneurs, community revolving funds as social compensation
mechanisms and production support through credit in kind; (iv) reprogram public
investment in irrigation projects to reduce costs and promote private investment, and
reorient public expenditure towards works which have clear social or external benefits and
can increase productivity and efficiency of the existing infrastructure; (v) strengthen the
national research system, rural extension and technology transfer with a strong
participation of the private sector; (vi) assist the Sierra communities to take responsibility
for natural resource management and reforestation; (vii) implement agricultural policy
taking into account environmental concerns and Natural Protected Areas; (viii) create a
national system to improve phyto-sanitary conditions of crops and livestock; and
(ix) direct support to producer Organizaciones Empresariales through training in
management and credit lines for operation and consolidation.
D. INSTITUTIONS
2.11         Rural development institutions involved in rural development in the Sierra
include institutions related to the Ministry of Agriculture (MAG), the Ministry of the
Presidency (NP) and private organizations (NGOs, training institutes).
2.12         Ministry of Agriculture. MAG has central headquarters in Lima and
directorates in 11 regions and sub-directorates in all geographical departments. MAG's
central structure is duplicated in each of the Directorates. MAG staff (including project
staff) amounts to about 4,300 including 577 managers, 1,381 professionals, and 2,169
technicians. In addition to its normative role, MAG controls three projects: the Special
Project for Land Titling (PETT), the National Project for the Management of Watershed
Basins and Soil Conservation (PRONAMACHCS) and the Project for Strengthczning
Agricultural Extension Services in the Sierra (FEAS). The Peruvian Indigenous Institute
(IIP) is also integrated into MAG. Four public organizations are part of MAG: (i) the
National Agrarian Research Institute (INIA); (ii) the National Agrarian Sanitation Service
(SENASA); (iii) the National Natural Resources Institute (INRENA); and (iv) the
National Council for the production of South American Camels.
2.13         PRONAMACHCS was created in 1981 as a soil conservation project
financed by USAID. Since 1986, it is-being financed by the National Treasury and since
1994 it also implements small-scale irrigation and reforestation community projects. It has
a staff of 1,100 people and 66 branches operating in 16 of the 24 departments and reaches
more than 2,000 communities in the Sierra. Since 1990 it has carried out 40,760 ha in soil
conservation, 523 small-scale irrigation works (180,000 ha), and 57,000 ha of forest
plantations. Its 1996 budget amounts to US$67 million, US$42 million of which are to be
financed by the Treasury. PRONAMACHCS operating costs amount to US$16 million
(25 percent of the total planned budget).4
4 The 1995 budget amounted tovUS$53 million but only US$20 million has been realized because of
fund shortages at the Treasury.

2.14        IIP. The Peruvian Indigenous Institute has operated since 1947 and has
been part of MAG since 1993. It carries out the governmental indigenous people policy,
studies and socioeconomic research of the problems and needs of the indigenous people.
IIP is the official agency for all actions the Government undertakes in favor of indigenous
people. It is tied to the Instituto Indigenista Interamericano of the Organization of
American States. Among its achievements are: (i) the ethno-linguistic map of Peru;
(ii) the community poverty map; and (iii) a directory of indigenous communities. IIP
would carry out monitoring studies of the project impact on indigenous people.
2.15        INRENA promotes the sustainable use and conservation of natural
resources. It carries out soil degradation and soil rehabilitation studies, natural resource
assessments, and produces natural resource and land use maps. INRENA is also in charge
of environmental assessments of projects in the agrarian sector and monitors the
implementation of environmental mitigation measures. INRENA would study the
productive potential of the micro-catchments in the project.
2.16        FEAS is financed by IFAD and promotes the development of a private
agricultural extension sector. It operates mainly in the departments of Piura, Cajamarca,
Puno, Moquegua and Tacna until 1999. FEAS finances technical assistance to rural
communities on a declining basis (90 to 50 percent) over a period of three years. FEAS is
providing technical assistance to communities in the project area.
2.17        FONCODES operates under the Ministry of the Presidency and finances
on a grant basis investment projects in the education, health and basic infrastructure
sectors. Since 1995 it is involved in the productive sectors. In 1994 it carried out 4,760
projects for a total of US$171 million. It receives financing from the National Treasury,
the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and other donors. FONCODES
and PRONAMACHCS have a cooperation agreement to complement each others
programs.
2.18        Non-Government Organizations. The number of NGOs active in the
rural sector are estimated between 750 and 1,250. The NGOs active in the rural areas
provide education, training, technical assistance, and marketing. They have little
experience in natural resources management and some have a paternalistic approach to
rural development. NGOs would be involved in the institutional strengthening of the
communities in the project area.
2.19        Community Enterprises. MAG has promoted the creation of community
and multi-community enterprises since 1993. Their number has increased to 600 in 1995
and they are mainly involved in processing of agricultural products. MAG fosters an
intensive training program in small enterprise management directed to the leaders of these
enterprises. The project would further support to the development of these entities.

3. BANK STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS
A. BANK ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
3.1         The Bank resumed lending to Peru in 1991 with a strategy designed to
support the Government's macro-economic and structural adjustment programs. Since
1993, poverty reduction has become the central objective of the Bank strategy in Peru.
To achieve this objective, the Bank concentrates its investment lending in infrastructure
and the social sectors. Projects with FONCODES, in Basic Health and Nutrition, Basic
Education and Rural Roads Rehabilitation combine poverty alleviation objectives with
investments in rehabilitation and maintenance of neglected public services. The Bank also
finances technical assistance in support of privatization and development of a
complementary regulatory and legal framework.
B. BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
3.2         Before 1993 the Bank had financed 64 loans for a total of US$2.2 billion.
Up to November 1996, the Bank had financed another US$1.35 billion, US$400 million
(30 percent) of which were destined to privatization adjustment loans, US$430 million
(32 percent) to social sector projects, US$180 million (13 percent) to standard
privatization loans, and US$240 million (18 percent) to the transport sector. In FY97 the
Bank has also approved an irrigation rehabilitation loan (US$85 million). IEFC operations
amount to US$112 million.
C. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
3.3         As per the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Peru5, poverty
reduction is the central objective of the Bank's involvement. This is to be achieved
through both private sector-led and environmentally sustainable growth and investments in
public goods and services which directly benefit the poor. The proposed project approach
supports these objectives by emphasizing poverty reduction in the poorest areas of the
country through investments in small-scale infrastructure and promotion of sustainable
natural resource management practices. Direct involvement of communities in the project
is also consistent with the objective of reducing the role of the State in productive
activities. Finally, technical assistance and technological support would strengthen public
institutions and communities, supporting the Bank's institution building objectives.
D. LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCE
3.4          Past Experience. Past development efforts in Peru were highly centralized
and rarely met the real needs of the rural population. These top-down projects have been
alien to the beneficiaries, administratively complex, costly to maintain and not sustainable.
Experience from FONCODES in Peru also shows that successful development efforts tend
5  Country Assistance Strategy of the World Bank Group, October 28, 1994, Report No. 12997-PE.



- 7 -
to be those administered at the local level close to the beneficiary communities.
Experience of the past twenty years in rural development indicates that effective rural
projects have been relatively small and built upon existing traditional social structures, and
have been designed, formulated and executed with considerable beneficiary participation.
They have sufficiently taken into account the role of women in the household and
community, and integrated women in project development and implementation.
3.5          Lessons in Natural Resources Management in Peru. Among the
lessons learned in soil conservation in Peru are the following: (i) there is an inverse
relationship between farm size and the implementation of soil conservation measures--the
smaller the property the higher the incentive to apply soil conservation; (ii) soil
conservation measures have a higher positive impact on productivity than agricultural
inputs, but soil conservation without improved agronomic techniques have low economic
returns; (iii) irrigation projects need to be complemented by technical assistance in
organization, water distribution and agricultural practices; (iv) participation of
beneficiaries in identification, design, implementation and maintenance of all soil
conservation works is a necessary condition for project success; and (v) payment of
salaries to communities for carrying out works for their own benefit discourages the
practice of communal works and the traditional organization of the people and is a
disincentive for future communal operation and maintenance activities.
3.6          FONCODES. The lessons learned through experiences of FONCODES
and other funds in Peru indicate the importance of: (i) transparent and well-defined
subproject eligibility and evaluation criteria to speed up the implementation process;
(ii) targeting mechanisms based on poverty data to reach the poor; (iii) promotional
activities and technical assistance to stimulate a demand-driven approach among the
poorer communities; and (iv) the degree of community participation, including women and
indigenous groups, and decentralized implementation of projects.
3.7          Regional Experience in Demand-Driven Development. A recent Bank
Review of demand-driven development funds in Latin America6 revealed that, first, by
encouraging the active involvement of community groups, the projects were much more
likely to meet the community's needs than if they were chosen to reflect the priorities of a
government agency. Second, once the communities developed a sense of ownership of a
project, they were more willing and interested in sharing in its costs and ensuring its
maintenance. Third, when a community group was given responsibility for implementing a
project that it had helped to choose and prepare, it had greater interest in ensuring that
private contractors executed the project well and honestly.

3.8         Demand driven projects have potentially conflicting objectives7. These are:
(i) poverty targeting versus economic imperatives; (ii) demand driven subprojects versus
feasibility and sustainability; (iii) efficiency and accountability versus poverty targeting.
The project would resolve these conflicts as follows:
(a)   Poverty Targeting and Economic Imperatives. The project would only be
active in those micro-catchments which are poor, but have physical
potential to improve the natural resource base in a sustainable way. The
productive potential in each micro-catchment would be studied by the
National Institute for Natural Resources - INRENA. The sustainability of
the subprojects would be assured by the beneficiaries' commitment to
operate and maintain the subprojects in which they have invested significant
time and effort in the investment period. Moreover, operation and
maintenance of the projects is part of agricultural work during land
preparation and harvest.
(b)   Demand-driven and Feasibility. To avoid non-economic subprojects
PRONAMACHCS has worked out a technical strategy. It would not only
examine the technical feasibility of the subproject, but also its integration
into a natural resources management strategy in the micro-catchment. This
would avoid the financing of subprojects on a stand alone basis which may
be uneconomic and cause environmental damage, if not properly
integrated. Moreover, communities would only be able to benefit up to a
financial ceiling per family, and maximum project support amounts per ha
or per investment would be introduced. This would avoid the financing of
overdimensioned subprojects and increase the probability that subprojects
would be economic. The significant contribution in unpaid labor by the
communities would encourage them to choose the most cost efficient type
of investments. The project monitoring unit would include cost efficiency
indicators to measure the effectiveness of this strategy.
(c)   Accountability and Poverty Targeting. The low skills of communities in
handling procurement and disbursement would be resolved by double
signature investment accounts of PRONAMACHCS with the beneficiary
community. Where communities lack the minimum management skills, the
local branch of PRONAMACHCS would continue to provide assistance
with local procurement. Moreover, the project would provide training to
communities in the management of their investment accounts and input
revolving system. The Government is also considering to provide
additional working capital to PRONAMACHCS in the amount of
US$2 million which would be used to prefinance procurement in
beneficiary communities.

E. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
3.9         Peru's main environmental problems include the general degradation of its
natural resource base because of a rapidly growing population, poverty, regional migration
and terrorism. Poorly managed irrigation schemes, modernization and expansion of
agriculture, industrialization, intensive mining and fishing add to the problems. Inadequate
institutions for enforcing property rights, inability to implement existing environmental
legislation, erratic swings in public policy, and fiscal difficulties impede a quick solution of
these problems. In the Sierra, deforestation is almost complete. The Eastern slopes have
lost 60 percent of their forest cover. Slash and burn agriculture, abandonment of over one
million hectares of Inca terraces and overgrazing have left half of Peru's surface area with
moderate to serious erosion. Small mining operations create river pollution. Poor
management of commercially oriented irrigation systems on the coast has lowered yields
and led to the salinization of one third of the area under cultivation.
3.10        The Giovernment does not require environmental impact studies of
projects. There is no Narional Environmental Action Plan. Nevertheless, in 1990 the
Peruvian Congress enacted the Environment Law which still needs to be implemented.
The law establishes a National Environmental System which is not yet operating. A
National Environmental Council (Consejo Nacional delMedio Ambiente--CONAM) has
also been established. The Government also created the National Institute of National
Resources (INRENA) within the Ministry of Agriculture. INRENA carries out
assessment of environmental and natural renewable resources, monitoring and control of
activities in which environmental risk is evident and establishment of effluent standards for
agricultural activities.
F. INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND POVERTY
3.11        The indigenous population, defined by individuals that speak only
Quechua, Aymara and other indigenous languages, represent about 11.3 percent of the
total population. Peru is a mestizo country, however, and this definition understates the
share of the indigenous population by not counting individuals that speak both Spanish
and an indigenous language. The indigenous population mostly resides in the Sierra and
the Selva. The indigenous people of the Sierra (called campesinos) live in close
attachment to their natural resources, have their own customary social and political
institutions and live primarily from subsistence-oriented production. They do not always
identify themselves as a distinct cultural group because the word "indigenous" has a
negative connotation in Peru.
3.12        According to a 1991 household survey8, 80 percent of the non-Spanish
speaking households are poor and 55 percent are extremely poor--they are 1.3 times more
likely to be poor than the rural Spanish-speaking population. Their educational attainment
and unemployment are higher, they have less access to public services such as running
water, sewerage and electricity, and infant mortality is more than double. Significant gains

were made during the past administration in the establishment of indigenous land reserves
and other legislation protecting indigenous peoples.
3.13         The Government has an indigenous development policy. The main aspects
of this policy are contained in the Ley General de las Comunidades Campesinas, Ley de
Deslinde y Titulaci6n de Territorios de las Comunidades Campesinas, Ley de
Comunidades Nativas, and Reglamento de Comunidades Nativas. The Peruvian
Indigenous Institute, within MAG, is in charge of implementing this policy. It promotes
actions to improve the living conditions of the indigenous people, such as community
enterprises and small agriculture initiatives. It also ensures application of the norms and
regulations in favor of indigenous people, including registration of indigenous
communities, demarcation and titling of indigenous lands. It addresses environmental
concerns, technology transfer, linguistic development, ecotourism, a diverse ethnic and
cultural development, and carries out studies in linguistic, ethnic diversity, and poverty
issues.
4.   THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.1          The general project objective is to help alleviate the poverty of rural Sierra
people. Specific project objectives are to assist the poor to: (i) improve sustainable
management of natural resources through soil conservation measures and reforestation at
the micro-catchment level; (ii) increase rural production and productivity through
introduction of irrigation and improved agricultural practices; and (iii) strengthen their
rural organizations so that they can become autonomous and sustainable entities.
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION, SCOPE AND STRATEGY
4.2          The project would finance: (i) demand-driven productive rural investments
in the Sierra on a grant basis matched by community labor; (ii) the participatory process by
which rural investments are identified, formulated and implemented; (iii) institutional
strengthening of rural communities; and (iv) goods, consulting services and training for
PRONAMACHCS assisting communities to carry out the above.
4.3          The project would be implemented over a period of six years in about
125 micro-catchments above 2,000 m altitude in the seven poorest administrative
departments of the Sierra. It would benefit an estimated 1,250 communities or 75,000
families. The target population would be selected amongst the poorest communities on
the basis of established rural poverty statistics within micro-catchments with potential for
productive improvement through soil conservation and rural productive infrastructure.
Rural investments would include: (i) soil conservation activities (construction of terraces,
water infiltration furrows, live barriers); (ii) small-scale irrigation; (iii) reforestation and



- 11 -
agroforestry; (iv) improvement of soil conserving agronomic practices; and
(v) construction of community seed storehouses.
4.4          The project's overall strategy consists of a participative community natural
resource management and land use planning. Implementation of participatory plans at
community level would lead to natural resources management planning and
implementation at the micro-catchment level (microcuenca), involving communities,
municipalities and other representative organizations. In general, the beneficiary rural
communities will be comunidades campesinas, which are public interest organizations
with legal status. When no comunidades campesinas exist, rural associations of at least
twenty farmers' family units may be eligible for rural investments. Detailed eligibility
criteria for beneficiary communities would be included in the Project operational
manual (para 8.2).
4.5         The geographical unit for planning and implementation is the
micro-catchment. Such micro-catchment covers on average 10,000 ha for 600 families
(or ten communities). The technical strategy aims at: (i) adjusting land use to soil
characteristics; (ii) increasing production on fertile lands and, where not possible, convert
marginal and erosion-prone soils into stable agricultural soils through terracing;
(iii) opening the soil structure to maximize water infiltration through introduction of
adequate soil preparation and cultivation techniques; (iv) increasing soil cover through
agricultural and (agro) forestry practices which at the same time increase income; and
(v) optimizing water use for productive and other purposes through construction of small
irrigation schemes.
4.6         The operational strategy consists of a rural extension system, organized by
PRONAMACHCS, which would help the communities prepare and implement the rural
investments, and finance the rural investment costs (contractors, materials, tools, inputs)
with the proceeds of the project. The communities would contribute in unpaid labor. The
project would train the rural communities to foster self management.
C. PROJECT COMPONENTS
4.7         The project has four components: (i) participative identification and
formulation of rural investments in micro-catchments; (ii) rural investments;
(iii) strengthening of rural community institutions; and (iv) logistical support and training
to the implementing agency (PRONAMACHCS).
L. Participatory Identification and Formulation of Rural Investments
(Costs US$466,000)
4.8         This component aims to promote active participation of project
beneficiaries in identification, planning, design and implementation of rural investments,
taking into account the potential of soil and water resources in a micro-catchment. The
project would be implemented in seven Departments: Cajamarca, Huanuco, Ancash,



- 12 -
Huancavelica, Junin, Ayacucho, and Apurimac. These Departments are amongst the
poorest of Peru and do not yet benefit from significant assistance in natural resources
management.
4.9         Selection of Project Area. To select the 125 micro-catchments in which
the project would intervene, PRONAMACHCS would, firsts consider all
micro-catchments of at least 1,000 ha above 2,000 m altitude with populations living in
extreme poverty and misery as defined by the Peruvian Indigenous Institute (IIP)9.
Second, INRENA would evaluate the development potential of the selected
micro-catchments. It would carry out a study in each of the retained micro-catchments to
identify the productive potential. Each study would include a summary report on land use,
land vulnerability and capabilities and a base map at a 1/25,000 scale covering topography,
water resources, roads, and population.
4.10         The order of priority in which the micro-catchment would be assisted
would depend on the interest of the population in natural resources management and the
degree in which other institutions are involved in overlapping activities. Project
involvement during the first project year would also be determined by the proximity of the
micro-catchments to PRONAMACHCS offices.
4.11        The project would finance land use and capability studies for about
125 micro-catchments including the purchase of satellite imagery, recruitment of
specialized agencies (INRENA), computer equipment and software.
4.12        Participatory Planning. Participatory planning of project-financed
activities in the selected micro-catchmnents would take place in seven steps.
Step 1: A PRONAMACHCS extension agent would contact the local authorities and the
communities living in the micro-catchment to explain the program objectives,
procedures, the intervention methodology and commitments the communities
and PRONAMACHCS would have to make.
Step 2: After approval by the community Assembly to participate in the program, a
committee selected by the Assembly would, jointly with the extension agent,
work out a chronogram of participatory planning activities (the Participation
Agreement).
Step 3: Participatory Diagnostic. The committee would carry out a diagnostic of the
community situation and the natural resources following the rapid rural appraisal
methodology and would also involve all institutions active in the
micro-catchment. The main output of the diagnostic would include a sketch of
the micro-catchment indicating the actual and potential use of natural resources
9 This definition corresponds to the classification by FONCODES at the district level. IlIP's
classification is more detailed and considers the communities in the district.



- 13 -
in the catchment, an assessment of the social situation, and an evaluation of the
community institutions.
Step 4: Participatory Planning. During this rapid rural appraisal process the committee
would elaborate a communal natural resources management development
program which could include soil conservation measures, small-scale irrigation,
forestry and agroforestry, agricultural practices, technical assistance and
extension, seed storage warehouses, and strengthening of the community
institutions. This program would be discussed and agreed upon by the whole
community Assembly. The committee would then proceed with the
prioritization of activities and establish an implementation program, chronogram
and budget which includes the participation of the community. This final plan
would then be submitted again to the whole community for final approval.
Following this approval, PRONAMACHCS and the community would sign an
agreement (the Subproject Agreement) containing the first year program and the
commitments of both parties.
Step 5: Implementation of the first year program.
Step 6: Monitoring and Evaluation. Periodic meetings between the committee and the
extension agent would take place to discuss the program implementation and
correct mishaps. The agent would write brief quarterly reports on program
implementation for every community. A standard activity monitoring sheet
would be included in PRONAMACHCS' monitoring system.
Step 7: The planning for the second and following years would follow first year
implementation. The same planning procedures as mentioned in steps 4, 5 and 6
would be followed.
4.13        To carry out participatory planning in 125 micro-catchments the project
would finance PRONAMACHCS' incremental operating costs, including incremental
staff, office supplies and expenditures related to the organization of field workshops.
II. Rural Investments (Costs US$77.4 million)
4.14        The project would finance works, materials and tools, agricultural inputs,
and consulting services to prepare and implement primarily five types of rural investments:
(i) soil conservation works; (ii) small-scale irrigation; (iii) reforestation and agroforestry;
(iv) introduction of improved production technology; and (v) community seed storage
warehouses. Full technical details of the rural investments are included in Annex 1.
(a)   Soil Conservation Works would include construction and rehabilitation of
soil terraces, water infiltration furrows, and live erosion barriers as well as
agricultural inputs to increase working capital for farming activities. It is
estimated that the project would help to put 27,000 ha of marginal land
into production.



- 14 -
(b)   Small-Scale Irrigation Structures would include the construction and
rehabilitation of irrigation canals, water reservoirs for productive and
human water consumption, irrigation and livestock, pressure irrigation,
river bank protection structures and small dams. Total area to be put under
irrigation would be about 10,000 ha.
(c)   Reforestation and Agroforestry would include the installation of
540 communal tree nurseries, production of 20 million seedlings, planting
of 17 million trees and maintenance of 2,600 ha of communal (agro)
forests.
(d)   Improved Production Technology would include the introduction of
improved seeds and pastures as well as cultivation techniques such as
contour plowing and planting to reduce soil erosion and increase yields.
Improved technologies would be introduced in three selected
micro-catchments. The introduction of these techniques would be
validated through intense monitoring and spread through contests between
communities, demonstration fields, study tours and other extension
techniques.
(e)    Community Seed Storage Warehouises: 430 warehouses would be
constructed.
(f)    Preparation Studies and Consulting Services for non-standardized
investments in some particular small-scale irrigation systems and
environmental impact analyses where necessary.
Eligibility Criteria and Beneficiary Contributions
4.15         The above investments would be eligible for financing under the project if:
(i) they are included in the Participation Agreement between the community and
PRONAMACHCS as described in para. 4.12; (ii) they benefit the community as a whole;
(iii) the cost of total project contributions (in materials, tools, equipment, agricultural
inputs and skilled labor) in a single community does not exceed US$100,000 per
investment type (soil conservation, irrigation and forestry) over the project period with an
overall maximum of US$ 1,000 per family; and (iv) the value of community contribution in
unpaid labor for the total investments in each community is at least 20 percent.
4.16         This project focuses on small investments, carried out by the beneficiaries,
and it aims to achieve a minimum financial return of ten percent on these investments.
Project financial analysis has determined that the expected benefits of particular
investments will not justify unit inputs exceeding a certain amount to be applied as a
financial ceiling for project contributionsl0. Thus the contribution in the form of materials
for the construction of absorption terraces would not exceed US$750 per ha, for slow
formation terraces US$375 per ha and for water infiltration US$150 per ha. In irrigation,
the project contribution per ha would not exceed US$1,500. Project contributions to
10 Investments exceeding these ceilings have a lower return.



- 15
communal tree nurseries would not exceed US$400 per nursery, to tree planting
US$230 per ha and maintenance US$540 per 10 ha. The project contribution to
warehouses would not exceed US$3,500 per unit.

4.17        The eligibility criteria and beneficiary contributions would be contained in
the project operational manual. They would be reviewed on the basis of the project
monitoring and evaluation. The preparation of a project operational manual
including eligibility criteria and beneficiary contributions --all acceptable to the
Bank-- before loan effectiveness has been agreed upon during negotiations
(para. 8.2).
m. Institutional Strengthening of Community Organizations (Costs US$3.6 million)
4.18        This component would finance training and technical assistance by
PRONAMACHCS and Non-Governmental Organizations to rural communities: (i) in
participatory planning; (ii) to establish 50 micro-catchment management committees which
would design and implement participatory soil conservation plans; and (iii) in financial
management so that they are able to manage an investment account and a small in-kind
revolving stock for agricultural inputs.
4.19        The project would finance the following activities.
(a)   Participatory planning promotion through: (i) the production of
30 different bilingual pamphlets on participatory planning and community
strengthening to be distributed in the communities; (ii) radio broadcasts to



- 16 -
promote participation; and (iii) 125 courses in participatory planning at the
micro-catchment level.
(b)   Establishment of 50 natural resources management committees at the
micro-catchment level through financing of 125 annual seminars,
1,250 workshops at the community level and 40 courses in
micro-catchment natural resources management.
(c)   Financial management courses to train 1,250 communities in the
management of their investment account and agricultural input revolving
stock in 250 courses.
(d)   Small enterprise management courses in 625 communities which show
most potential to benefit from these courses.
4.20        In addition, the project would finance 1,250 small initiatives for the
exclusive benefit of rural women. Each initiative would not exceed US$1,500 per
community. They would include community projects in small livestock, wood
conservation stoves, medicinal plants, food processing, and gardening. For each project,
the beneficiaries would participate for at least 20 percent of the cost.
IV. Project Operation, Management, Monitoring and Evaluation
(Costs US$11.7 million)
4.21        To improve PRONAMACHCS' management capacity and enable smooth
project implementation, this component would: (i) introduce a coherent management
information system as well as a project monitoring system; (ii) train PRONAMACHCS
staff in management and natural resources conservation techniques; and (iii) complement
Government financing for the administration of PRONAMACHCS.
4.22        PRONAMACHCS' three cumbersome management information systems
would be integrated and simplified. The existing information systems do not provide
sufficient financial data to allow efficient monitoring of subproject costs and impact. To
overcome these deficiencies the project would finance management information and
monitoring consultants, software and computer equipment.
4.23        To improve PRONAMACHCS' technical capacity, the project would
finance training for professional and managerial staff. This training would include:
(i) management courses in Peru; (ii) managerial seminars and workshops for mid-level
managers; (iii) technical and environmental analysis training for extension staff,
(iv) national and departmental workshops; (v) study trips to learn about natural resources
management experiences in the region; and (vi) short term international consultants to
provide advice in specialized fields.
4.24        The project would also strengthen the departmental and branch offices and
finance: (i) 20 vehicles, 200 motorcycles, 20 sets of office equipment, 100 incremental
fixed-term extension staff and incremental operational costs for 20 PRONAMACHCS
branches within the project area; (ii) 7 sets of audiovisual and data processing equipment



- 17 -
and 7 community institution building promoters at the Departmental level; (iii) two
incremental staff to improve the accounting, control and management information system
at PRONAMACHCS; (iv) consultants to monitor and evaluate the impact of project
activities (including consultants for IIP); and (v) independent financial auditors.
Relationship with FONCODES II Project
4.25        FONCODES and PRONAMACHCS have worked out a formal agreement
on April 22, 1996 to divide responsibilities for an efficient implementation of subprojects
and avoid overlaps. The agreement provides that FONCODES would orient its
productive rural investments to those sectors which are complementary to
PRONAMACHCS' core program, as defined in the agreement. To avoid inconsistency in
approach, FONCODES would finance projects such as implemented by
PRONAMACHCS under the same conditions and eligibility criteria, and not remunerate
unskilled labor for those types of subprojects which are also financed by
PRONAMACHCS.
4.26        PRONAMACHCS would: (i) analyze the demand for rural investments in
a participatory way; (ii) prepare the technical dossiers for FONCODES subprojects in soil
conservation, small scale irrigation and reforestation projects in those areas where both
institutions intervene; (iii) participate with the beneficiaries in the implementation of
FONCODES subprojects as works supervisor; (iv) provide technical assistance to
FONCODES; (v) enhance the sustainability of FONCODES subprojects which fall under
the agreement; and (vi) provide a priority program to be financed by FONCODES while
PRONAMACHCS is awaiting the availability of project funds.

5. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. PROJECT COSTS
5.1         Total project costs are estimated at US$93.2 million including taxes and
duties. Base costs are US$81 million and contingencies are US$12.2 million (15 percent).
Taxes and duties are estimated at US$7.2 million. The foreign exchange component is
US$20.2 million, or 22 percent of project costs. Project costs are estimated at March
1996 prices. The breakdown of costs by component is shown in Table 3. Detailed cost
tables are presented in Annex 5. Physical contingencies are estimated at five percent of
investment costs. Price contingencies (averaging ten percent of base costs) were
calculated on the basis of the following domestic and international inflation rates.

B. PROPOSED FINANCING PLAN
5.2         The Bank would finance about 55 percent of project costs. These would
consist mainly of works, goods (materials, tools and agricultural inputs) and equipment.
Government would finance the incremental recurrent costs of PRONAMACHCS
(15 percent) and parts of goods, inputs, equipment, training and technical assistance. The
farmers would contribute about 30 percent of the project costs in unpaid labor.

C. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR GOVERNMENT
5.3         Government would contribute approximately US$14.3 million towards the
project. This contribution includes the costs of all farmer field training programs
(US$465,000), a percentage of all investment costs which covers taxes and duties
(US$7.2 million), recruitment (on a fixed-term basis) of 100 additional extension agents
and 7 departmental promoters, and about 50 percent of PRONAMACHCS' incremental
operating costs. This amount would add approximately 15 percent to the
PRONAMACHCS annual operation budget of US$15 million during the project period.
D. PROCUREMENT
5.4         The table below summarizes the project elements, with cost estimates, and
proposed procurement methods. All procurement under the project would be carried out
in accordance with Bank guidelines dated January 1995.

(c) Not subject to procurement.
5.5           The Bank would finance: (i) civil works, tools, materials, equipment and
agricultural inputs for rural investments; (ii) vehicles and office equipment for
PRONAMACHCS; (iii) training; (iv) consulting services; and (v) non-salary incremental
operating costs. During negotiations, it has been agreed that PRONAMACHCS
would use Bank standard bidding documents for International Competitive Bidding
procurement and bidding documents acceptable to the Bank for National
Competitive Bidding (para. 8.1).
5.6          Procurement would be carried out by PRONAMACHCS and rural
communities under the guidance of PRONAMACHCS, which would be strengthened by a
local consultant, a specialist in Bank procedures. PRONAMACHCS employs an



- 21 -
administrative officer in charge of procurement in every branch office who would train
community leaders in purchasing tools, equipment, agricultural inputs at the local level
through shopping. PRONAMACHCS has gained experience in Bank procurement
through the management of a Japanese Grant. It has been agreed during negotiations that,
prior to the issuance of any invitations to prequalify for bidding or to bid for contracts,
PRONAMACHCS would forward a project procurement plan to the Bank for its review.
Procurement of all goods and works shall be undertaken in accordance with the Bank
approved procurement plan. The procurement plan would be included in the project
operational manual (para 8.2).
Civil Works, Tools, Materials and Equipment for Rural Communities
5.7         Procurement for community-based civil works, tools, materials, agricultural
inputs and equipment totaling US$49.5 million (US$43.2 million of which would be
financed by the Bank) would follow practices in accordance with PRONAMACHCS'
operational guidelines which are acceptable to the Bank. Procurement for
community based projects would be done by the communities themselves with technical
assistance of PRONAMACHCS. Works under the project are small works not exceeding
US$100,000 per subproject and are scattered over the seven Departments. Therefore, all
works would be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of
quotations obtained from at least three qualified domestic contractors in response to a
written invitation. Goods for communities (including tools, materials, agricultural inputs
and equipment) costing US$50,000 or less per contract and up to an aggregate amount of
US$34.1 million would be procured through national shopping at the local level. Goods
and agricultural inputs for communities not available at the local level and costing less than
US$200,000 per contract may be procured by PRONAMACHCS at the departmental
level up to an aggregate amount of US$6.8 million through National Competitive Bidding.
5.8         Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) acceptable to the Bank would be
used for National Competitive Bidding (NCB) and these SBDs would be included in the
project operational manual (para 8.2).
Goods and Equipment for PRONAMACHICS
5.9         PRONAMACHCS would purchase vehicles, motorcycles and computer
equipment for an amount of US$1.6 million equivalent, US$1.4 million of which would be
financed by the loan. Procurement of vehicles and motorcycles would be done through
International Competitive Bidding. Procurement of computer equipment, not exceeding
US$50,000 per contract, up to the aggregate amount of US$400,000, will be done
through international shopping among suppliers with established service and maintenance
facilities in Peru.
Consulting Services
5.10        Consulting Services under the project would amount to US$1 million
(US$0.9 million of which would be financed by the Bank). The services consist of:



- 22 -
(i) consulting assignments for individuals and firms providing direct technical assistance
and consulting services to INRENA, IIP and PRONAMACHCS in the baseline studies
and monitoring; and (ii) technical assistance services, training, and studies by individuals,
NGOs or firms to rural communities. Consulting and management services would be
procured in accordance with the 1981 Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. All
assignments would be small and straightforward. PRONAMACHCS would recruit
individual consultants from a shortlist of at least three candidates for each post. A sample
letter of invitation, award criteria and a sample contract, all acceptable to the Bank,
would be included in the Project operational manual (para. 8.2).
5.11        Review Procedures. Although the prior review arrangements described
below will result in a relatively low level of prior review by the Bank, this is acceptable in
light of the large size of the sample of projects which will be subject to ongoing review
under the auditing arrangements described in paragraph 5.13.
5.12        Review of Procurement by PRONAMACHCS. The Bank would
conduct a prior review of: (i) each contract for vehicles; (ii) the first two contracts for
other goods costing more than US$100,000; (iii) all procurement for goods exceeding
US$200,000 per contract; (iv) consultant selection documentation (terms of reference,
shortlists, contract, etc.) for consulting services directly recruited by PRONAMACHCS
with an estimated contract amount of US$100,000 or more for firms and US$50,000 or
more for individuals; (v) terms of reference for all consulting services contracts; and
(vi) all consultants contracts based on a single source or of a critical nature.
5.13        Review of Procurement by Communities. Bank officials would carry
out a post-review of procurement by communities on a small sample basis during
supervision. PRONAMACHCS would recruit auditors who would not only examine
financial implementation but also procurement procedures and physical implementation in
the field. These auditors would carry out six-monthly audits on the basis of a sample not
lower than 60 percent of the Bank-financed investments in the first project year, 50
percent in the second and 40 percent in the last years. Terms of reference of these
auditors, acceptable to the Bank, would be included in the Operational Manual
(para 8.2).
E. DISBURSEMENTS
5.14        The Bank loan of US$51 million is expected to be disbursed over a period
of 6.5 years, beginning the third quarter of FY97 through the end of the second quarter of
FY2003. The project completion date would be December 31, 2002 and the closing date
would be June 30, 2003. The disbursement schedule is presented in Annex 6. The
disbursement pace is similar to the historical disbursement profile for agricultural projects
in Peru. The disbursement pace would depend on the quality of subproject preparation
and PRONAMACHCS's administrative capacities. PRONAMACHCS would be
strengthened by a specialist in Bank disbursement procedures. Employment of a



- 23 -
disbursement specialist by PRONAMACHCS before March 31, 1997 has been
agreed upon during negotiations (para 8.1).
5.15         Rural investments would include civil works, skilled labor, goods, tools,
materials and equipment for eligible beneficiaries. Training includes the cost of the
trainers' and trainees' fees, rental of training facilities, per diem of trainees and materials
required for the training activities. Consulting services include contracts to carry out:
(i) training; (ii) technical assistance including by NGOs; (iii) follow-up on participatory
planning; (iv) cartographical services; (v) pre-investment studies and (vi) accounting,
control and management information studies. Incremental operating expenditures include
expenditures for travel, office rental, office materials and supplies, utilities, office and
equipment maintenance, field materials and per diems. The term agricultural inputs means
seeds, fertilizers and a positive list of chemicals to be included in the project
operational manual (para 8.2).

5.17        Documentation of Expenditures. Disbursements would be made on the
basis of full documentation for all expenditures made under contracts requiring prior Bank
review and amendments to contracts raising the value of such contracts above the prior
review limits. These contracts are: (i) all contracts for vehicles, the first two contracts for
goods exceeding US$100,000 and all contracts exceeding US$200,000; and (ii) consultant
service contracts directly procured by PRONAMACHCS with an estimated contract
amount of US$100,000 or more for firms and US$50,000 or more for individuals. For all
other expenditures disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditure
(SOE) for which supporting documents would be maintained by PRONAMACHCS and
would be available for Bank staff review. Because of the large volume of disbursements



- 24 -
expected to be claimed under SOEs, special efforts would be made for the selective review
of SOE documentation by visiting Bank missions and auditors.

5.18        Special Account. A Special Account in US dollars would be opened at a
commercial bank in Peru. The account would have an authorized allocation of
US$3 million and would cover four months of project expenditures. The authorized
allocation would be limited to US$1 million until the withdrawals have reached
US$5 million. Withdrawals from the Special Account would be done by
PRONAMACHCS. The Bank would replenish the Special Account for the amount of
withdrawals on account of eligible expenditures at the request of the Borrower.
5.19        Project Account. PRONAMACHCS would create a subproject financing
fund or project account of US$2 million equivalent, which would allow it to put small
advances into community bank accounts and to be used to purchase tools and materials
purchases at the local level. Eligible expenditures would be reimbursed to the project
account through the Special Account.
5.20        Retroactive Financing. Reimbursement of up to US$5 million would be
permitted for eligible expenditures made in accordance with procurement procedures
agreed under the project from July 1, 1996, provided that the loan is signed not later than
July 1, 1997. If the loan is signed at a later date, the initial date for eligibility of
expenditures for retroactive financing would be modified so that the period covered by
retroactive financing would be no more than one year. Retroactive financing is
recommended to ensure that the selection and studies of micro-catchments, the
participative planning of the demand for soil conservation investments and bulk
procurement can go ahead before project effectiveness.



- 25 -
F. AUDITING AND ACCOUNTS
5.21        PRONAMACHCS would maintain separate accounts for project
expenditures as well as a register of assets purchased with project funds. The present
accounting system has been analyzed and found to be adequate. It needs now to be
enhanced to include the project accounts. The accounting plan would be included in
the project implementation manual (para 8.2). PRONAMACHCS would hire
independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank to audit on an annual basis the financial
statements, the Special Account and SOEs. In addition the auditors would prepare a
(long-form) report on project management. Copies of the audited statements would be
sent to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year. With respect to SOEs, the
auditor's reports would include an opinion (and comments and recommendations, as
necessary) on the methods employed in compiling the SOEs, their accuracy, the relevance
of supporting documents, their eligibility for financing under terms of the loan agreement,
the standards of record keeping and intemal controls related to the foregoing. Terms of
reference of the auditors would be included in the project operational manual
(para 8.2).
6. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT
6.1         The project would be carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture through
PRONAMACHCS which would be strengthened by two local consultants, specialists in
Bank procurement and disbursements working within the Planning and Administration
Departments. Twenty branches would be involved in the project"1. The branches, now
only containing soil conservation specialists, would be strengthened by incorporating
promoters and agriculturists.
6.2         PRONAMACHCS has an executive director assisted by an administrative
and financial office, a planning office, a legal and an internal audit office. There are three
technical directorates: soil conservation, reforestation and infrastructure. At the regional
level there are 16 departments and 66 branches.
6.3         The planning office would be responsible for preparing the annual
operational plan and the internal monitoring and evaluation of the activities financed under
the project. The administrative office would be responsible for the project accounting and
disbursements. PRONAMACHCS is familiar with procedures of international institutions.
The procurement officer and financial manager of PRONAMACHCS have received
training in Bank disbursement procedures and would undergo Bank procurement training.
1 The list of branches is in Annex 3.



- 26 -
6.4         Seven departments would be involved in project implementation.
PRONAMACHCS central structure is also reflected at the departmental level.
Considering the multiplicity of training and community institutional strengthening activities
under the project, seven specialist promoters would be recruited to coordinate and support
the training activities. Recruitment by PRONAMACHCS of one specialist in
promotion and organization of rural communities per department before March 31,
1997 has been agreed upon during negotiations (para 8.1). Terms of reference of the
specialists would be included in the Project operational manual (para 8.2).
6.5         Each of the branches involved in the project would have three specialists
responsible for coordination, planning, training and supervision. This team would consist
of a soil conservation engineer, an agricultural engineer, and a forestry specialist.
Specialists in the promotion and organization of rural communities would be recruited
when activities in this sector require it. The team would be strengthened by one
agronomist for each five extension agents.
6.6         At the micro-catchment level the branches have one extension agent per
five communities. This would allow the extension agent to spend one day per week per
community and undergo regular training. The extension agent would be trained in all
PRONAMACHCS activities through an intensive technical training program. About
100 fixed-term extension agents would be recruited under the project.

B. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
6.7         Implementation Plan. The overall project implementation plan is in
Annex 8 and includes a detailed first year implementation plan. During the lead-in period
of the project, PRONAMACHCS and INRENA would carry out the studies on the
micro-catchments and the branches would carry out the participatory planning sessions
for the first project year. The micro-catchments (79) for the first year have been
identified. The general plan of action is to start in 1996 with the 300 communities already
working with PRONAMACHCS and to gradually add 400 communities in 1997, and 550
in 1998.
6.8         The pace of the rural investments has been estimated on the basis of
PRONAMACHCS' implementation experience. Although the institution has the capacity
to drastically increase its activities, implementation of rural investments has been hindered
by lack of funds. The implementation plan, however, provides for a gradual increase in
PRONAMACHCS activity. The project would be carried out in accordance with the
implementation plan including a detailed first year implementation plan, annual
revisions of the plan to be made by PRONAMACHCS and to be submitted to the
Bank for review (para. 8.1).
C. PROJECT MONITORING AND SUPERVISION
6.9         The project would be monitored by: (i) PRONAMACHCS' monitoring
and evaluation unit; (ii) the MAG project coordinating unit; (iii) IIP; (iv) Bank supervision
missions; and (v) external audits.
6.10        PRONAMACHCS would set up.an in-house monitoring and evaluation
unit which would collect qualitative data on participatory planning, physical and financial
data on rural investments and their impact on poverty and development, data on progress
in institutional strengthening of the communities and efficiency data on
PRONAMACHCS' management and operation. PRONAMACHCS would be
strengthened by a project monitoring specialist. Employment of the monitoring
specialist by PRONAMACHCS before March 31, 1997 has been agreed upon during
negotiations (para 8.1). Terms of reference of the specialist would be included in the
Project operational manual (para 8.2).
6.11        The monitoring indicators would be divided into: (i) project activity
progress indicators; (ii) result indicators; and (iii) project impact indicators. Project
activity indicators include measurements of progress in procurement, recruitment of staff,
studies, training programs, disbursements, the number of rural investments approved,
under implementation and implemented, hectares of terraces built and under irrigation, the
number micro-catchment committees formed, etc. Result indicators would include
production and yield increases, areas with agro-forestry protection, participation of
women, efficiency of the community organizations, and increased management capacity of
PRONAMACHCS. Impact indicators would measure the development impact on
revenue, improvements in local diet, sustainability of the works, entrepreneurial activities



- 28 -
and the local organizations. A list of monitoring indicators is presented in Annex 8
and would be included in the project operational manual (para. 8.2).
6.12        The MAG project coordinating unit would monitor the project through
regular progress reports. IIP would carry out yearly evaluations in ten percent of the
communities to measure project impact on indigenous people.
6.13        The Bank would monitor and supervise the project through six-monthly
progress reports and two supervision missions per year, in which the Borrower would
participate. These supervision missions would cover project progress in: (i) participatory
planning; (ii) physical implementation; (iii) community strengthening; and (iv) operation
and monitoring. They would also review compliance of procurement and disbursement
procedures and statements of expenditure. The supervision plan is in Annex 8.
6.14        Project Launching Workshop. At the outset of the project, Government
would organize a project launching workshop. The Government would invite
representatives of all institutions involved, possible partners in project implementation and
farmers organizations and explain the project objectives, methodology and field of action.
The workshop would also cover (for a more limited public) procurement, disbursements
and project monitoring aspects.
6.15        Mid-Term Review. Thirty months after loan effectiveness, the Bank and
the Government would jointly carry out a mid-term review (MTR) (para 8.1). The
review would cover progress in the physical project achievements and community
strengthening on the basis of the project monitoring indicators. In particular the MTR
would look at: (i) the necessity to expand the eligible investments into artesanal
agricultural processing related activities; (ii) the impact of the improved technology
activities in the five selected micro-catchments; (iii) the need for reallocation of funds;
(iv) the eligibility criteria and beneficiary contributions; and (iv) the development impact.
6.16        Implementation Completion Report (ICR). Not later than six months
after the project closing date, the Government and the Bank would carry out a joint
project completion review and produce an Implementation Completion Report. Following
this review, the Government would present to the Bank a plan for the future operation of
the project, furnish the plan to the Bank for comments, and carry out the plan taking into
account the Bank's comments thereon.
7. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A. METHODOLOGY
7.1         A financial and economic analysis has been carried out for the rural
investment component and for the project as a whole. The underlying analysis is based on



- 29 -
a financial analysis for the rural investment component completed during project
preparation 2. The financial analysis has been adjusted to account for economic prices and
transfer payments to arrive at an economic analysis. Overall project financial and
economic analysis has been prepared by building models based on the component analysis
and detailed costs estimated for the overall project. A detailed description of these
analyses is provided in Annex 7. The methodologies, assumptions, and results are
summarized below.
7.2          Under the rural investments component, subprojects would be implemented
in a variety of agroecological zones throughout the Sierra, where sub-regions have
significantly different climates due to varying altitudes. Additionally, individual
subprojects would be financed largely as the result of a demand-driven, community
participatory process.
7.3          Rather than conducting financial and economic analysis for a set of
pre-defined specific subprojects, several types of subprojects have been analyzed to define
economically viable investment parameters. These subproject types have been selected on
the basis of PRONAMACHCS implementation experience. They are indicative not only
of subprojects expected to be implemented under the project but also of sub-regions in the
Sierra where they are likely to be carried out.
7.4          The analysis has been done on the basis of 12 farm models which are
representative of the principle agroecological zones in the Sierra. The models focus
primarily on crop development since data on grazing and other activities are scarce and the
project is oriented towards agricultural improvements. For each subproject, farm models
represent farm families who benefit primarily from improvements in soil and water
management. Increased production value results from reducing losses due to soil erosion,
increasing irrigated areas while maintaining relatively constant cropping patterns, and
reducing seed or crop losses due to poor storage capacity.
7.5          For each model, with and without project scenarios have been analyzed on
a per ha basis. This yields an incremental benefit per hectare which serves as the basis for
estimating benefits resulting from each subproject type. In general, benefits have been
estimated for a period of twenty years considering that the type of subprojects envisioned
under the project are of a long term investment nature and several years may pass before
tangible benefits are realized. With these benefit flows, using discount rates of 8, 10, and
12 percent, (acceptable levels of) investment cost parameters have been estimated on a per
hectare basis. These parameters serve as the basis for the investment limits defined in
paras. 4.15-16 above. These limits are generally at or below PRONAMACHCS average
subproject investment costs.
12 Detailed studies were conducted by a team of international and local consultants. Under FAO and
Bank supervision, the results of these studies were later adjusted during project pre-appraisal. The
studies and adjusted results are located in the Project Files.

B. RURAL INVESTMENT COMPONENT
7.6          Financial Analysis. Using the above methodology, a financial rate of
return for the rural investment component has been estimated. Additionally, the financial
impact of subprojects on beneficiary families has been estimated. The assumptions and
results for this financial analysis are the following:
7.7          Assumptions for the financial analysis are: (a) commodity prices are based
on farmgate prices for the Sierra; (b) only agricultural activities are taken into
consideration; (c) the cost of unskilled labor is estimated at five soles per day;
(d) maintenance costs are estimated at three percent of investment costs; (e) taxes and
duties are included; and (f) physical contingencies are estimated at five percent of
investment costs.
7.8          The financial impact analysis for beneficiary families also assumes that:
(a) inputs provided under the subprojects are treated as short term in-kind loans without
financial cost; (b) tools provided under the subprojects are treated as donations,
(c) unskilled labor is an in-kind contribution provided by beneficiaries during the
non-farming season; and (d) income taxes on beneficiaries are not included since families
at the poverty level found under the project are typically exempt from these taxes.
7.9          The results show that the subprojects are financially viable. Without
maintenance costs, all subprojects show average financial internal rates of return at
12 percent or better, except for subprojects with just agronomic improvement activities
(where the return is estimated at ten percent). The financial return for the overall
component is estimated at just over 11 percent. Factoring in maintenance costs, the
returns for subprojects generally fall by two to three percent and the return for the overall
component falls to ten percent. However, the financial impact of subprojects on
beneficiary families can be measured not only in terms of financial returns but also in terms
of the value of inputs and tools ("incentives") received. This can range from about
US$10 to US$50 per family for each subproject. Combined with the aforementioned
subproject financial returns, this translates into incremental income per family of about
US$60 to US$250 for each subproject. While the incremental income is spread over
several years, for families with annual incomes of less than US$1,000, it can have a
significant impact, especially since families often participate in more than one subproject
during a given year.
7.10         Economic Analysis. The economic analysis for the component has been
carried out using the same methodology applied for the financial analysis. However,
several adjustments have been made to convert, where applicable, financial prices into
economic prices and to account for transfer payments.
7.11         The same assumptions used for the financial analysis have been used for
the economic analysis, except: (a) economic prices have been estimated for international
commodities such as wheat and corn; (b) the economic opportunity cost of unskilled labor



- 31 -
is estimated at three soles per day (or 60 percent of the financial wage cost); and (c) taxes
and duties for investments are excluded.
7.12         The results show that economic returns improve significantly relative to
financial returns, primarily due to the reduced cost of unskilled labor assumed in the
economic model, as well as the reduction of taxes and subsidies. The unskilled labor is a
weighty factor, particularly in soil conservation subprojects. The economic internal rate of
return is higher than the financial internal rate of return by over five points. Economic
returns for the other subprojects generally improve by about two to three points above
financial returns, although for subprojects such as warehouses, where there is relatively
little unskilled labor involved, the economic and financial returns are about the same. For
the overall component, the economic return is 14 percent, about 4 points higher than the
financial return, after factoring in maintenance costs. Additionally, there are several
positive externalities which, while difficult to quantify, would also yield significant
benefits. These include: reduced urban migration, reduced soil erosion downstream in the
more commercial lower watershed areas, enhanced security and pacification in rural areas,
and enhanced solidarity and social cohesion among rural communities.
C. PROJECT ANALYSIS
7.13         Building on the above financial and economic evaluation, and taking into
consideration project investment costs, financial and economic analysis for the overall
project has been carried out. The assumptions underlying the component analysis remain
the same for the overall project analysis. The principle differences are: (a) costs for
additional components planned under the project are incorporated into the financial model,
and (b) for the economic model, these same additional costs are largely excluded since
associated benefits are non-quantifiable and thus the economic value can not be
incorporated in the benefit stream.
7.14         Financial Analysis. After adding in additional costs for institutional
strengthening, training, and logistical support to PRONAMACHCS, the financial internal
rate of return for the overall project naturally falls by a couple of points. However, the
return remains reasonable at eight percent, still at or above Government's cost of capital,
and arguably an acceptable rate of return for any project oriented towards poverty
alleviation in the Sierra.
7.15         Economic Analysis. The economic internal rate of return for the overall
project is 12 percent. This is again a function of the value of unskilled labor and transfer
payments factors described above, as well as the exclusion of additional component costs
whose benefits can not be quantified. The economic return for the overall project does
not take into consideration the significant positive externalities described above.
D. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
7.16         Sensitivity analysis has been carried out for the rural investment component
and overall project financial and economic analyses. Changes in investment costs and



- 32 -
benefits have been tested to determine the impact of such shifts on the internal rate of
return (IRR). Changes of specific line item costs have also been tested, particularly those
that are weighty in the financial and economic models, such as unskilled labor.
7.17         The results show that the IRR is sensitive to movements in the overall
investment costs and benefits, as well as the cost of unskilled labor. This is also a function
of the timing of investments and benefits, where costs are heavily front-loaded and benefits
more back-loaded. A ten percent shift in costs or benefits yields more than a one percent
shift in the IRR. A ten percent shift in unskilled labor cost yields nearly a one-half percent
shift in the return rate. Investment costs, including for unskilled labor, can and should be
monitored closely to ensure they do not overly exceed investment limits established by the
above analysis. At the same time, since benefits have been estimated conservatively (they
neither include benefits from grazing and other non-farm activities, nor externalities), there
is little concern that these will shift significantly in the wrong direction.
E. BENEFITS
7.18         It is estimated that the project would ultimately benefit about 75,000 poor
families in about 1,250 communities throughout the Sierra. These families are very poor
or extremely poor, maintaining subsistence lifestyles on an average of one half or one
hectare of marginally cultivable land. Incomes are typically less than US$1,000 per family
and opportunities for alternative livelihoods are few.
7.19         As noted, subprojects are financially beneficial, with returns generally at or
above 12 percent. These returns combined with in-kind assistance to subprojects yield
incremental income per family of about US$60 to US$250 for each subproject. The IERR
does not take into account major externalities which include: (i) reduced urban migration,
(ii) reduced soil erosion downstream in the more commercial lower watershed areas,
(iii) enhanced security and pacification in rural areas, and (iv) enhanced solidarity and
social cohesion among rural communities. While these externalities are difficult to
quantify, anecdotal evidence suggests that their economic value is significant. For
example, it is estimated that PRONAMACHCS projects have helped generate about
30,000 jobs per year and reduce destruction of some 75,000 ha of cultivable coastal land
in five years. Even using conservative estimates of the economic value of such benefits,
the savings to society are in the tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars.
F. RIsKs
7.20         The major risks in this project are as follows. The first risk is that
communities insufficiently participate. This can be caused by PRONAMACHCS staff
imposing on communities to carry out non-economic rural investments or by a lack of free
labor in the communities. This risk would be mitigated by the requirement to have
participative planning agreements with the communities before disbursement of project
proceeds, courses in participative planning and a ceiling to the total investment amount per
family. This would reduce incentives to choose non-economic activities and take on more
activities than the community can carry out. The monitoring system would provide data



- 33 -
on subproject implementation, including community labor participation. The second risk
is that soil conservation works would not be followed by improved agronomic practices.
This would reduce the economic profitability of the project. This risk would be mitigated
by providing the communities with extension services and agricultural inputs on a grant
basis for the first year. The community would also receive training to learn how to
manage a revolving system by which the inputs can be yearly replaced. The third risk
would be the lack of funding for PRONAMACHCS. In the past, shortages of funds have
hampered PRONAMACHCS' investment activities, but not its operation. The additional
project-related expenditures would be included in the Government's annual budget. This
is already the case for the 1997 estimated expenditures. The risk of shortages of
counterpart funds would be further mitigated through an ongoing dialogue between the
Bank and the Ministry of Economy and Finance on the adequate provision of counterpart
funds to Bank-financed projects.
G. GENDER ISSUES
7.21        Women carry out major parts of the work in the Andes. They do not
participate sufficiently, however, in the decision making at the community level and in
training. To improve participation by women PRONAMACHCS would: (i) encourage
rural community committees to integrate women so that at least ten percent of the
committee members are women; (ii) recruit more female extension agents so that
20 percent of the extension agents in the project area would be women by the end of the
project; (iii) schedule training programs to involve more women so that every year at least
20 percent of the project training beneficiaries are women; and (iv) carry out 1,250
specific project activities aimed at increasing the revenues of women and improving soil
conservation. These actions would be closely monitored during implementation.
H. INDIGENOUS PEOPLE
7.22        All project beneficiaries can be categorized as indigenous people of the
Andes. The project activities fit within the strategy of the Peruvian Indigenous Institute
which aims at involving the traditional communities in development activities.
A pre-appraisal beneficiary assessment to involve indigenous people in project design has
been carried out. Participatory planning during implementation would continuously
involve indigenous people in the decision-making process. This would be monitored by
IIP. The Government's land registration campaign also ensures that indigenous people
can register titles to their lands. Moreover PRONAMACHCS would finance language
training for non-quechua speaking extension agents and translation of project manuals in
Quechua. IIP would also participate in project impact and monitoring studies to ensure
that indigenous people effectively participate in decision-making and benefit from the
project.
7.23        The activities carried out under the project would fully comply with the
Bank's Operational Directive on indigenous peoples (OD 4.20) for the following reasons.
Indigenous people have been involved in the project design through a beneficiary



- 34 -
assessment. The Ministry of Agriculture has the social, technical and legal skills to carry
out the project. The implementation arrangements would involve the local communities
(comunidades campesinas) in the preparation and implementation of the rural investments.
Local customs (such as community labor) would be widely used during implementation.
The development activities financed under the project would support, revive and try to
improve the ancient production technologies and techniques used by these communities
during centuries. The project would include training in management skills for indigenous
people to avoid over-dependency on PRONAMACHCS. A pilot program in three
micro-catchments would try to improve certain traditional agronomic practices of the
indigenous population. Finally, as part of an effort to comply with OD 4.20 para
15 (a) and (c), an additional assessment of the legal status of the campesinos and
their communities - as reflected in the country's constitution, legislation and
subsidiary legislation--and their ability to obtain access to and effectively use the
legal system would be carried out before March 31, 1997 and an action plan in
agreement with the Bank would be prepared before June 30, 1997 to implement the
study's recommendations in connection with the project (para 8.1). The assessment
would also include the land tenure rights of the communities. Draft terms of reference of
the study are in Annex 10.
I. ENVIRONMENT
7.24        The project would have long term beneficial environmental effects on water
and soil resources at the micro-catchment level. These beneficial effects include soil and
water conservation, reduced sedimentation in streams and improvements in water quality.
The project would also reduce sedimentation to the coastal river basins, thereby reducing
inputs of nutrients from fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides to downstream areas.
A positive list of chemicals to be financed under the project would be established and
included in the operational manual. The integration of environmental considerations into
the construction and operation of small irrigation projects and other off-farm activities at
community levels would mitigate some localized negative environmental impact. Since
there would be numerous subprojects implemented within the micro-catchments, the
overall project would provide cumulative beneficial effects on water quality and
environmental quality. PRONAMACHCS staff would also be trained in environmental
analysis and mitigation. The mitigation and enhancement measures suggested in Annex 9
should ensure the attainment of the benefits. These mitigation measures would be
included in the project operational manual in the form of an environmental
checklist (para 8.2).
J. POVERTY ALLEVIATION
7.25        The chief objective of the project is to increase rural household incomes
and alleviate poverty through sound and sustainable natural resources management,
irrigation and forestry. The micro-catchments selected under the project are almost all
situated in the higher Sierra areas where possibilities for productive development without
outside assistance are rare. In Peru, geography is the indicator with the greatest value as



- 35 -
targeting mechanism: by directing resources to the rural Sierra, one in every two
extremely poor households in the country can be reached. 3 The beneficiary communities
would be selected on the basis of poverty criteria. All project beneficiaries are categorized
as poor, and many are extremely poor. Improved natural resources management would
increase their production and revenue over time and increase food security.
8. AGREEMENTS
8.1          Agreements reached during negotiations:
(a)   PRONAMACHCS would use Bank standard bidding documents for
International Competitive Bidding procurement and bidding documents
acceptable to the Bank for National Competitive Bidding (para. 5.5);
(b)   PRONAMACHCS would employ a specialist in Bank disbursements before
March 31, 1997 (para 5.14);
(c)   the recruitment by PRONAMACHCS of one specialist in promotion and
organization of rural communities per department before March 31, 1997
(para 6.4);
(d)   the project would be carried out in accordance with the implementation
plan including a detailed first year implementation plan, annual revisions of
the plan to be submitted to the Bank for review (para 6.8);
(e)   the recruitment by PRONAMACHCS of a project monitoring specialist
before March 31, 1997 (para 6.10);
(f)   the project monitoring and supervision arrangements including the content
of the Mid-Term Review (para 6.15); and
(g)   the carrying out of a legal assessment of the indigenous peoples rights
before March 31, 1997 and preparing an action plan before June 30, 1997
(para 7.23).
8.2          As a condition of loan effectiveness, PRONAMACHCS will approve the
project operational manual. Such manual to contain procurement procedures and
bidding documents; sample letters for invitation and procedures for evaluation of
consulting services; standard terms of reference for consultants; a procurement
plan; selection and eligibility criteria for micro-catchments; eligibility criteria for
rural organizations; eligibility criteria and beneficiary contributions of rural
investments; draft agreements with communities; a positive list of chemicals to be

procured under agricultural inputs; monitoring indicators; terms of reference for
auditors; terms of reference for the departmental specialist in promotion and
organization of rural communities and monitoring specialist; plan of accounts; and
an environmental checklist, all acceptable to the Bank (paras. 4.4, 4.17; 5.6, 5.8,
5.10, 5.13, 5.15, 5.21, 6.4, 6.10, 6.11 and 7.24).
Recommendation.
8.3          Based on the above, the proposed project is suitable for an IBRD loan of
US$51 million to the Republic of Peru.

ANNEX 1
PERU
SIERRA - NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND
POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT
RURAL INVESTMENTS
A. TECHNICAL STRATEGY
1.          The predominantly semi-arid upper Sierra (above the 2,000 above sea
level) covers about 350,000 km2 and can be divided in three agroecological zones:
(i) valley bottoms - characterized by slopes under 12 percent, deep, fertile soils, abundant
surface water and smooth temperatures; (ii) steeplands - characterized by steep slopes
(average 25-30 percent), shallow soils, limited access to irrigation water, and temperatures
varying from smooth in the lower parts to cold and windy in the upper slopes; and
(iii) high plateaus (above the 4,000 m.a.s.l. line) - characterized by a smooth topography,
poor soils, relatively abundance of water and a cold, windy climate.
2.          Valley bottoms have generally been developed into intensively cropped,
irrigated oasis, with relatively minor soil management problems. They cover about five
percent of the Sierra. Steeplands, covering about 75 percent of the land, are characterized
by extensive, severely eroded and poorly managed rainfed cropping areas. In sites with
better soils and favorable water-access conditions, terrace systems have been constructed
since Inca times, for the establishment of more stable, irrigated farming patterns. Terraced
areas cover about one million ha (0.3 percent of the Sierra), many of them abandoned and
others severely degraded. High plateaus (20 percent of the area) are used mainly for
extensive grazing and are too cold for crops.
3.          The most significant types of natural resource degradation in the Sierra
include severe soil deterioration associated with continuous soil losses, nutrient and
organic matter depletion, gully formation and increased downstream river silting, caused
by water-induced soil erosion and uncontrolled water runoff during the rainy season,
resulting from extensive removal of the natural vegetation, inadequate land use and poor
soil management. This is compounded by uncontrollable natural erosion mainly in the
sparsely vegetated slopes of the steepest Andean areas. Wind erosion is far less
significant.
4.          Water-induced erosion starts when the bare soil is exposed to erosive
rainfall. The impact of rain seals the surface (rainsplash effect). Rain which cannot
infiltrate is lost as surface runoff, carrying away more soil particles and causing sheet an
gully erosion damages, silting of river beds and flooding. To prevent water-induced soil
erosion, a land management strategy must achieve three objectives: (a) minimize
rainsplash effect by protecting the soil surface; (b) minimize excess runoff by maximizing
the amount of infiltration; and (c) minimize water runoffs ability to flow and form gullies



- 38 -
by limiting its accumulation and velocity. A series of land/water management and soil
conservation techniques are used.
5.           The first step is to adjust land use to land suitability. In the Sierra, where
most land is technically inappropriate for crops due to the steep slopes, fanning suitability
usually needs to be generated by upgrading unsuitable to suitable soils, through terracing
and irrigation. On slopes not exceeding 12 degrees, soil conservation can be achieved
through agronomic practices. Above this gradient, however, physical barriers against
erosion are required. In the Sierra, construction of terraces, contour trenches and live
barriers will constitute the leading strategy. In any circumstance, the strategy will be
oriented to maximizing production from the best land and minimizing the use of marginal
land, which translates into developing areas with high potential soils, and designing poor
soils for reforestation and livestock. In areas where the average slope is below the
10-12 percent line, the project would introduce an expanded, comprehensive land
management strategy, with stress on agronomic practices.
6.           To minimize rainsplash effect and excess runoff, farmers would rely on
reduced- or no-tillage techniques, associated with deep ripping, contour cropping, soil
amendments, and raising nutrient and organic matter levels, to stimulate crop biomass
production and productivity; crop diversification and cropping rotations to include green
manure crops, selected seeds, intensified crop density and optimal use of crop residues;
windbreaks to reduce surface evaporation; adequate pasture and herd management; and
use of low-cost vegetative contour barriers with fodder crops or other erosion-control
plants. Generally these practices result in quick improvements in yields and attractive
financial returns.
7.           Water harvesting is an additional objective to be considered as a means to
prevent runoff and soil sliding and store irrigation water for the dry spells. Since the
handling of excessive runoff implies a collectively agreed control plan, the success of the
technical strategy would depend on the involvement of all land users within a
micro-catchment.
8.           In areas unsuitable for improvement, reforestation will be encouraged, both
for conservation and exploitation purposes. The project's technical strategy is based on
land and water management practices detailed in the Technical Manual to be prepared by
PRONAMACHCS. Some of these technologies are readily available for diffusion; others
need to be adapted before being transferred to the farmers.
B. PROJECT INVESTMENTS
1.    Soil Conservation Infrastructure Works
9.           Soil conservation structures create a stable agroecological environment for
sustainable farming in the Sierra and constitutes the project's central strategy. Three main
types of structures are envisaged: bench terraces, slow-formation terraces and infiltration
furrows.



- 39 -
(a)    Bench Terraces or Absorption Terraces (Terrazas de Absorci6n)
10.          Bench terraces are earth embankments constructed in a series of levels like
the steps of a stair, traversing the slopes to prevent erosion and generate suitable soil for
cropping, generally on very steep slopes. Each step is separated from the next by almost
vertical stone walls (or earth risers). Earthen risers may be stabilized with a vegetal cover,
introduced preferably with selected native brush species.
11.          Soil Conservation Impact. The construction of bench terraces upgrades
unsuitable land to first-class cropland. Bench terraces are very effective against erosion.
The deep, leveled soil accumulated in the bench efficiently absorbs rain water and prevents
runoff. Non-absorbed water is conducted to a drainage network. In addition, bench
terraces permit irrigation schemes to increase soil moisture, extend cropping periods and
expand production possibilities. Bench-terrace soils can be improved through organic
matter and fertilization, creating the basis for sustainable production systems.
12.          Targets and Costs. The project's final target over five years is to improve
about 2,350 ha of unsuitable slopes with the construction of hand constructed bench
terraces. The construction costs include labor, tools and local materials (mainly stones
and earth). Total construction cost depends essentially on the amount of labor required.
This varies with the slope, soil depth and the presence of stones. Total costs (including
labor) may vary from about SI. 4,300 to S/. 11,400 per ha, 76 percent of which accounts
for labor. The maximum cost (including labor) allowed under the project is S/. 7,000/ha,
beyond which the activity becomes economically unviable. The total cost of this activity is
estimated at US$6.8 million. The total contribution of the communities, calculated at a
S/. 5/person-day, is estimated at US$5.1 million.
(b)    Slow Formation Terraces (Terrazas de Formacion Lenta)
13.          Used generally on less pronounced slopes, slow-formation terraces (SFT)
are formed by constructing level-contour barriers with stones or earth embankments
across the slopes, to control runoff, favor water infiltration, and convey the accumulation
of runoff-carried soil. Over the years, these sediments stabilize and form smooth-graded
platforms between terraces. The efficiency of SFTs can be increased with the
establishment of vegetated contour rows along the embankments. Where soil depth
permits, live barriers associated with infiltration furrows may replace the embankments.
14.          Soil Conservation Impact. SFT constitute a low-cost, efficient
erosion-control solution for slopes under the 12 percent gradient line. Like bench
terraces, SFT favor water infiltration, allow plowing, and facilitate the use of irrigation.
However, SFT soil conservation effect is slower and stabilization usually requires a period
of 10 years or more. During the formation period, erosion is maintained within the
boundaries of each platform, controlled by the barriers. Erosion is the main formation
factor of this type of terrace. In its final stage, the gradient of the terraced slope would be
flat, and any sheet erosion can be controlled through appropriate agronomic soil
management practices and the inclusion in the system of a proper drainage network. SFT



- 40 -
is an efficient long term technique for transforming soils originally unsuitable for crops
into productive, sustainable farmlands.
15.          Targets and Costs. The target is to improve a total area of about
10,000 ha with slow-formation terraces. SFTs require less labor and tools than bench
terraces. Average total costs vary between S/. 1,350 and S/. 5,080 per ha. The highest
values correspond to extreme situations in which works are spread over a period of three
to five years. In each year the barriers are lifted with a new stone layer to raise the level of
the sediment platform. PRONAMACHCS estimates average labor requirements varying
between 390 and 710 person-days, while tools requirements vary between S/. 680 and 780
per hectare. The financial analysis carried out during preparation shows that, to obtain a
profitability of ten percent, construction costs per ha must not exceed: S/. 5,400 in the
upper Sierra; S/. 3,600 in the central band; and S/. 1,300 in the lower areas. The project
would supply the required tools at an estimated total cost of US$3.5 million over five
years. Communities will contribute 4.5 million person-days, estimated at about
US$9.7 million.
(c)   Infiltration Furrows (Zanjas de Infiltraci6n)
16.         Infiltration furrows (IF) are level contour trenches crossing the slopes
controlling runoff and collecting rain water to increase infiltration and soil moisture. IFs
are constructed in the grassland areas of the upper catchments for pasture improvement or
reforestation.
17.          Soil conservation impact. The impact of IFs on local erosion is
negligible, as their command areas are generally protected by a permanent grass cover.
However, by intercepting runoff, they contribute to reduced downhill runoff volumes and
erosiveness, thus protecting downstream croplands from intensified degradation. IFs main
conservation impact, however, is increasing soil moisture. This contributes to improve
plant growth conditions in the treated areas and raise overall soil moisture and ground
water volumes at micro-catchment level, multiplying the availability of irrigation water.
18.          Targets. The project will construct IFs in a total area of about 14,800 ha.
The labor required for the construction of IFs varies, according to the slope, distance
between furrows and the depth of the trenches, from 190 to 325 person-days per ha, and
the demand for tools from S/. 350 and S/. 430 per ha. Total ha costs vary from S/. 800 to
S/. 1,500. The total cost for the construction of IFs over five years has been estimated at
US$2.6 million. Beneficiaries would contribute US$7.1 million equivalent.
2.    Agricultural Inputs
19.          To ensure higher yields and revenues from these investments and optimize
the use of conservation and irrigation works, the project would promote adoption of
simple, higher performing technological packages comprising mainly improved seeds,
fertilizers and agrochemical. These inputs will be distributed to farmers who completed



- 41 -
the construction of bench terraces and slow-formation terraces as incremental working
capital to farming activities.
20.           Soil Conservation Impact. Quality seeds combined with the use of
fertilizers and proper pest control will contribute to increased crop vigor and,
consequently, to increased soil cover. Higher yields and revenues should encourage
farmers to extend and maintain their soil conservation structures.
21.           Targets and Costs. Delivery of agricultural inputs would start operating
in project-year two, after completing the first-year conservation target. The project would
assist 1,500 ha in years two and three; and 3,000 ha in years four and five. The crops to
be benefit are mainly potatoes (50 percent); maize (25 percent) and barley (25 percent).
The total cost of this component over five years is estimated at US$9 million. Per-ha
costs are as follows:
(in Soles)
Crop          Seeds   Fertilizer  Agrochemical   Total
Potatoes             2,250      800          700        3,750
Maize/barley           70       380          100          585
Average Cost            -         -            -        2,160
3.    Small-Scale Irrigation Works
22.          In the semi-arid environment of the Sierra, the use of conservation
structures can be optimized with the introduction of irrigation, reducing risks and
increasing land productivity. The project would finance construction and/or rehabilitation
of small irrigation works aimed at expanding and improving crop production efficiency.
These works include construction of small reservoirs, improvement of weirs and diversion
structures and the construction and or/lining of water distribution canals. The project
would also promote pressure irrigation by gravity, and supply the corresponding pipes and
sprinklers for its implementation. Most irrigation schemes would benefit the areas treated
with bench (absorption) terraces as well as valley bottoms with a smooth topography.
Sprinkler and drip irrigation will be promoted on slow-formation terraces.
23.           Soil conservation impact. Impact of irrigation on soil conservation is
indirect. It contributes to improve crop vigor, generating increased soil cover (to protect
it against rainsplash and wind erosion) and increased organic matter in the soil through
expanded root systems and a more voluminous aerial vegetation. This improves soil
fertility, increases yields, fosters sustainability, and provides farmers with means to
improve crop husbandry.



- 42 -
24.          Targets and Costs. The project would construct/rehabilitate small
irrigation works to benefit a total area of about 10,000 ha. This would include the
construction/rehabilitation of: (a) 50 water reservoirs; (b) 17 small dams; (c) 80 km of
irrigation canals; and the supply of PVC pipes, hoses and drip-irrigation gadgets, and
sprinklers. Total costs of the irrigation component are estimated at US$22.9 million.
Maximum per hectare costs with irrigation works (including labor, tools, materials and
equipment) have been estimated at US$1,500 in the upper Sierra; US$2,600 in the central
areas; and US$3,100 in the lower catchment zones. Considering the extreme diversity of
such irrigation works, the unskilled labor component is estimated at seven percent.
4.    Reforestation and Agroforestry Activities
25.          There are in the Sierra about 20 million ha of land suitable for forestry,
most of which is bare land exposed to accelerated erosion. About 350,000 ha (2.5 percent
of that area) have already been reforested over the last 15 years, part of which under the
PRONAMACHCS' soil conservation program. These forests are becoming an important
source of firewood and timber for construction materials and furniture in the Sierra.
About 15 percent of the country's sawn timber is being supplied by these forests.
However, for lack of adequate forest management knowledge, local processing facilities
and sound marketing arrangements, timber extraction is not producing the expected
returns. As reforestation is a key soil conservation factor, and the country's demand for
forest products is increasing, forestry development is an important project component. It
would include, besides the production of seedlings and establishment of forest and
agroforestry plantations, actions to improve forest management.
26.          Impact on soil conservation. Forest stands would be planted in areas not
suitable for crops, but good for forestry activities. Forest plantations will be a
complementary activity in the overall micro-catchment system. Forest stands provide a
permanent soil cover and protection against erosion. They absorb and store rain water in
the micro-catchment and reduce the impact of downhill runoff affecting croplands in lower
bands. Forests improve the soils on which they are planted, by incorporating organic
matter and nutrients extracted from the lower soil layers and deposition of leaves and
branches. Agroforestry activities include particularly: (a) windbreaks - to protect soils
against wind erosion and crops against evapotranspiration; (b) live barriers - to control
runoff and establish slow-formation terraces; and (c) alley-cropping - the establishment of
wide-spaced soil-enriching perennial trees, intercropped with annual crops. The best
adapted species for the Sierra have already been established through tests with eucalyptus,
conifer and native species.
27.          Activities and targets. The Agroforestry component, designed to address
the various phases of the activity, includes the following investments:
(a)    Tree Nurseries. Includes the establishment on farmers' land of
infrastructure for production of forest seedlings. Investment items include
fencing, preparation of seed-beds and transplanting platforms, installation



- 43 -
of an irrigation system, tools, plastic bags, and labor. The project would
help establish 540 nurseries.
(b)   Seedling production. The community would, with PRONAMACHCS
assistance, carry out: preparation of seed-beds, seeding, transplanting,
watering, seedling management and selection. Nurseries would produce an
average of 10,000 seedlings per year. The project would help produce
about 20 million seedlings.
(c)    Forest establishment. The accomplished seedlings will be transplanted to
areas established by the participatory micro-catchment planning. Land
preparation previous to planting includes the construction of infiltration
furrows, pegging, and holing. Most plants will be used for agroforestry
and sylvo-pastoral activities, alternated with crops and/or pastures, through
alleys, windbreaks, live fences and vegetated barriers. The remaining
seedlings will be planted for conservation and economic exploitation. The
project would help establish an equivalent of 17,000 ha of forest (trees).
(d)   Forest management. Aimed at ensuring plant survival, it includes: pest
control, protection against damages by domestic animals and cattle,
pruning, thinning, regrowth management, etc., spread along the forest cycle
up to maturity.
28.          Costs. The component's total cost is estimated at US$11.9 million. The
project would finance all requirements for tools, materials, seeds and other inputs, at a
total cost estimated at US$6.9 million, or about 60 percent of the component's total costs.
The communities will supply about 160,000 person days of voluntary labor, rated at a
total cost of about US$3.4 million), or 40 percent of forestry total costs.
5.    Seed and Input Storage Rooms
29.          Construction of small community storage rooms is an efficient complement
to soil conservation investments and has contributed to the sustainability of the farmers
production systems. They are extremely useful for storage of seeds, their maintenance in
good planting condition, and the upkeep of inputs and crop products. The construction of
storage houses is recommended when the quantity of inputs and products exceeds
20 metric tons. They are semi-rustic structures with a very simple design, and constructed
mainly with community labor, using local materials (lumber, bricks, tiles). The project
would finance the complementary construction materials, tools, and the qualified labor.
30.          Soil conservation impact. Well preserved quality seeds will contribute to
produce vigorous crops end ensure good soil cover, protecting soils against erosion,
favoring infiltration and incorporation of increased organic matter in the soil. The
resulting economic gains through reduced risks and increased average yields and revenues
are expected to motivate farmers to adopt improved soil management practices.



- 44 -
31.         Targets and Costs. The project would finance construction of 430 small
storage houses with an average capacity of 25 m.t. The average unit cost is estimated at
S/. 11,742, which includes: qualified labor; construction materials (S/. 5,300); tools
(S/.315); and 750 person-days of unskilled labor. The project would finance
US$1.6 million. The communities would supply labor, estimated at US$800,000.
C. INTENSIVE-MANAGEMENT PILOT MICRO-CATCHMENTS
32.         Introduction. While bench terracing has been successful for upgrading
originally unsuitable soils to productive farmland, and slow-formation terraces have been
introduced by PRONAMACHCS as an efficient low-cost solution for reducing average
slopes, no comprehensive strategy has yet been developed to prevent soil degradation in
these terraces and ensure its sustainability on the long run.
33.         The difficulty of ensuring soil cover after harvest is a major constraint.
Crop residues are eaten by animals and fallow growth is constrained by lack of moisture.
This leaves soils exposed to splash erosion at the first rains of the subsequent season.
Erosion combined with damage by animals and lack of maintenance have degraded most
old terrace systems, and caused low productivity and abandonment. To prevent
degradation, improved soil management practices, not yet systematically tested, need to be
introduced. They include, particularly, adequate soil preparation, fertilizing and manuring,
adoption of efficient irrigation-water distribution, use of ecological band-specific crop
varieties, proper crop densities, and soil conservation effective rotations.
34.         Project Action. To trigger the process of introducing an amplified soil
management strategy in the Sierra, extrapolating the current conventional approach which
concentrates on the construction of physical structures, the project would introduce an
extended, intensified soil management strategy in three pilot micro-catchments to be
defined at appraisal. These micro-catchments are to be selected on the basis of their
agroecological representatives, communities' willingness to participate, and dynamism of
the local PRONAMACHCS technical teams. In these pilot micro-catchments, the
integrated land management strategy will be tested in full.
35.         Participatory planning will follow the same overall methodology adopted
by the project. In addition to the conventional strategy (terracing, reforestation,
irrigation), project implementation could put particular emphasis on: (a) introduction of
improved agronomic, zootechnical and agroforestry practices in both terraced and
non-terraced areas; (b) adaptive research in soil management technologies; (c) water
monitoring to determine project impact on water flows and transport of soil sediments;
(d) realignment and maintenance of feeder roads to neutralize road-born erosion impacts;
and (e) socioeconomic monitoring to determine impact on production and revenues.
36.         Implementation Arrangements. Research and monitoring activities will
be carried out through agreements with relevant public or private specialized institutions
such as INIA, INRENA, Universities, etc. Two pilot micro-catchments would be started
in PY1 and the third in PY3.

ANNEX 2
PERU
SIERRA - NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND
POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT
RuRAL COMMUNITY STRENGTHENING
1.          During project preparation the Government has carried out a beneficiary
assessment in 144 communities located in 30 micro-catchments of eight departments. This
annex provides a summary of the conclusions of this assessment and describes the
community strengthening component. The full report is included in the working paper.
A.    BENEFICIARY ASSESSMENT CONCLUSIONS
Profile of the Target Communities
2.           Most peasant communities in the Sierra are basically groups of families
living in a territory where property rights are vested in the extended family. Decisions are
generally taken in a communal assembly and are carried out by community authorities or
elected community boards. Peasant communities have legal recognition and are legal
entities before the law. 14
3.           Women. According to some estimations women are responsible for
60 percent of agricultural activities. They are usually unaware of their rights and usually
do not participate in management positions within their own communities. Women have
made important labor contributions to PRONAMACHCS activities.
4.           Land Tenure. There are two types of land ownership. Family plots are
exploited without obligation of a contribution to the community. More than 50 percent of
the families own around two hectares of land. Community lands are collectively used by
the whole community under three modalities: (;) natural pastures for the use of all
"comuneros" for livestock purposes; (ii) community agricultural land for common benefit;
(iii) miscellaneous and non cultivated lands (eriazas) including forest lands.
Community Organizations
5.           Community peasant organizations are stable, long term organizations that
enjoy credibility and respect among peasants and its characteristics offer several
advantages for project sustainability. Community organizations in the Sierra evolve
14  Peru Political Constitution recognizes these communities and their ownership of communal land;
Civil Code, according to Decree of July 24, 1984 protects their legal status; Law 24656 of Peasant
Communities declares them of national interest to support their development.



- 46 -
around land ownership and cultural traditions. Top authority lays with the General
Assembly where the main decisions are taken; a board of managers integrate a "Junta
Directiva" including a President, a Vice-President, a Treasurer, Deputy and a Supervisor;
this organization also incorporates municipal authorities related to the political structure of
the country such as the "Teniente Gobernador" and the "Agente Municipal'. All
members are elected democratically in a general assembly attended not only by all
"comuneros" but by their families, including young people and children. Traditional
organizations have proven to respond to requirements of different public and private
programs. The community creates special committees of elected members in charge of
each particular program; such as: conservation, irrigation, water and electricity
committees.
6.          Community Enterprises (Empresas Comunales) have been promoted
according to a model provided by MAG. In the last three years more than 700 such
"empresas" have been developed but not all are functioning successfully. According to
the beneficiary assessment, many peasants participation in empresas comunales has been
out of interest in obtaining public funds rather than just the advantages of incorporating a
modem entrepreneurial management.
Community Willingness to Participate and to Provide Labor
7.          An important aspect of the beneficiary assessment was to identify potential
beneficiaries' willingness to participate in the project; this was measured through
participation levels in PRONAMACHCS activities. Almost 95 percent of peasants
interviewed found the activities very useful for their communities because of the soil
conservation impact. Seventy percent of peasants confirmed that most works were
finished and operating. These works have contributed to recover solidarity and mutual
support rooted in community traditions. Thirty percent mention subprojects with some
level of difficulty; mainly because of conflicts within the community itself
8.          To promote participation PRONAMACHCS has provided four types of
incentives: (i) tools; (ii) seeds and fertilizers; (iii) training; (iv) and eventually, food
support. These incentives are a key factor for ensuring community participation.
Ninety-five percent agreed with the PRONAMACHCS approach, mainly because of the
provision of agricultural inputs and tools (35 percent), although an important group
considered soil conservation, tree nurseries and training also very important. Twenty
percent mentioned that they would not participate without incentives. Seventeen percent
would not be interested if they did not receive food.
9.          The decision on labor commitment are taken by the community assembly.
Each committee establishes its own work program deciding on specific days and times to
carry out different tasks as well as sanctions when members fail to accomplish their
obligations. Penalties include payment of fines and/or additional labor contributions.



- 47 -
10.         Each family contributes, on average, 48 days of free labor per year. When
benefits of conservation are better understood, the yearly contribution can raise to
144 days per family. On average, 50 percent of families in each community participate in
PRONAMACHCS work. The departments with higher number of indigenous population
are also the ones with higher rates of participation because of their cultural tradition of
free labor contributions (minka).
Community Participation and Training
11.         Participation is the key element to achieve all project's objectives.
Participation is necessary to: (i) implement a participatory planning system and undertake
investments that respond to community priorities; (ii) carry out conservation activities
requiring organized participation of communities; (iii) set up a natural resources
management system based on the introduction of participatory research programs; and
(iv) transform community organizations into a more business management oriented
organization.
12.         Training was one of the main requests of communities during the
consultation process. Technical training provided by PRONAMACHCS concerns
conservation works, maintenance and operation of rural infrastructure. Sixty percent
expressed their satisfaction with this effort; however, they also requested a more
aggressive and systematic training program. Peasants expressed their doubts about the
effectiveness of training of "community promoters" and insisted on the need of direct
training through the extension agents to major groups. Twenty-one percent agreed with
the advantages of promoters training and 25 percent preferred a combination of both
training methods. The use of the local language was suggested by 18 percent of peasants.
Moreover, 36 percent mentioned the need for more practical than theoretical courses.
B.  COMMUNITY STRENGTHENING COMPONENT
13.         Objectives. The project would include a component to enhance
community participation, increase awareness of advantages of conservation and better
community organization. The component's objectives would be to: (i) make communities
conscious of the need of preserve natural resources and promote their participation in
PRONAMACHCS conservation activities; (ii) promote creation of micro-catchment
management committees to increase conservation impact; (ii) strengthen the managerial
capacity of peasants community organizations; and (iv) enhance women participation.
14.         Strategy. To achieve these objectives four action lines have been
considered: (i) promotion and participatory planning; (ii) micro-catchment management
committees; (iii) strengthening managerial capacity of community organization; and
(iv) support to women participation.



- 48 -
1. Promotion and Participatory Planning
15.         This action builds on the PRONAMACHCS experience of community
work but promotes a more organized participation of communities. Two activities would
be implemented: a promotion campaign and participatory planning.
16.         Promotion. A yearly promotion campaign woi.ld take place to incremse
participation and disseminate results. This would include:
(a) preparation of bilingual pamphlets: a set of 30 pamphlets per community
would be prepared relating to: (i) the participatory approach of the project; (ii) the need
to improve community organization; and (iii) free labor contributions; and
(b) radio broadcasts would be organized in each branch to respond to local
conditions and interest, languages and education and cultural levels.
17.         A participatory planning process would be implemented to ensure
community participation in all stages of the project according to the following cycle:
(a)   initial approach of PRONAMACHCS with community authorities to
explain project objectives, procedures and conditions;
(b)   agreement to participate by community assembly and designation of special
committee members;
(c)   each community, with the support of the PRONAMACHCS extension
agents would: (i) identify the community's potential and needs;
(ii) diagnose the socioeconomic conditions; (iii) assess the organization
capacity; (iv) identify of possible conflicts and risks to introduce preventive
measures; (v) estimate free labor contributions, by gender and age; and
(vi) identify needs to strengthen community organization and training;
(d)   preparation of a participatory plan including: (i) soil conservation
activities; (ii) rural infrastructure; (iii) forestry and agroforestry;
(iv) technical training and assistance; (v) community organization
strengthening;
(e)   implementation directly controlled by community through its special
committee;
(f)   monitoring and evaluation through periodic meetings of special committee
and PRONAMACHCS; and
(g)   preparation of plan for following year.
18.         The community would receive practical training when preparing
participatory plans. This would be reinforced by more formal training for communities



- 49 -
grasping this approach and able to incorporate it as part of decision-making. Training
would initiated in the third project year, once the participatory planning process is general
practice. Training would be provided to the most advanced communities; coverage would
begin with 40 micro-catchments in the third year to reach 125 the last year. By the end of
the project, at least 20 percent of the communities involved would be able to prepare
participatory plans on their own.
2. Micro-catchment Management Committees
19.         Ninety percent of the peasants agreed on the need to organize activities at
micro-catchment level. Peasants mentioned as main advantages of such organization:
(i) a more integrated execution of investment works; (ii) an increase in management
capacity; (iii) sharing experiences; (iv) marketing improvements; and (v) better land use.
Peasants consider as main obstacles to create micro-catchment committees: (i) the lack of
experience to undertake such organization and thus the need of training; (ii) distance
between communities. Other important problems mentioned were conflicts in some
miicro-catchments and differences in natural resources availability and development level
that might raise conflicts.
20.         These results show the importance of supporting communities creating
organizations larger than their boundaries and point out areas where potential conflicts
might occur. Therefore, it is necessary to initiate the process of organization at
community level to ensure community ownership. Peasants themselves suggested a
consultation process as a first stage to create a steering committee to promote the idea and
define a strategy. This process should also involve other entities, public and private,
acting at the micro-catchment level as well as municipal authorities.
21.         This process would include the following steps: (i) promotion to create
this committee and consultation among grass root organizations and authorities in each
community to reach an agreement on the subject; (ii) periodical meetings to initiate
common resolutions; (iii) annual meetings of community representatives, leaders, and
authorities to prepare a formal agreement to create the committee and prepare a common
action plan; (iv) concertation with public and private organizations, as well as local
authorities to decide upon complementary activities; (v) support to formalize the
organization of the committee; (vi) preparation of medium and long term programs at the
micro-catchment level; and(vii) training of participant members in each committee to be
able to prepare, implement and manage agreements on an accountable basis.
22.         The project would finance a gradual process including community
workshops, micro-catchment concertation meetings and training.
(a)   Community Workshops: Extension agents would introduce the concept
of micro-catchment organization, helping communities to identify actions
to be executed at the micro-catchment level; all 1,250 communities would



- 50 -
carry out a yearly workshop to define such proposal; this process would
ensure active community participation instead of top-down decisions.
(b)   Micro-catchment Concertation Meetings: Although informal meetings
can be organized, PRONAMACHCS would ensure that at least once a year
communities in each micro-catchment would meet to reach agreements on
common actions and mechanisms to organize a micro-catchment
management committee.
(c)   Training to Organize and Manage Micro-catchment Committees: It is
expected that by the third year consultation and concertation processes
would be consolidated and that formation of committees would be in
process; to support these results participants in committees would receive
training in aspects such as: legal mechanisms and procedures,
administration and management; management for services provision, etc.
23.         As a result of this process it is expected that at least 50 of such committees
would be created and operating on sustainable basis; also 250 agreements of coordinated
actions and training of all participants in these committees are project goals.
3. Strengthening the Managerial Capacity of Community Organizations
24.         This training aims at efficient management of investments, business leaders,
a more efficient organization of communities and emerging of local initiatives. Three main
lines of training would be developed.
(a)   Training in Management of Revolving Stock of Agricultural Inputs.
Fund Committees are in charge of provision of agricultural inputs.
Presently their operational results have been mixed and training would
provide skills to improve performance and a more transparent management.
This training should ensure: (i) adequate integration and operation;
(ii) autonomous management by the community; and (iii) higher recovery
levels. Through this training, communities should be able to manage
independently and select the best alternative to recover inputs. At the end
of the Project, at least 1,000 revolving stocks would be operating properly
with average recovery levels of 70 percent.
(b)   Training in Management of Rural Investment Accounts. A special
committee manages the community works and resource administration
through an account administered jointly by this special committee and
PRONAMACHCS. Although this mechanism has been successfuil, it is
important to enable the committee to manage the account with decreasing
PRONAMACHCS supervision.
(c)   Training to Develop the Communities Managerial Capacity. This
training would be provided on demand to respond to particular needs of



- 51 -
each community. A special menu of basic training would be prepared to
target community authorities and leaders and "promoters" designated by
communities. As a result of this training it is expected that each
community would have at least three promoters per community.
4. Support of Rural Women Participation
25.         As a recognition of the important role played by women in the Sierra and
their contribution to PRONAMACHCS efforts, a special program would support women
participating in the project with small productive projects, including: (i) small livestock
development; (ii) family food gardens; (iii) medicinal plant production; (iv) basic
processing of agriculture products. The general rules to obtain this incentives are:
(i) beneficiaries would contribute with al least 20 percent of the total cost; (ii) support is
subject to actual participation in conservation activities; (iii) activities should be
sustainable; (iv) beneficiaries are committed to disseminate their experiences in their
communities; and (v) investment is limited to US$1,500 per community.
5. Implementation
26.         Implementation of this component builds on PRONAMACHCS' existing
capacity. A specialist in Promotion and Community Development would be hired at
department level to guide implementation. This specialist would have: (i) experience in
community development and organization; (ii) knowledge about socioeconomic and
cultural conditions of Sierra communities; (iv) experience with PRONAMACHCS
activities; and (v) knowledge or training to be able to communicate in native languages.
The main functions would include to: (i) overlook implementation ensuring adequate
coverage and impact; (ii) coordinate design, execution and results of community training;
(iii) promote and coordinate different activities to implement micro-catchment
management committees; (iv) coordinate and evaluate component impact.
27.         The existing Promotion Unit in PRONAMACHCS would support
component implementation through activities such as: (i) design and preparation of
bilingual pamphlets; (ii) design and preparation of radio broadcast; (iii) support to execute
community workshops; (iv) support micro-catchment meeting organization; (v) design and
support of execution of Rural Women Participation Program; and (vi) promote
agreements with other public and private organizations.
6. Monitoring and Impact Evaluation
28.         Promotion and Participation. These actions have a quantitative dimension
that can be measured with two indicators: (i) coverage of promotion, for instance,
number of communities reached by radio broadcasts and pamphlets distributed; and
(ii) number of beneficiaries reached by the project. The qualitative dimension of
participation is more difficult to measure, nevertheless, the following results can provide
some valuable information: (i) free labor contribution per gender; (ii) attendance to
workshops and training courses; (iii) community representatives attending



- 52 -
micro-catchment meetings; (iv) number of committees created an working on a sustainable
basis; (v) number of participatory plans prepared by the communities themselves.
29.         Micro-catchmentManagement Committees. The simplest measure is to
account for the number of such committees integrated under the project; however, the
impact of such organization should consider real changes in the management of activities
at the micro-catchment level. The following indicators would be useful to both purposes:
(i) community workshops celebrated at the micro-catchment level; (ii) number of
micro-catchment annual meetings carried out; (iii) number of agreements signed and
implemented; and (iv) participation and support provided by municipal authorities.
30.         Strengthening Communities Managerial Capacity. Training and
experience would strengthen community management capacity. Such result can only be
measured in the medium or long term. However, it is important to monitor: (i) the
number of beneficiaries trained; (ii) success of different courses, measured by sustained
attendance and trainees evaluation of courses; and (iii) analysis of failures. To capture the
qualitative dimension of the project's impact on community traditional organizations the
following aspects can be useful: (i) number of input revolving stocks operating with rates
of recovery bigger than 70 percent; (ii) number of entrepreneur promoters working per
community; and (iii) emerging community initiatives in relation to conservation,
productivity improvements, marketing and/or entrepreneurial activities.
31.         Enhancing Women Participation. Women participation should be
monitored in all aspects of project implementation in quantitative and qualitative aspects.
Following indicators are recommended: (i) labor contributions; (ii) number of women
attending training courses; (iii) number of women appointed at any committees created
under the project; (iv) women attending micro-catchment meetings and/ or appointed as
community representatives; and (v) female entrepreneur promoters. Additionally,
programs implemented to be an incentive for women participation should be monitored
and evaluated considering aspects such as: (i) number of programs implemented and
beneficiaries (ii) replication of the programs in the community; and (iii) programs
operating on sustainable and self-sufficient basis.

PERU
SIERRA - NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND
POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, EXTENSION AND TRAINING
Rural Extension
1.          Organization. Practically all project components will be handled through
the extension structure. Extension will be coordinated, and to a large extent carried out,
by PRONAMACHCS, through its existing structure. An extension coordinator, assisted
by three professionals, will be responsible for extension coordination. The field structure
will consist of 20 PRONAMACHCS branch offices. Each office will cover about seven
micro-catchments, and will include a nucleus team of subject-matter specialists (SMS),
covering soil conservation, irrigation, forestry, and community strengthening aspects.
These teams will be responsible for project promotion, micro-catchment selection and
planning, and technical and administrative project support.
2.           Extension agents. Permanent technical assistance to the farmers will be
ensured by field extension agents - one per about seven communities. They will be
selected amongst PRONAMACHCS and MAG technical staff, according to their
professional profile and language proficiency, and deployed to the project after receiving
pre-service training. The current staff of PRONAMACHCS's 20 branches includes
60 SMS professionals (three per office) and 120 extension agents (six per office). The
foreseen incremental number of extension agents to be re-deployed to the project is
estimated at 100. This will raise the total number of project extension agents to 400, and
ensure an average staff of 14 extension agents per office by year three.
3.           Subject matter specialists. The SMS teams will be responsible for the
selection of micro-catchments and will coordinate rapid rural appraisals and preparation of
micro-catchment development plans. They will be further select, train, help and supervise
the field extension agents. They will also supervise the implementation of the
project-funded community investment accounts. Field extension agents will participate
with the SMS teams in the rapid rural appraisals and participatory planning of the
micro-catchments to which they are deployed. They will promote the organization of the
communities and interest groups and assist these groups to prepare land management farm
plans and implement the planned activities.
4.           Promoters. In each assisted community, extension agents will train two or
more local soil conservation promoters, elected by the community to help implementation
and assist farmers to adopt the recommended soil conservation technologies. Extension
agents will be permanently backed up in all these tasks by the regional SMS teams. A field
extension agents will visit an average of two communities per day. This will allow him to



- 55 -
pay a weekly visit to each community, and dedicate one day per week for studies and
office work. Once a week, he will be accompanied by an SMS member.
5.           Costs. The costs of the extension component are estimated at
US$4.3 million.
Training
6.          Intensive training and periodic updating on soil and water management,
group dynamics, production technologies and economics will enable SMS and extension
agents to carry out their mandate. The training program will include the following main
activities: (i) pre-service training; (ii) seminars, workshops and short courses;
(iii) exchange of experiences; and (iv) technical visits to natural resources management
projects in other countries.
A. Pre-service Training
7.           The central objectives of pre-service courses are to familiarize the technical
staff with the project and supply them with the essential technical and operational
information for project implementation. The basic structure of these courses will include
elements on: (i) main natural resources degradation problems in Peru; their social and
economic context, and impact, past experience in addressing these problems; (ii) project
objectives, strategy, scope and design; (iii) participatory surveys and soil conservation
planning at micro-catchment level, the use of maps and images; (iv) technologies for
implementing the project's technical strategy; (v) operational strategy, extension
methodology, group dynamics, community organization; micro-catchment management;
revolving stock; and (vi) elements of rural economy applied to the Sierra.
8.           The above structure will be adapted, respectively to professionals
(graduates) and extension agents (technicians), in a differentiated manner, taking account
their previous training and experience with natural resources management in the Sierra.
The courses will have a duration of six days for professionals and ten days for extension
agents, will be administered by PRONAMACHCS specialists, national experts and
international consultants, and organized for groups of about 25 participants, covering a
total staff of 125 professionals and 250 extension agents.
B. Seminars and Workshops
9.           Their objective is to complement pre-service training and update the staffs
knowledge on technical and operational matters, with an important practical training
component with conspicuous field activities. They will be divided in national workshops,
and regional workshops.
10.         National workshops are designed to deepen the technical training of the
project's SMS professionals. They will also be used for evaluating the achievements of the
previous year and programming the activities of the subsequent year. National workshops
will generally be organized by specialty, including respectively soil conservation (physical



- 56 -
structures and agronomic aspects), irrigation, and forestry. Three yearly national
workshops are foreseen, one by group of 20 professionals of each specialty (one
professional per regional office). The 7 Department directors would also participate,
totaling 27 participants by workshop. Each workshop will have an average duration of
three days.
11.          Regional workshops objectives are similar to those of national workshops,
but focused on Department-level aspects, and will involve all SMSs and extension agents
of each Department. During the first three years of the project, regional workshops will
aim essentially at complementing pre-service training, with practical courses scheduled
according to the seasonal cycle of field activities. In project years four and five, the
courses would focus on technical updating and improvement, essentially addressed to
department-level problems. The courses will have an average duration of two days.
C. Exchange of Experiences
12.          This training modality would stimulate the extension of successful local
experiences to the rest of the project area, through technical visits of project professionals
and extension agents to the areas of other PRONAMACHCS offices. Once a year two
representatives of each project office will spend one day visiting a conspicuous land
management experience in another jurisdiction, participating in field days or other events
especially organized for this purpose. The yearly number of participants would be 40.
D. Study Tours
13.          They envisage the exchange of experiences with natural resources
management projects in other countries, mainly in Latin America. It is envisaged to offer
each project-related professional the opportunity to participate in one such visits abroad,
over the five years of the project. The average number of professionals per group/year
will be 14 (total 70). Average duration is eight days per study tour.

POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL EVALUATION
1.          Introduction. Financial and economic analysis has been carried out for the major
project component, the Rural Investment Component, as well as for the project as a whole. The
underlying analysis is the result of consultant studies completed during preparation of the
project'5, and is essentially a financial analysis for the Rural Investment Component. The
underlying analysis has been adjusted to account for economic prices and transfer payments to
develop an economic analysis for the Component. Finally, overall project financial and economic
analysis has been prepared by building models based on the Component analysis and detailed costs
estimated for the overall project. The results of these analyses are summarized in the attached
Tables 1 through 4. The methodologies and assumptions utilized are described below.
2.           Target Population. It is estimated that the project would ultimately benefit over
75,000 poor families in about 1,250 communities throughout the Sierra. These families are very
poor or extremely poor, maintaining subsistence lifestyles on an average of one half or one
hectare of marginally cultivable land. Incomes are typically less than US$1,000 per family and
opportunities for alternative livelihoods are few.
3.           Methodology. Under the rural investment component, a large number of various
types of subprojects would be implemented in a variety of agroecological zones throughout the
Sierra. For example, these include three or four different types of soil conservation projects, a
half-dozen or more types of irrigation projects, construction of seed warehouses, various
reforestation activities, and improved agronomic techniques. Furthermore, these subprojects
would be implemented throughout the Sierra, where sub-regions have significantly different
climates due to varying altitudes and weather conditions. Finally, individual subprojects would be
selected for financing largely as the result of a demand-driven, community participatory process.
4.          In light of the above, rather than conduct financial and economic analysis for a set
of pre-defined specific subprojects, several types of subprojects have been analyzed, with the
objective of defining economically viable investment parameters. These subproject types have
been selected on the basis of PRONAMACHCS twelve years of experience. They are indicative
not only of subprojects expected to be implemented under the project but also of sub-regions in
the Sierra where it is likely they will be carried out.
15 Detailed studies were conducted by a team of international and local consultants. Under FAO and Bank
supervision, the results of these studies were later adjusted during project pre-appraisal. The studies and
adjusted results are located in the Project Files.



- 64 -
5.           The analysis has been carried out on the basis of 12 farm models representative of
the principle agroecological zones. The models represent the present and future agriculture
scenarios of the different project areas. They focus primarily on crop development since data on
grazing and other activities are scarce and the project is in any case oriented towards agricultural
improvements. Cropping intensity and water use efficiency at the outset of the project reflect
current practice. With few exceptions, the specific crop models assume a constant input/output
relationship. While this is a conservative assumption, it allows to focus on project benefits related
to subproject enhancements and not speculative advances in agriculture development.
6.           For each subproject, farm models represent farm families who benefit primarily
from improvements in soil and water management. Increased production value results from
reducing losses due to soil erosion, increasing irrigated areas while maintaining relatively constant
cropping patterns, and reducing seed or crop losses due to poor storage capacity. In some cases,
the potential for enhanced agriculture development in higher value crops (e.g., onions) is currently
hindered primarily by poor irrigation. Thus, it is assumed that the development of such potential
under the project is directly related to irrigation improvement (as opposed to new agriculture
development practices). The models show an evolution over a twenty-year period, the expected
useful life of the subprojects (except for reforestation where only a one-time benefit is expected
about ten years after the initial investment). Most subprojects have a lag of about two to four
years before benefits begin to accrue and full development is only reached about eight years after
initial investments are made. Each model differs based upon current and expected cropping
patterns for a given area and its size.
7.           The models represent four different agricultural/technological approaches in three
different sub-regions of the Sierra. The agricultural approaches are: traditional dry agriculture,
dry agriculture with improved agronomic techniques, traditional irrigation agriculture, and
irrigation agriculture with improved agronomic techniques. While climatic and soil conditions are
extremely diverse throughout the Sierra, to simplify the analysis, three primary agroecological
zones have been identified. These are the High Sierra (3,400 - 4,000 meters), the Middle Sierra
(2,700 - 3,400 meters) and the Lower Sierra (2,000 - 2,700 meters). Each zone has a
representative set of crops, many of them highly localized and produced strictly for the internal
market, with potatoes being the most commonly produced among all three regions. Wheat and
corn are the only potentially international commodities and they are produced predominantly in
the Middle and Lower Sierra zones. Onions are also commonly produced in these two zones.
8.           For each model, with and without project scenarios have been analyzed on a per
hectare basis. This yields an incremental benefit per hectare which serves as the basis for
estimating benefits resulting from each subproject type. In general, benefits have been estimated
for a period of twenty years considering that the type of subproject types envisioned under the
project are of a long term investment nature; that is, several years may pass before tangible
benefits are realized. With these benefit flows, using discount rates of 8, 10, and 12 percent,
(acceptable levels of) investment cost parameters have been estimated on a per hectare basis.
These parameters serve as the basis for the investment limits defined in para. 4.15 of this Staff
Appraisal Report. Due to the highly localized nature of the subprojects, it is difficult to compare
these limits to "standard" or "internationally acceptable" investment levels. However, they are
generally at or below PRONAMACHCS average subproject investment costs.



- 65 -
9.           The types of subprojects analyzed for each of the farm models are: absorption
terraces (TA), slow-forming terraces (TFL), ditches, reforestation, irrigation, intensive watershed
management (IWM) (agronomic improvements) and warehouses. For TA, TFL and irrigation
subprojects, for each sub-region of the Sierra, an incremental benefit per hectare has been
calculated. However, subprojects such as TA and TFL would be predominantly implemented in
the Middle and Upper Sierra where technical and economic viability of these subprojects is the
greatest. Similarly, irrigation subprojects would be implemented largely in the Middle and Lower
Sierra. As such, for TA and TFL subprojects, the incremental benefit per hectare used in the
financial and economic projections reflects the average of the benefit estimated for just the Middle
and Upper Sierra. For irrigation, the incremental benefit per hectare used in the projections is the
average of that estimated for the Middle and Lower Sierra. For ditches, the incremental benefit
per hectare is assumed to be only about 60 percent of that for TFL since, while the two are
technically usually implemented jointly, most of the benefits come from TFL. In the case of
reforestation and warehouses, benefit estimates are based on case experiences and data regarding
the sale of wood and reduction in seed losses respectively. The specific benefit estimates are
provided in the attached Tables 1-4 under the sections on Notes and Assumptions.
Rural Investment Component: Financial Analysis
10.          Using the above methodology, a financial rate of return for the Component has
been estimated. Additionally, drawing on documented experience from specific subproject cases,
sirnilar to those defined in the above farm models, the financial impact of subprojects on
beneficiaries has been estimated. Assumptions and results for this financial analysis as follows.
11.         Assumptions:
(a)   agricultural commodity prices are estimated using farm-gate prices for the Sierra,
averaged over the past several years to eliminate the impact of significant positive
price movements in the fourth quarter of 1995;
(b)   only agricultural activities are taken into consideration since agriculture is the
primary means of income/livelihood in the rural Sierra and the investments under
the project are oriented primarily towards improvements in agricultural output; as
such, benefits do not reflect improvements in grazing and trading activities which
could occur;
(c)   the cost of unskilled labor is estimated at 50 percent of the urban minimum wage,
yielding a cost of five soles per day;
(d)   recurrent costs following the project are primarily for operation and maintenance
of some of the investments; these costs are estimated yearly at 3 percent of
investment costs;
(e)   taxes and duties for investments are included in the investment costs;



- 66 -
(f)    physical contingencies, estimated at 5 percent of investment costs, are included in
total costs; however, price contingencies are not since the impact of movements in
prices is demonstrated in the sensitivity analysis described below; and
(g)   for analyzing the financial impact of subprojects on beneficiary families: (i) inputs
provided under the subprojects are treated as short term in-kind loans without
financial cost; (ii) tools provided under the subprojects are treated as donations;
(iii) unskilled labor an in-kind contribution provided by beneficiaries during the
non-farming season; and (iv) income taxes on beneficiaries are not included since
families at the poverty level found under the project are typically exempt from
these taxes.
12.          Results. The results show that the subprojects are financially viable, particularly
before taking into consideration ongoing operation and maintenance costs. Without operation
and maintenance EM costs, all subprojects show average financial internal rates of return at
12 percent or better, except for subprojects with just agronomic improvement activities (where
the return is estimated at ten percent). Returns for reforestation are notably high (28 percent) but
these returns cannot be realized until eight to ten years after the initial investment, so significant
demand for these subprojects is not expected. The financial return for the overall Component is
estimated at just over 11 percent.
13.          Factoring in operation and maintenance costs, the returns for subprojects generally
fall by two to three percent and the return for the overall Component falls to ten percent.
However, the financial impact of subprojects on beneficiary families can be measured not only in
terms of financial returns but also in terms of the value of inputs and tools received. This is
particularly true since beneficiaries make no financial contributions under the subprojects and,
while they do contribute significant amounts of unpaid labor, this is done mostly in the off season
when alternative opportunities (particularly for cash) are few or non existent. The financial value
of these inputs and tools ranges greatly depending on the subproject type. Soil conservation (and
some reforestation) subprojects usually include more of these "incentives" than irrigation related
subprojects. Other subprojects, such as warehouses, with higher financial returns, include few
incentives. In any case, the financial value of these incentives can range from about US$500 to
US$2,500 per subproject/community - with about 50 families per community, this translates into a
financial value of about US$10 to US$50 per family for each subproject. This combines with
financial returns of around 10 to 12 percent for subprojects, which translate into incremental
income per family of about US$50 to US$200 for each subproject. Such incremental income is of
course spread out over several years, since subproject benefits only begin to flow after two to
four years in most cases, and only reach full development about eight years after the initial
investments are made. Nonetheless, for families with annual incomes of less than US$1,000, this
incremental income can have a significant impact, especially since families can and do often
participate in more than one subproject during a given year.
Rural Investment Component: Economic Analysis
14.          The economic analysis for the Component has been carried out using the same
methodology applied for the financial analysis. However, several adjustments have been made to



- 67 -
convert, where applicable, financial prices into economic prices and to account for transfer
payments. The same assumptions used for the financial analysis have been used for the economic
analysis, except as follows:
15.          Assumptions:
(a)    most agricultural commodities in the Sierra are non-tradable; as such farm prices
for these products are the same as economic prices; for internationally marketable
products, wheat and corn, economic prices have been estimated taking the CIF
price plus the cost of shipping to the Sierra - the resulting economic prices are
slightly higher than the financial prices;
(b)   the economic/opportunity cost of unskilled labor is substantially less than the
financial cost since there are few work opportunities in the Sierra during the
non-farming season - this cost is estimated at three soles per day; and
(c)   taxes and duties for investments are excluded since they are transfer payments.
16.          Results. Economic returns improve significantly relative to financial returns,
primarily due to the reduced cost of unskilled labor assumed in the economic model, as well as the
reduction of taxes and subsidies. The unskilled labor is a weighty factor, particularly in soil
conservation subprojects. This impacts costs both on the investment side and in terms of
operation and maintenance. As such, taking this impact combined with the effect of eliminating
taxes and subsidies, the economic internal rate of return is higher than the financial internal rate of
return by over five points. Economic returns for the other subprojects generally improve by about
two to three points above financial returns, although for subprojects such as warehouses, where
there is relatively little unskilled labor involved, the economic and financial returns are about the
same. For the overall component, the economic return is about four points higher than the
financial return, after factoring in operation and maintenance costs.
17.          These results are favorable, although they may be skewed somewhat by the cost of
unskilled labor factor. Notwithstanding this factor, the economic results still do not incorporate
external benefits which are difficult to quantify. These include: reduced urban migration, reduced
soil erosion downstream in the more commercial lower watershed areas, enhanced security and
pacification in rural areas, and enhanced solidarity and social cohesion among rural communities.
18.          While these benefits are essentially non-quantifiable, some anecdotal evidence can
provide an idea of the potential magnitude of these benefits. For example, detailed studies have
shown that, at its current implementation level, PRONAMACHCS activities result in generating
approximately 65,000 jobs per year16. The proposed project would support at least this current
level of implementation on an annual basis, if not expand PRONAMACHCS implementation
capacity. As such, given a project life of five years (although implementation activities would
likely continue beyond this period), about 325,000 jobs could be generated. If urban migration is

- 68 -
reduced by only half that amount, assuming the social cost of maintaining a rural immigrant in
Lima is just half the minimum wage, this yields a savings of over US$80 million.
19.          Similarly, detailed studies have shown that, since about 1990, nearly
300,000 hectares of cultivable land in the coast have been lost to soil erosion17. One of the
principle causes of such soil erosion in the coast has been poor natural resource management in
the upper watershed areas of the Sierra. Naturally, poor agricultural practices in the coast are
also important factors leading to the same negative impact. Nevertheless, if poor resource
management in the Sierra is responsible for just 25 percent of the lost cultivable land, or
75,000 ha, the economic loss is substantial. Taking coastal land values at just US$1,000/ha (and
irrigated land values up to 10 times higher), the economic losses would be about US$75 million.
Project Analysis
20.          Building on the financial and economic evaluation described above for the Rural
Investment Component, and taking into consideration detailed investment costs estimated for the
project, financial and economic analysis for the overall project has been carried out. The
assumptions underlying the Component analysis remain the same for the overall project analysis.
The principle differences are: (a) for the overall project financial analysis, the costs for additional
components planned under the project are incorporated into the financial model; and (b) for the
overall project economic analysis, costs for additional components planned under the project are
largely excluded since associated benefits are non-quantifiable.
21.          Financial Analysis. After adding in additional costs for institutional strengthening,
training, and logistical support to PRONAMACHCS, the financial internal rate of return for the
overall project naturally falls by a couple of points. However, the return remains reasonable at
eight percent, still at or above the Government's cost of capital, and arguably an acceptable rate
of return for any project oriented towards poverty alleviation in the Sierra.
22.      Economic Analysis. The economic internal rate of return for the overall project is
again several points higher than the financial rate. This is again a function of the unskilled labor
and transfer payments factors described above, as well as the exclusion of additional component
costs with unquantifiable benefits. The economic return for the overall project is estimated at
12 percent, without taking into consideration the significant positive externalities described above.
Sensitivity Analysis
23.          Sensitivity analysis has been carried out for the Rural Investment Component and
overall project financial and economic analyses. Switching values are not calculated, since the
internal rates of return already reflect values assuming a net present value of zero and these return
rates are near the Bank standard opportunity cost of capital. Rather, movements in investment
costs and resulting benefits have been tested to determine the impact such shifts would have on
17 Source: MAG, Preparation Study for Land & Water Management Project, Shaner, et al.



- 69 -
the internal rate of return. Movements of specific line item costs have also been tested,
particularly those that are weighty in the financial and economic models, such as unskilled labor.
24.          The results are shown in the attached Tables 1 through 4. In general, the internal
rate of return is somewhat sensitive to movements in the overall investment costs and benefits.
A 10 percent shift in costs or benefits yields more than a 1 percent shift in the rate of return. This
is the result of analyzing a select number of representative cases, with somewhat similar patterns,
rather than developing hundreds of models needed to represent the great diversity found in the
Sierra. It is also a function of the timing of investments and benefits, where benefits are heavily
front-loaded and benefits more back-loaded. Smoothing the investment costs and front-loading
more of the benefits would yield less sensitivity. However, that would be unrealistic since in
practice most of the subprojects do not yield results until after several crop rotations.
25.          Among specific cost items, unskilled labor is by far the most sensitive to
movements. A ten percent shift in unskilled labor yields nearly a one-half percent shift in the
return rate. As mentioned above, this is a function of the weightiness of this factor in the overall
cost model. This begs the question, are the unskilled labor cost assumptions reasonable.
The financial price of five soles per day is reasonable since it is representative of what has been
occasionally paid to unskilled workers under programs other than PRONAMACHCS. It is also
half the minimum wage paid in the urban sector, not unreasonable considering the cheaper living
costs in the Sierra relative to say Lima. On the other hand, FONCODES pays unskilled laborers
ten soles per day. This, however, tends to distort the rural labor market. First, cash payments for
unskilled labor in the Sierra are rare. Second, the level of payment is equal to or higher than what
a laborer would normally earn through his/her own traditional farming activities. As such,
FONCODES payments draw workers away from their normal activities for temporary work. This
provides an incentive for the local population to choose to work on Government projects just
because of the relatively high wages. It also creates an incentive for workers to promote projects
with higher labor requirements, regardless of their utility, because of the same wage factor.
26.          In sum, while the financial and economic models are somewhat sensitive to shifts
in key factors such as investment costs, benefits, and unskilled labor costs, the models are
reasonably reflective of reality and appropriately address distortions. As such, they serve as a
useful tool for monitoring movements of these key factors. In particular, investment costs,
including for unskilled labor, can and should be monitored closely to ensure they do not overly
exceed investment limits established by the above analysis. At the same time, since benefits have
been estimated conservatively (they do not include benefits from grazing and other non-farm
activities, nor externalities), there is little concern that the rates of return will shift in the wrong
direction.

Notes and Key Assumptions:
1) Figures may not add precisely due to rounding; they also may be slightly different than those in detailed cost tables due to slightly different exchange rate assumptions
2) Financial costs have been estimated as follows
a) investment costs lor inputs (insumos) have been reduced by 50% since they are partially incorporated in the calculations for incremental benetis
b) recurrent costs following the project have been estimated at 3% o0 investment costs
c) the price for mano de obra no ca8ficada is 5soles/ornal
d) farm prices (In the sierra) are used for all products; for tradable products wheat and corn, prices are 0.6 soles/kg and 0.4 solesfRg respectively
e) taxes and duties are Included In the base costs
3) Benefit streams for each subproject type have the following lag times (year aoter investment when benefit flows begin) and unit benefits per year.
a) Terrzas de Absorclon: 3rd, 800 soles/hia
b) Terrazas de Formacion Lenta: 5th; 510 soles/ha
c) Zanjas de Inliltracion: 5th; 310 soles/ha
d) Relorestacon: 12th (one-time beneft); 55000 soles/ha
e) Riego: 2nd; 650 soles/ha
f) Maneqo Intenstra: 2nd; 650 soles/ha
9) Almacenes: 2nd; 1875 solesv/almacen (25MT)

Notes and Key Assumptions:
1) Figures may not add precisely due to rounding; they also may be slightly differert than those in detailed cost tables due to slightly different exchange rate assumptons
2) Economic costs have been eshmated as follows:
a) investment costs for training and InstitutIonal strengthening have been deducted since associated benelns are non-quantiliable
b) investment costs for inputs (insumos) have been reduced by 50% since they are partially incorporated in the calculations for incremental benefits
c) recurrent costa following the project have been estimated at 3% o1 investment costs
d) an economic price (opportunity cost) for mano de obra no calificada has been estimated at 3 solestjornal
e) economic prices for tradable products are estimated as: wheat = 0.64 soles/kg; corn = 0.49 solesIRg
1) taxes and duties are not Included since they represent transfer payments
3) Benelt streams for each subproject type have the lollowing lag times (year alter investment when benefit flows begin) and unit benetits

Notes and Key Assumptions:
1) Figures may not add precisely due to rounding: they also may be slightly different than those in detailed cost tables due to slightly dfferent exchange rate assumptions
2) Economic costs have been estmated as follows:
a) investment costs for training and instiutional strengthening have been deducted sincrassociated benefits are non-quantdiable
b) investment costs for Inputs (insumos) have been reduced by 50% since they are partially incorporated In the calculations tor incremental benefits
c) recurrent costs tollowrng the project have been estimated at 3% of investment costs
d) an economic price (opportunty cost) for mano de obra no caltficada has been estimated at 3 solesljornal
e) economic prices for tradable products are estimated as: wheat - 0.64 soles/kg; corn = 0.49 soles/kg
I) taxes and duties are not Included since they represent transfer payments
3) Benefit streams for each subproject type have the following lag tmes (year after investment when benefit flows begin) and unit benefits:
a) Terrazas de Absorcion: 3rd; 800 soles/ha
b) Terrazas de Formacion tents: 5th; 510 soles/ha
c) Zanjas de lntitracion: 5th; 300 solesnha
d) Retorestacion: 12th (one-time beneft); 55000 soles/ha
e) Riego: 2nd; 650 solestha
f) Manejo lntensroa: 2nd; 650 soles/ha
g) Almacenes: 2nda 1875 solee/almacen (25MT)

Monitoring and Evaluation Indicators
1.          PRONAMACHCS would introduce a coherent management information system
providing data on which monitoring and evaluation indicators can be based. The monitoring
indicators would provide information on: (i) project activities and inputs; and (ii) immediate
results (products). The proposed monitoring has to be complemented by ad-hoc studies to
evaluate the results of project activities which can not always be measured in numbers as well as
project impact. Such studies would cover, for instance, the degree of participatory planning,
impact of the community institutional strengthening component and impact of staff training.
2.          Project Monitoring. The monitoring system would be based on the management
information system. Basic information would be collected at the PRONAMACHCS branch levels
from promoters, extension agents and the accounting system. This information would cover all
PRONAMACHCS activities, including information needed for the Ministry of Finance budget
purposes. A simple reporting system would be introduced and summary information would be
transmitted monthly by computer diskette to the departmental offices which would then combine
information of all branches to be transmitted to the central PRONAMACHCS office in Lima.
Based on data received from the departmental offices, the central monitoring office would
produce three-monthly project monitoring reports. At branch and departmental level, no
project-specific reports would be required.
3.          The monitoring indicators would relate to specific project in and outputs and are
presented in the table below. As the project is demand-driven, all targets would have to be very
indicative estimations.
(a)   Participatory Identification and Formulation of Rural Investments: indicators
would include the number of maps, rapid rural appraisals and planning agreements
concluded.
(b)   Rural Investments: indicators would focus on the number of hectares in soil
conservation activities, irrigation and forestry; tools, materials and inputs provided;
labor days provided; families involved; subproject costs; tree nurseries constructed
and trees planted; warehouses constructed, etc.
(c)   Rural Community Strengthening: indicators would be the number of promotion
activities, courses, and participation of women in activities. More details are
described in paras 28 to 31 of Annex 2.
(d)   Strengthening of PRONAMACHCS: indicators would refer to procurement,
recruitment of staff, introduction of the management information system and
training programs.
4.          Project Results and Impact Assessment. The evaluation system would measure
project results and impact. An initial base survey would be carried out in the micro-catchments.
This basic survey would use data provided by the INRENA studies, the rapid rural appraisal and
some additional data collection which might be necessary to obtain the "without" project

situation. A similar intermediate evaluation in twenty randomly selected micro-catchments would
be carried before the project mid-term review. A final evaluation would be carried out in the
whole project area by the end of the project. The evaluation methodology would include
questionnaire surveys, interviews with key informants, focus groups, case studies and direct
observation.
5.          The most important impact indicator relates to the overall objective of the project:
poverty alleviation through sustainable natural resources management. To measure the attainment
of such objective data would have to be kept on items such as the quantity of agricultural and
forest products marketed, composition of the family diet and the products offered in the local
stores, number of televisions in the community, houses with solid roofs, and storerooms
independent from the main living quarters.
6.          As far as the specific project objectives are concerned, the following result and
impact indicators would be used:
(a)   Participatory Identification and Formulation of Rural Investments: the number of
annual plans and agreements signed between PRONAMACHCS and the
communities would be the main indicator;
(b)   Rural investments: sustainability indicators such as the soil conservation and
reforested areas properly cultivated and maintained, increases in production and
average yields, changes in cropping patterns, protection of forest plantations,
number of families who benefit from project activities, soil conservation measures
carried out without direct project support, degree of use of warehouses
constructed with project support;
(c)   Strengthening of community organizations: the impact of this component can be
estimated by analyzing the decision-making process within the communities; their
capacity in procurement and management of the revolving input stocks; the
reimbursement rate; the creation of micro-catchment committees; initiatives taken
by women; the participation of women in committees and training programs; and
(d)   Strengthening of PRONAMACHCS: the impact of this component would be
measured in attitude changes of staff towards community participation and
economic aspects in rural investments; the operation of the management
information and monitoring system; and the degree by which the branches and
departmental offices operate more efficiently.

PERU
SIERRA - NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND
POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT
ENviRONMENTAL IMPACT AND MITIGATION MEASURES
1.          The project would generally have-long term beneficial environmental
effects on water and soil resources at the micro-catchment level. These beneficial effects
include soil and water conservation, reduced sedimentation in streams and improvements
in water quality. The project would also reduce sedimentation to the coastal river
catchments, thereby reducing inputs of nutrients from fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides
to downstream areas. The integration of environmental considerations into the
construction and operation of small irrigation projects and other off-farm activities at
PRONAMACHCS and community levels would mitigate some localized negative
environmental impact. Since there would be numerous projects implemented within the
micro-catchments, the overall project would provide cumulative beneficial effects on
water quality and environmental quality. The concept of multiple use at some of the small
water storage projects may also provide greater environmental benefits if carefully planned
and carried out. The mitigation and enhancement measures suggested in Table I should
ensure the attainment of the above benefits.
2.          The impacts associated with off-farm activities should be minor, but are
highly dependent on the type of activities and site specific characteristics. Dewatering
would affect the aquatic resources and wildlife associated with a stream. Constructing
warehouses would probably have limited impact. Most of the mitigation measures to
control soil erosion and disposal of waste materials should be adequate in these cases.
3.          PRONAMACHCS has good experience in preparing small irrigation
projects and implementing them. However, from the evidence of a recently constructed
small irrigation pond and channel, it was obvious that PRONAMACHCS and the affected
community have not recognized the need to terrace and re-vegetate the construction lay
down areas adjacent to the completed canals or storage reservoirs. As a result, substantial
long term soil erosion and runoff problems would result and impact water quality in
adjacent canals and small streams after construction is completed. A MAG official
commented that environmental protection and restoration of the construction area are not
a great concern in Peru nor are they a part of the project activities. This policy and
practice, however, would change during project implementation because the adverse
environmental effects from these construction areas can undermine the project's water and
soil management benefits in the micro-catchment.

ponds can cause water quality
degradation.
4.             To address the above concerns, the project needs to integrate a simple
environmental impact assessment and an environmental mitigation program into each step
of the project preparation process now in place at PRONAMACHCS. For example, a
standardized checklist of environmental measures to prevent erosion and excessive runoff
would be included in the project operational manual and implemented for each subproject.



- 84 -
The entire project cycle would include environmental restoration and protection of the
construction site and environmental measures would be taken after the civil works are
completed to protect the micro-catchment from excessive soil erosion and adverse water
quality impacts. These measures are fairly standardized and include many of the
mitigation measures in the above table.
5.          PRONAMACHCS staff require some basic training in environmental
impact assessment and in the implementation of environmental measures with materials
available in the micro-catchment. Training for the community may also be advantageous.
Training would also be given to farmers in applying pesticides, fungicides and herbicides
to ensure that these chemicals are properly applied at the proper rates. Washing of and
disposal of empty chemical containers would be strongly discouraged.
6.          The concept of multiple use of small irrigation ponds should be explored
with communities and also factored into the design of such projects. For example,
growing fish in these ponds could diversify the food supply and supplement the incomes of
communities. This proposal would require an investigation to determrine the suitability of
native fish to be successfully raised in the ponds in a cost-effective manner.
7.          To minimize the adverse cumulative effects on water quality from major
road construction and the construction of other small irrigation projects being undertaken
in the Sierra, MAG also needs to coordinate more closely with the Ministry of
Transportation and FONCODES to ensure that measures are routinely taken to minimize
soil erosion and water quality impacts on streams and rivers. Failure to reach a consensus
with the Ministry of Transportation on this issue would have serious consequences for the
entire water and soil management program in the Sierra. Over longer periods of time and
overshadow the beneficial effects of environmentally sound water and soil management
practices if left unaddressed.
8.          To avoid environmental damage from the use of agricultural chemicals,
PRONAMACHCS would provide a positive list of chemicals to be financed under the
project. This list and any modifications thereof would be analyzed and approved by the
Bank. Additional training would also be provided to extension agents and farmers in the
use of these chemicals.

PERU
SIERRA - NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND
POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE OF LEGAL ASSESSMENT
ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
Background
1.          The project recognizes that it is important to raise the status and economic
level of indigenous peoples to alleviate poverty and social marginalization in the area. The
Bank recognizes the importance of indigenous peoples' issues as evident in its Operational
Directive (OD) 4.20, "Indigenous Peoples". OD 4.20 applies to this project because its
goal is to ensure that indigenous people receive culturally compatible social economic
benefits from development projects.
2.          OD 4.20 also states that the legal framework concerning indigenous
peoples should be assessed with special attention given to their land rights, as well as
access to natural resources (OD 4.20, para. 15 (a)). Therefore, it is important to
understand the domestic legal framework surrounding the indigenous people in order to
implement the project effectively. Special attention should be given to indigenous peoples
rights in the context of the Peruvian Constitution and legislation such as the Ley de
Comunidades Campesinas, Agrarian Law, Water Law, etc.
Qualification
3.          The consultant/specialist should either be a lawyer or a legal professional.
S/he must have extensive knowledge of indigenous peoples' policies in Peru. The legal
specialist will draw upon his/her knowledge and expertise of laws involving indigenous
peoples, policies and administrative practices in Peru. The legal specialist will deliver the
materials and analyses described below with the objective of guiding PRONAMACHCS
and Bank staff.
Scope of Work
4.          The consultant is expected to carry out the work over a period of 1 month
before the end of 1996.
5.          The consultant will, inter alia:
(a)   compile and research applicable Peruvian legislation, subsidiary legislation,
guidelines and pending legislation that affect indigenous peoples' rights at



- 86 -
both national and local level (which includes laws on indigenous peoples,
natural resource use, land use, etc.);
(b)   provide full analyses of collected materials;
(c)    describe the forms of organization and governance structure of indigenous
peoples and the degree to which they are recognized in the national
legislation;
(d)   analyze the functions and institutional capacity of the Ministry of
Agriculture (particularly IIP and PRONAMACHCS) and any other
government agency dealing with indigenous peoples issues at the national,
regional and local levels.
(e)    address the legal issue regarding indigenous "campesino" communities of
the Sierra of Peru;
(f)    prepare an action plan to remedy deficiencies in the legislation; and
(g)   prepare a draft report on each of the above categories revisable by the
Bank and to be finalized by the consultant following said reviews.
