    Approval
    Corporate Review Decision                   Following the corporate review, the decision was taken to
                                                proceed with the preparation of the operation.

     I.    Country and Sector Background

1.       At all levels education attainment and growth in Vietnam have been impressive.
Primary and secondary net enrollments have grown rapidly, positioning Vietnam - who has
expressed strong commitment to achieving universal basic education - in a very favorable
position compared to countries with a similar income per-capita income level1. The fastest
growth has taken place at the upper levels of education. Enrollment in colleges and universities
has nearly doubled from 2001 to 2011. This can be explained by: (i) an initially low enrollment
rate; (ii) high demand for higher education as a result of higher returns to skills; and (iii) the
Government’s actions in expanding the sub-sector.
2.     Higher education enrolment coverage, while increasing rapidly (gross enrollment
increased from 11 percent in 1998 to 24 percent in 2010) remains low compared with other
countries in the region such as Thailand, Malaysia or Korea.

3.      Access to higher education is becoming more equitable in time across urban and
rural areas and income quintiles. But while trends are positive, differences in enrollment
between advantaged and disadvantaged groups remain marked and the educational attainment
gap to be filled is large requiring sustained effort. Furthermore, ethnic minority groups have
yet to see significant improvement.

4.      Eventually, quality of higher education has not been improved on a large scale. A
large proportion of academic staff in Vietnam does not have a postgraduate degree and very few
have doctorates. In Vietnam the proportion of faculty having a doctoral degree has been falling

due to rapid system expansion. The large number of students for each faculty member2 has
negative consequences on the learning environment.

    II.      Operation Objectives

5.     The proposed Higher Education Development Policy Program - Third Operation
(HEDPO3) is the third in the series to support and sustain the implementation of key
elements of the Higher Education Reform Agenda (HERA). The Policy Matrix indicates the
status of the measures passed under HEDPO1 and HEDPO2, and policy measures for the
proposed third operation (HEDPO3)
6.      HEDPO3 aims to strengthen governance, financing and quality of Higher Education by
(i) improving the responsiveness of higher education and research and increase the quantitative
capacity of the system (ii) enhancing fiscal transparency, sustainability and effectiveness of the
higher education sector and (iii) improving the quality of Higher Education institutions.

  The target has been exceeded. In fact the total number of HEIs applied credit-based qualification systems is forty
three (43).
III.      Rationale for Bank Involvement

7.     The World Bank’s five-year Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)4 supports
Government’s “Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan 2011-2015.? Under CPS Pillar
I, which focuses on building the country’s competitiveness, the World Bank’s program will help
to “develop a higher education system that produces graduates better suited to the new
economy’s needs?.

8.     HEDPO 1-3 is designed explicitly to complement the Poverty Reduction Support
Credits and follow-on DPOs focusing on macro and structural reforms. It bridges the gap
between the macro-reform agenda and the micro-operational foundations of ongoing investment
operations. It supports a set of mid-level policy and institutional actions that institutionalize a
programmatic reform agenda for improved delivery of higher education services.

9.       HEDPO1-3, along with the Second Higher Education Project and the New Model
University Project, supports Government’s implementation of the HERA. HEP2 takes the
policy development from the definition of the problem, through the collection and analysis of
information, to the development and discussion of policy options. HEDPO1-3 covers the
promulgation and execution of policy measures, linked to the government’s higher education
reform strategy. NMUP demonstrates these policy measures in specific institutional settings.
The future FIRST project will further strengthen policy development and implementation in
areas related to quality and innovation.

10.     The set of higher education operations mentioned above complements the B ank’s
support for access to, and quality of, basic education. The School Education Quality
Assurance Program (SEQAP), the Vietnam Escuala Nueva Project (VNEN) and the forth-
coming School Readiness Promotion Project (SRPP) aim at increasing the opportunities of
learning in basic education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

    Report No. 65200-VN.
Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation

11.     A set of indicators for monitoring were agreed for all three programmatic operations
(HEDPO1-3). The MOET’s Program Unit, led by the Higher Education Department, monitors
and reports on progress against the HEDPOs. The evaluation made in the Implementation
Completion Report for HEDPO1 and 2 pointed to the fact that while selected indicators are
important, they are not directly linked to policy measures adopted in HEDPO 1 and 2. Taking
these findings forward, the Program results framework has been revised for HEDPO3. It now
includes two parts: (i) overall sector monitoring indicators; and (ii) Program-specific results
indicators. In addition to collecting summary statistics, MOET conducted qualitative
assessments of policy measures impact.

 V.    Risks and Risk Mitigation


12.     Vietnam faces important short-term domestic macroeconomic management challenges.
Whilst foreign exchange reserves have more than doubled in 2012, it is low compared to
international levels. The ongoing domestic credit bust could further worsen both growth
prospects and asset quality. Another risk is the authorities’ departure from fiscal and monetary
discipline prompting inflation resurgence. This could unravel gains already made and further
weaken confidence. A similar outcome, but where potential growth is compromised, could arise
from delayed and poor implementation of structural reforms including the resolution of bad debts
in banks and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Vietnam is also vulnerable to the effects of a
prolonged global economic slowdown, which could adversely affect exports, remittances,
foreign investment, and possibly aid. Although it has managed to navigate the 2008/09 crisis
reasonably well through implementation of a large stimulus package, fiscal space is now limited
because of high levels of public debt and large contingent liabilities from a weak banking sector
and poorly managed SOEs. Mitigation measures include closer monitoring of macroeconomic
developments, and increased dialogue with the authorities in collaboration with the IMF to
ensure steadfast implementation of reforms already announced and to prepare for new ones. The
ongoing work on a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) by the World Bank and IMF is
expected to provide a comprehensive roadmap for financial sector reform and accelerate
implementation. EMCC series itself can be considered as part of a risk mitigation strategy as it
underscores the need to reform, builds consensus around challenging issues and helps design
appropriate responses.

13.     The main sector risk is that many policies promoted in the HEDPOs go beyond the
mandate of MOET and need strong support from MOF, MPI, MOST and leadership of the Prime
Minister’s Office, the National Assembly and the Communist Party. This risk has been
mitigated by (i) the fact that the development the higher education sector master plan drew on
wide consultation with all stakeholders; and (ii) key reforms are laid out in phases with transition
in the roles/ responsibilities key stakeholders. The Higher Education Law has been deliberated
and promulgated by the National Assembly, the highest legislative body in the country.

14.      Further sector risk concerns MOET’s weak capacity (both technical skills and due to
institutional fragmentation) to develop coherent policy (including economic analysis) for
HEDPOs. This risk has been partially mitigated by the support of the Second Higher Education
Project. All technical assistance, training and workshop and consultation with universities had
been provided by this project.

15.     Finally, while the HEDPP results in the promulgation of regulations that lay out key
policy reforms, HEIs may not be fully effective in applying the regulations to their full potential.
This risk is partially mitigated by the fact that one NMUP financed by the World Bank and the
other NMUP by ADB will provide a privileged locus for testing the full application of the new
body of regulations and offering a demonstration effect for roll-out to other HEIs.

Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects

Poverty and Social Impacts

16.     Vietnam is in the process of increasing the coverage of its Higher Education system,
going from servicing a small urban elite to making it accessible to the wider population.
Available data indicates that the system-wide expansion does not exclude any particular
groups, and more and more capable, talented youth from low socio-economic backgrounds
benefit from higher education opportunities. Despite these encouraging trends of the poor and
ethnic minorities accessing higher education, they remain far behind groups from higher socio-
economic backgrounds. Reasons for a lower participation rate of youth from these groups can be
found at earlier levels of education where limited access to schools, low teacher quality and poor
schooling conditions limit their participation at pre-higher education levels. All the Bank’s non
HE programs (early childhood development, primary education) concentrate on helping to raise
access to better quality of basic education of the disadvantaged children (poor, Ethnic Minorities,
children with disabilities…).
17.     The government has been relying on cost-recovery to support the expansion of
higher education but they also institute measures to safeguards the poor’s access to higher
education. To avoid leaving behind students who cannot afford tuitions fees, the Government
has set up a massive loans scheme, which has also become more pro-poor, as evidenced in the
higher proportions of students from lower income quintiles reported being exempted.
18.    Fostering private sector participation will benefit to the whole population including
the poorest students. Indeed, experience around the world shows that private education is the
quickest way to achieve expansion in higher education (private providers can move faster and
sometimes more effectively to fill gaps in supply of higher education). In a review of the HE
system in Vietnam, widening access to higher education was attributed to a number of
government policies, including the establishment and development of non-public higher
education institutions in rural and remote areas, and the introduction of a student loan program.
19.     The move to a credit-based training system (well under way) will provide more
flexibility to students to continue their studies as they will not have to repeat the whole year if
they fail to pass some courses. This quality improvement measure is likely to benefit mostly poor
students who need to work at the same time as they study to cover the costs of their education.
20.     Finally, investing in Higher Education is a crucial part of Vietnam’s drive toward
greater productivity, growth and technological development. Helping the Higher Education
system by strengthening its governance, supporting the diversification of its funding and
establishing mechanisms to improve its quality – will provide the high-level skills demanded by
the labor-market and needed to develop Vietnam’s potential to lift competitiveness. This will
therefore support the country to sustain the growth of recent decades that will benefit to the
whole society, contributing to avoid the low middle-income trap and to decrease poverty rates.

Environment Aspects
21.     The policies supported by the proposed operation relate to governance, financing, and
quality of teaching and are not likely to have any significant positive or negative effects on the
country's environment, forest, and other natural resources. Under the governance policy area,
one of the HEDPP objectives is to increase the quantitative capacity of the higher education
sector. The national capacity can be increased through a number of different approaches
including increased construction of HEI facilities, which does raise the possibility of minor
environmental impacts. The impact of new facility construction or renovation are considered to
be minor because HEI facilities are almost invariably built in urban or highly converted
environments with little likely impact on natural habitats, forests, or natural resources. The
Vietnamese law requires environmental impact assessments of all large construction projects,
including educational facilities. Considering the scale and magnitude of likely impacts, the Bank
considers that the capacity of the education sector to adequately address environmental issues is
sufficient.
