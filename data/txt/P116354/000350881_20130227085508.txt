  HIGHER EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT POLICY PROGRAM – THIRD OPERATION


Recipient       Socialist Republic of Vietnam
Implementing    Ministry of Education and Training
Agency
Financing       IDA Credit
Data            Terms: IDA blend (25-year maturity with 5-year grace period)
                Amount: US$50.0 million
Operation       Development Program Lending
Type            Programmatic operation: Third in a series of three single-tranche operations

Main Policy     1.   Higher education governance and institutional autonomy;
Areas           2.   Sector financing and institutional financial management; and
                3.   Quality improvement, accreditation and assurance.
Key Results     •    Governance: (i) Capacity to decide overall student numbers and
Indicators           academic content transferred to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs);
                     (ii) Number of HEIs having increased academic autonomy; (iii) Number
                     of public HEIs having established university council; and (iv) Number of
                     joint training programs with foreign HEIs;
                 • Financing/Financial management: (i) Percentage of total HEI revenue
                     coming from tuition fees; (ii) Percentage of education budget allocated
                     for HE sector; (iii) Percentage of students received loans; and (iv)
                     Number of HEIs having annual financial report.
                 • Quality: (i) Percentage of students in credit-based programs; (ii) Number
                     of accreditation agencies established; and (iii) Number of HEIs having
                     established internal quality assurance system.
Program         The objectives of the Higher Education Development Policy Operations
Development     (HEDPO) are to strengthen governance, financing and quality of higher
Objective and   education by: (i) improving the responsiveness of higher education and
Contribution    research and increase the quantitative capacity of the system; (ii) enhancing
to Country      fiscal transparency, sustainability and effectiveness of the higher education
Partnership     sector; and (iii) improving the quality of Higher Education institutions. It
Strategy        contributes to the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) first pillar-
                Competitiveness with the objective of “develop[ing] a higher education
                system that produces graduates better suited to the new economy’s needs.?
Risks and       Vietnam faces important short-term domestic macroeconomic management
Risk            challenges. Whilst foreign exchange reserves have more than doubled in
Mitigation      2012, it is low compared to international levels. The ongoing domestic credit
                crunch could further worsen both growth prospects and asset quality.
                Another risk is the authorities’ departure from fiscal and monetary discipline
                prompting inflation resurgence. This could unravel gains already made and
                further weaken confidence. A similar outcome, but where potential growth is
                compromised, could arise from delayed and poor implementation of

                                             v
               structural reforms including the resolution of bad debts in banks and state-
               owned enterprises (SOEs). Vietnam is also vulnerable to the effects of a
               prolonged global economic slowdown, which could adversely affect exports,
               remittances, foreign investment, and possibly aid. Although it has managed
               to navigate the global economic crisis reasonably well through
               implementation of a large stimulus package, fiscal space is now limited
               because of high levels of public debt and large contingent liabilities from a
               weak banking sector and poorly managed SOEs. Mitigation measures include
               closer monitoring of macroeconomic developments, and increased dialogue
               with the authorities in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund to
               ensure steadfast implementation of reforms already announced and to
               prepare for new ones. The ongoing work on a Financial Sector Assessment
               Program (FSAP) by the World Bank and IMF is expected to provide a
               comprehensive roadmap for financial sector reform and accelerate
               implementation. The Economic Management and Competitive Credit
               (EMCC) series itself can be considered as part of a risk mitigation strategy as
               it underscores the need to reform, builds consensus around challenging
               issues and helps design appropriate responses.

               Sector-specific risk: Many policies promoted in the HEDPO go beyond the
               mandate of Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) and need strong
               support from Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Planning and
               Investment (MPI) and Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) and
               leadership of the Prime Minister’s Office and the Communist Party.
               Mitigation: The development of the higher education sector Master Plan
               drew on wide consultation with all stakeholders; key reforms are laid out in
               phases with transition in the roles/responsibilities key stakeholders. The
               Higher Education Law has been deliberated and promulgated by the National
               Assembly, the highest legislative body in the country.

               Policy-related risk: MOET capacity may not have increased as much as
               anticipated to be able to develop coherent policies. Mitigation: The Second
               Higher Education Project (HEP2) helped building capacity of MOET in the
               areas of diagnostics and making policy recommendations. Key policies for
               increasing autonomy of HEIs and system differentiation have been adopted
               but the risk of weak implementation capacity remains.

               Institutional risk:
                • MOET and HEIs may not be fully effective in applying the regulations
                    to their full potential. Mitigation: The New Model University Project
                    (NMUP) provides a privileged locus for testing the full application of the
                    new body of regulations and offering a demonstration effect for roll-out
                    to other HEIs.

I.      INTRODUCTION

1.      The programmatic series of three single-tranche operations of Higher Education
Development Policy Operations (HEDPO1-3), are designed to support the Government’s
implementation of its “Socio-Economic Development Strategy (SEDS) 2011-2020? and its
“Higher Education Reform Agenda? (HERA) 2006-2020. In particular, HEDPO1-3 aim to
strengthen governance, financing and quality of higher education by: (i) improving the
responsiveness of higher education and research and increase the quantitative capacity of the
system; (ii) enhancing fiscal transparency, sustainability, and effectiveness of the higher
education sector; and (iii) improving the quality of Higher Education Institutions (HEI).

2.      The proposed Higher Education Development Policy Program Third Operation
(HEDPO3) aims to support and institutionalize key elements of the HERA. Although each
individual operation was to be delivered annually 1 after having completed the relevant prior
actions, HEDPO3’s delivery had taken longer than anticipated for two reasons: (i) the triggers
for the third operation are complex that required additional time to complete; and (ii) the
government’s wish to elevate key policy measures to be adopted by the highest legislative body
(the National Assembly) through a Higher Education Law. This effort is commendable because
the adoption of the HE Law required high-level political support and an extensive consultative
process that involved multiple ministries and agencies involved in Higher Education. HEDPO1-
3 are implemented as three equal tranches of US$50 million equivalent and the Policy
Matrix and Result framework (Annex 2) presents a historical view of HEDPO1-2 achievements
while laying out the prior actions for the proposed third operation.

II.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

3.       Vietnam has witnessed impressive economic growth and poverty reduction in the
past 25 years. Political and economic reforms (?ổi Mới) launched in 1986 have transformed
Vietnam from one of the poorest countries in the world, with per capita income below US$100,
to a lower middle-income country within a quarter of a century. At the end of 2011, Vietnam’s
per capita income was estimated at US$1,374. 2 Using a ‘basic needs’ poverty line initially
agreed in 1983 3, the poverty headcount fell from 58 percent in the early 1990s, to 14.5 percent
by 2008, and is expected to be well under 10 percent by 2014 4. The country has attained five of
its ten original Millennium Development Goal targets and likely to attain two more by 2015.

4.     Reforms in the early nineties contributed to major competitiveness gains, which
enabled a structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and services. Investments in
physical capital and human resources led to increased capital and labor productivity. Vietnam’s
membership of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the World Trade

  HEDPO1 was approved in June 2009, and HEDPO2 was approved in November 2010.

  The GSO-WB poverty line was presented in the 2000 Country Economic Memorandum Attacking Poverty (World
Bank, 2000) and is approximately US$1.10 (2005 PPP). It was constructed on the basis of the consumption behavior
of the poor in the 1993 VLSS, and has been updated for inflation for each round of the VHLSS.
4
  In September 2010, Vietnam announced a new official poverty rate of 14.2 percent. In June 2012, the World Bank
and GSO, using 2012 VHLSS data, have proposed a new and higher poverty line for Vietnam that is consistent with
its status as a lower-middle income country

                                                       1
Organization (WTO) in 1995 and 2007 respectively, and a series of bilateral trade agreements,
promoted reforms and led to higher private and public sector investments.

5.      There is growing recognition however that reforms now need to promote more
efficient use of factor endowments, and increase productivity across the economy. Loss of
competitiveness and declining productivity in Vietnam are evident in: 5 (i) low productivity
within manufacturing; (ii) low and declining public investment efficiency; (iii) low execution of
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) commitments; (iv) concentration of exports in low value added
manufactures with high and growing import needs; and (v) depletion of natural resources and
environmental damage, which are not fully reflected in final prices.

6.      Recent assessments and surveys indicate that competitiveness constraints stem
largely from a number of policy and institutional weaknesses. 6 There have been bouts of
macroeconomic instability, which has impacted on market confidence. Public sector governance
is increasingly fragmented, leading to uneven implementation of rules and regulations.
Inefficient public investments have contributed to falling marginal productivity of capital.
Finally, a severe shortage of skilled labor is creating bottlenecks for business expansion and
higher value addition. Addressing these challenges is critical to helping Vietnam avert a middle
income trap – where it will be no longer able to compete against low wage economies in
manufactured exports, or against more advanced economies in innovative products.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN VIETNAM

7.       Vietnam’s economy gradually returned to a relatively stable macroeconomic
environment during 2012 compared to the tumultuous period of 2007-11. In early 2011, the
country was in a phase of heightened macroeconomic vulnerabilities. This was characterized by
high and rising inflation, extreme volatility in the foreign exchange market, rapidly dwindling
international reserves, a sharp rise in country risk following default by one of its biggest SOEs,
high levels of fiscal and trade deficits, and weaknesses in the banking and corporate sectors.
These vulnerabilities and the absence of a persuasive strategy to address them led to weakening
sentiments towards the country’s economic prospects.

8.        Stabilization measures (Resolution 11) implemented in 2011 and 2012 have helped
Vietnam avert a macroeconomic crisis.            They have also helped restore macroeconomic
stability, reduce inflation, strengthen fiscal and external accounts, and stabilize the exchange
rate. The increased supply of US dollars in the market has enabled the State Bank of Vietnam
(SBV) to replenish foreign exchange reserves, which are now reportedly just over two months of
imports.

Real Sector

9.     Stabilization policies coupled with sluggish global growth, however, has also led to
slower growth Vietnam in 2012. Real GDP growth has slowed to 4 percent in Q1 year-on-year,

the lowest in three years. Growth picked up in Q2 (4.6 percent) and Q3 (5.4 percent), reaching
5.03 percent for the whole year. This is below the initial 2012 target of 6 - 6.5 percent. One of
the main reasons is the low level of public and private investments. With slowdown in credit
growth and efforts to restructure public investment, total investment has fallen sharply from 41.9
percent of GDP in 2010 to 34.6 percent in 2011. The slowdown has been felt most acutely in the
construction sector as well as by small and medium-sized enterprises.

External Sector

10.    Slowing output in domestic enterprises stands in sharp contrast to relatively strong
performance in the foreign invested export sector. In 2011, Vietnam recorded the highest rate
of export growth in East Asia amongst developing nations, with China at a distant second. The
country’s total export turnover in 2012 is estimated at US$114.6 billion, rising 18.3 percent over
2011. The foreign invested sector (including crude oil) contributed 63 percent of Vietnam’s total
exports and grew by 31 percent in 2012, while the domestic sector contributed 37 percent and
grew at 1 percent.

11.     Imports have slowed down significantly together with falling growth, and in
particular due to falling demand for construction material. Import spending in the year to
August is estimated at US$114.3 billion, up 7.1 percent year-on-year. Imports of machinery and
equipment by foreign firms remained strong. However imports by domestic firms decreased,
reflecting a strong consolidation of public as well as private investment. Imports of raw
materials and intermediate goods (fertilizer, animal feed, cotton, fiber, fabrics) have also
decreased, reflecting falling domestic demand and growing inventory. Imports of automobiles
and motorbikes fell sharply partly because of a hike in taxes and fees to deal with chronic traffic
congestion in large cities.

12.      Vietnam has, as a result of these developments, posted a surplus on its trade account
for the first time since 1992. This has in turn contributed to a record current account surplus
estimated at 5 percent of GDP. Vietnam’s turnaround in its external balance—from double digit
deficit to surplus in a period of five years and without any sharp and sudden adjustments to the
exchange rate—has been particularly impressive.

13.    The improved current account position has enabled the SBV to shore up foreign
exchange reserves. International reserves have built up from 7 weeks of import cover (end
2011) to about 10 weeks (December 2012), which is roughly US$20 billion. 7 This was also
helped by a fall in domestic capital flight, as exchange rate stability and falling inflation have
helped to restore confidence in the VND (Chart 13). This is reflected in the fact that the
reference rate for VND has been stable at VND20,828 to the US$1 for nearly a year, and a
narrowing differential between the parallel and official rates.

Inflation and monetary policy

14.     Inflation has been falling steadily in the past twelve months. High commodity prices,
delayed withdrawal of stimulus measures and inability to raise interest rates in a timely manner
in late 2010 led to a steady increase in inflation during the first half of 2011. As the impact of
Resolution 11 started to take hold, inflation began to fall. By December 2012 headline inflation
for the year had fallen to 6.8 percent. Easing of food prices has contributed the most in overall
disinflation.

15.     The SBV had aggressively cut interest rates between March and July 2012 in
response to the slowdown in growth and falling inflation. Key policy rates were cut by 500
basis points over this period. The cap for dong deposit was reduced from 14 percent to 11
percent. The rules on lending to real estate and for private consumption had also been relaxed.
SBV encouraged commercial banks to lower lending rates and promote credit for production,
agriculture and rural development, exports, and small and medium enterprises.

16.    Despite this, total credit has grown by only 7 percent in 2012, which is much lower
than the 15 percent target for the year. Total deposits on the other hand rose by more than 11
percent during the ten eight months of the year. The rate cuts may have helped alleviate cost
pressures in the private sector, but they are unlikely to impact on supply or consumer spending.

7
  The Prime Minister at the Consultative Group Meeting in December 2012 indicated that reserves were equivalent
to three months of imports.

                                                       5
This is partly because both individuals and firms are already highly leveraged, and there are
uncertainties over future economic prospects, which has contributed to a more cautious attitude.

Fiscal Policy

17.      The Government has prioritized fiscal consolidation efforts, particularly by
targeting more efficient public investment. The overall deficit was at an estimated 3.2 percent
of GDP in 2011. The 2012 State Budget commits the Government to further rationalize public
investment, and increase the relative share of social spending. Total Government expenditure is
estimated at VND 896 trillion, of which VND 651 trillion is recurrent expenditure, and VND 245
trillion is capital expenditure. Social spending is around one third of total planned spending, out
of which education accounts for 47 percent, social protection for 29 percent, and health for 17.5
percent. Government policy is to allocate 20 percent of total spending on education and to ensure
that the health budget increases by at least the same rate as the overall budget.

18.     A combination of economic slowdown and tax relief for enterprises has contributed
to lower than expected domestic revenues in the first nine months of 2012. Revenues have
declined 0.6 percent in nominal terms compared to the same period last year. Government
expenditure in the first nine months of 2012 has remained on track. Discipline over capital
expenditure has been maintained. The overall impact on the government’s 2012 fiscal deficit
target is still uncertain though may increase to around 4.8 percent of GDP. Oil revenue will be
higher than budgeted, and tax collections may increase in the last quarter as the economy gathers
pace. The preliminary estimates for the 2013 Budget show efforts to bring the fiscal deficit
down to 3.8 percent of GDP, including a possible small reduction in on-budget capital
expenditure.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

19.    Vietnam’s economy is expected to grow at a moderate pace of around 5.5 percent
during 2013. In the Bank’s base case scenario, assuming the continuation of the good spell of
macroeconomic stability and reasonable export growth, we do not expect any strong headwinds
that could destabilize the economy in 2013. The trade and current accounts are expected to
remain in surplus in 2013 though by a smaller amount than in 2012. We also expect some
consolidation of the fiscal accounts and inflation remaining in the high single digit.

20.     With the restructuring agenda gaining momentum, we expect some important
progress in 2013. Efforts to divest non-core assets and equitize a large number of SOEs could
send a positive signal to investors about government’s commitment to this agenda. It could also
involve some pains in terms of retrenchment of labor and restructuring of bad debts. We also
expect some efforts to resolve the bad debt problem, though given the complexity of the issues
involved, it is likely to be a much more drawn-out process. Many of these actions would involve
costs and it is unclear how these will be met. If the costs are paid by allowing foreign or
domestic private enterprises and banks to invest in the weak banks, it will certainly help to keep
the fiscal situation under control and boost investor’s confidence. Given the low price of risk in
global capital markets, Vietnam has a unique opportunity to clean up a part of its bad debt
problem by accessing external capital at a much lower cost than would have been otherwise
possible.

                                                6
21.    There are however several downside risks to the projections. First, on the external
side we expect a weak global recovery but no big negative shocks from the United States, Euro
Area or Japan. Therefore Vietnam’s exports, FDI and remittances should continue to do as well
as in 2012 or better. It is also assumed that oil prices will remain relatively high (around
US$105 per barrel) but non-oil commodity prices would gradually fall—which should help keep
dpwn domestic inflation. Furthermore, progress is expected to be made on the restructuring
agenda in 2013 compared to 2012.

Debt Sustainability

22.     Vietnam’s public debt is currently at sustainable levels. Total outstanding
Government and Government Guaranteed external debt increased by nearly 50 percent from
2008 (US$21.8 billion or around 21 percent of GDP) to end of 2010 (US$32.5 billion or 32.7
percent of GDP) due to the Government’s fiscal stimulus package. Although debt to the external
private sector rose from around US$3 billion in 2008 to US$5.4 billion in 2010, more than 80
percent of Government and Government Guaranteed external debt is long-term and concessional
from official creditors. Domestic public debt has gone from around 18 percent of GDP between
2006 and 2008, to around 21.5 percent of GDP in 2010, also due to the fiscal stimulus.

23.       Vietnam is assessed at low risk of debt distress. The Present Value of Government
and Government Guaranteed external debt is estimated at around 27 percent of GDP,
considerably lower than the 50 percent of GDP threshold for external debt sustainability. The
Present Value of public sector debt (i.e. including domestic debt) is closer to 50 percent of GDP.
Maintaining the current course of fiscal consolidation is essential for debt sustainability. It will
help to shelter against potential exchange rate shocks, slowing exports due to falling global
demand, and declining sources of concessional financing. Some of the recent developments
imply a different set of assumptions than what was considered in the last Debt Sustainability
Analysis (DSA). Weaker economic growth and higher recapitalization needs due to large non-
pool loans (NPLs) would adversely impact the debt sustainability. This will be looked at in more
detail in the next DSA planned for Q2 2013.

24.      There is growing recognition that contingent liabilities from SOEs and the financial
sector pose significant risks to debt sustainability. Explicit obligations in the form of
government guarantees are less than 5 percent of GDP. But implicit obligations, for example in
the event of a systemic shock in the financial sector, are not captured under government and
government guaranteed debt statistics. A large proportion of NPLs is attributed to state
enterprises. SOEs are in turn highly leveraged – between 2007 and 2009, debt to equity ratio
averaged 307 percent relative to 183 percent for non-state firms and 145 percent for foreign
firms. The SOEs also had the highest debt-to-asset ratio among the three groups. Therefore
economic slowdown, affecting SOEs could further affect NPLs and a banking sector crisis.
However, even in the absence of a shock, Vietnam’s debt dynamics can change quickly
depending on costs of the government’s economic restructuring agenda. The latter includes a
plan to deal with NPLs in the system and restructure the largest state enterprises in the country
(i.e. Economic Groups and General Corporations). The preliminary 2013 Budget estimates
however do not seem to have provisions for restructuring costs.

Summary

25.     Vietnam’s current macroeconomic situation is more stable than it has been in the
past two years. As discussed earlier, Vietnam’s inflation is at two-year low, its international
reserves have doubled in the past 12 months, the exchange rate has been stable, and its trade and
current account deficit are at modest levels. Stabilization measures implemented over the course
of 2011 and 2012 have helped to achieve and maintain this stability. Policies pursued by the
Government have been costly in terms of growth, but they are consistent with restoring
macroeconomic stability. Moreover, the Government remains fully committed to maintaining
macroeconomic stability as seen from the communiqué issued after the recently concluded Party
Plenum. Therefore, the current macroeconomic policy framework is deemed adequate for a
Development Policy Operation.

26.     However, Vietnam faces important short-term domestic macroeconomic
management challenges. Whilst the level of foreign exchange reserves has more than doubled
in 2012, it is low by international standards. The sharp slowdown in domestic credit and tepid
growth are further worsening asset quality. The risk that authorities would depart from fiscal and
monetary discipline prompting inflation resurgence is low but rising. Delayed and poor
implementation of structural reforms including the resolution of bad debts in the banks and SOEs
could unravel gains already made and weaken confidence further. Vietnam is also vulnerable to
the effects of a prolonged global economic slowdown, which could adversely affect exports,
remittances, foreign investment, and possibly aid. Although it has managed to navigate the
global economic crisis reasonably well through implementation of a large stimulus package,
fiscal space is now limited because of high levels of public debt and large contingent liabilities
from a weak banking sector and poorly managed SOEs.

27.     These risks are being mitigated through closer monitoring of macroeconomic
developments, and increased dialogue to ensure steadfast implementation of reforms
already announced and to prepare for new ones. The ongoing Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) is expected to provide a comprehensive roadmap for financial sector reform
and accelerate implementation. Economic Management and Competitiveness Credit (EMCC)
series itself can be considered as part of a risk mitigation strategy as it underscores the need to
reform, builds consensus around challenging issues and helps design appropriate responses

Poverty reduction

28.     Vietnam’s record on economic growth and poverty reduction over the past two
decades has been remarkable. Progress also has been substantial in other dimensions of well-
being, ranging from high primary and secondary enrolments to improvements in health status,
and reduced morbidity and mortality.

29.     Despite remarkable progress, the task of poverty reduction is not complete, and in
some respects has become more difficult. Although tens of millions of Vietnamese households
have risen out of poverty over the past decade, many have income levels still very near the
poverty line. These households remain vulnerable to falling back into poverty as a result of
idiosyncratic or economy-wide shocks, which have tended to become larger, more frequent, and
lengthier. New challenges have arisen in reaching those still living in poverty due to isolation,

                                                8
limited assets, low levels of education and poor health status, while poverty reduction has
become less responsive to economic growth. Furthermore, while Vietnam’s 53 ethnic minority
groups make up less than 15 percent of the total population, they account, for 47 percent of the
poor in 2010 compared to 29 percent at the end of 1990s, which is a real concern.

30.    Regional differentials are important and likely to become more so in the future.
Poverty levels vary substantially across regions with poverty headcounts being highest in the
mountainous and more isolated Northwest region, as well as in the North East and the Central
Highlands. Despite all regions having witnessed progress in recent years (Figure 2), disparities
remain.

31.    If poverty in Vietnam is still predominately a rural phenomenon (Figure 3), there is
a growing concern regarding urban poverty. New forms of poverty may arise as a result of
rapid economic transformation and global integration. The global crisis has exposed Vietnam’s
susceptibility to external shocks at both the macroeconomic and household levels as evidenced




                                                 9
by rising unemployment and widespread reports of wage cuts and reduced working hours 8.
Several studies and rapid assessments 9 have shown that these events have been particularly
challenging for urban residents: 65 percent of households surveyed in the 2009 Urban Poverty
Survey reported higher food and other essential item prices as a source of difficulties, making
inflation by far the most common factor among job loss, business slowdowns, natural disasters,
health shocks, and others.

III.        THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR CONTEXT

32.      Education attainment and growth in Vietnam have been impressive. The country has
expressed strong commitment to achieving universal basic education as a foundation for social
development and economic growth. Accordingly, primary and secondary net enrolments have
grown rapidly11 with upper levels of education having seen the greatest expansion: Enrolment in
colleges and universities has nearly doubled from 2001 to 2011. This increase can be explained
by: (i) an initially low enrolment rate; (ii) high demand for higher education as a result of higher
returns to skills; and (iii) the Government’s actions in expanding the sub-sector.

33.     Despite the rapid increase in higher education enrolment, overall coverage remains
low compared with other countries in the region. The fast growing economy and the
increasing need for innovation and higher quality skills have placed major demands on the
existing higher education system. Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) data
show that the higher education gross enrolment rate increased from about 11 percent in 1998 to
18 percent in 2008 to 24 percent in 2010 but remains low compared with countries such as
Thailand, Malaysia or Korea.

34.     Access to higher education is becoming more equitable across urban and rural areas
and income quintiles but ethnic minority groups have yet to see significant improvement.
Individuals from more advantaged groups still outpace those from other groups in terms of
higher education enrollment, but rural areas and groups from lower income quintiles have
registered the fastest gross enrollment rate growth (Figures 4 and 5). These trends, however,
stand in stark contrast with almost insignificant improvements of ethnic minorities’ access to
higher education between 1998 and 2010 (Figure 4).Therefore, reducing the large differences in
enrolment between advantaged and disadvantaged groups and closing the large educational
attainment gap will require a sustained effort.

35.     The emergence of private higher education started in the mid-1990s in response to
an increasing demand for and enrolment in higher education. By 2012, Vietnam counted 419
HEIs, of which 80 are private. Although the Government remains by far the main provider in the
sector, private provision is playing a critical role and has become an increasingly important share
of the total sector provision (Table 3).

36.     Currently, the state is providing 55 percent while tuition fees provide 45 percent of
public HEIs budgets. Given that this policy could have strained some students and their
families’ capacity to pay, an expansion of student loans schemes and other aid mechanisms was
introduced. In this funding context and to support further expansion, main options include a
further increase in public spending, diversification of resources 12 and further expansion of the
private sector.

37.    The management of the higher education system is fragmented. Responsibility for the
oversight of the education sector is shared between the Ministry of Education and Training
(MOET), and other line ministries and local authorities: some 60 public HEIs are under direct
MOET control, while the others are controlled by other ministries (depending on the areas of
study and research) or Provincial People’s Committees. HEIs submit their annual plans and
budget estimates to their respective ministries for approval and consolidation. Ministry of
Finance (MOF) and Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) consolidate the budget proposals
from line ministries and make final allocations based on budget availability. This has led to

issues of incoherent and non-transparent budget allocations. The quality of higher education
and faculty has not significantly improved. The proportion of faculty members with doctoral
degrees is generally used as an indicator of the quality of a higher education institution,
especially in the case of international rankings. In Vietnam, the proportion of faculty having a
doctoral degree has been falling (Table 4) due to the rapid system expansion, leading to an
increase of academic staff without a postgraduate degree. The large number of students for each
faculty member 13 has negative consequences on the learning environment.

HIGHER EDUCATION AND LABOR MARKET NEEDS

38.      Vietnam is going through a structural shift of its economy, going from a net food
importer to the world's second-largest rice exporter. The agriculture sector share of economic
output declined, falling to 21 percent of GDP in 2010 as production in other sectors of the
economy rose. Industry and construction represented 40.9 percent of GDP and services 38.1
percent in 2010. Foreign trade and FDI have also improved significantly. In this evolving
economic context, employment opportunities for tertiary graduates have increased substantially.
Nevertheless, employment of tertiary graduates is still concentrated in a few sectors and
employment opportunities are still constrained by a high share of self-employment. There is an
increasing demand for highly skilled labor, especially in sectors such as manufacturing and FDI.
This is also visible from the combination of drastic increases in the tertiary education wage
premium over the 1998 to 2008 period (by over 40 percent) with very high “professionalization?
rates 14 (over 80 percent) 15. The figure below shows that employment attainment for tertiary
graduates remains quite stable over the 2002-2010 period with some variations: Less tertiary
graduates worked in state owned enterprises in 2010 than they did in 2002 (respectively 20.84
percent against 8.32 percent) while more tertiary graduates worked in private enterprises in 2010
(20 percent) compared to 2002 (only 7 percent).

40.     While demand for higher education graduates has been growing, there are
significant levels of skills “mismatches? related to higher education. Skills mismatches are
particularly relevant in technologically intensive and export-oriented sectors in Vietnam (Figure
7) suggesting both important constraints to country competitiveness and mismatches affecting
higher education (quantity and quality) 16. Beyond issues of shortages of highly skilled labor, it is
clear that poor quality and relevance of skills acquired in higher education are a big issue. Recent
evidence collected from employer and employee surveys confirms pervasive gaps in technical,
English and communication skills of professionals. A recent report on foreign employers also
confirms that only 10 percent of the recent graduating class of engineers had the potential to
become “effective employees?. 17 Two constraints to higher relevance clearly appear: (i)
information regarding employment of graduates, labor market and skills is still weak; and (ii)
research capacity of universities is not only low but also more supply- than demand-driven.
Furthermore, the lack of university-industry linkages and lack of information on labor market
needs have negative consequences on the relevance of university programs. Vietnam’s national
competitiveness increasingly depends on skilled human capital, which its higher education
system is expected to deliver.

HIGHER EDUCATION REFORM AGENDA

41.    The Government’s socio-economic development strategy 2011-2020 18 stresses the
theme of quality, efficiency and sustainability of national development. It emphasizes that if
economic restructuring is to be sped up, growth must be harmoniously combined with social
progress and equality. The SEDS 2011-2020 emphasizes “[Vietnam] will concentrate on
education and training, especially tertiary and vocational training, to have a labor force of high

quality and proper structure, and thus accelerate the economic restructuring and the shift of
[sustainable] growth models.?

42.     The Government sets clear goals for higher education in its HERA. 19 The strategy
aims for an overall quantitative goal of “increasing enrolment in universities and colleges by 10
percent annually, to reach a level of 450 students per 10,000 population by 2020?, and an overall
qualitative goal of “approaching the advanced education standards of the region and the world?.
Specifically, the following targets for the higher education sector have been set: (i) revenue
from research activities increased to 25 percent by 2020; (ii) proportion of university teaching
staff with masters’ level degree increased to 60 percent by 2020; (iii) proportion of university
teaching staff with doctoral level degree increased to 25 percent by 2020; and (iv) ratio of
university students to teaching staff reduced to 26:1 by 2020.

43.      The main objectives of the HERA are: (i) complete the national network of HEIs with
greater autonomy to individual institutions and introducing measures in order to create a climate
of competition between and within institutions that promotes improvement; (ii) a dramatic
expansion in physical capacity to allow an increase of the participation rate in higher education
institutions; (iii) simultaneous increase in quality and/or efficiency of the system; 20 (iv)
introduction or reinforcement of research in universities in order to better train future new
teachers, to enrich and upgrade present teachers’ teaching abilities and to upgrade the quality
level and international visibility of Vietnamese universities; and (v) improve the governance of
the higher education and research system at both national and regional levels.

44.      HERA proposes comprehensive measures including: (i) renovating curricula and
teaching methods; (ii) developing systems that increase study opportunities through transfers;
renovating financial mechanisms and policies to make institutions more pro-active and
responsible for finance, staffing and organization; (iii) renovating management with stronger
decentralization, clearer responsibilities and authorities for different entities; (iv) implementing
quality assurance and accreditation schemes, gradually joining international educational quality
accreditation systems; (v) encouraging the establishment of private institutions, including
institutions with foreign investments; and (vi) encouraging foreign experts and Vietnamese
expatriates to teach in Vietnam.

45.    The HERA is backed by an ambitious plan to cover the additional costs over the 15-
year period 2006-2020, which the MOET estimates to be US$20 billion. The largest share is
estimated for HEI infrastructure (US$18 billion) and smaller shares to training program
development, staff development and student financial assistance. The MOET plans to finance
HERA’s additional cost from a combination of public, private and Overseas Development
Assistance (ODA) funds, in which half of the costs are to be covered from private sources.

   This includes lower teacher-student ratios, a reformed entrance examination, better trained teachers, better pedagogy, the
development within universities of research activities that are indispensable for deepening and broadening teachers’ scholarship,
the transformation of selected institutions into teaching and research institutions, improved curriculum frameworks and better
assessment of learning outcomes, greater flexibility of study programs and student mobility with the introduction of a credit
accumulation system, and the development of a quality culture within the institutions, including the implementation of an
accreditation system of all institutions (public and non-public) at the national level.

46.     The Government has plans to raise major ODA financing for the development of the
higher education sector. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) currently
have operations and future plans to provide approximately US$700 million specifically to
Vietnam’s higher education sector. Other ODA contributions to the HERA strategy come from
bilateral sources, including assistance directly to certain HEIs and various scholarship programs
that enable HEI faculty to complete their doctoral studies in overseas universities.

47.      The government financing strategy for HERA also expects that substantial
resources will come from foreign sources. The government has opened the education market,
which provides a range of opportunities for foreign investment and partnerships. The sector
received a boost with the enactment of a March 6, 2000 decree, providing incentives for foreign
investment in several areas, including education and training. To date five foreign-owned
institutions with a total investment of about US$70 million have started operations 21.

48.    HERA assumes that the total government spending for education will reach 20
percent by 2010 and stay at least at that level thereafter. The budget for scientific research to
be conducted by higher education institutions is expected to reach 1.5 percent of the government
budget by 2015. In line with regional practice 22, the principle of cost sharing between the state
and students and families continues to underlie the HERA targets.



21
  Government’s report No. 51/BC-CP dated May 8, 2010
22
  Recent data from Mongolia, Indonesia and China show that tuition fees represent between 30 and 50% of overall income for
public higher education institutions.

                                                            17
WORLD BANK ASSESSMENT

49.      The HERA has ambitious targets and the main challenge for the Government is to
operationalize the strategic goals of HERA by addressing broad governance issues (e.g. legal
and financial frameworks) while promoting local, HEI-level modernization. This requires a shift
in responsibilities between the central authorities and individual HEIs, with the MOET taking on
a “stewardship? role in broad sector orientation, public financing (especially with a view to
ensuring equitable access to higher education), and monitoring results for public accountability.
The governance reforms supported by HERA fit squarely within international best practices and
several Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and East Asian
countries (in particular Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong SAR, China) have greatly increased the
institutional autonomy of their public institutions.23 Greater autonomy has the potential to lead to
better alignment with labor market needs through flexibility, an increased role of external
stakeholders and higher innovation potential in combination with competition. International
experience also shows the importance of putting in place well-working accountability
arrangements, including: (i) appropriate financial and quality assurance mechanisms; (ii)
information and monitoring systems; (iii) management structures with external stakeholder
involvement; and (iv) incentives for competition among HEIs 24.

50.     The Bank recognizes risks in the HERA strategy. The experience of policy
development in Vietnam has revealed economic and institutional constraints inherent in the
system that hinder the pace and directions of the reform. Although concrete steps have already
been taken to begin the reform process, the efforts generally emphasize issuance of decrees and
circulars, campaigns and short workshops for university administrators, rather than deep
structural transformations of management and personnel policies that are needed to achieve
lasting institutional changes. Furthermore, there are gaps in the regulatory and legal
framework, 25 which need to be addressed. Policymakers will need to be flexible in reexamining
and reworking policies based on evidence of their effectiveness. So far, the reform focused on
the need to discipline more strictly HEIs that violate regulations. However, positive incentives
should also be part of the new system-level oversight mechanisms, along with tough penalties, to
ensure quality improvement emerge from inside HEIs themselves.

51.    Some measures may have unintended effects. Raising standards that new private
investors have to meet to enter the higher education market are intended to improve quality;
overly restrictive standards may, however, constrain investment to the point where the
Government’s targets for quantitative expansion are not met . Likewise, the continuous
application of cost sharing policies between the state and students with a rising share of tuition
fees may have unintended negative consequences on the equity of access if not adequately
mitigated by effective student loans and scholarships policies.

IV.       BANK SUPPORT TO GOVERNMENT’S STRATEGY

LINK TO CPS

52.    The World Bank five-year Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 26 supports
Government’s “Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan 2011-2015.? Under CPS Pillar
I, which focuses on building the country’s competitiveness, the World Bank’s program will help
to “develop a higher education system that produces graduates better suited to the new
economy’s needs? to which the three HEDPO operations are expected to contribute.

53.     Higher education contributes to economic development. Building a higher education
system in Vietnam that is innovative, responsive to the demands of the market and of high
quality is essential to Vietnam’s economic growth and development. The Government has
requested the World Bank to provide continued support for its higher education agenda,
recognizing the success of past collaboration in the sector. This is all the more critical at a time
when Vietnam, having recently acceded to membership of the WTO, is looking to develop a
skilled population, with a strong knowledge base, that will position the country for economic
expansion and integration into the global economy.

54.      Higher education contributes to social development and equity. Economic
development is not the only driver of investment in higher levels of education. Higher education
institutions also satisfy a growing demand from students for a sophisticated and rewarding
education and provide a forum in which societies can examine their culture and values, analyze
problems and identify appropriate solutions. The higher education system must provide equal
education opportunities, regardless of students’ gender, ethnicity, family income or other
characteristics.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

55.     The IMF has not had a program in Vietnam since the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility expired in April 2004. But it maintains a regular policy dialogue through Article IV
consultations, interim staff visits, and its resident representative office in Hanoi. It supplements
this dialogue with technical assistance. The IMF has engaged closely in the Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC) process, including through the provision of Letters of Assessment in
support of PRSC operations. There are a range of ongoing areas of joint work between the Bank
and the Fund, which are of direct relevance to the Economic Management and Competitiveness
Credit. These include: (i) a joint work program on strengthening debt management; (ii) annual
joint debt sustainability analysis; (iii) tax policy and administration reform; (iv) public
expenditure management; (v) banking sector supervision; and (vi) the Financial Sector
Assessment Program.

56.     In the education sector, the International Finance Corporation, through the Vietnam
Business Forum Secretariat cooperates closely with the World Bank in Vietnam and contributes
actively in the area of policy development, particularly in foreign investment policy and
strategies for the sector.

57.    The two multilateral Banks - ADB and WB - are currently working together in the higher
education sector, supporting the implementation of two new model university projects. The new
model projects provide opportunities to demonstrate the benefits of innovative arrangements in
governance, financing, quality improvement, quality assurance and financial management in
research-oriented universities. The Bank’s work in quality assurance has also benefited from
experiences from pilot projects in selected universities, supported by the Netherlands
Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

58.    HEDPO1-3 is designed explicitly to complement the Poverty Reduction Support
Credits, focusing on macro and structural reforms. It bridges the gap between the macro-
reform agenda and the micro-operational foundations of ongoing investment operations. It
supports a set of mid-level policy and institutional actions that institutionalize a programmatic
reform agenda for improved delivery of higher education services.

59.     HEDPO1-3, along with the HEP2, the New Model University Project and the
Fostering Innovation, Research, Science and Technology Project, supports the
Government’s implementation of the HERA. HEP2 provided grants to a large number of
universities to improve their training and research activities. HEP2 also provided technical
assistance, workshops and training for policy development. This process covered the definition
of the problems, the collection and analysis of information, and the development and discussion
of policy options. HEDPO1-3 covers the promulgation and execution of policy measures. NMUP
demonstrates these policy measures in specific institutional settings. The forthcoming FIRST
project will further strengthen innovation policy development.

60.     The set of higher education operations mentioned above complements the Bank’s
support for access to, and quality of, basic education. The School Education Quality
Assurance Program (SEQAP), the Vietnam Escuala Nueva Project (VNEN) and the forth-
coming School Readiness Promotion Project (SRPP) aim at increasing the opportunities of
learning in basic education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. In this way, the Bank’s
Vietnam education portfolio contributes both to the Government’s growth strategy (CPS Pillar I)
and its equity strategy (CPS Pillar III). More generally, equity issues in the education sector will
continue to be a major focus of the World Bank's support for basic education. With an emphasis
on achieving an equitable distribution of quality education outcomes across the school-age
population and ensuring a greater proportion of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds
complete basic education, the opportunities of these groups to take up post-basic education will
increase.

LESSONS LEARNED

61.     A comprehensive approach is needed to reform. Previous operations highlight the
importance of a comprehensive approach to reform in particular because of the linkages between
policy actions across policy areas, so that a piecemeal approach would end up being less
effective. For instance, shifting from state control to state supervision of Higher Education (HE)
requires creating regulatory and incentive frameworks to support institutional accountability and
autonomy. These policies, which include quality assurance and accreditation schemes, strong

                                                20
university governing boards, and performance-based funding mechanisms, form the architecture
of a competitive, autonomous higher education system with ever-improving standards. In order
to make this transition, the Government of Vietnam (GOV) will need to reduce the number of
planning and oversight functions but increase its efficiency in carrying out these functions.

62.      Time requirement is long but efforts are steady. Progress in several areas of higher
education reform has been slower than expected. Vietnam’s consensus building processes takes
time and a realistic timetable would ensure consistent and continued progress towards achieving
critical policy measures.

63.     Better coordination would strengthen policy reforms. There is a need for greater
coordination of policy reforms in higher education than is currently being provided by MOET.
As discussed earlier, many important public HEIs do not report to MOET. Therefore, reforming
HEIs relationships with these other ministries or offices is crucial if they are to fully benefit from
the autonomy provided by MOET.

64.     Different incentives would provide more support to HEIs to implement the new
mechanisms set up by the reform. A policy-based operation such as a Development Policy
Operation (DPO) that provides funding to the Government for policies it adopted but expects
implementation to be carried out by autonomous institutions led to a mismatch between
incentives and implementation. Aside from increased autonomy to impact their financial
situation in the future, HEIs were offered no other incentives and minimal technical support to
put in place required new mechanisms, institutional arrangements, and overall improvements. In
future programs in Vietnam it would be important to consider possible different incentives to
HEIs, both financial and perhaps technical support, to motivate implementation of new policies.

65.      Some issues remain, related to the ambiguity of the content, feasibility for
implementation, comprehensiveness and consistency between different regulations for
higher education. HEIs will need to have the capacity both to decide their own goals and
programs and determine how their goals and programs will be pursued. Critical for the nascent
institutional autonomy will be “academic freedom, individual academic autonomy, institutional
sovereignty and institutional self-determination? 27. Vietnam’s higher education system is very
much in early stage of development. The tendency of “awaiting instruction from the top? still
exists. Many universities are still looking for specific guidance for implementation from the
center. In many ways, some universities are still passive in performing their roles in the new
legal environment.

66.     Government’s incremental approach, rather than a radical “paradigm shift?, in
implementing its higher education reform may prove virtuous but to succeed in a fast
changing world requires both efficiency and speed. The ability to respond rapidly has become
a significant advantage in business. Most important of all is a strategic vision for immediate and
long-term objectives, direction, demand, capacity relevant to development trends, guiding
ideology, and a general action map; this constitutes a philosophy for development. Vietnam has
ambitious objectives, but without a bold, systematic and comprehensive vision, as well as
processes for implementation of its reform, progress may be less substantial and systematic than

expected. The decision-making process at the highest levels relies on extensive consensus
building across a range of political stakeholders. Thus, the development of the HERA and the
HE Law involved an extensive consultation process with numerous stakeholder groups. There
was a serious effort to collect inputs from different groups of Vietnamese society. In addition to
internal discussions within government, consultation workshops were held with local officials,
universities, groups of academics, the domestic business sector, international and local experts.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNING

67.      The study “Higher Education and Skills for Growth 28? showed that the demand for
skills has been increasing significantly in Vietnam, due to a combination of inter-industry
employment changes, capital accumulation and skills-based technical change. Employment
opportunities for tertiary graduates now exist in most sectors. Higher education graduates also
contribute positively to firm productivity. On the one hand, this evidence provides a strong
justification for further expansion and improvement of higher education. On the other hand,
increasing evidence of skills bottlenecks, combined with broad institutional and financing
constraints, suggests that the higher education system may not have yet the tools to adapt to the
growing and changing needs of the dynamic economy. Improving higher education
responsiveness will require a set of reforms that create a more flexible and diverse system, with
more private sector participation, higher autonomy at the HEI level and greater emphasis on
research with the potential development of centers of excellence. The study recommends that the
government creates supporting governance and financing frameworks, with new roles for the
public and private sector, by pursuing a reform agenda in stages. The initial stages would aim at
strengthening the framework for a competitive higher education system, while helping
universities improve the relevance of decision making to the emerging social and economic
needs. A later stage would then focus on further investments in building a first class higher
education system.

68.     A regional flagship report on “Putting Higher Education to Work: Skills and
Research for Growth in East Asia 29? shows that higher education systems in East Asia are not
contributing actively to innovation and technological capacity, and have not effectively
addressed the mismatches between the demand and the supply of skills. These structural deficits
largely result from countries’ failure to implement coherent sets of policies to address the
challenges and shape the directions of their higher education system in holistic ways. These
problems are compounded by the institutional segmentation and fragmentation that characterize
higher education system of most countries in the region. In Vietnam, for instance, the significant
transfer of decision making authority to HEIs in recent years has been recognized but was
accompanied by: (i) ambiguity of content; (ii) low implementation feasibility; and (iii)
inconsistency between different regulations due to the lack of systematic vision and coordination
between agencies responsible for higher education. The study argues that a well performing
higher education system can only be achieved by establishing the right incentives through
autonomy and accountability, and mobilizing and allocating resources efficiently and effectively.

69.     A case study on “Equity and Access to Tertiary Education in Vietnam? 30 has also
been conducted to investigate the results and lessons of efforts to expand access to tertiary
education and improve the chances of success for under-privileged youths (with particular
emphasis on the effects of the fee structure as well as student loans and scholarships schemes).
The study found that the comprehensive package of measures introduced by the Government has
had some success in reducing disparities. However, it also documents important gaps and offers
concrete recommendations on how to address them – with focus on the amount, coverage and
allocation of student aid and loan schemes.

70.     The Government, under HEP2, conducted several important diagnostics and policy
deliberation including: (i) the development of the Higher Education Sector Master Plan; (ii) the
calculation of actual and appropriate unit costs; (iii) the evaluation of public financing policies
and procedures; and (iv) the development of the quality assurance framework. Details about
these diagnostics and policy recommendations are presented in the next section, which describes
the policy measures included in HEDPO3 31.


V.           THE PROPOSED OPERATION

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

71.     As mentioned in the introduction, the preparation of HEDPO3 has taken longer than
originally planned but the program content remains consistent with the on-going
Government’s Higher Education Reform Agenda. In addition to the complexity of the
reforms, the Government’s wish to include key policy measures in the Higher Education Law
required more time for consultation and consensus building. The Law was not expected by the
previous HEDPOs. Instead, it was foreseen that by HEDPO3 the Government would have only
issued a Master Plan of Higher Education. The approval of the Education Law at highest level of
authority (National Assembly) in June 2012 reflects the strong commitment of the Government.
In other words, Vietnam went beyond the defined prior actions in HEDPO1-3, overachieving
compared to initial expectations. In this context, it made sense to wait for the approval of the
Higher Education Law before programming the 3th operation.

72.    The policy measures for HEDPO1-3, summarized in the Policy Matrix (Annex 2),
are drawn from the Government’s HERA Strategy and the recommendations from the Country
Fiduciary Accountability Assessment 2007 (“CFAA 2007?) 32 that are relevant to the higher
education sector. All measures have been selected on the basis of: (i) the importance for the
achievement of key reform objectives; (ii) Government ownership; (iii) transparency and
30
     World Bank (2011)
31 A   detailed list of analytical outputs produced by the World Bank and others is presented in Annex 4 (list of analytical outputs).
32
  The CFAA 2007 analyzed the education sector and highlighted four key findings and recommendations:
 •  Improve the comprehensiveness of annual budgets by incorporating all revenues and other fund sources;
 •  Develop and implement measures to require public, private and semi-public institutions to adopt standard PFM practices and
    provide regular financial and audited annual financial statements, as well as public disclosure of budget plans and financial
    reports;
 • Require institutions that are controlled by provinces, cities or other ministries, to provide financial plans and financial audit
    reports to the relevant sector Ministry to enhance the comprehensiveness of sector budgets and sector oversight;
 • Increase transparency by ensuring compliance with requirements for publication of quarterly and annual plans, budget
    allocations, financial reports and audit results.

                                                                          23
predictability of the achievement; and (iv) the agreed framework and use of Government’s own
systems and procedures for implementation, monitoring and evaluation, its cycles and timelines
HEDPO1 set out initial elements of reform, HEDPO2 extended the scope of key policies and
HEDPO3 aims to institutionalize key reform measures at the highest legislative level.

73.     The government conducted extensive consultation on the key policy measures that are
included in the HEDPO series. Focused group discussions have been held to discuss the
concepts and directions for change. The drafting of the new regulations goes through many
iterations with inputs from key constituencies. The final drafts are published on the websites of
the government agencies for public consultation for 60 days before they are submitted for final
signature and promulgation.

74.      HEDPO3 aims to strengthen governance, financing and quality of higher education
by (i) improving the responsiveness of higher education and research and increase the
quantitative capacity of the system; (ii) enhancing fiscal transparency, sustainability and
effectiveness of the higher education sector; and (iii) improving the quality of Higher Education
institutions.

75.    The HEDPO3 prior actions are presented below. The HE Law is the most important
policy action as it covers all three broad policy areas: (i) Governance; (ii) Financing and
Financial Management; and (iii) Quality. In addition to the HE Law, other prior actions have
been presented along these policy areas as summarized in the following Box 1.

                                  Box 1. Prior actions of HEDPO3

Higher Education Law

Prior action 1: The National Assembly has enacted Law No. 08/2012/QH13, of June 18, 2012, on
Higher Education, defining: (i) the qualification and training modalities of HEIs; (ii) the
classification of HEIs; (iii) the structure of networks of HEIs and their differentiation/segmentation in
the system by institutional missions; (iv) the regulation of HEIs’ institutional autonomy and
accountability in academic, organizational and financial affairs; and (v) the regulation of HEIs’
institutional accreditation and quality assurance processes.

Governance

Prior action 2: MOET has issued Circulars No 57/2011/TT-BGDDT and 20/2012/TT-BGDDT, of
December 2, 2011 and June 12, 2012, respectively, increasing the autonomy of HEIs in setting their
students enrolment targets, based on minimum conditions of staff qualifications and training facilities

Prior action 3: The Government has issued Decree No. 73/2012/ND-CP of September 26, 2012, on
foreign cooperation and investment in education, setting forth the parameters for the establishment
and operation of foreign-capitalized educational institutions.

Financing and financial management

Prior action 4: The Recipient has: (i) prepared for all (45) HEIs, under the management of MOET,
annual financial reports for the fiscal year 2011 (incorporating all revenues, expenditures and funding
sources); and (ii) completed the audits of the financial statements of fiscal year 2010 of at least

                                                     24
twenty-five (25) HEIs under the management of MOET.

Quality

Prior action 5: MOET has issued Circular No. 57/2012/TT-BGDDT of December 27, 2012, amending
Decision No. 43/2007/QD-BGDDT, of August 15, 2007 on higher education credit-based training
system, providing for: (i) HEIs guidance on the application of credit-based training curricula; (ii)
minimum training standards for HEIs; (iii) consistency in HEIs’ grading systems; (iv) an early
warning system for students to maintain acceptable level of credit accumulation; and (v) the
implementation steps for the revised credit-based system in HEIs.

Prior action 6: At least one hundred and fifty (150) HEIs have established internal quality assurance
units in order to ensure appropriate and adequate standards of service provision.

76.     Following the revision of the Education Law in December 2009, the Government has
secured approval for a new Higher Education Law that governs the administration of
higher education. The purpose of this Law is to provide legal guarantees that are required for
exercising the constitutional right to teaching and learning. The Law addresses issues such as the
relationship between MOET and HEIs, the creation and closure of HEIs, the appointment and
dismissal of teachers, and the selection and evaluation of students. The Law creates legal
conditions for HEIs enabling them to operate in line with and to benefit from the autonomy
guaranteed therein, and to ensure lecturer, researcher and student participation in exercising
autonomy. The scope of the Higher Education Law covers all activities in the domain of higher
education and the pertaining service-related and administrative activities, to the organizations
and institutions facilitating the execution of such tasks as well as to all stakeholders such as
founders, lecturers and academic researchers, other staff, and students within Vietnam as well as
the Vietnamese HEIs operating overseas. The Law reveals an effort towards institutional
autonomy for HEIs on many important aspects like planning, opening and closing units, new
programs, financial management and staffing.

Prior action 1: The National Assembly has enacted Law No. 08/2012/QH13, of June 18, 2012, on
Higher Education, defining: (i) the qualification and training modalities of HEIs; (ii) the
classification of HEIs;           (iii) the structure of networks of HEIs and their
differentiation/segmentation in the system by institutional missions; (iv) the regulation of HEIs’
institutional autonomy and accountability in academic, organizational and financial affairs; and (v)
the regulation of HEIs’ institutional accreditation and quality assurance processes.
  Status: HE Law was passed by the National Assembly on June 18, 2012 and effective since/went
                                     into effect on January 1, 2013.



POLICY AREAS

77.      In addition to the approval of the Higher Education Law mentioned above, policy
measures for HEDPO3 are grouped under the themes of governance, financing, and quality. Each
theme will be presented through: i) brief diagnostics of the issues/challenges, key measures taken
under HEDPO1-2; ii) how the Law addresses these issues/challenges; and iii) support and
initiatives beyond the law and remaining reform agenda for further follow-up.

78.    The policy area aims at improving the responsiveness of higher education and research
and increasing the quantitative capacity of the system.

i) Diagnostics

79.    Rapid expansion of the Vietnamese Higher Education system over the past two
decades has outpaced the evolution of the regulatory and legal framework. In 1987, there
were 101 universities and colleges, all of which were public. By September 2009, there were 376
universities and colleges, of which just over twenty percent were non-public. By 2012, Vietnam
counted 419 HEIs (80 are private). Currently, all but one of Vietnam’s 63 provinces possesses at
least one tertiary education institution. Vietnam needs to avoid letting HE system growing
spontaneously as the fruit of initiatives of some actors and the incapacity of others to respond to
the student demand, but, instead, to give high priority at setting up a well thought organized
system. The Government recognizes the need to address the issue of dispersed authority for
decision-making in Vietnam’s higher education system and the importance to decentralize
decisions which can be taken at institutional level.

80.    In HEDPO1, the Prime Ministerial Decision No. 380/QD-TTG dated March 24, 2009
issued the regulation on a charter for the first “new model? university, conferring
academic, managerial and financial autonomy to the Vietnam-German University (one of
the two new model universities that are being supported by World Bank and Asian Development
Bank under the NMUPs). This decision has allowed this HEI to enjoy high autonomy and special
operational mechanisms beyond previous practices in financial management, including setting its
own tuition fees and salary for staff based on competencies and professional performance.

81.      Under HEDPO2, significant progress was made towards putting in place the
regulatory environment and common rules of operation. Prime Ministerial Decision No.
58/QD-TTg dated September 22, 2010 put in place regulations on the generic HEI Charters
setting out functions of key bodies within HEIs. The generic HEI Charter is crucial for the
success of the government’s policy towards increasing autonomy. The generic HEI Charter,
applicable to both public and private universities, academies and colleges in charge of higher
education, sets forth the duties and rights of HEIs regarding their three fundamental missions:
education and training, fundamental and applied research and interaction with society (outreach).
It also defines the rights and duties of academic, technical and administrative staff, the duties and
rights of students, institutional governance and composition and roles of the different bodies
involved in managerial, financial and academic decisions. Finally, the Charter stipulates the
control mechanisms of institutions, as well as procedures for the settlement of violations.
Experience in the adoption of University Charters has been mixed, with mostly public HEIs
reporting difficulties with conflicting legislation, and uncertainties and need for guidance on
implementation. Several HEIs have commented that HEI Charters should distinguish and be
modified for different types of HEI, i.e., public and private.

82.   In line with the objective of increasing the autonomy of HEIs, the charter entrusted
most of the decision power to two bodies, the University Council and the Rector, approved
under the same Prime Ministerial Decision that regulated the Charter. The University

                                                 26
Council is considered the management authority of HEIs, responsible for passing resolutions on
major policies to implement the autonomy and social duties of universities as assigned by the
state. It is also responsible for nominating candidates for Rectors and Vice-Rectors for
appointment (for public universities) or approval (for private universities) by the competent
government body. The Rector is directly responsible for managing and leading institutional
activities as stipulated in the State’s laws and in the Charter. Participation of the private sector in
University Councils is expected, thereby supporting stronger linkages between universities and
the private sector, and therefore ultimately higher responsiveness to labor market needs.

83.     To guide the development of the regulatory framework, a Master Plan for
Vietnam’s Higher Education system was developed. The elaboration of the Master Plan is a
means to put in place a multi-tiered structure of higher education and research capable of
reaching the ambitious goals of HERA. Informed by relevant international and regional
experience, the Master Plan that provides a vision of a tiered higher education system and
pathways and policy options to implement the vision produced. While the Master Plan is
primarily concerned with organization and governance of the system, it also proposes approaches
to financing and quality assurance. The Master Plan is articulated around the following eight
objectives/long-term goals: (i) a multi-functional, multi-tiered post-secondary education system
where four segments are proposed 33; (ii) a multi-owned system with clarification on the
distinction between private HEIs that are “for-profit? and “not-for-profit?; (iii) a system-wide
coordination which establish a single point of authority to coordinate and guide the education
and research system in accordance with State priorities; (iv) a strong and appropriate institutional
governance where university councils will be the supreme legal bodies of universities and where
roles of a university chair and a rector are clearly separated and clarified; (v) the integration of
research and teaching where research funds are made available directly to research institutes and
universities on a purely competitive and transparent basis; (vi) increased private-sector
investment by reviewing the range of financial incentives available and actively developing
relationships with public and private sector enterprises; (vii) increased funding support and the
attainment of equity by establishing an income-contingent loan scheme for students; and (viii)
improved quality by developing a quality assurance system.

ii) How the HE Law addresses these issues/challenges

84.      The HE Law is backed by the Master Plan for the HE system, which presents options
and recommendations for further reform of the system. The Master Plan was originally included
as a trigger for HEDPO3. However, as mentioned before, the government’s legal framework puts
the Higher Education Law as the highest legislation governing the sector. MOET therefore took
important recommendations of the Master Plan and included them in the Law to address issues
mentioned above. The HE Law specifically addresses the following aspects of the Master Plans:
(i) in its article 9, addresses the issue of a multi-tiered system (as outlined in the Master Plan)
where higher education institutions are classified into (a) research-oriented higher education
institutions; (b) application-oriented higher education institutions; and (c) vocational-oriented
33
   The four segments include: (a) “research oriented? universities (accounting for about 5% of all higher education
students), (b) “teaching-oriented? universities (accounting for about 20% of all higher education students), (c)
“teaching dominant? universities (accounting for about 25% of all higher education students) and (d) colleges that
provide two year and three-year diploma programs, with professional-secondary and post-secondary vocational
training programs to be merged and delivered exclusively by these colleges

                                                         27
higher education institutions; (ii) defines non-profit foreign-capitalized higher education
institutions in its article 4; (iii) provides some clarification to improve institutional governance
although roles are still not clearly separated; (iv) facilitates private-sector investment by
exempting from taxes the amount (at least 25 percent) used for investing in higher education
institution development (article 66); and (v) calls for the development of a quality assurance
system stated in several articles in chapter 7. The Master Plan serves as an excellent reference
document by providing critical inputs to issue the needed decrees to support the HE Law
implementation.

iii) Support and Initiatives beyond the law and remaining reform agenda for further follow-up.

85.     In addition to the approval of the HE Education Law, HEDPO3 supports further
reform steps by the government to ensure a higher education system capable of responding
to the large demand for higher education studies while securing increasing quality of
teaching and research. It specifically focuses on: (i) the issuance of regulations to increase
autonomy of HEIs in setting their enrolment quotas, based on minimum conditions of staff
qualifications and training facilities; and (ii) the adoption of a Decree on the foreign cooperation
and investment in education.

86.    In light of “increased? autonomy granted by the Law, MOET has issued a regulation to
increase the power of HEIs in deciding their enrolment targets.

  Prior action 2: MOET has issued Circulars No 57/2011/TT-BGDDT and 20/2012/TT-BGDDT, of
  December 2, 2011 and June 12, 2012, respectively, increasing the autonomy of HEIs in setting
   their students enrolment targets, based on minimum conditions of staff qualifications and
                                       training facilities.

    Status: Completed (Circulars 57 and 20 of MOET, dated 2 December 2011 & 12 June 2012)


87.     The above regulation transferred the autonomy for setting enrolment targets from
the old centrally-planned mechanism with enrolment quotas allocated by MOET to a mechanism
whereby HEIs register their enrolment targets. MOET checks these targets based on minimum
requirements such as availability and qualifications of staff and training facilities. This policy
liberated the HE supply provision and put HEIs in charge of ensuring minimum quality
conditions with accountability to the public.

88.     Opening up the education sector to foreign providers and joint programs is another
important measure in diversifying and increasing the capacity of the system. In the pipeline
since 2005, included in HEDPO1, but taken out in HEDPO2 and moved to HEDPO3, this decree
was finally issued in September 2012. Covering the entire education system, it stipulates
regulations on foreign investment cooperation. It builds up the legal corridor in joint training
programs in Vietnam with foreign partners, stipulates the mobilization of resources from
overseas to develop the higher education system and provides regulations on procedures for
issuing investment certificates, educational establishment certificates and operation permits.
Challenges remain though as higher figures in capital conditions can hinder foreign investment.


                                                28
[“Projects of investment in establishing higher education institutions must reach at least 150
million VND per student (not including the expense on land tenancy)? – Article 28].

Prior action 3: The Government has issued Decree No. 73/2012/ND-CP of September 26, 2012, on
foreign cooperation and investment in education, setting forth the parameters for the
establishment and operation of foreign-capitalized educational institutions.
                 Status: Completed (Decree N° 73/2012/ND-CP dated 26/09/2012)


89.     Beyond the HEDPOs series, several measures will be required to move from theory
to concrete implementation and to clarify some “contradiction? or “issues? that have not
been enough addressed by the Law. As an example, the law clearly articulates on the
autonomy of higher education establishments, but the opening of new programs are still subject
to reviews by MOET. HEIs are entitled to independently determine tuition fees and charges but
within range set by the government. Likewise, there is yet a common set of rules for the
operation of both public and private HEIs. New regulations, although necessary, won’t be
sufficient. A dramatic change of culture away from central planning and subordination will be
indispensable. The relationship between MOET and other line Ministries and their HEI should
move from a system founded on authority and subordination to a system of contractual
agreement.

Policy Area 2: Financing and Financial Management

90.     This policy area aims at enhancing fiscal transparency, sustainability and effectiveness of
the higher education sector.

i) Diagnostics

91.    Vietnam is spending a significant share of its public resources on higher education.
Twenty (20) percent of the State Budget is allocated to the education and training sector (about
5.3 percent of its GDP). Within the education budget, 11 percent is allocated to higher education
(equivalent to about 0.7 percent of GDP). This level is in line with most middle-income Asian
countries and the budget allocated to tertiary education is therefore significant in relation to the
capacity of the economy.

92.    However, the expansion in student enrolment is far exceeding the increase in public
resources. Between 2000 and 2010, student enrolment in the higher education sector
(universities and colleges) has more than doubled (from 894,000 students in 2000 to 1,936,000
students in 2010). The share of public spending on higher education only increased from roughly
9 percent in 2000 to 12 percent of the total education budget in 2010.

93.     While public funding remains the most important source of revenues of public
universities, the country has successfully mobilized additional resources for the sector. A
survey of 70 universities in 2011 pointed to an average equal split between public funding and
revenues from tuition fees. The share of tuition fees varies across different institutions and
disciplines, with as low as 20 percent for fine arts, 30 percent for medicine and pharmacy to as
high as 60 percent for economics, finance and law. All disciplines except pedagogy and

                                                29
education management, independently of their unit costs, receive a similar public subsidy. The
tuition fee caps (or ranges) across the public higher education system do not reflect actual costs
of different fields of study and institution types, greatly limiting the capacity of the system to
produce high quality training and research.

94.     In spite of significant private resource mobilization for higher education, the rapid
expansion has led to a rather low overall level of spending per student. On average, HEIs
spend around US$320 per student per year. This level of spending is similar across disciplines
(information technology, natural sciences, social sciences, agriculture, forestry and fishery and
economics and law) with the exception of fine arts (almost doubled) and medicine and pharmacy
(tripled). The low level of spending per student is due to the fact that most resources are
allocated to labor costs. In Vietnam, 65 percent of spending is for labor costs and only 35 percent
of spending is for non-labor costs, on average.

95.    Vietnam has not prioritized its public spending fields with high social benefits and
positive externalities. Less than 0.05 percent of GDP is spent on research and development in
higher education 34. This is low in relation to international standards. The relatively low share of
student enrolment in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields (about

34
     The country spends about 0.2% of its GDP in overall R&D.

                                                               30
25 percent) 35 also suggests insufficient prioritization to spending in these important fields.
Vietnam does not have a policy to prioritize public funding across institutions leading to widely
spread out resources (across both institutions and students). In part this is related to a lack of
emphasis on research and differentiation between fields of study, in part to the absence of a fully
tiered system, and in part to the lack of performance-based mechanisms to allocate funds.
Resources are allocated through block grants based on historical costs (unrelated to the actual
number of students, but loosely related to maximum student enrolment quotas determined on the
basis of faculty, facility and transparency indicators).

96.    Recent increases in the amount and coverage of the loan and scholarship program
indicate improvements in the priority given to using public spending for equity purposes.
In 2011/2012 academic year, 1.6 million students are currently beneficiary of a loan,
representing about 60 percent of the student body; and another 15 percent of students benefit
from partial scholarships (fee deductions or exemptions). Decree 49/2010 authorizes
Government to pay scholarships directly to disadvantaged (ethnic minorities, remote) families.

97.     HEDPO1 acknowledged the proposal for restructuring education and financing for
the period 2008-2012 developed by MOET. This proposal reviewed the structure of the
education system; made comparison with selected countries; assessed financing policies adopted
during the period 2001-2008, estimated the demand for education from 2009 to 2020 and made
recommendations for reforming the financing of education during 2009-2012 period. While this
proposal was the first attempt to rationalize financing for education, only selected elements of
the proposal have been put into policies. The main reason was that the proposal reflected mainly
MOET’s perspectives about the system and had not yet incorporated the complex and diverse
incentive systems of other key stakeholders such as MOF, MPI, other ministries and provinces.

98.      HEDPO2 acknowledged two prior actions based on the above proposal, which were:
(i) the regulation and guidelines on criteria-based formula for setting HEIs maximum enrolment
quota; and (ii) Decree 49 on tuition fee levels for 2011-2015 periods. The first action aimed to
make the process for setting enrolment quotas more transparent and linked to HEIs capacity to
deliver programs (mainly number of qualified staff and basic infrastructure). The second action
addressed the chronic low level of tuition fees (set during the early 1980s and unchanged despite
inflation) and delinked the financing for fee exemption and social scholarships from the regular
budget funding to HEIs.

99.     The direction of reform in financing of the higher education sector has shifted. It
was originally envisaged that HEDPOs will lead to a formula for allocating public funds. As the
system has become more reliant on cost-sharing and the cap on enrolment has now been freed
up, the financing strategy will need to take these dynamics into account. The directions for
reforms have been adjusted from the development of formula funding of public financing
towards better prioritization of public resources towards areas with high social
returns/externalities – such as research and STEM fields - inclusiveness, and better allocation of
public and private funding within the public system, including moving to a tiered higher
education system, introducing performance-based mechanisms and incorporating an effective
variable fee system.

35
     According the latest data from UIS.

                                                31
ii) How the Law addresses these issues

100. The HE Law states in chapter 10 that the Government will increase its budget for
higher education. The Government will give priority to development of selected higher
education institutions to become research-oriented universities that provide high quality training
in basic sciences, technology and key social economics fields. The Law also confirms the
principle of cost-recovery in higher education. Special support policies will be adopted for
students from poor areas and ethnic minority and for gender equality. The Government will
contract and ensure funding for major research program with universities that have strong
research and technology capability.

iii) Support and Initiatives beyond the law and remaining reform agenda for further follow-up.

101. HEDPO3 acknowledges the shift in leadership of reforming higher education
financing from MOET to MOF. MOET, who is the main counterpart for the HEDPOs, while
very committed to the goal of improving efficiency and effectiveness, is limited in its capacity to
influence the policy on financing as only less than twenty percent of HEIs receive their budget
from MOET. MOF is the agency that consolidates the budget for the whole sector. At MOF’s
request, the Government has issued a resolution outlining its strategy for: (i) reforming financing
of public institutions (including higher education institutions) with the aim to increase overall
investment in higher education; (ii) greater autonomy to institutions in setting fees and spending
decisions; and (iii) reallocating government subsidies to public goods (STEM, teacher training
and research). The development and implementation of the above strategy will go beyond
the HEDPOs series. The Bank will continue to collaborate with MOF and MOET on the reform
agenda. The implementation of this far reaching reform can entail changes in laws and decrees,
building consensus with MOET and among universities. Better use of public spending must
entail greater focus on research, which could be achieved through channeling more funds to top-
tier institutions (with a clear research mandate, for research proposals in a competitive way
(through MOET or MOST) 36, and to post-graduate courses in research and teaching
institutions. 37 It would also be important to further flesh-out the new policy on fees, making it a
“variable fee? system explicit, with fees set freely by institutions, under cost containment
mechanisms, 38 and varying across disciplines and students (according to their level of
disadvantage). This system would then be complemented and further strengthened by the student
loan program. The proposal also mentions many “priority? fields, both in hard and social
sciences, whose rationale for receiving public subsidies is not necessarily clear. This could
potentially lead to new inefficiencies in public resource use and allocation, including the
introduction of distortions in market mechanisms. One solution could be classifying disciplines
according to their “social benefits? and “private costs? and prioritizing public funding disciplines
with high social benefits and private costs. Many science and technology fields would fall in this
category.

102. In addition to reforming public financing, HEDPO3 aims to improve transparency
and accountability in public financial management in the higher education sub-sector. This

36
   MOST has already set in place a fund for basic research (NAFOSTED) with good potential to channel increasing resources for R&D through
competitive mechanisms.
37
   This would entail keeping or even increasing the public subsidy for these courses which are currently in low supply in Vietnam.

   This would require among other mechanisms, a stronger role for university boards.

                                                                   32
is particularly important given the high level of perceived risk in public investment programs
operating in increasingly decentralized HEIs with moderate institutional capacity. The policy
actions outlined below focus therefore on financial reporting and auditing, with a strong
emphasis on public disclosure.

103. HEDPO1 acknowledged the efforts of 20 HEIs that prepared annual financial reports
for 2007 and 12 MOET-managed HEIs having their 2006 annual financial statements audited by
the State Audit of Vietnam. HEDPO2 acknowledged the efforts by 40 HEIs that prepared their
annual financial reports for 2007 and 20 MOET-managed HEIs having their 2006 annual
financial statements audited by the State Audit of Vietnam (SAV).

104. The prior action to be included in the Public Financial Management (PFM) area of
HEDPO3 Program is:

 Prior action 4: The Recipient has: (i) prepared for all (45) HEIs, under the management of MOET,
annual financial reports the fiscal year 2011 (incorporating all revenues, expenditures and funding
 sources); and (ii) completed the audits of the financial statements of fiscal year 2010 of at least
                      twenty-five (25) HEIs under the management of MOET.

                                        Status: Completed


105. A review of the quality of reports and audits has been undertaken by the World Bank and
recommendations for improvement have been provided to the Government.

Policy Area 3: Quality

106. This policy area aims at improving the quality of higher education institutions. It focuses
on (i) the move to credit-based training system; (ii) the establishment of internal quality
assurance system at HEI level; and (iii) the establishment of the accreditation system.

i) Diagnostics

107. Before 2007, higher education training in Vietnam followed the annual cycle which
was not flexible and efficient. If a student fails to pass, s/he will need to repeat the whole year.
Since 2007, the MOET introduced regulation encouraging HEIs to move to a credit-based
training system. This transition entails many changes to the traditional model of delivery,
including: (i) addition of academic advisors and teaching assistants to the lecturing staff; (ii)
changing the curriculum to fit a modular/credit system; (iii) applying information technology to
course registration and timetabling; and (iv) more extensive use of libraries/labs and other
learning resources. Under HEDPO1, very little happened on this reform. HEDPO2
acknowledged the application of the credit-based system in thirty HEIs.

108. The continuing growth of higher education enrolment puts tremendous pressures on
the quality of teaching, research and public service. There are 419 Higher Education
Institutions in Vietnam – a twofold increase over the last decade. Those institutions serve over
2.5 million students, a 31 percent increase over the same period. Clearly, the rapid growth of
Vietnamese higher education, in the absence of a national quality assurance system, has brought

                                                  33
about problems and great variations in quality. The same sense of fragmentation described under
governance section is reflected in the accreditation efforts which have focused on both
institutional and program accreditation, as well as other modes of external and internal quality
assurance. Rigorous accreditation procedures (external and internal) are important in periods of
rapid expansion and particularly urgent in the Vietnamese context of proliferating new private
universities and diploma mills. Since the government is a major player in every activity, the
challenge is to create the appropriate balance between government control and independent
decision-making that can be trusted and respected by institutions being accredited.

109. HEDPO1 acknowledged the issuance of a regulation (Ministerial Circular
n°09.2009/TT-BGDDT, dated May 7, 2009), requiring HEIs to disclose information relating to
the quality of education facilities, teaching and management staff, income and expenditures on a
regular basis. This regulation aims to improve timeless and quality of information about HEI
performance that is available to the Government, employers, graduates, students and their
families. The Government also established the National Accreditation Body (Ministerial
Decision N° 7113/QD-BGDDT, dated October 23, 2008) that is charged with reinforcing the
quality assurance system at the central level by specifying and ensuring minimum quality
standards.

110. HEDPO2 acknowledged the approval of the Education Law 2009, which led to a
slight adjustment in the Prior Action that required issuing regulations for the
establishment of independent review agencies responsible for regularly assessing public
and private HEIs against minimum standards and advising government on their
accreditation. MOET needed to put out a comprehensive framework for education quality
assurance and accreditation before a new structure for accreditation was set up. A Regulation on
the framework for education quality assurance and accreditation was approved by MOET
(Ministerial Decision No. 4138/QD-BGDDT, dated September 20, 2010). The accreditation
model grants stronger independence to accreditation agencies than the previous model (in which
these agencies only conduct external evaluations and the accreditation/certification rested with
the MOET-led accreditation body). However, in practice, external measures needed to secure a
minimum quality standard and promote quality improvement have made limited progress. A
decision as to whether there will be one or several accreditation agencies and how to secure their
independence and funding has yet to be made. The current discussion centers on whether to
accredit HEIs or programs, which would be extremely costly given the lack of qualified
evaluators.

ii) How the HE Law addresses these issues/challenges

111. The Higher Education Law in its chapter 4 stipulates that higher education training
will follow the credit system. In chapter 7 the Law articulates the objectives, principles and
institutional framework for accreditation of HEIs and their study programs. The Law also
stipulates the need for HEIs to establish their internal quality assurance system that will cover: (i)
the establishment of quality assurance units; (ii) development of quality assurance mechanisms
including internal and external reviews; and (iii) other feedback mechanisms.

iii) Support and initiatives beyond the law and remaining reform agenda for further follow-up


                                                 34
112. HEDPO3 supports further reform steps by the Government to ensure a better quality of
higher education through: (i) the issuance of a circular providing guidance to HEIs on the
application of the credit-based training system; and (ii) setting-up of internal quality assurance
systems. More than one hundred HEIs have now moved to the credit-based training system and
as part of HEDPO3, a regulation will be issued by MOET to provide further guidance to HEIs
on this transition. The introduction of the credit system has been well received by HEIs.
However, consultation with HEIs shows that institutions face many challenges during this
important transition. At some of the institutions, the change was merely a formality with little
change in the curricula or teaching processes. The information technology infrastructure tends to
be unable to serve the high volume of transactions required under this new system. The low
number of teaching staff and lack of teaching assistants and academic advisors limit the choice
of courses available to students and the grading system is inconsistent with traditional grading
that has been widely accepted by employers.  A review of experience points to further revision
of this important policy.

Prior action 5: MOET has issued Circular No. 57/2012/TT-BGDDT of December 27, 2012, amending
 Decision No. 43/2007/QD-BGDDT, of August 15, 2007 on higher education credit-based training
 system, providing for: (i) HEIs guidance on the application of credit-based training curricula; (ii)
   minimum training standards for HEIs; (iii) consistency in HEIs’ grading systems; (iv) an early
   warning system for students to maintain acceptable level of credit accumulation; and (v) the
                 implementation steps for the revised credit-based system in HEIs.

                                         Status: Complete


113. Regarding the setting up of internal quality assurance, it has to be mentioned here
that HEDPO1 did not include this policy measure and only focused on the set-up of the external
accreditation system. During the preparation of HEDPO2 this aspect was discussed in depth and
the government acknowledged the fact that quality should ultimately come from efforts within
universities. It was agreed that HEDPO3 will include measure to increase the number of HEIs
having established internal quality assurance systems at their institutions.

     Prior action 6: At least one hundred and fifty (150) HEIs have established internal quality
   assurance units in order to ensure appropriate and adequate standards of service provision.

                   Status: 153 HEIs have set up internal quality assurance units


114. Progress within HEIs in developing internal quality systems has been encouraging.
Over 150 quality assurance centers have been established in HEIs nationwide since the
regulation was promulgated in 2008 and strengthened in 2010. There are 891 staff in charge of
quality assurance, including 117 institutions with more than 4 persons in charge. They collect
data on an annual basis as required by MOET and several have done excellent work beginning to
promote a “quality culture? at their institutions. These fledgling units have promoted
collaborative relations with Accreditation on Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)-
accredited universities outside Vietnam to strengthen their own programs. Others use
International Standards Organization as a measure for internal quality assurance. However,

                                                   35
capacity to provide quality assurance services to universities and faculties is still limited. HEIs
informally report different progress in establishing quality systems lack of guidance and need for
technical assistance to make progress.

115. In addition to promote the development of a quality assurance culture at the institutional
level, the Government is also setting up an accreditation system with externally set quality
standards. The implementation of accreditation framework will be a first step towards
accountability for performance. To complete the institutional framework for accreditation two
policy documents regulatiing the conditions for the establishment of independent accreditation
agencies and minimum qualifications of accreditors will need to be completed.

116. Table 9 documents the triggers that were articulated for HEDPO3 at the time of
negotiation of HEDPO2 and the actual prior actions that finally included in HEDPO3.

VI.    OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

117. Vietnam is in the process of increasing the coverage of its Higher Education system,
going from servicing a small urban elite to making it accessible to the wider population. This
expansion appears to be generally equitable: As shown in Figure 4 and 5, although the richest
quintile has the highest level of tertiary education participation, access has also improved for
the poorest quintiles and ethnic minorities, albeit from a very low base. Quintiles 2 and 3
have seen the highest increase in participation rates. This data indicates that the system-wide
expansion does not exclude any particular groups, and more and more capable, talented youth
from low socio-economic backgrounds benefit from higher education opportunities. Despite
these encouraging trends of the poor and ethnic minorities accessing higher education, they
remain far behind groups from higher socio-economic backgrounds. Reasons for a lower
participation rate of youth from these groups can be found at earlier levels of education where
limited access to schools, low teacher quality and poor schooling conditions limit their
participation at pre-higher education levels. Indeed, a first major problem facing Vietnam is
persistent inequalities in attainment, attendance and completion at primary and secondary level,
particularly along the income and ethnic dimension. As an example, primary completion rates
are 73 percent for the poorest children, versus roughly 95 percent for the upper income quintile.
The lower income quintile has attendance rates below the national average at both lower and
upper secondary level. The gap between Kinh on one hand and remaining ethnic minorities on
the other, is present at all education levels. It is therefore imperative that interventions aiming at
improved participation at the HE level also include interventions at the pre-school, primary and
secondary education levels. All the Bank’s non HE programs (early childhood development,
primary education) concentrate on helping to raise access to better quality of basic education of
the disadvantaged children (poor, Ethnic Minorities, children with disabilities, etc.). The Global
Partnership on Output-Based Aid is furthermore providing scholarships to more than 8000
students from poor families to go upper secondary schools in 11 provinces.

118. The government has been relying on cost-recovery to support the expansion of
higher education but they also institute measures to safeguard the poor’s access to higher
education. To avoid leaving behind students who cannot afford tuitions fees, the Government
has set up a massive loans scheme (with a total amount above 1.85 billion USD towards 868,715
students in Universities and more than US$1,3 billion for 760,937 students in colleges in 2012).
Amongst the beneficiaries, more than 60 percent come from poor and near poor households. The
policy of fee exemption has also become more pro-poor, as evidenced in the higher proportions
of students from lower income quintiles reported being exempted. However, the Bank will
continue to monitor developments.

119. Fostering private sector participation will benefit to the whole population including
the poorest students. Indeed, experience around the world shows that private education is the
quickest way to achieve expansion in higher education (private providers can move faster and
sometimes more effectively to fill gaps in supply of higher education). 39 Private sector
participation in Vietnam is likely to significantly benefit relatively lower income families who do
not have access to HE. In a review of the HE system in Vietnam, widening access to higher
education was attributed to a number of government policies, including the establishment and
development of non-public higher education institutions in rural and remote areas, and the
introduction of a student loan program 40. This program will lead to increase opportunities for the
poorest students to pursue education at higher level.

120. Furthermore, by supporting a comprehensive financing strategy to address needs for
resources diversification, the program will strengthen efficiency in public spending in HE
leading to cost-saving that will in turn generate more resources for expanding access to a
wider population (in particular trough the development of loan and scholarship programs as
mentioned above).

121. The move to a credit-based training system (well under way) will provide more
flexibility to students to continue their studies as they will not have to repeat the whole year
if they fail to pass some courses. This quality improvement measure is likely to benefit mostly
poor students who need to work at the same time as they study to cover the costs of their
education.

122. Finally, investing in Higher Education is a crucial part of Vietnam’s drive toward
greater productivity, growth and technological development. Helping the Higher Education

therefore support the country to sustain the growth of recent decades that will benefit to the
whole society, contributing to avoid the low middle-income trap and to decrease poverty rates.

Gender

123. Vietnam ranks 79th out of 135 countries in World Economic Forum’s Global Gender
Gap Index for 2011, where the four determining measures are: (i) economic participation and
opportunity; (ii) educational attainment, (iii) health and survival; and (iv) political
empowerment. In the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Women’s Economic Opportunity Index
2012, Vietnam is ranked slightly lower, at number 87 out of 128 countries. Here, the rating is
based on indicators in 5 different categories: (i) labor policy and practice; (ii) access to finance;
(iii) education and training; (iv) women’s legal and social status; and (v) general business
environment.

124. Whilst Vietnam is ranked higher than a number of other countries at roughly the
same level of development, there is still a lot of potential for improving Vietnam’s
performance in these global gender equality indices with a focus on higher education
opportunities, thereby contributing to improving Vietnam’s competitiveness. On Women’s
Economic Opportunity Index, countries such as Singapore, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, China,
and the Philippines all rank higher than Vietnam, while the only other East Asian countries in the
Index with lower rankings than Vietnam are Cambodia and Laos. 41

Gender and Education
125. The 2008 VHLSS shows continued increases in educational attainment among
younger cohorts of men and women (18-21 year olds) compared to the 2004 and 2006
surveys. Women have caught up or surpassed men in terms of attaining junior college and
university degrees. Younger cohorts of children entering school are also more likely to stay on to
complete their secondary schooling. As a result, among current school aged children, Vietnam
has closed and even reversed gender gaps in primary, secondary and tertiary schooling.

126. However, some gender disparities exist amongst children in poor regions who are
ethnic minorities. The Northwest region, which has highest levels of poverty, is the region
reporting marked gender inequalities in education. Among 15-17 year olds, only 53 percent of
girls remained enrolled in secondary school compared to 68 percent of boys. As far as ethnicity
is concerned, Khmer/Cham and Northern Mountain ethnic groups all report female disadvantage
in enrolment rates. Among the H’Roi minority the gender gap is 25 percentage points. There are
also gender gaps in dropout rates among ethnic minorities, for example less than one fifth of
H’Roi boys left school while more than 40 percent of girls did 42.


41
   Vietnam is rated somewhat better on two other Gender equality indices with more emphasis on human
development indicators and less emphasis on economic opportunities: the Gender Inequality Index (Vietnam was
ranked 48 out of 174 countries in 2011) and the Gender Empowerment Index (Vietnam was ranked 52 out of 155
countries in 2008
42
   Chi (2009)
                                                      43
127. In higher education, women not only have caught up, but are also surpassing men in
university enrolments. The female enrolment share increased from 41.6 percent in 2000 to 48.8
percent in 2008 and in 2008. Furthermore in 2008, 22.5 percent of woman aged 18-21 was
attending junior college or university, compared to only 19.6 percent of men. Yet, gender
disparities persist in the choice of fields of study. Men are more likely to specialize in
engineering, manufacturing, construction and services while women specialize in social sciences,
education, humanities and the arts. 29 percent of men compared to 11 percent of women enrolled
in tertiary degrees focused on engineering, manufacturing and construction while 41 percent of
women compared to 26 percent of men specialized in social sciences, business and law. Only in
general programs and health do we see similar degrees of clustering. Moreover, while gender
parity has been achieved at undergraduate levels, only 30.5 percent of Masters’ degrees and 17.1
percent of PhDs were awarded to women in 2007 (Ministry of Labor - Invalids and Social
Affairs, 2010).

Gender and employment
128. In 2011, the World Bank in Vietnam led the development of a Country Gender
Assessment (CGA) which looked at gender and employment as one of its three focus areas.
According to the CGA, women’s participation in the labor force is relatively high in Vietnam at
72.3 percent in 2009 compared to 81 percent for men. When looking more specifically at the
Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), which has women’s labor force participation as one of its
indicators, this positive trend is also reflected in Vietnam’s ranking at 13 on this particular
indicator.

129. Nonetheless, the high ranking on this indicator is outweighed by poorer
performance in some of the other indicators. For example, the GGGI includes an indicator on
wage equality for similar work, where women’s wages for similar work are recorded to be only
69 percent of men’s in Vietnam. 43 This is similar to the findings of the World Bank’s CGA,
which furthermore notes that women are still highly segregated by both industry and occupation.
If one looks at industrial segregation using the Duncan Index (a commonly used measure of job
segregation illustrating the percentage of all female workers who would have to switch industries
in order to equalize the distribution between men and women), the number for urban areas was
70 in 2008, which means that 70 percent of women would have to switch sectors in order to
equalize job distribution with men. In urban areas the number was around 52 percent. Both in
rural and urban areas, women are more likely to be in lower paying industries and the proportion
of skilled female workers is only half that of skilled male workers. 44.

130. The CGA furthermore highlights how women are also in more vulnerable jobs, for
example, own-account work and unpaid family labor. In fact, during the recent economic
crisis, women disproportionately left wage employment for more vulnerable jobs. Women also
receive less vocational training, and undertake a disproportionate amount of unpaid work, which
is seen as a barrier not only to employment, but also to civic participation.

43
   When looking at individual indicators in the GGGI (there is a total of 14), Vietnam gets the poorest rankings on
sex ratio at birth and women in ministerial positions, and the best ratings under the ratio of men/women of
professional and technical workers and on healthy life expectancy.
44

                                                        44
131. The CGA recommends therefore to strengthen training and incentives for women to
enter a broader range of occupations as the CGA notes that as Vietnam is moving into middle
income status, women are likely to be at a particular disadvantage in gaining access to newly
created jobs in higher-tech industries that demand workers with scientific, engineering and
technical skills.

132. Challenges remain to address the inequities described above. The HEDPOs
contribution to the general increase in the quantity and quality of higher education provision
indirectly improves the opportunities to access higher education by women. The program’s result
framework pays attention to monitoring gender-disaggregated data on important dimensions such
as enrolment ratio and ratio of female students accessing loans. Further support should aim to
ensure a fairer distribution of men and woman in fields of study that will in turn impact women’s
role, position and responsibility in labor market.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

133. The policies supported by the proposed operation relate to governance, financing,
and quality of teaching and are not likely to have any significant positive or negative effects
on the country's environment, forest, and other natural resources. Under the governance
policy area, one of the Higher Education Development Policy Program (HEDPP) objectives is to
increase the quantitative capacity of the higher education sector. The national capacity can be
increased through a number of different approaches including increased construction of HEI
facilities, which does raise the possibility of minor environmental impacts. The impact of new
facility construction or renovation are considered to be minor because HEI facilities are almost
invariably built in urban or highly converted environments with little likely impact on natural
habitats, forests, or natural resources. The Vietnamese law requires environmental impact
assessments of all large construction projects, including educational facilities. Considering the
scale and magnitude of likely impacts, the Bank considers that the capacity of the education
sector to adequately address environmental issues is sufficient.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

134. A set of indicators for monitoring were selected for HEDPP program. The MOET’s
Program Unit, led by the Higher Education Department, monitors and reports on progress against
the HEDPOs. The evaluation of HEDPO1 and 2 pointed to the fact that while selected indicators
are important, they are not directly linked to policy measures adopted in HEDPO 1 and 2. Taking
these findings forward, the HEDPO3 Program results framework has been revised (Annex 2) to
ensure better linkage between the result framework and the policy measures adopted.

135. One single Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be prepared for all three
HEDPO1, 2 and 3 operations. Although the lapsed time between HEDPO2 and 3 was slightly
above two years, given the consistency of the overall policy framework, HEDPO3 will be
retained as the third and last in the series of HEDPP. MOET will report on the program
indicators as summarized in Annex 2. In addition to collecting summary statistics, MOET will
conduct qualitative assessments of the impacts of the policy measures. MOET will provide a
consolidated report on the implementation of the policy measures adopted in HEDPO1,
HEDPO2 and HEDPO3 and how these measures contribute to the program development

                                               45
objective. Extensive consultation and sharing lessons learnt with higher education institutions
and their stakeholders will be conducted as part of the preparation of the completion report.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

136. Public Financial Management. Vietnam’s PFM environment is considered adequate to
support this operation. The most recent Country Financial Accountability Assessment conducted
in 2007 concluded that ‘the financial management risk to proper use, control and reporting of
funds that are managed through the Vietnam’s PFM systems is assessed as moderate’. The
Government has maintained strong ownership of the PFM reform agenda and continues to lead a
coordinated reform program in consultation with the donor community. A Strategy for Finance
Development of Vietnam for the period 2011-2020 has recently been approved. The approved
State Budget is published on the MOF website just before the start of the Fiscal Year. It includes
information on: (i) aggregate revenue and spending; (ii) budget financing; (iii) planned spending
by government function; and (iv) domestic revenue sources. MOF publishes quarterly budget
execution reports, which include information on spending at central, provincial, and district
level, and estimated revenue collection. Audited financial statements are published eighteen
months after the end of the Fiscal Year. Progress has been made to implement a range of PFM
reforms emanating from the CFAA recommendations (notably in the areas of public debt
management, external oversight, fiscal transparency, and the roll-out of the Treasury and Budget
Management Information System). However key legislative reforms, such as the revision of the
State Budget Law and the State Audit Law are still pending. While the financial management
and accountability systems of the government have improved, the risks arising from weak
implementation and compliance remain. The quality and extent of independent audit oversight
can be further strengthened by updating the audit strategies and methodologies of the SAV to
align with international practices, and through the development of an effective internal audit
function, which currently is only at an embryonic stage in Vietnam. A number of donors are
providing support to the SAV for the implementation of its strategy to 2020, including the Bank
which is providing technical assistance to modernize the SAV’s audit standards and
methodologies in the area of financial and compliance audits.

137. Foreign Exchange Environment. An IMF safeguards assessment has not been conducted
in Vietnam. This assessment would provide information about the foreign exchange control
environment of the SBV and integrity of financial information. The SBV is subject to auditing by
SAV on an annual basis, however under the current laws the audited financial statements and
audit reports of SBV are not made public. Notwithstanding these factors, IDA understands,
following recent discussions with the IMF, that there are no serious concerns with the SBV’s
foreign exchange control environment.

DISBURSEMENTS AND AUDITING

138. Dedicated Account and audits. To address the potential residual fiduciary risks related to
the foreign exchange environment, the Recipient will maintain a dedicated foreign currency
deposit account (DA) for the proceeds of the Credit, and will report on the funds flow of the DA.
The DA will form part of the country’s official foreign reserves. The Government will, if
deemed necessary by Association, allow an independent external audit of the DA.


                                               46
139. Disbursement. The proposed Credit will follow the Bank’s disbursement procedures for
development policy lending credits. The untied finances will be disbursed against satisfactory
implementation of the development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases. Once
the credit is approved by the Board and becomes effective, the proceeds of the credit will be
deposited by IDA in an account designated by the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank. The
Recipient shall ensure that upon the deposit of the Credit into said account, an equivalent amount
in Vietnamese Dong is credited in the Recipient’s budget management system, in a manner
acceptable to the Association. If the proceeds of the Credit are used for ineligible purposes as
defined in the Financial Agreement, the Association will require the Recipient to refund the
amount directly to Association. Amounts refunded to the Association shall be cancelled. The
administration of this Credit will be the responsibility of the MOF.

140. Reporting. The Recipient will report to the Association on the amounts deposited in the
foreign currency account and credited to the budget management system and on the timing of
such deposits and credits. The Recipient will forward the report within one month of receiving
the letter from the Association advising of the deposit, and the report will include: (i) statement
of the exact sum received into the dedicated DA and the timing of such receipts; (ii) confirmation
to Association that all withdrawals are for eligible expenditures; (iii) confirm to the Association
details of the Treasury account to which the Vietnamese Dong equivalent of the Credit proceeds
will be credited, the credited amount, and their timing; and (iv) a report on receipts and
disbursements for the dedicated DA.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

141. The HEDOP3 faces many risks but they are judged to be outweighed by the expected
benefits of the operations. The main risks are associated with the country, the education sector
in general and this operation in particular.

142. Country risk: Vietnam faces important short-term domestic macroeconomic management
challenges. Whilst foreign exchange reserves have more than doubled in 2012, it is low
compared to international levels. The ongoing domestic credit crunch could further worsen both
growth prospects and asset quality. Another risk is the authorities’ departure from fiscal and
monetary discipline prompting inflation resurgence. This could unravel gains already made and
further weaken confidence. A similar outcome, but where potential growth is compromised,
could arise from delayed and poor implementation of structural reforms including the resolution
of bad debts in banks and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Vietnam is also vulnerable to the
effects of a prolonged global economic slowdown, which could adversely affect exports,
remittances, foreign investment, and possibly aid. Although it has managed to navigate the
global economic crisis reasonably well through implementation of a large stimulus package,
fiscal space is now limited because of high levels of public debt and large contingent liabilities
from a weak banking sector and poorly managed SOEs. Mitigation measures include closer
monitoring of macroeconomic developments, and increased dialogue with the authorities in
collaboration with the International Monetary Fund to ensure steadfast implementation of
reforms already announced and to prepare for new ones. The ongoing work on a Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) by the World Bank and IMF is expected to provide a
comprehensive roadmap for financial sector reform and accelerate implementation. The
Economic Management and Competitive Credit (EMCC) series itself can be considered as part

                                                47
of a risk mitigation strategy as it underscores the need to reform, builds consensus around
challenging issues and helps design appropriate responses.

143. The main sector risk is that many policies promoted in the HEDPOs go beyond the
mandate of MOET and need strong support from MOF, MPI, MOST and leadership of the Prime
Minister’s Office, the National Assembly and the Communist Party. This risk has been
mitigated by (i) the fact that the development the higher education sector master plan drew on
wide consultation with all stakeholders; and (ii) key reforms are laid out in phases with transition
in the roles/ responsibilities key stakeholders. The Higher Education Law has been deliberated
and promulgated by the National Assembly, the highest legislative body in the country.

144. Further sector risk concerns MOET’s weak capacity (both technical skills and due to
institutional fragmentation) to develop coherent policy (including economic analysis) for
HEDPOs. This risk has been partially mitigated by the support of the Second Higher Education
Project. All technical assistance, training and workshop and consultation with universities had
been provided by this project.

145. Finally, while the HEDPP results in the promulgation of regulations that lay out key
policy reforms, HEIs may not be fully effective in applying the regulations to their full potential.
This risk is partially mitigated by the fact that one NMUP financed by the World Bank and the
other NMUP by ADB will provide a privileged locus for testing the full application of the new
body of regulations and offering a demonstration effect for roll-out to other HEIs.

       H.E. Mr. Jim Yong Kim
       President
       World Bank
       Washington, DC, United States of America


       Dear H.E. Mr. Jim Yong Kim:
        Since mid-1980s, the Vietnamese government has made a series of reforms in higher
education system that contribute to strengthen the capacity in system administration, lecturer
team, facilities, and improve the quality of training. During the process of reform and innovation,
the Government of VietNam has received financial support from the World Bank through the
approval of significant projects such as the higher education project I in 1997, the higher
education project 2 by end of 2007 and the approval of New Model University Project in June
2010.
        Along with the above mentioned projects, the World Bank has continued to give high
priority for Vietnam through the Higher Education Development Policy Program (HEDPP) in 3
Operations (HEDPOl -3) to support the Government of Vietnam to carry out "Higher Education
Reform Assistance 2006-2020" (HERA) with the aim to enhance the system administration,
reform the financial mechanism, improve the teaching and research quality, enhance the
accountability and transparency in financial management in higher education. As the design,
each stage will be carried out annually in line with the achievement progress in the policy matrix.
HEDPOI was approved in June 2009, and HEDP02 was approved in December 2010. HEDP03
was planned to be approved in December 20 11.
        The preparation for HEDP03 has been carried out as scheduled, but by mid-2011, the
Government of Vietnam needed more time to complete key activities, including the development
and promulgation of the Law on Higher Education. This is a crucial step in policy commitment
towards Higher Education that requires wide consultation and participation of many ministries,
sectors and needs to be adopted by the National Assembly. As the approval of this Law was not
expected by the previous HEDPOs (it was foreseen that Government would have only issued a
Master Plan of Higher Education), Ministry of Education and Training has proposed to the
World Bank to extend the preparatory time for HEDP03 to June 2012, and prepared for the
negotiation in December 2012.


                                               49
         On June 18, 2012, the XIIIth Session National Assembly has passed the Law on Higher
Education, an important legal basis regulating activities in the field of higher education. The
approval of this Law at higher level of authority reflects the high commitment of the
Government who went beyond the defined prior actions in HEDPO 1-2, overachieving compared
to initial expectations. The Law on Higher Education has many new contents such as
stratification of higher education, the socialization of higher education, the autonomy of higher
education institutions; assurance and control of higher education quality; criteria for lecturers in
higher education institutions; state management on higher education, inspection and audit. This
law shows a great effort for the autonomy of higher education institutions in academy, finance
and human resources.
       The promulgation of the Law on Higher Education and a series of priority policies for
policy development are proposed to the World Bank for the approval of the HEDP03 document
with the objective to strengthen Governance, Financing and Quality of Higher Education by (i)
improving the responsiveness of higher education and research and increase the quantitative
capacity of the system; (ii) enhancing fiscal transparency, sustainability and effectiveness of the
higher education sector and (iii) improving the quality of higher education institutions.
        Prior actions of HEDP03 are as the following. In addition to the Higher Education Law,
which covers Governance, Financing and Financial Management as well as Quality policy areas,
other prior actions have been defined for HEDP03 along the above areas.
       Higher Education Law:

           •   The National Assembly has enacted Law No. 08/2012/QH13, of June 18, 2012,
               on Higher Education, defining: (i) the qualification and training modalities of
               HEis; (ii) the classification of HEis; (iii) the structure of networks of HEis and
               their differentiation/segmentation in the system by institutional missions; (iv) the
               regulation of HEis' institutional autonomy and accountability in academic,
               organizational and financial affairs; and (v) the regulation of HEls' institutional
               accreditation and quality assurance processes.
Within the Framework of the Law, HEDP03 also supports further reform steps by the
government with the following commitment.
       Governance:

           •   MOET has issued Circulars No 57/2011/TT-BGDDT and 20/2012/TT-BGDDT,
               of December 2, 2011 and June 12, 2012, respectively, increasing the autonomy of
               HEis in setting their students enrolment targets, based on minimum conditions of
               staff qualifications and training facilities.

           •   The Prime Minister has issued Decree No. 73/20 12/ND-CP of September 26,
               2012, on foreign cooperation and investment in education, setting forth the




                                                 50
               parameters for the establishment and operation of foreign-capitalized educational
               institutions.
       Finance and financial management:
           •   The Recipient has: (i) prepared annual financial reports for at least 45 HEis for
               the fiscal year 2011 (incorporating all revenues, expenditures and funding
               sources); and (ii) completed the audits of the financial statements of fiscal year
               2010 of at least twenty-five (25) HEis under the management ofMOET.
       Although not define as a prior action in HEDP03, the Government commits to issue a
Resolution on the financial innovation strategy of the public schools (including universities,
colleges) with the aim to increase the general investment in higher education; entrusting more
autonomy to schools in developing tuitions and making decisions on spending; and re-allocation
of government subsidies (science and technology, teacher training and research).
       Quality:

          •    MOET has issued Circular No. 57/2012/TT-BGDDT of 28 December 2012 to
               amend some articles of the Regulations on Credit-Based System that were
               promulgated under Decision No. 43/2007/QE>-BGD&DT dated 15 August 2007,
               providing for: (i) HEis guidance on the application of credit-based training
               curricula; (ii) minimum training standards for HEis; (iii) consistency in HEls'
               grading systems; (iv) an early warning system for students to maintain acceptable
               level of credit accumulation; and (v) changes to the administration of HEls.
          •    At least one hundred and fifty ( 150) HEis have established internal quality
               assurance units in order to ensure appropriate and adequate standards of service
               provision.
      Although not define as prior action in HEDP03, Ministry of Education and Training also
commits to set up an accreditation system with externally set quality standards.
         Vietnamese Government respectfully requests the support of the International
Development Association through Higher Education Development Policy Program to recognize
the significant progress made during the process of developing and implementing Higher
Education Innovation over the recent period. We understand that the upcoming policy changes
are still challenges and require the efforts in synchronous coordination and purpose agreement.
Vietnamese government realizes that once carrying out budget support measures it is necessary
to improve policy and public financial management towards the international standards. HEDPP
includes an overall monitoring and evaluation framework with the results indicators.
       Vietnamese Government assures that all the funds of the development policy program
will be supplementary funding, in addition to the annual state budget approved annually for
higher education, which has been adopted by the National Assembly and will be used for the

                       Vietnam—Assessment Letter for the World Bank
                                    February 19, 2013

Recent Developments and Outlook

1.      There were improvements in economic performance in 2012. Headline inflation
declined from more than 20 percent (y/y) in August 2011 to single digits in 2012. The current
account was in surplus with strong export growth. The exchange rate was stable and the level of
international reserves increased. As inflation came down, it was possible to bring down the
structure of interest rates—policy rates, deposit rates, and lending rates. Some progress has also
been made in stabilizing the banking sector. With these achievements, the authorities’
macroeconomic management credentials and credibility in the market have improved.

2.      There have also been significant challenges. Growth was slower in 2012 (at 5 percent
compared to 5.9 percent in 2011) and it has been difficult for enterprises, especially small-and-
medium enterprises, to survive. Despite lower headline inflation, persistently high core inflation
with weak demand conditions suggests still high inflation expectations. Although liquidity in the
banking system is ample, credit growth has been very weak and the level of inventories remains
high. Based on SBV calculations, the level of nonperforming loans (NPLs) in the banking system
is substantially higher than is reported by the banks. The real estate market has been frozen.
There was some instability in financial markets related to high profile events in the banking
sector in recent months. Progress in banking sector reform is slower than is required. And related
to this, progress in the reform of state-owned enterprise (SOEs) has also been significantly
slower than is needed for building foundations for higher growth in the future.

3.     Risks to the outlook are to the downside. Growth is likely to remain moderate in 2013
given structural problems in the financial and SOE sector that are yet to be addressed.
Uncertainty remains concerning the global outlook given challenges in advanced economies.
Several emerging economies in the region have some room to cushion adverse developments, but
Vietnam has limited policy space.

Policies

4.     Macroeconomic stability must be maintained:

•       Monetary and exchange rate policy. Maintaining low inflation and a stable exchange
rate are very important elements of this effort. In the absence of a shock, it would be prudent for
the SBV to maintain the policy rate at its current level for some time to come. At the same time,
it must continue to monitor inflationary pressures closely. The level of international reserves has
risen, but is still below what would be considered either comfortable or even adequate for
dealing with large external shocks. So there is a need to further increase the level of international
reserves through appropriately tight macroeconomic policies. Continued tight macroeconomic

                                                 63
policies are also paramount to anchor inflation expectations and improve confidence in the dong.
For this, it is important that fiscal policy continues to support the stabilization effort. In the case
of an adverse shock, fiscal policy could be loosened somewhat, while monetary policy should
continue to focus on reducing inflation. At the same time, given the relatively low level of
reserves, the exchange rate should also be allowed to play its role in the adjustment process.

•        Fiscal policy. Overall stabilization efforts need to be supported by fiscal policy.
Estimates for 2012 indicate that the weak economy and tax stimulus measures depressed
domestic revenue. Oil revenue continued to be strong because of favorable oil prices, but trade-
related revenue fell as a result of weak imports, and domestic revenue fell because of economic
weakness and tax stimulus measures. Budgetary expenditures were broadly in line with plan, but
the authorities accelerated VND 15 trillion of off-budget spending from future years into 2012 to
stimulate growth. It is likely that only about one-third of that amount was disbursed in 2012
(with the remainder in early 2013), and not all VAT and CIT revenue deferred into 2013 will be
collected because of widespread bankruptcies; therefore, the deficit is estimated to have widened
to a little under 5½ percent in 2012 before retrenching to about 4½ percent in 2013 (GFSM 2001
definition). Although the 2013 fiscal deficit is somewhat higher than envisaged at the time of the
2012 Article IV, it implies a withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, but there is no provision for the cost
of bank recapitalization and SOE restructuring and reforms, including consequences of possible
labor redundancies. In past international experience, SOE reforms have typically been associated
with significant contingent liabilities.

5.     Structural reforms must be accelerated significantly.

•      Banking sector. Weaknesses and opacity in the banking sector undermines stability and
will continue to constrain growth. Following an extended credit boom and connected lending to
SOEs, the banking system is characterized by poor asset quality, underprovisioning, and
inadequate capital adequacy. There is significant confusion among market participants about the
level of NPLs. While banks report their NPLs to be around 4½ percent, the SBV’s off-site
estimate stands at a much higher 8¾ percent. NPLs are concentrated in SOEs, particularly those
with real estate exposure. Given the weaker growth outlook and the need for banking sector
reform and consolidation through 2015, NPLs are likely to increase further.

Despite reform proposals, the mergers of weak banks in late 2011 and early 2012, the recent
discussions on an asset management company to address the NPL problem, and efforts to
strengthen risk management and governance at banks, there is still a need for a clearly articulated
and comprehensive bank resolution strategy. In addition, progress in implementing existing plans
has been slow. A realistic resolution plan based on thorough onsite bank examinations, which
should reveal the true extent of the damage and recapitalization requirements, is urgently needed.
The resolution plan should differentiate between illiquid and insolvent banks, force existing
shareholders to take losses before receiving new capital injections, and dispose of bad assets.
Further delays in banking reform will raise the likelihood of increased contingent liabilities and
pose risks for public debt sustainability.

Vietnam is participating in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), jointly conducted
by the IMF and the World Bank. On the basis of this, concrete reforms to strengthen the financial

                                                  64
sector will need to be implemented. Although the banking sector is by far the largest part of the
financial sector in Vietnam, and therefore needs most of the attention, reforms will also be
necessary in the insurance sector and capital markets.

•       The real estate sector. The real estate bust has contributed to weaknesses in the banking
sector. The modern property sector is relatively new and limited to housing that is not affordable
to the middle class. Developers armed with funding from banks, coupled with speculative
demand in the belief that prices would keep rising, have led to overbuilding. Despite real estate
prices having already fallen by an estimated 30–50 percent from peak in some urban areas, the
property market is in a supply glut that will take years to eliminate.

•       State-owned enterprises. Considerable parts of banking sector loans are to SOEs.
Banking system problems cannot be addressed without dealing with the problems of the banks’
borrowers. Therefore, SOE reform is paramount. As a first step, SOEs’ true financial condition
must be disclosed to the public, including their audited income statements and balance sheets.
These enterprises use public money for their operations and the public needs to be informed of
how that money is used. Once the true financial condition of these enterprises has been revealed,
steps can be taken to improve their operations and governance structures. These plans must be
formulated and implemented in a time-bound manner.

IMF Relations

6.       The 2012 IMF Article IV consultation was concluded by the IMF’s Executive Board in
May 25, 2012. In recent years, the Fund has been providing technical assistance in the areas of
tax policy and administration, government finance statistics, national accounts and price
statistics, and external sector statistics. A joint IMF-World Bank mission visited Hanoi during
October 29–November 9, 2012 and January 14–30, 2013, to conduct the first FSAP mission for
Vietnam.
