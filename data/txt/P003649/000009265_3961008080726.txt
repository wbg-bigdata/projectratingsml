MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A SHANXI POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed credit to the People's Republic of China for SDR 67.3 million, the equivalent of
$100 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years, to help finance the
Shanxi Poverty Alleviation Project. The Government of China will make the proceeds of
the IDA credit available to Shanxi Province at an annual interest rate of 3.5 percent with a
repayment period of 20 years, including a 7-year grace period. The Province will bear the
foreign exchange risk.
2.    Background. China's economic reforms, begun in 1978, sharply reduced poverty
in the period 1978-1985. In 1978, 270 million (one-third of the population) lived below the
absolute poverty line compared to 100 million (one-tenth of the population) in 1985. But,
since 1985 there has been only a small decline in the incidence of absolute poverty. This is
because gains in farm incomes have come mainly in areas with favorable natural resources,
where farmers could benefit from market-oriented reforms. Gains in poverty alleviation
have been harder to make in the remote mountainous areas of the southwest, north and
northwest, where the area of farmland per family is small and irrigation potential is limited.
In these areas, per capita output of grain and subsistence foods failed to show any
significant increase in the 1980s, and rural enterprises employ only 4 percent of the rural
labor force in the poorest counties in contrast to the 22 percent national average.
3.    Recognizing the necessity of a stepped-up, redirected poverty reduction effort, in
1993 the State Council endorsed a new program to focus on the poorest counties throughout
China. Called the "Eight-Seven Poverty Alleviation Plan (8-7 Plan)", its objective is to
raise the estimated 80 million people in absolute poverty to above the poverty line by the
end of the century, with a focus on raising living standards and incomes through
investments in land development, rural works and rural enterprises. Counties included in
the plan generally had incomes below Y 400 per capita ($50 equivalent, 1992 prices). The
592 nationally designated poor counties covered by the program include over 70 percent of
the 80 million poor.
4.    Shanxi Province, on the east bank of the Yellow River, has a population of 30.3
million. It is one of the poorest provinces in China, with 50 of its 118 counties identified as
poverty stricken. The total population of the 50 counties is 8.4 million, of whom 7.5
million are rural. Average rural per capita income in 1993, which was a good year for
agriculture, was Y 509, about 29 percent less than the Y 718 average rural per capita
income for the province and just over half the national average rural per capita income of



Y 921. Within the 50 counties, some 492 townships with a population of 3.8 million have
been classified as areas of absolute poverty with incomes of below Y 400 per capita.
5.    In 1993, agriculture accounted for about 15 percent of the province's gross product
compared to 57 percent from industry and construction (particularly coal mining and
mineral processing) and 28 percent from other sectors. While the agricultural sector has
been declining over time as other sectors have developed, it still employs almost half of
Shanxi's labor force and provides the bulk of its food requirements. Since 1985 a program
to increase the high-quality cultivated land area through comprehensive rehabilitation of
small watersheds, including terracing of slope lands, has been successfully pursued in
Shanxi. The IDA supported Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 2616-
CHA) builds on this experience. The program is an important means of tackling poverty
through the development of unused land in poor areas.
6.    To encourage continued support of the 1985 program, the Province published a
regulation in 1994 extending the period for which land can be contracted to farm
households. Normal land contracts, previously for 15 years, will now be extended to 30
years, except in poverty and marginal areas where they will be for 50 years. In areas of
uncultivated slopes, gullies and river beach land, the tenure can be extended to 100 years.
The new regulations aim to encourage farmers to practice sound soil and water conservation
measures. As a further incentive, farmers on uncultivated slopes and gullies will be excused
payment of agricultural taxes for the first ten years of occupancy. The method of land
allocation would be by auction among farmers in nearby villages. In order to protect the
interests of poorer families in the community, payment for the land can be by installments
over a period of years. The main objective of the auction system is to give a farmer security
in the use of his land, provided his farming practices meet the standards laid down for land
management by the province.
7.    The poverty alleviation strategy of the Shanxi Government, over the next five
years, aims to raise cultivable land from the present 1.3 mu (0.09 ha) per head to 2 mu
(0.13 ha) per head, to develop agroindustries, to improve rural infrastructure, and to
encourage integrated development of orchards, forests and ruminant livestock.  In
addition, the Government has focused attention on the social sectors, and several ongoing
programs in the poverty areas and in the proposed project area-Luliang and Yuncheng
Prefectures, are currently supported by IDA. The Educational Development in Poor
Provinces Project (Cr. 2336-CHA) seeks to improve the efficiency and quality of primary
and lower secondary school education and support the establishment of a nine-year
compulsory education system; the Rural Health Workers Development Project (Cr. 2539-
CHA) is improving medical colleges, township hospitals and training centers. A number
of other locally-funded social sector programs are also ongoing in the area.
8.    Project Objective. The project would help alleviate poverty in the 20 poorest
counties of Yuncheng and Luliang Prefectures in Shanxi Province. It would complement
ongoing social sector activities in the counties and support the Government's policy of
reducing the imbalance in economic development between the increasingly prosperous



- 3 -
eastern provinces and the poorer central and western regions. The project would include
a range of activities aimed at raising incomes of about 3 million poor. These activities
include: (a) terracing and irrigation improvement to increase agricultural production for
subsistence or sale; (b) improvement of rural roads to provide better market access and
encourage farmers to grow cash crops; (c) expansion of livestock raising and horticulture
development; and (d) support of income-producing enterprises and activities for poor and
disadvantaged women, through local women's federations operating under the aegis of
the All China Women's Federation (ACWF) which manage a number of these programs
in the project areas.
9.    Improvement of the irrigation system in the project area will have a major impact
on poverty alleviation. At present, because of small farm sizes and unreliable irrigation,
farm families live in considerable insecurity. Even if a family manages to escape poverty
in one year, it often returns to poverty the next year. The project would also have
significant environmental benefits, since past problems in diverting water from the
Yellow River have led to sinking of large numbers of tubewells and over-exploitation of
the aquifier. The irrigation system to be constructed under the project would virtually
eliminate the need for the tubewells.
10.   Project Description. The main features of the project are: (a) construction of a
new pumping complex and associated structures on the Yellow River at Langdian in
Yuncheng to supply water to three existing pumping stations; and provision of 14
floating pumps at the existing station at Zuncun; (b) improvement and expansion of the
Yuncheng Irrigation System; (c) river beach development, including land leveling,
electrification, upgrading of rural roads, and tubewells (the area has ample groundwater
resources on 13,000 ha of presently cultivated land) in Yuncheng; (d) construction of 78
village water supply schemes to serve 620,000 people in Yuncheng, and 204 smaller
village water supply systems to serve 64,000 people in Luliang; (e) improvement of
existing rural roads in both prefectures; (f) comprehensive soil and water conservation
works in small watersheds in Luliang, consisting of terraces, construction of check dams,
and an afforestation program for slope land; (g) expansion of the area under fruit and nut
trees; (h) expansion of livestock raising by individual farmers; (i) expansion and
improvement of agricultural processing facilities; (j) support for a program targeted at
poor and disadvantaged women managed by the ACWF; and (k) an institutional
development component including facilities for project management; and training and
overseas study tours.
11.   Project Implementation. Overall responsibility for managing the project rests
with the Shanxi Provincial Government. The planning and subsequent implementation of
the project is coordinated at the provincial level by a Project Leading Group (PLG), headed
by the Vice-Governor responsible for agriculture, it includes representatives from all the
concerned agencies, including the Poverty Alleviation Office, the departments of planning,
finance, agriculture, water conservancy, forestry, and animal husbandry. Under the PLG at
each level, a Project Management Office (PMO) will be responsible for executing the
project. The PMOs will direct, coordinate and manage the work of the various



- 4 -
implementing agencies such as the water conservancy, agricultural, and animal husbandry
bureaus. The Provincial PMO has been given department level status, reporting directly to
the Provincial Commission. This will increase their ability to coordinate the various line
departments all the way down to the township level. Village committees will be the key to
physical implementation of the livelihood components and mobilizing village labor for the
engineering infrastructure components. For project implementation, special groups will be
formed to manage the mobilization of farmers, organize training, supervise construction and
control financing. Once completed, the beneficiary households will be fully responsible for
managing the operation and maintenance of the facilities.
12.   The project cost is estimated at $182.8 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of $26.6 million (15 percent). Retroactive financing of SDR 6.7 million ($10.0
million equivalent) is recommended for payments made between August 1995 and the date
of the signed Credit Agreement. This would allow the start of preliminary activities during
winter when farm labor is available, and a full working season thereafter, when weather
conditions improve. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project events and the status of
Bank Group operations in China are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 15079-CHA, dated February 21, 1996 is
being distributed separately.
13.   Project Sustainability. The project will raise incomes of about three million
poor in a sustainable way. Through improvements in land utilization, cropping patterns
and increased production technology, household incomes in this area are likely to rise by
50 to 100 percent after taxes and loan repayment, leading to real increases in net incomes
and sustained poverty reduction. Recurrent costs will be financed through realistically
determined user fees and funds earmarked under the 8-7 Poverty Alleviation Program.
Institutional sustainability is addressed through a comprehensive program of technical
assistance, training, and study tours to strengthen existing capacity and ensure
development of long-term capabilities.
14.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Group Operations. The Bank Group
has assisted in the financing of numerous projects aimed at raising living standards and
incomes in the rural areas of China. These projects have been implemented efficiently, time
and cost overruns have been moderate despite periods of sharp price escalation, and rates of
return have generally equaled or exceeded appraisal estimates. A notable feature of these
projects has been the involvement of local communities in their planning, design, and
implementation. The agricultural and water conservancy bureaus of the counties and
townships have played a leading role in the projects, under the overall supervision of the
provinces, and several projects carried out in relatively resource-poor areas, such as the Red
Soils I and II Projects, the Gansu Agricultural Development Project and the Loess Plateau
Project, are or promise to be notably successful.



-5-
15.   Worldwide, the lessons derived by the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department
from nearly 300 projects of similar nature point to the importance of: (a) concentrating on
geographical areas where the poor live, products and services the poor produce and
consume, and assets the poor hold; (b) commitment to and ownership of the project
objectives and components by the people directly affected, which in turn requires active
beneficiary participation during planning and design of the components; (c) an enabling
policy environment providing sufficient incentives for the farmers to respond to the
opportunities offered by the project; (d) flexibility to react to unforeseen or unforeseeable
events by adopting a process approach for components with higher risk, and (e) design
simplicity and replicability. These lessons have been explicitly incorporated into the design
of the individual components of the project. Careful selection of the project and targeting of
beneficiaries, active participation of shareholders throughout the design phase, focus on the
policy environment through guaranteed long-term land contracts, flexibility and process
approach in components with high risk (e.g., livestock) and design simplicity where
appropriate (e.g., horticulture and watershed rehabilitation), were integral parts of project
preparation. To succeed, past experience clearly indicates that poverty alleviation projects
need strong government commitment, broad-based beneficiary participation, incentives to
the rural poor complementing their own small investments (e.g., externalities such as a rural
road, a canal, or a processing plant), a capable institution to implement the program, and
proven technologies backed by functioning support services. These factors are present in
the project areas.
16.   Rationale for Bank Group Involvement. The project is consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy being presented today. Under this strategy two of the Bank
Group's operational priorities in China are poverty alleviation and environmental
enhancement and protection. The Bank's 1992 report: "China: Strategies for Reducing
Poverty in 1990s" and the subsequent International Conference on Poverty Issues in China
held in Beijing in November 1992, led to a substantial level of agreement between the
Chinese authorities and the Bank on the nature of the poverty problem and approaches to its
alleviation.  The project design reflects those approaches and the strategy of the
Government's "8-7 Plan" by addressing two of the key challenges facing rural development
in China-slow income growth and limited entrepreneurial development as well as the need
for greater government investment in rural areas. The project attacks poverty at its core and
will improve the lives of many of the rural poor in the project areas. The project will also
have a positive environmental effect by: increasing the input of surface water to replace
unsustainable exploitation of groundwater; modernizing agroprocessing facilities to
enhance efficiency and reduce pollution; conserving land and reducing sediment runoff in
parts of Luliang prefecture; and supporting establishment and protection of a nature reserve
in Yuncheng prefecture.
17.   Agreed Actions. The principal agreements reached at negotiations were that:
(a) the Province will forward to the Association by November 30 of each year, a proposed
program of training activities to be carried out during the following calendar year and
thereafter implement such programs as approved by the Association; (b) the province will
comply with agreed safety procedures for review of design, construction and maintenance

of hydraulic structures; (c) the project accounts, the Special Account and statements of
expenditures will be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA and will be
submitted to IDA within six months of the close of each financial year; (d) the project
will be implemented in accordance with an environmental management and monitoring
plan acceptable to the Association; (e) each prefecture will implement the Resettlement
Action Plan agreed with IDA; (f) Shanxi will prepare and submit a detailed annual budget
and work plan to IDA for review by November 30 of each year in respect of project
implementation in the following year, and carry out such plans, as approved by the
Association; (g) the PMOs at provincial, prefecture, county and township levels would be
maintained with terms of reference acceptable to IDA and staffed by competent staff in
adequate numbers; (h) the land developed under the Project will be leased to farmers for
terms between 30 years and 50 years under written contracts; (i) project monitoring
would be carried out in accordance with indicators acceptable to the Association; (j)
Shanxi would furnish the Association with a mid-term report by September 30, 1998; and
(k) livestock, as well as subloans for agroprocessing and ACWF subprojects, would be
made available in accordance with procedures, terms and conditions acceptable to the
Association.
18.   Environmental Aspects. This is a Category B project. An Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) has been prepared for the project and is satisfactory. The EIA
finds that the project's environmental and social impacts are beneficial and the potentially
adverse impacts are confined to some of the agroprocessing plants. Mitigation measures
as well as detailed proposals for environmental management and monitoring are included
in the EIA. Resettlement is minimal, with only 84 households affected as a result of
expanding rural roads. The Government has prepared a Resettlement Action Plan
satisfactory to the Association.
19.   Project Objective Categories.  The proposed project relates to the Bank's
Program Objective categories for poverty reduction and women in development. The
project has a two-pronged approach to the alleviation of poverty. Some components will
provide direct benefits to targeted villages and households while other components will
benefit a large area and large numbers of people. The ACWF component will specifically
target poor and disadvantaged women through small and focused subprojects to generate
cash income for women in remote villages. Women will also be the prime beneficiaries
of the improved rural water supply. Not only will the distance to water points be
dramatically reduced, which is directly beneficial to women, but reliable water supply
also allows the household to keep a draft animal and small livestock
20.   Participatory Approach. During the process of project preparation-including
four joint missions by IDA and the Food and Agriculture Organization/Cooperative
Program (FAO/CP) conducting numerous site visits and two years of field preparation-
the prefecture PMOs have created widespread awareness of the project. Numerous
meetings were held at the township and village level to identify candidate villages and
households. The public media were utilized to increase awareness in the entire project area
(multiple TV and radio coverage of preparation activities). In addition, the environmental



- 7 -
assessment team conducted an opinion survey of farmers, administrators, technicians and
intellectuals. The social assessment team conducted pilot surveys of 130 villages in
Yuncheng and 70 villages in Luliang. The Yuncheng team has done a pilot survey covering
156 households. Consequently, the level of awareness is high and the local farmers are
anxious to see the start of the project.
21.   Successful implementation of the project requires a high level of community
participation. The larger engineering schemes will require labor input from the villagers as
their contribution to the project investment. Proper participation, mobilization, motivation
and organization will be required to ensure high quality construction and a feeling of
ownership in the project. For the livelihood improvement schemes, a broader community
approach will be taken although typically there are a few target households in each village.
This will provide learning opportunities for other villagers and will prepare the ground for
future investments using local funds. In China, introduction of the household responsibility
system has developed more individualistic attitudes amongst the farmers. Now some
blending of entrepreneurial initiative and collective support is required for poverty
alleviation to extend maximum benefits to the greatest number of poor.
22.   Economic Analysis. For each of the project components and for the project as a
whole a rigorous economic analysis was conducted. Non-quantifiable benefits were also
described where appropriate. Uneconomic components were eliminated early. Cropping
patterns, yields and economic crop budgets were estimated for all of the main project
components for the "without project" and "with project" cases. These were used to estimate
project benefits for the irrigation, beach land, rural roads, horticulture and soil conservation
components. Household models were used to derive benefits for the livestock component.
For the water supply component the economic analysis was based on projections of future
water use and the villagers' willingness to pay for the supply of drinking water to the
village. The period of analysis for most of the components was 20 years, with the exception
of the protection of forests and the agroprocessing component, where it was 35 and 17
years, respectively. Operating costs for Yuncheng irrigation, the beach land and the water
supply components include pumping costs, maintenance and replacement of pumps and
other equipment, and personnel. Economic prices in 1995 constant terms were calculated
for all traded inputs and outputs based on the World Bank's price projections. For
nontraded goods the economic prices are local market prices. The overall economic rate of
return (ERR) is estimated at 28 percent, largely as a result of the high sunk cost of the
existing irrigation systems. Sensitivity of ERRs of each of the project components has been
tested for cost overruns, increased input costs and shortfalls in output, and the results show
that the components are robust and economically viable. Switching values were calculated
and components with a somewhat higher risk underwent more specific sensitivity tests.
None of these variants reduced the ERR of the components below acceptable levels. In
fact, a worst case scenario, a major shift of the Yellow River channel away from the pumps
for the Yuncheng Irrigation System within five years of completion, would only lower the
ERR of this critical component to 17 percent.

23.   Benefits. The project will raise incomes and living standards of about three million
people in some of the poorest areas of Yuncheng and Luliang Prefectures in Shanxi
Province. There will be significant increases in crop production on the 123,000 ha
Yuncheng Irrigation System through a more reliable supply of irrigation water, and on
13,000 ha of the river beachlands of Yuncheng through irrigation and other works. Water
supply schemes will provide a safer source of water for nearly 700,000 people, and will
relieve them of the task of hauling water from long distances so that their time and energy
may be more productively used. The increased water supply will also allow watering of
seedlings and thereby promote orchard establishment. Rural roads will help 355,000 people
in remote areas to diversify their agricultural production on about 70,000 ha through better
access to markets and input supply, and enhance employment opportunities and access to
social services. Expansion of horticulture and livestock raising will offer opportunities for
tens of thousands of families to raise their incomes. Finally, expansion and improvement of
agroprocessing facilities will provide more markets for agricultural produce and create
employment.
24.   Risks. The project will be executed by local government units that have a good
record in implementing agricultural and rural development projects. Two components of
the project present some elements of risk-the Langdian Pumping Complex and the
livestock component. The channel configuration of the Yellow River at the Langdian site
appears to be stable, but this might change suddenly in the aftermath of an extreme flood or
through gradual changes in the river's morphology. If the river channel were to move away
from the site of the new pumping station, it would become necessary to dredge a connecting
channel to the river at the end of each flood season. The dredges in the sediment basin
would be used for this since they are needed in the sediment basin only in the flood season.
It is also to be noted that the discounted net agricultural benefits of the Langdian complex
will exceed the cost of the complex after four years of operation. The livestock component
will introduce thousands of farmers to livestock ownership. This will call for careful
selection, intensive training and monitoring of the beneficiaries, all of which are supported
under the project.
25.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.

(a)  As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the SDR.
In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater than the
original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
(b) Credit fully disbursed.
(c) Not yet effective.
