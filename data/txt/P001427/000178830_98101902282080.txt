REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
FOR A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Liberia for the equivalent of US$6.3 million to help
finance a third education project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including 4-1/2 years of grace, with interest of 8.2 percent per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic mission visited Liberia in March 1973.   Its report
"Liberia: Growth with Development - A Basic Economic Report" (No. 426a-LBR
dated March 1, 1975) was distributed to the Executive Directors. An updating
report entitled "Liberia: Economic Memorandum" (No. 873-LBR dated September 15,
1975) has also been distributed subsequently. An economic mission visited
Liberia in November/December, 1976 to review the Four-Year Development Plan
(1976-1980) and its report is in preparation. Country data sheets are con-
tained in Annex I.
Structural Characteristics
3.        The growth of Liberia's economy remains heavily dependent on the
performance of the enclave sector consisting mainly of: (a) iron ore mines;
(b) rubber plantations; and (c) forestry concessions. These enclaves are
the main source of export earnings and contribute a sizeable share of govern-
ment revenues. Iron ore mining is by far the largest single activity in the
enclave sector, accounting for about one third of gross domestic product at
factor cost. There are only limited linkages between the enclaves and the
rest of the economy; as a result, the benefits of economic growth have been
unevenly distributed. Annual repatriation by foreigners of profits and
savings is equivalent to about 20 percent of gross domestic product.
4.        At the other extreme, traditional agriculture has minimal inter-
action with the monetized economy; however, it supports the majority of the
population - as much as 70 percent. With a population of about 1.5 million,
average per capita GNP in 1975 was US$410; about 4 percent of Liberians have
per capita income levels of about US$3,000 or more, while the majority live
at or near subsistence level with income of about US$100 per annum. To help
redress this imbalance the Government is trying to increase its earnings from
the concessions and use the resources to diversify the economy with increased
participation by Liberians.

-2-
Development Plan
5.        The Government has recently prepared a Four-Year Development Plan
covering the period July 1, 1976 to June 30, 1980. In preparing the Plan
the Government was assisted by a planning team financed jointly by the Bank,
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), United States Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID) and the Government (Reference President's Memo-
randum to the Executive Directors, No. R74-61 dated March 25, 1974). The
Plan identifies the basic, long-term objectives of Liberia's socio-economic
development as: (a) diversification of production; (b) dispersion of sustain-
able socioeconomic activities throughout the country; (c) greater involvement
of Liberians in development activities; and (d) equitable distribution of
the benefits of economic growth so as to ensure an acceptable standard of
living for the people throughout the country. The average annual growth of
real GDP during the Plan period is envisaged at around 6.8 percent. However,
because of delays in the implementation of expected investments in iron ore
mining and some slackening in demand for the country's main exports, the
recent Bank economic mission has estimated that real growth during the four-
year period is unlikely to exceed 3-4 percent. Total development expenditure
is projected at US$415 million, of which US$251 million would be financed from
foreign sources and US$164 million financed domestically. Firm commitments
accounted at the start of the Plan for almost 60 percent of the expected
foreign financing.
6.        The Development Plan attaches high priority to agriculture, parti-
cularly integrated rural development, as the cornerstone of the Government's
diversification strategy. The objective is to diversify and modernize
agricultural production, increase productivity, improve associated rural
economic activities such as marketing and processing, and provide social
and physical infrastructure to improve the quality of life in the rural areas
where most Liberians live.
Recent Economic Developments
7.        During 1973-1975, Liberia, like most other developing countries,
was hit by higher import prices and international inflation. While strong
world demand for Liberia's major export, iron ore, brought large gains in
export prices in 1974, the 1975 recession in the industrialized countries
significantly reduced the demand for the country's most important export
commodities -- iron ore, rubber and timber. With growth performance con-
tinuing to be largely a function of enclave activities, growth of real
GDP - which averaged about 6.4 percent a year in the 1967-1970 period -- has
slowed down significantly and is estimated to have been about 2.5 percent in
1976.
8.        Liberia has had a long history of sound fiscal management and pub-
lic sector resources have not come under undue pressure during the past decade.
A satisfactory growth in government revenues averaging about 13.5 percent
per year between 1970-1975 enabled the Government to finance increasing



-3
expenditures. Recurrent expenditures during this period grew by about 10
percent while development expenditures increased nearly fourfold. However,
public sector finances may come under increased pressure in the medium term
mainly because of an anticipated acceleration in the rate of growth of gov-
ernment expenditures -- particularly current expenditure -- coupled with a
more moderate rate of growth in revenues. The rate of growth of government
revenues is likely to be moderate in view of the anticipated lower GDP growth
rate as well as the uncertain future of world demand for iron ore and the
fluid state of the current negotiations between the Government and the
iron ore companies regarding the government's share in profits and future
dividend distribution policies.
Balance of Payments
9.         During the 1964-1972 period, the value of merchandise exports grew
by 10 percent and imports by 5.9 percent annually in current prices. There-
after, from 1972-1974, mostly reflecting accelerated international inflation,
imports rose by 29 percent annually, exceeding the 22 percent annual export
growth. Oil imports increased from US$12 million in 1972 to US$56 million in
1974, but declined to US$48 million in 1975 due to reduced mining activities.
Nevertheless, Liberia achieved a trade surplus of US$110 million in 1974,
US$63 million in 1975 and an estimated US$99 million for 1976. During 1975,
Liberia received aid commitments of US$93 million -- US$82 million in loans
and about US$11 million in current transfers. The World Bank Group was the
largest donor in terms of commitments (43 percent). The other major donors
were United States, Italy and the African Development Bank.
Creditworthiness
10.       Liberia's external public debt outstanding and disbursed was esti-
mated at about US$170 million as of December 1975. Debt service payments
as a proportion of exports of goods and non-factor services were estimated
at 5.1 percent in 1975 as compared to 5.7 and 7.7 percent for 1974 and 1972
respectively. Debt service payments as a percentage of government revenues
have also declined from 24.3 percent in 1972 and 21.1 percent in 1974 to 17.3
percent in 1975. Both ratios are projected to decline further in the next few
years as the final portion of the heavy debt incurred in the early 1960s is
paid off. The Bank Group share of the public debt outstanding and disbursed
is presently about 16 percent and, based on commitments of the aid agencies
up to 1975, is projected to increase to about 30 percent by 1980; as a propor-
tion of public debt servicing liability, the Bank Group share is projected to
increase from its present level of about 12 percent to about 35 percent in
1980. Even with an expanded public borrowing program, Liberia's debt service
ratio through the 1980s is expected to remain relatively modest unless there
is an unexpected deterioration in external conditions. It should be noted,
however, that Liberia's exports are highly concentrated in a few commodities
(mainly iron ore and rubber) with unstable world market prices. Nevertheless,
given the country's satisfactory performance in economic management and its
modest debt service ratio, Liberia should be regarded as creditworthy for the
proposed loan.

PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA
11.       The Bank has made 13 loans (including one Third Window loan) for
projects in Liberia totalling US$71.2 million; there have been 5 IDA credits
totalling US$24 million, and one technical assistance grant of US$200,000
for development planning. IFC has made two equity investments totalling
US$555,000 in the share capital of the Liberian Bank for Development and
Investment (LBDI). The Bank loans have been for roads, port expansion, power
and LBDI; IDA credits have been for education and agriculture. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as
of February 28, 1977 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
12.       The objectives of Bank Group operations in Liberia are:     (a) to help
increase the absorptive capacity of the economy and enable Liberians to take
greater initiatives in developing their own resources for the benefit of their
own people; (b) to support policies and programs leading to broader sharing of
the fruits of economic progress; (c) to help the Government in broadening the
economic base; and (d) to assist the Government in mobilizing development
resources from other external agencies.
13.       Consistent with these overall objectives, Bank Group lending for
education in Liberia has been aimed at: (a) improving the quality of education
by raising standards and enhancing its relevance to Liberian needs; (b)
expanding the system, especially in rural areas, so as to promote geographical
equity; and (c) meeting urgent manpower requirements. The proposed third
education project would assist in achieving these objectives. It would help:
(a) improve programs of science and technology in rural secondary schools in
four counties; (b) strengthen secondary teacher training and administration
and planning of secondary education; (c) strengthen the architectural services
of the Ministry of Education for better preparation and implementation of
projects; and (d) meet urgent needs for skilled manpower by supporting indus-
trial, vocational and forestry training.
14.       In line with the priorities established in the Government's Four-Year
Development Plan, the Bank is also giving increasing emphasis to the agricul-
tural sector. We are supporting two agricultural development projects in Lofa
and Bong Counties under co-financing arrangements with the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID). A rubber project is being prepared to
assist small and medium size Liberian rubber farms in rehabilitating and
planting rubber trees which would involve a total of about 60,000 acres
throughout the country. Also under preparation is a forestry development
project which would initiate a pulpwood plantation program and provide assis-
tance to the newly established Forestry Development Authority for better
management and development of Liberia's forest resources.



- 5 -
15.       In infrastructure, a water supply project is under preparation which
would extend the Monrovia water supply system and help strengthen the manage-
ment and finances of the Liberia Water and Sewerage Corporation. A fourth
highways project is also being considered which might include construction
and improvement of high priority sections of selected primary and secondary
roads, road maintenance and assistance to the domestic construction industry.
In the power sector, an interim power project is being prepared which would
include expansion of the Liberia Electricity Corporation's thermal power
generating facilities until feasibility studies have been completed for a
possible hydro-power development project.
PART III: THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Sector Background
16.       The Ministry of Education controls general and technical education
at the pre-university level. Vocational training for industry and training
for agriculture and forestry is coordinated by the National Council for
Vocational and Technical Education and Training (NCVTET). Higher education is
provided by two institutions -- the autonomous state University of Liberia and
the private state-aided Cuttington College.
17.       The education sector has suffered from low quality and geographical
inequities. With respect to quality, classrooms are usually crowded and
schools often lack necessary teaching equipment and supplies. In addition,
teaching has remained largely theoretical. Science and practical subjects
have been neglected and only 2 percent of those enrolled in secondary schools
in 1975 were in technical education programs. It is also difficult to attract
and retain good teachers: only 25 percent of the primary teachers are trained
and there are virtually no Liberian graduate teachers. Moreover, only about
14 percent of pupils entering grade 1 graduate from grade 12. The university
experiences high attrition and repetition rates, especially in science-based
programs among first-year students. Neglect of the rural areas is evidenced
in several ways. The schools in Monrovia are better financed than rural
schools and only in Monrovia is there a public school properly equipped for
science and technology. With 15 percent of the total population, Monrovia has
34 percent of total lower secondary and 55 percent of total upper secondary
enrollments. The high illiteracy rate (60 percent of males and 85 percent of
females over 15 years of age) is almost entirely a rural phenomenon.
18.       In recent years, Government has had some success in dealing with
these problems. First, considerable progress has been made in improving
access to education. Enrollment ratios of 65 percent at the primary and
15 percent at the secondary level represent a doubling during the period
1970-75; these, and pupil/teacher ratios of 35:1 at the primary and 26:1 at
the secondary level, are about average for Africa. Second, Government has
recently increased teachers' salaries, although at the primary level they
remain at the equivalent of only twice per capita GNP, the lowest in Africa.



-6-
Third, through projects such as the Bank Group-assisted First and Second
Education Projects there has been improvement in educational planning,
manpower planning and educational administration. There have also been
extensions and improvement of teacher training and expansion of educational
opportunities in rural areas. The proposed Third Education Project would
deal further with sector problems by helping to improve planning and adminis-
tation, make education more responsive to Liberia's manpower needs, and create
new opportunities for science and technology education in rural areas.
Manpower Requirements
19.       As a result of the deficiencies in the country's educational and
training systems, there is an acute shortage of Liberian manpower at all
levels, requiring the country to depend extensively on expatriates. The
Government has decided that public and private sector training programs and
employment policies should aim at Liberianizing the work force as expedi-
tiously as possible. It is estimated that the modern sector will require
14,000 new workers per year over the 1974-82 period, the greatest need being
for industrial production and related workers (28 percent) and for agricul-
tural, forestry and related workers (27 percent). Skilled workers from these
two categories will comprise about 20 percent of total annual demand. It is
also estimated that the forestry sub-sector will need over the 1975-1985 period
an additional 5,000 vocational, 800 technical and 140 professional personnel,
or an average yearly requirement of about 600 workers. Total annual demand
for skilled workers in the electrical, automotive, mechanical and construction
trades is about 1,700 with the Monrovia area requiring about 700.
Education and Training Strategy
20.       The Government's educational objectives, summarized in the 1976-80
National Development Plan, are to:
(a) Improve the quality of education at all levels, in particular
by:
(i) diversifying primary and secondary level curricula, and
increasing the emphasis on science, technical and practical
subj ects;
(ii) increasing the supply of trained teachers, training school
supervisors, strengthening examinations and testing services,
increasing teachers' salaries, producing and supplying suitable
textbooks, and providing better school buildings;
(iii) improving the programs and equipment for technical training
and practical course work;
(iv) improving the university by providing opportunities to
develop the staff through training and research on local
problems, improving remedial services, providing better
screening of entrants and better physical facilities,
and restricting the growth of new programs.



- 7 -
(b) Reduce geographical inequities by concentrating the expansion
of school places in rural areas, especially under a community
schools program for primary and adult education, and by pro-
viding laboratories and workshops in rural secondary schools.
21.       With respect to manpower development, a National Council for Voca-
tional and Technical Education and Training (NCVTET) has been established
to coordinate national vocational training programs and policies. Its
secretariat, the Manpower Planning Division of the Ministry of Planning
and Economic Affairs, has undertaken manpower surveys and planning and has
produced basic data on the distribution of employment in Liberia. An Agricul-
tural and Industrial Training Board (AITB) is to be established under this
proposed project to coordinate and implement policies and programs related to
agricultural and industrial training in the public and private sectors. The
Institue of Public Administration and the Civil Service Agency have been
established to strengthen public administration and to improve training and
personnel administration. Middle-level training programs are being organized,
in collaboration with Sierra Leone, in such specialized fields as customs,
forestry and telecommunications. In its plans for manpower development, the
Government is particularly concerned with training Liberians for public and
private sector jobs in skills that will bring immediate benefits, notably
those associated with exploiting the country's agricultural, mineral and
forestry resources. This approach is sound, as economic diversification
and the more efficient use of resources are essential for the continuous
growth of the economy over the long run.
22.       In implementing its education sector development strategy, the
Government is being assisted by several external agencies. The Bank Group,
which is the largest source of external assistance, has financed two education
projects (Annex II, page 5) aimed at improving secondary education and educa-
tional planning and management, and at redressing geographical inequities.
The First Education Project, signed in May 1972, provides US$7.2 million to:
(a) construct two rural secondary schools, extensions to a rural primary
teacher training institute, and a new College of Agriculture and Forestry;
(b) provide equipment for science education and technical teacher training;
and (c) finance technical assistance and fellowships for project administra-
tion and manpower and educational planning. At the early stages of project
implementation, there were delays in the construction program due to lack of
experience in project administration, shortages of certain building materials,
and limited capacity of the local construction industry. The initial dif-
ficulties have subsequently been overcome mainly by breaking down civil works
contracts into smaller packages which local contractors could execute more
easily. The education and university planning components have proceeded
satisfactorily, and the project is expected to be completed with a six-
month delay and with only a modest cost overrun, to be financed by the Govern-
ment. The Second Education Project, signed in June 1976, aims mostly at
improving education in rural areas and continuing the support for educational
administration and planning initiated under the first project.      It provides
US$4.0 million to: (a) construct community schools in 45 villages; (b) expand
a teacher training institute; (c) finance technical assistance to strengthen



- 8 -
curriculum development, textbook production, and educational administration
and planning; and (d) prepare for the proposed third education project.
Experience gained by the PIU in implementing the first project has markedly
improved performance under the second project; since loan effectiveness in
July 1976, construction contracts have been awarded and project implementation
is on schedule. The third project would include further support for improving
secondary education, and would meet specific manpower needs in the small
industry and forestry sectors. Together, these three projects provide an
integrated approach to balanced growth of the education sector.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
Project Background
23.       The project was identified by the Government and the Bank and
prepared jointly by the Government, the Bank and UNESCO. It was appraised
in August 1976, and the Appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal of a Third
Education Project in Liberia", No. 1358a-LBR dated April 8, 1977 is being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors. A loan and project summary
is given in Annex III to this report. Negotiations for the proposed loan were
held in Washington from March 7 to 9, 1977 with the Liberian delegation led by
Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf, Deputy Minister of Finance.
Project Objectives
24.       The proposed third education project has been timed and designed
to take account of ongoing projects and complement and reinforce them in
accordance with sectoral objectives. As with the two earlier projects,
it would include measures to improve the quality of education and meet man-
power requirements. The project aims to provide skilled manpower in two
crucial areas of economic development -- the modern industrial and service
sectors and forestry. The project would also provide for improving programs
in science and technology in rural secondary schools.
Project Description
25.       The proposed project would comprise:
(a) Strengthening the Industrial Training System. The Project would
finance construction, furniture and equipment for an Agricultural
and Industrial Training Board (AITB) and a Vocational Training
Center (VTC) in Monrovia; 8 man-years of technical assistance
and 23 man-years of fellowships to help establish the Board and
the Center; and 10 man-years of fellowships, together with equip-
ment and vehicles, to develop manpower planning capability. The
AITB would play a vital role in overseeing the industrial training
system on a day-to-day basis, monitoring training standards and
policy and administering the public sector industrial training



- 9 -
centers. Evidence satisfactory to the Bank that AITB has been
established would be a condition of disbursement for the con-
struction of buildings for the AITB and the VTC (paragraph 4 (b),
Schedule 1 to draft Loan Agreement). The VTC would train appren-
tices, upgrade skilled workers and offer pre-employment training
in mechanical, electrical, automotive and building construction
trades. The Government agreed during negotiations to take the
necessary measures to recruit and train instructors for the VTC
(Section 3.04 of draft Loan Agreement). The Manpower Planning
Division of the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs would
be equipped to undertake micro-level planning for the public and
private sectors.
(b)  Strengthening Forestry Training.   This would include construct-
ing, furnishing and equipping a Forestry Training Institute at
Bomi Hills for forest rangers and forest workers; 2 man-years of
technical assistance; and 7 man-years of fellowships to help
establish the Institute. The Institute would be managed by the
Training and Research Board established under the Mano River Union
between Liberia and Sierra Leone and would include representatives
of public and private sector bodies concerned with forestry in
both countries. About 20 percent of the Institute's capacity
would be for Sierra Leone and 80 percent for Liberia. The Liberian
Government agreed during negotiations to provide the Institute
with all the funds required to meet its operating costs (Section
4.05 of draft Loan Agreement). The Liberian Government would make
arrangements with the Sierra Leone Government and the private sector
to recover their shares of the training costs.
(c)  Improving Secondary Education.   This would include constructing,
furnishing and equipping four Science and Technology Centers (STC)
at rural secondary schools in four counties and providing vehicles
for transport of children from outlying schools to two of the Cen-
ters (Sanniquellie and Buchanan); 16 man-years of technical assist-
tance to help establish the new science programs and 1 man-year to
prepare a school map; 36 man-years of fellowships to produce admin-
istrators of science, technical and secondary education and second-
ary teacher trainers; and equipment and vehicles for related field
and office work and for strengthening science and technology teach-
ing programs and secondary teacher training. Pupils would be bused
to Sanniquellie and Buchanan STCs from village schools within a
30-mile radius on a pilot basis in order to determine the effective-
ness of busing as a method of providing science and technology
instruction to pupils from small village secondary schools. During
negotiations Government agreed it would: (a) monitor and record the
results of this pilot scheme for evaluation purposes; (b) train
science and technology teachers in accordance with a timetable



- 10 -
acceptable to the Bank; and (c) provide new classrooms and related
facilities required for the schools in Greenville by the end of
calendar year 1978 and Sanniquellie by the end of calendar year
1979; these are not included in the project but will be attached to
the Science and Technology Centers in these two towns which are
included in the project (Section 4.03 of draft Loan Agreement).
(d)  Strengthening Educational Architecture.    The project would provide
office equipment, vehicles for field work, 2 man-years of technical
assistance and 7 man-years of fellowships to strengthen a newly
established Division of Educational Facilities in the Ministry
of Education. The new Division is responsible for the design and
supervision of all construction work under the Ministry. It would
also carry out architectural supervisory and design work for the
Project Implementation Unit under Bank Group assisted education
projects.
During negotiations Government agreed that it would: (a) employ technical as-
sistance personnel acceptable to the Bank; (b) award fellowships for training
programs satisfactory to the Bank, provide appropriate positions to absorb the
trained personnel and require the recipients to serve at least 2 years in the
positions for which they were trained (Section 3.03 of draft Loan Agreement);
and (c) make adequate and timely budgetary allocations to ensure the availabi-
lity of funds for the operation of the educational institutions included in
the project (Section 4.04 of draft Loan Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
26.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$9.5 million, includ-
ing taxes totalling US$1.0 million. About US$6.3 million, or 74 percent of the
net of tax cost, would represent foreign expenditures and would be financed by
the proposed Bank loan. The balance would be financed by the Government. At
full development in 1983, the project would increase government recurrent
expenditures by US$700,000, or about 2 percent of estimated budgetary expendi-
tures in that year. The cost of technical assistance is estimated to average
US$36,000 per man-year. A detailed breakdown of the costs and the proposed
financing plan are given in Annex III.
Project Implementation
27.       The Project Implementation Unit (PIU), established within the
Ministry of Education to implement the first two education projects, would
be responsible for implementing the third project. It would liaise with
staff from other ministries and departments of government concerned with the
project, notably the Ministry of Labor, Youth and Sports and the NCVTET
for the Vocational Training Center and the Agricultural and Industrial Train-
ing Board, the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs for manpower plan-
ning, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for forestry training.
Each of these agencies has already nominated liaison staff.



- 11 -
28.       To handle the additional workload of the third project, PIU would
be strengthened by the appointment of a third Deputy Project Director starting
in May 1977. To ensure that PIU would be adequately staffed, Government has
agreed that the staff would include: (a) a Project Director; (b) three Deputy
Project Directors; (c) a Project Accountant; and (d) a Procurement Specialist.
The qualifications and experience of all of the above shall be satisfactory to
the Bank (Section 3.01 (c) of draft Loan Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
29.       Civil works for the Vocational Training Center, the Agricultural and
Industrial Training Board, the Forestry Training Institute, and the Science
and Technology Centers valued at US$3.8 million, furniture valued at US$0.3
million, and equipment valued at US$1.4 million would be procured on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement. Furniture, equipment, vehicles and other items
which cannot be grouped in packages of at least US$50,000 equivalent each,
or which are not suitable for international competitive bidding, would be
procured either on the basis of quotations or through local competitive
bidding in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. The aggregate
value of such items is estimated at about US$0.2 million. Local manufacturers
of furniture and equipment would be allowed a preferential margin of 15
percent of the c.i.f. price of competing imports, or the total applicable
customs duties and import taxes, whichever is lower.
30.       Disbursements from the loan would cover; (a) 55 percent of total
expenditures for civil works including professional fees; (b) 100 percent of
foreign expenditures for direct imports and 65 percent of total expenditures
for locally procured furniture and equipment; (c) 85 percent of total expen-
ditures for technical assistance; and (d) 100 percent of foreign expenditures
for fellowships.
Project Benefits and Risks
31.       The shortage of trained manpower at all levels of the country's
economy is one of the more serious development constraints in Liberia.
As a result, the country is heavily dependent on foreign technical assistance,
especially at the professional and managerial levels; this constitutes a
significant element in the costs of development projects. Understandably,
the Government wishes to increase the number of trained workers and reduce
its heavy dependance on expatriates through appropriate training programs
and employment policies in both the public and private sectors.
32.       The proposed project would support the country's manpower develop-
ment efforts by providing assistance for: (a) industrial and vocational
training; (b) forestry training; (c) manpower planning; and (d) science
and technology education at the secondary school level. Together with the
Bank Group's on-going education projects, it would also assist the Government
in correcting the traditional geographical imbalance in the distribution
of school facilities. The project does not present any unusual risks.

PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
33.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Liberia and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
34.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex IV of this Report. A condition of disbursement of funds for construc-
tion of the buildings for the AITB and VTC would be that the Bank has been
furnished with evidence satisfactory to the Bank that the AITB has been
established.
35.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
36.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
Robert S. McNamara
President

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 617-LBR   Port Development Project:   US$3.6 Million Loan of
June 20, 1969; Effective Date: July 10, 1969;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
Project execution has been satisfactory. The Bank has agreed to the
Government's request that funds still undisbursed be used to help finance a
study of port development needs in Liberia, which was stipulated in the
project. Government signed a contract in May 1974 for the first phase of
the port development study, which was completed in September 1975. As a
result, it was determined that specific field studies of the hydrographic
conditions of the port of Monrovia would be required before the Phase II
master plan studies could be undertaken. Consultant proposals for the hydro-
graphic studies are currently under consideration by the Port Authority with a
view to starting the studies later in 1977. Extension of the loan closing
date to cover the next phase of the studies is currently under consideration
by Government and National Port Authority.
Loan No. 1150-LBR Power Project: US$1.8 Million Loan of August 1, 1975;
Effective Date: October 20, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979
The project finances technical assistance for establishing a
long-range development plan and detailed investment program as well as for
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

strengthening management of the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) and
training its staff. While LEC's new management team tackled many operational
problems there was a slippage on some of the specific tasks LEC management
was expected to perform (e.g., sector development plan, tariff study, and
training program). This was due to delays in recruiting qualified experts as
well as the need to first concentrate on keeping LEC operating satisfactorily.
The initial difficulties have been overcome and the project implementation
is proceeding satisfactorily. However, LEC's Board of Directors recently
replaced the Managing Director, and the effect of this change on the corpora-
tion's management remains to be seen.
Credit No. 306-LBR Agricultural Projects: US$1.2 Million Credit of May 17,
1972; Effective Date: December 8, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977; and
Credit No. 577-LBR US$6 Million Credit of August 1, 1975; Effective Date:
May 26, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Under the first credit, feasibility reports on three agricultural
projects and a consultant's study on the reorganization of the Ministry
of Agriculture have been completed, but construction of the training center
is behind schedule. The project completion date has been revised from
June 30, 1976 to August 31, 1977. A second credit (for the Lofa Agricultural
Development Project), approved in 1975, is now in execution. There was an
initial delay in implementing the project due to the delay in recruitment of
key project staff. However, the project is now fully staffed and is being
implemented satisfactorily, although it is too early to make a full assessment
of its performance. The project has received necessary cooperation and
support from the Government agencies and there has been a positive response
from the project farmers.
Loan No. 1055-LBR   Development Finance Company:   US$4 Million Loan of
December 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 3, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979; and
Loan No. 1323-LBR   US$7 Million Loan of October 7, 1976; Effective Date:
December 17, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Loan 1055-LBR helped LBDI meet its financial requirements through
calendar year 1976. LBDI's loan approvals during calendar 1976 surpassed
the projected level for the year. Commitments and disbursements were
similarly above targets. Disbursement of Bank funds, in particular, has
been faster than projected. The loan is fully committed and 65 percent
disbursed as of February 28, 1977. Loan 1323-LBR, signed October 7, 1976,
together with a recently secured third loan of UA 2 million from the ADB
would cover LBDI's foreign resource gap for the period 1977 to 1979.

Loan No. 907-LBR    Highway Projects:  US$3.0 Million Loan of June 13,
1973; Effective Date: December 28, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977;
Credit No. 395-LBR US$2.6 Million Credit of June 13, 1973; Effective Date:
December 28, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977; and
Loan No. 1156-LBR   US$27.5 Million Loan of August 28, 1975; Effective Date
October 14, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The project financed under Loan 907/Credit 395-LBR contains four
elements: (a) the design and reconstruction of the Monrovia By-Pass: this
is now substantially completed; (b) feasibility studies for the improvement
of three roads in the vicinity of Monrovia: all are now completed; on two
of the roads which are important links in the main highway network, recon-
struction has been demonstrated as amply justified and final design has
been started, aiming at completion by May 1977; (c) technical assistance in
the Government's four-year maintenance program: this is already showing
benefits in improved running surfaces on earth and gravel roads and plans are
now being made to consolidate the gains and develop them still further by
closer attention to the organization and planning of road maintenance; and (d)
assistance in determining how best to improve the efficiency of the local
construction industry: a study has begun and should be completed by mid-1977.
The project financed under Loan 1156-LBR contains four elements:
(a) the design and construction of a major bridge and of an urban main road
(5.4 mi.) in Monrovia and of a rural main road (83 mi.); construction has
started on all three and is proceeding somewhat hampered by an unusually
protracted rainy season in 1976; (b) consultant services for feasibility
studies of rural main roads and for an urban transport study in Monrovia;
negotiations are now proceeding with selected consultants; (c) establishing a
feeder road construction unit; equipment was delivered in January 1977,
technical advisors provided by the UK are in post and the unit is operational
and has made a good start; and (d) technical assistance in building up the
planning department of the Ministry of Public Works; a Transport Planner is
now in post.
Credit No. 305-LBR Education Projects: US$7.2 Million Credit of May 17,
1972; Effective Date: December 18. 1972; Closing Date:
March 1, 1978; and
Loan No. 1266T-LBR US$4.0 Million Third Window Loan of June 7, 1976; Effec-
tive Date: July 8, 1976; Closing Date: October 31, 1980
Physical implementation of the first project has been slow due to
difficulties in selecting suitable architectural consultants, reaching agree-
ment on designs and following satisfactory bidding procedures for civil
works. The problems have been resolved and implementation is now proceeding
satisfactorily. All of the construction contracts have been awarded and work

on all project buildings is well advanced. The education, manpower and
university planning components of the project have been completed satis-
factorily. The project is expected to be completed by around March 1978,
about six months behind the original schedule.
Implementation of a second loan (on Third Window terms) is underway.
Good progress is being made in design of buildings and selection of technical
assistance personnel. Recruitment of suitable candidates for fellowships is
proceeding more slowly due to the difficulty of finding such candidates. The
first steps have been taken towards preparation of equipment lists, purchase
of vehicles and design of furniture. The construction contract for the
primary school units has been awarded.

Financing Plan:           The proposed loan would finance the foreign
expenditures component estimated at US$6.3 million.
The Government of Liberia would provide the balance
of US$3.2 million.

1981              0.3              6.3
Procurement:               Civil Works valued at US$3.8 million, furniture valued at
US$0.3 million, and equipment valued at US$1.4
million would be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. Furniture, equipment, vehicles and
other items which cannot be grouped in packages of
at least US$50,000 equivalent each, or which are not
suitable for international competitive bidding,
would be procured on the basis of quotations or
through local competitive bidding in accordance with
procedures acceptable to the Bank. The aggregate
value of such items is estimated at about US$0.2
million. Local manufacturers of furniture and
equipment would be allowed a preferential margin of
15 percent of the c.i.f. price of competing imports,
or the total applicable customs duties and import
taxes, whichever is lower.
Technical Assistance:      The project includes 30 man-years of technical assist-
ance at an estimated cost of about US$36,000 per man-
year, of which about US$25,000 is estimated to be for
salaries. Technical assistance would be for such
services as industrial and vocational training,
manpower planning, forestry training, and science and
technology teaching.
