* AORANDJM AIID RUCO_SRDTION OF THE PRESIDfNT
OF THE INTEEATIONAL BAN  VA RECONSTRUCTION A1D DEVEOPMT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO TOE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC
FOR A
SOCIAL SECTOR MANAGUIENT TECINICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation  on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Argentina for the equivalent of US$28 million to help
prepare and launch reforms in social sectors is submitted for approval.
The loan would have a term of 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable i.nterest rate.    The Government of Japan has also
agreed to assist the project by a grant equivalent to US$3.7 million.
2.       Background.  Even before Argentina's recent economic crisis began,
a significant part of the population lived with little access to public
education,  health,  water  and   sewerage,   and  under  grievous  housing
conditions. Since the mid-1970s, the population in need has increased,
while the coverage and quality of services have deteriorated and the public
and private resources spent on social services have declined. The 1976-81
government spent 17 percent less than the 1973-1975 average on social
services, despite a 17 percent increase in total public expenditure, caused
in  large  part  by  significant   defense  and  security  spending.    The
deterioration of those  services  that  predominantly  benefit lower income
groups has been more severe  than  those  that  serve the middle and higher
income groups.
3.       Since the gap between  the  demand  for  and  the supply of public
social services has  grown,  their  organizational shortcomings have become
more visible. A recent Bank report (IBRD 6900-AR) showed that programming
and budgeting in social sectors are inadequate; cost recovery and resource
mobilization efforts are weak; and earmarked funds are targeted poorly.
Inefficiencies plague the system: inadequate attention to recurrent cost
and maintenance budgets causes expensive equipment to sit idle and
buildings   to   become   unusable;   manpower   distribution   is   skewed
geographically and skill-wise; the coordination between public and private
sectors is extremely  weak.    Much  of  public social expenditures benefit
those who can afford to pay the full cost of these services. However, user
charges are unrelated to service costs or absent; evasion of taxes
earmarked for secial security reaches 50 percent. The Ministries in charge
of social services function at very low levels of productivity, lack
reliable and systematic information, cannot analyze and evaluate their own
programs or monitor the performance of sector agencies. They also suffer
from  low  salaries,  absenteeism,   bad  morale  and  deplorable  physical
conditions.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy is to support
better utilization of the nearly 30Z of public expenditures devoted to
social services, particularly greater cost effectiveness, quality and
accessibility by lower income  groups.    The  present Government has given
priority to alleviating the hardships experienced by an increasing part of
the population and providing equal access to social services. Achievement
of these objectives would require substantial resource mobilization and
major budgetary and institutional reforms to improve allocative and



- 2 -
administrative efficiency and targeting.    Their accomplishment would help
create a better basis for the long-term fulfullment of the country's social
and economic development goals.
5.       The aforementioned  Bank  report  recommended comprehensive policy
and institutional reforms to improve resource mobilization, programming,
efficiency  and  targeting  of   services,  and  demonstrated  that  better
programming and budgeting, introduction of user charges and accurate
targeting would provide far better quality, much more service, and more
effective help, with only minor increases in budgetary resources. Having
fully couicurred with the Bank's advice, the Government has requested
further guidance and critical support in the preparation and execution of
high priority action programs for policy and institutional reform in the
areas covered by this operation. Under a PPF advance by the Bank, it has
formed teams directly attached to the offices of the Ministers and
Secretaries to prepare the project which is intended to lay the policy and
institutional groundwork for a series of planned social sector projects.
The design and implementation arrangements for carrying out the project
take into account the lessons learned from the Bank's experience under the
Public Sector Management Technical Assistance Loan.
6.       ProJect  Objectives.    The  proposed  loan  would  assist  in the
preparation and execution of reforms to improve the institutional and
physical capacity to deliver social services to those who need them. It
would provide technical assistance and equipment to the Ministries of
Education and Justice (MEJ), Health and Social Action (MSAS), Labor and
Social Security (MTSS), Economy (ME); and the National Directorate of
Statistics and Census (INDEC) tot (i) improve the quality and cost
effectiveness of social services; (ii) improve the access of the needy to
social services; and (iii) prepare programs and plans of action for the
mid-term development of the social sectors.
7.       Project  Description.      The   project  would  provide  technical
assistance to (i) prepare and implement programs for improvements in
resource allocation and utilization, cost recovery and targeting; (ii)
introduce administrative reforms and streamline processes in order to
improve programming and budgeting of sector expenditures, including the
establishment of policy analysis units in social sector ministries; (iii)
train federal and provincial sector managers; (iv) build or strengthen
information systems to support policy-making and post-evaluation capacity;
and (v) put in place a better targetting system for the needy. Since the
project is multisectoral, a coordinating unit (PCU) would ensure that
overall goals and objectives are reflected in the activities of each
component and that the key activities (statistical services, information
systems, training, evaluation, procurement) are coordinated. The PCU would
also support the participating units' implementation of their components,
review in substance the selection and contracting of consultants and
purchasing equipment and evaluate the impact of technical assistance on the
performance of the  agencies.    To  fulfill  these  duties, it will retain
experts, acceptable to the Bank.    The  project,  to be carried out over 3
years, would provide funds for consultant fees; training; vehicles,
furniture and equipment and civil  works.   Total project cost is estimated
at US$45.0 million equivalent, including US$10.6 million (24Z) in foreign
exchange. Schedule A contains a breakdown of costs, the financing plan and
the disbursement schedule and Schedule B the amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements.    A  timetable of key project processing



events and the status of Bank Group operations in Argentina are given in
Schedules C and  D,  respectively.    A  map  is  also attached.  Technical
Annex A provides an overview of sector agencies, the description of project
activities  by   sectoral   components   and   the  arr7agements  regarding
procurement, disbursement, accounts  and  audit.    Annex  B presents time-
specific policy actions which were discussed with the social sector
ministries.  Annex C is  the    Government's letter of intention concerning
the project.
8.       Agreed Actions.    The  Government  has  agreed  on  the following
actions: (i) the studies financed under the project would include specific
implementation programs to meet the objectives of th. project; (ii) where
appropriate, and taking into account the Bank's comments thereupon, the
Government would prepare time-specific programs or plans of action to carry
out the recommendations of such studies; (iii) annual action plans for the
execution of activities under each component will be furaished to the Bank
by September 1 of each year for the following year. The effectiveness of
the loan agreement would be subject to the satisfactory fulfillment of the
following conditions: (i) establishment of a project coordinating unit and
project execution units with adequate staffing and definition of functions;
and (ii) contracting a procurement agent. Starting in 1989, the Bank would
receive annual progress reports and consult with the Government on the
results of stu: yes. Also, the loan would be tranched. A mid-term review
of project implementation would be made and no more than half of the loan
proceeds (i.e. beyond US$14.0 million) would be disbursed unless the Bank
is satisfied with the progress achieved in carrying out the project and in
attaining its objectives.    Hiring  of  consultants  will  be according to
procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
9.       Benefits.    The  project   is   expected  to  bring  about  major
improvements in the efficiency of social service delivery, mobilize
additional resources and contribute to the alleviation of the negative
impact of the deteriorating economic situation of the last decade and cost
of recession and adjustment on the poor. It would also help to prepare
follow up projects that would be presented to the Bank for financing.
10.      Risks.  Next year's national elections could affect the commitment
required for this project, especially because of its strong policy emphasis
and the existence of enclave units to be financed by outside funds. To
minimize this risk, an effort has been made to build a wide consensus
through bipartisan project preparation  groups.    Also, a larger amount of
supervision, annual joint reviews and the aforementioned comprehensive
mid-term review, are planned to ensure satisfactory progress towards the
achievement of the objectives of the project.
11.      Recommendation.   I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

ARGENTINA
TECHNICAL ANNEX TO THE MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT
FOR A
SOCIAL SECTOR MANAGEMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
SECTION A. THE PROJECT AND ITS BACKGROUND
I. OVERVIEW, OBJECTIVES AND STRiTEGY
1.    Even before Argentina's  recent  economic  crisis  began, a significant
part of the population lived with little access to public education, health,
water and sewerage, and under grievous housing conditions. Since the mid-
1970s, the population in need has increased, while the public and private
resources for education,  health  and  housing  have  declined.   The 1976-81
government spent 17 percent less than the 1973-1975 average on social
services, despite a 17 percent increase in total public expenditure, caused
in  large  part  by   significant   defense   and  security  spending.    The
deterioration of those services that predominantly benefit lower income
groups--primary education, public hospitals, preventive health care, slum
improvement programs--has been more severe  than those that served the middle
and higher income groups.   Much  of public social expenditures benefit those
who can afford to pay the full cost of these services. User charges are
unrelated to service costs or absent; evasion of taxes earmarked for social
security reach 50 percent.
2.    Since the gap between the  demand  for  and the supply of public social
services has grown, their organizational shortcomings have become more
visible. Inefficiencies and the lack of suitable data, as in the legal
system, plague the provision of services: inadequate attention to recurrent
cost and maintenance budgets causes expensive equipment to sit idle and
buildings to become unusable; manpower distribution is skewed geographically
and skill-wise;  the  coordination  between  public  and  private  sectors is
extremely weak.
3.    The Ministri-s in charge of social services function at very low levels
of  productivity  because  of   the   scarcity  of  reliable  and  systematic
information, the weakness of  intermediate  and support staff, and cumbersome
budgetary procedures.   They  also  suffer  from  absenteeism, bad morale and
deplorable physical conditions.  Therefore, their capacity to plan and budget
programs and monitor the performance of sector agencies is severely limited.
4.    The present Government has  given  priority to alleviating the hardship
experienced by an increasing part of the population and providing equal
access to social services.    Achievement  of  these objectives would require
substantial resource mobilization and major budgetary and institutional
reforms to improve allocative and administrative efficiency and targeting.
Better programming and budgeting, introduction of user charges and accurate
targeting would provide far better quality, much more service, and more
effective help, with only minor increases in budgetary resources.

It. SECTOR AGENCIES
5.    Education.  The Secretariat  of  Education  (SE)  in the MEJ is charged
with the management of secondary schools (primary education was decentralized
to provinces in 1978). oversight of technical and university education, and
programs to improve the content and quality of education. The Secretariat of
Coordination (SCECC) has responsibility for finance and budgeting and
administrat:on.  The  delivery  of  educational  services  has been seriously
impaired by the lack of policy analysis capability. inadequa:e information,
outmoded procedures and weak coordination of the provincial programs.
6.    Health  and  Social  Welfare.       The  federal  MSAS  is  organized  in
secretariats  responsible  for   health,   human   welfare,  housing,  social
promotion, and  the  coordination  of  the  Ministry.    The  large number of
providers,  financing  schemes   and   autonomous  provincial  and  municipal
administrations combine with inadequate coordination and weak leadership to
cause overlapping, duplication, inequity and inefficierncies in the Health
Secretariat's  coordination  of  the  sector.       The  Secretariat  of  Human
Development and Family (SDHF) is responsible for services to the elderly,
minors, the disabled, youth and women.    SDHF's management is weak and lacks
an organized  constituency.    Its  recent  reorganization  emphasized SDHF's
promotional, advisory, training, coordinating and policy setting assistance
to the provinces, municipalities and NG0s, instead of the direct management
of projects.    SDHF  requires  greater  efficiency  in  program planning and
implementation, especially to cope with growing numoers and needs of
vulnerable groups.
7.    Social Security and Labor.   The  Secretariat of Social Security in the
MTSS and its revenue directorate (DNRP), an autonomous and decentralized
agency,  collect  social   security  contributions,  identify  beneficiaries,
distribute benefits, and conduct the legal pursuit of arrears. They lack the
capacity  to  carry  out  these   tasks  satisfactorily.    Thus  evasion  of
contributions reach almost 50Z, and substantial delays and mistakes occur in
the payment of be.nefits.   Private sector employees, public sector employees,
and self-employed workers have been organized in individual social security
organizations (CNP's). Nominally autonomous and self-financing entities, the
CNP's have gradually evolved into appendages of the Secretariat.
8.    Because of the heavy involvement  of  the government in labor disputes,
both as the largest employer and the arbitrageur, the Secretariat of Labor in
MTSS has traditionally played the role of the government counterpart of labor
unions. The Secretariat has recently initiated an effort to function as the
employment policy maker and to ensure a smooth functioning of the labor
market.
9.    Legal Information System.   The  shortcomings  of the legal information
system  hinder  eccuomic  activity  and   reduce  the  effectiveness  of  the
Government's fiscal,  financial  and  trade  policies.    The  Government has
established, with assistance from the Government of Italy, a computerized
information system (SAIJ) to provide up-to-date information on federal and
provincial legislation, regulations and  cases.    When completed, SAIJ would
bring certainty and transparency to the legal, administrative, economic and
financial  systems  and   ensure   consistency   and  predictability  in  the
application of regulations. The reforms to be implemented under the project
would help to re-establish a clear set of rules for private investment and
production in particular, and economic activity in general.

III. THE PROJECT
10.   The proposed loan  would  assist  in  the  preparation and execution of
reforms to improve the institutional and physical capacity of social service
delivery to achieve the project objectives.   Also, in order to translate the
Government's social policy into effective action, the allocation of fiscal
resources among  competing  social  programs  would  be  strengthened.   This
requires incorporating the policy priorities (protection of recurrent cost
requirements, redistributive emphasis, user charge applications) into the
budget preparation process, screening agency proposals in terms of these
priorities, and conducting federal/provincial budget negotiations on sector-
specific rather than overall  quantitative  targets.   Project activities are
described below:
A. Education
11.   Management Information and Decision-Making:  Technical assistance would
strengthen  the  Ministry's   planning,   programming   and  policy  analysis
capability and enhance the availability of information on the costs and
benefits of programs. A policy analysis unit would be created at the level
of the Education Cabinet to identify and analyze strategic and policy-related
issues.    Assistance  wouid  be  provided  for  strengthening  the planning,
statistics, budgeting, auditing and control units, and the inter-university
boards   of   coordination   through   consultant   studies,   organizational
restructuring and reequipment.    Financing  will  also  be  provided for the
rehabilitation of an existing building to consolidate scattered offices in
adjacent facilities, and for modernizing the Ministry's payroll and other
information systems.
12.   Quality of Education:   An  assessment  mechanism would be developed to
help analyze the system's strengths and weaknesses so as to target resources
better on the areas  of  greatest  need.    Pilot studies concerning teaching
material  and  teacher  retraining  would  also  be  included.    Also,  cost
effectiveness studies of technical education and applications of educational
technology would be carried out.   To lay the groundwork for decentralization
of secondary education, an inventory of existing facilities, plans for
maintenance, repair and additions, and a program for strengthening the
management of teaching personnel would be prepared. Also, a proposal would
be developed to strengthen the role of the parent-teacher cooperatives at the
primary level.
B. Health
13.   National Institute  of  Social  Insurance  (INOS).    INOS  would:  (i)
develop an accreditation procedure with a set of minimum guidelines to
register social insurance funds (OS); (ii) propose alternative benefit plans
with a minimum medical care package; (iii) develop a plan for the extension
of health care coverage to the poor; and (iv) develop procedures to integrate
service delivery by social insurance funds with other health care providers.
14.   Decentralization of National Hospitals.  The decision-making capability
of national hospitals would be increased to strengthen control of their
resources. Staff would be trained, management systems put in place, and
budgetary responsibility transferred to the operational level. The role of
each facility within the health care delivery system would be clarified and
its services integrated in the delivery network.



- 14 -                 Annex A
Page 4 of 7 pages
15.   Health Manpower.  A program would  be prepared to deal with the surplus
of physicians and  the  shortage  of  nurses.    The  program will (i) review
medical education and nursing ed"cation; (ii) expand primary health care in
the medical and nursing curricula; (iii) upgrade empirical nurses; and (iv)
establish a national task force on health education policies; (v} establish
decentralized continuing education programs in primary health care for
physicians and nurses.
16.   Information System.   This  activity  would reinforce ongoing technical
assistance to establish a data bank for management planning and control. The
project would develop the management information system for sector policy
formulation and for hospital management, establish a national register of
resources, and collaborate with INDEC on the Household Survey.
17.   Ministerial Coordination.    The  project  would  support  a management
information system which would enable the Secretariat of Coordination to
review, coordinate and evaluate the programs and budgets of the MSAS.
C. Welfare Services
18.   Service  Demand  and  Supply.  The  project  would  encompasss  (i)  an
inventory of demand by target group and an analysis of the current service
capability; and (ii) development of options for enhancing management capacity
including an assessment of the decentralization of responsibilities to the
provinces, municipalities and NGO's.
19.   Demonstration Projects.  Two high  priority projects to gain experience
in resource management, intersectoral coordination, cost effectiveness of
coverage, and models of community involvement will be executed: (i) three
reorientation centers, six income-producing cooperatives and thirty homes for
street children will be furnished and equipped; evaluation studies to guide
program expansion will be conducted; (ii) three self-help community centers
in urban slum areas will be established to develop and execute small
community promotion projects in health, housing, environment, nutrition and
labor.  Responsibility  to   manage   both   activities  will  eventually  be
transferred to provincial and nongovernmental community organizations.
D. Social Security
20.   Macro Programming.  This component would provide assistance for a study
to review the existing social security system and develop alternative
modalities in the context of macroeconomic and legal conditions.
21.   Revenue Enhancement.   This  component  would  consist of the following
activities: (i) development of legal, economic and administrative proposals
needed to improve the efficiency of revenue recording, reporting, collection
and enforcement procedures; (ii) completion of the master list of employers,
records of salaried and self-employed workers; and the elimination of open
records without specific employers; (iii) development of a follow-up system
for payment arrears and payments in default; and, (iv) installation of a
management information system, including comprehensive job description and
classification, staff profiles, and training and incentives systems.

22.   Benefits Administration.   This  component  would include the following
activities:  (1)  preparation  of  a   proposal  to  restructure  levels  and
distribution  of   benefits   with   specific   reference   to  their  income
redistribution effects; (ii) streamlining of procedures for defining benefit
eligibility and amounts, and the mechanization of payment mechanisms: (iii)
development of a proposal for administrative restructuring.
23.   Labor Market Services.  Assistance would be provided to the Secretariat
of Labor to: (i) develop an employment data bank, including sector- and area-
specific information; (ii) prepare policy proposals to improve labor mobility
and to introduce unemployment assistance programs; (iii) prepare a proposal
to restructure the Labor Inspection, Employment and Informal Sector units.
E. Cross-Sectoral Activities
24.   Public Social Expenditures.   Assistance  would  be provided to form an
advisory group in the Ministry of Economy to: (i) analyze the effects of
public social expenditure on the target population, and the costs and impact
of the most important programs; and (ii) analyze the planning and budgeting
mechanisms to develop a proposal to improve the cost effectiveness of public
social expenditures; (iii) make recommendations on the ways to improve
service delivery, in particular of those targeted to low income groups.
25.   Statistical Services for Social  Sectors.   Assistance will be provided
to INDEC of the Secretariat of Planning and to sectoral statistics units in
Education,  Health,  Justice,  Human   Development   and  Family,  and  Labor
Secretariats both in the national and provincial ministries in order to
coordinate (and if necessary integrate) and improve the various data
collection  instruments  (censuses,   surveys  and  administrative  records).
Project activities would include: (i) analysis of information demand;
evaluation of existing systems and data sources; and assessment of personnel
and training needs; (ii) design of information monitoring, evaluation, norms
and generalized classifications; testing of sectoral information systems;
'iii) partial implementation of the sectoral systems in pilot provinces.
26.   Legal  Information  System.    The  project  would  provide  consultant
services and equipment  to  increase  substantially  the  number of users and
expand SAIJ's data base and technical capacity and make the system more user-
oriented and accessible. Consulting services and equipment would be provided
to: (i) complete the assessment of information and training needs of public
and private users and the definition of technical specifications of hardware
and software needed; (ii) develop integrated software that would enable a
certain group of users such as the Central Bank, the courts and the Attorney
General's office to feed the system with up to date information on rules and
regulations, cases and legal opinions as soon as they are issued, as part of
these  institutions'  management  information   systems:  (iii)  improve  the
updating expediency of the existing data base and to establish a user-
friendly access system, including the development of a thesaurus and
automatic  codification  of  information.        This  component  also  includes
assistance for a training program for SAIJ's staff and the system's other
users.

SCUTON B. PROJECT AMINISTRATION AND  HPLEMUNTATION
II. ORGANIZATION AND COORDINATION
27.   The Ministry  of  Economy  (ME)  will  have  overall responsibility for
project organization and management; its Secretary of Economic Coordination
will be responsible, as Project Director, for project implementation and
follow up. The Secretaries of each of the concerned Ministries would be the
Associate Project Directors. Project Execution Units would be established in
the Secretariats of Education, Health, Justice, Human Development and Family,
led by a Project Coordinator and supported by consultants. The Secretaries
of Social Security and Labor and the Director of INDEC would be responsible
for their components, also assisted by coordinators.
26.   Project execution is likely to be  affected by the deterioration of the
civil service salaries, which caused many government officials to pay
inadequate attention to their duties and to take second jobs. In order to
ensure that competent government officials are retained and work full-time on
the project, the Government will supplement salaries of a limited number of
civil servants involved in  execution.    Government  officials even those on
leave arrangements, would be ineligible, however, to work as consultants on
the project.
29.   Coordinating Unit.  The proposed loan would fund a Project Coordinating
Unit (PCU) which would report to the Project Director and woulds (i) ensure
that overall objectives are reflected in the activities of each component and
that key areas pertinent to the project as a whole (statistical services,
information systems, training, evaluation, procurement) are coordinated
and/or integrated;   (ii)  provide  or  arrange  support to the participating
sectors in implementing their project components, including assistance in
drafting  terms  of  reference,   determining  qualifications  and  selecting
consultants: (iii) review all consultant reports, providing feedback to the
Project Director, implementing agencies, and the Bank on content and
soundness of recommendations; (iv) provide to the Bank annual progress
reports; (v) make all administrative arrangements for the contracting of
consultants, and the purchase of equipment and supplies with the assistance
of a procurement agent.   The  PCU  would consist of: one project coordinator
(to  be  appointed  by   the   Ministry   of  Economy);  two  economists;  an
administrative assistant, two secretaries and a messenger, all working full-
time for the project. The PCU would have funds available to obtain expert
advice and peer reviews on consultant studies, and publish those studies that
would be found meritorious.
30.   To ensure that  the  assistance  provided  by  the project improves the
delivery of social services, the Bank and the Government would conduct joint
annual reviews and a major mid-term review of the project's policy and
institutional impact against a timetable of agreed actions. The PCU would,
with inputs from the units in each sector, develop indicators, carry out
baseline studies, quantify sectoral objectives, and set up a monitoring
mechanism to measure regularly the changes in the structure, the process and
the outcomes of  the  project  implementation  agencies.    Also, the project
coordinator  would  head  an   informatics   commitee  intended  to  exchange
information among the executing agencies and to standarize equipment acquired
under the project, which committee shall be established within sixty days
after the effective date.



- 17 -                Annex A
Page 7 of 7 pages
31.   Annual Action Programs.  The  Project  Execution Units would prepare an
annual  program   for   each   sector   specifying   objectives,  activities,
institutional arrangements, and the project's expected impact for each year
and each component.    The  programs  would  include  terms  of reference for
approval by the PCU and the Bank and could recommend funding allocations
among components. Action programs for years 1, 2 and 3 would be submitted
for  Bank  approval  by  July   1988,   September  1989  and  September  1990
respectively.    Joint  project   implementation  reviews  would  take  place
annually.
II. PROCURIEMNT, DISBURSEKENT, ACCOUNTS. AUDIT
32.   Procurement. All goods, civil works,  services and consultants would be
procured under procedures consistent with Bank guidelines. It is estimated
that 802 of total expenditures on consultants would be for local consultants.
Procurement of civil works and goods, principally computers and their
corresponding software and office technology equipment, would be carried out
through international competitive bidding in the case of contracts over
US$200,000  equivalent,   and   through   international   shopping  including
quotations from at least three suppliers for goods costing less than
US$200,000 but more than US$20,000 up to an aggregate amount not to exceed
the equivalent of US$3.7 million; all in conformity with the Bank guidelines
for procurement. Direct purchases of small items would also be allowed,
provided that their cost is the equivalent of US$20,000 or less and that they
do not exceed in the aggregate the equivalent of US$200,000. Prior Bank
review would be required for all contracts for goods and services over
US$200,000 equivalent.
33.   Hiring of Procurement Agent.  To expedite employment of consultants and
purchasing equipment, the Government would hire a procurement agent under a
Management Services Contract, financed by the proposed loan. The procurement
agent would  follow  procedures  consistent  with  Bank  guidelines.    It is
expected that UNESCO and PAHO would also support components in the education
and health components, respectively. The Government would need to agree with
the procurement agent and the UN agencies on the administrative services to
be rendered and on the fees.
34.   Disbursements.  The  disbursement  schedule  would reflect a three-year
disbursement  period.    The  Bank  would  disburse:  1002  of  the  costs of
consultants and associated services; 1002 of the cost of foreign goods and
equipment; 1002 of foregn expenditures and 802 of local expenditures for
training and fellowships; and 1002 repayment of the PPF advance. The project
is expected to be completed by December 31, 1991, and the closing date would
be June 30, 1992.
35.   Accounts and Audit.  The Borrower would establish and maintain separate
project accounts for all expenditures financed under this loan. Accounts and
supporting records pertaining to the services and goods financed under the
loan would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
