MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Mexico
Ports Rehabilitation and Equipment Project (Loan 2946-ME)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Mexico - Ports Rehabilitation and
Equipment project (Loan 2946-ME, approved in FY88) prepared by the Latin America and Caribbean
Regional Office with Part II contributed by the Borrower.
The Loan for US$50 million equivalent was closed on schedule on June 30, 1994. A balance
of about US$3.8 million was canceled. The loan was the fourth to assist the port system in Mexico. Its
objectives were to (a) improve port efficiency through the rehabilitation and modernization of port
operations, infrastructure and equipment; (b) improve port equipment management, including equipment
procurement, finance and maintenance; (c) help with the reorganization of dredging; and (c) strengthen
port investment planning and financial management. New infrastructure works, equipment procurement
and rehabilitation of facilities were to be undertaken in four ports. Rehabilitation and modernization of
dredging covered both acquisition and repair of equipment and a planning and management study.
Technical assistance for management included, inter alia, a study of the project's environmental impact.
The project seems to have been successful.  Traffic increased; dredging operations were
reorganized; cost studies resulted in an overhaul of the tariff structure and a more effective recovery of
port charges. The economic return of the project would be 29 percent against 22 percent forecast at
appraisal. A Strategy for Privatization Study was conducted. Major and positive changes in port
administration took place during project implementation; dredging services were privatized; a new Ports
Act was passed in 1993, which opened the way to privatization of local Integral Port Administrations
through concessions (BOT) schemes. While the PCR tends to attribute these reforms to the project,
documentation is missing on its actual impact on Government policy.
The outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory; its sustainability is rated as likely; and its
impact on institutional development is rated as modest. The PCR lacks important information, especially
as regards finance, compliance with covenants, procurement, studies and the execution of an action plan
that was central to project implementation.
An audit is planned.

(Loan 2946-ME)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.    The principal objectives of the project, namely the improvement of port efficiency,
dredging operations, planning, and financial management, were largely achieved (para.
5.3). Dredging operations were improved through privatization. Financial management
and performance was improved largely through the appropriate revision of port charges
and through more effective recovery of port charges. However, the most significant
contribution of the project was the reorganization of the ports sector and the improvement
of container handling facilities in Veracruz, Manzanillo, Altamira and Lazaro Cardenas
(para. 6.1).
Implementation and Results
2.    Although there was some delay in the start up of the project (para 5. 1) and
substantial changes in the project content (paras 5.1 and 5.3) the essential components of
the project were completed within the scheduled time (para 5.4) with increased emphasis
on container handling operations and the privatization of the dredging services. Overall
costs of the project at US$127.9 million was over 40% higher than the appraisal estimate,
mainly because of inflation and changes in the project content (para 5.5). Total port traffic
increased substantially (para 6.2) and the financial position of the four ports improved
significantly, with the exception of Guaymas where there was a reduction in traffic after
1992 (para 6.3), as reflected in the 1993 financial results. In the other three ports the
improvement in finances was considerable, particularly in Veracruz (para 6.4).
Throughout the period of implementation of the project, the port organization improved
(paras 8.1 and 9.1) and the economic re-evaluation of the project yielded an ERR of 29%
against 22% forecast at appraisal (paras 6.5 and 6.6).
Sustainability
3.    The project witnessed the maturing of the institutional set up of the port sub-sector
and the rehabilitation of the subject ports was significant and important. This will enable
over time the realization and maintenance of the projected benefits of the project (para
7.01).

Findings and Lessons Learned
4.    This was a successful project that covered four important ports in Mexico. The
project helped provide additional container handling facilities in Veracruz, Manzanillo,
Altamira and Lazaro Cardenas. The work of improving grain storage facilities at
Veracruz was entrusted to the private sector. Review and re-allocation of equipment in
the various ports improved equipment utilization and maintenance. Dredging operations
were privatized. A set of studies helped modify and refine the investments. Above all
substantial financial and organizational improvements resulted as a result of the project.
5.    Although the Bank-Borrower relationships were, in general, satisfactory and the
procurement process was properly conducted, in an amicable manner, a dispute in regard
to the award for a heavy-duty container crane (paras 9.1 and 10.1) has elicited a complaint
from the Borrower in his report (Part II). The Borrower was asking for some flexibility
on the part of the Bank which was not possible under the prevailing Bank Procurement
Guidelines. This should not, however, detract from a project which was, in general, well-
executed.

II.    Background:
2.1    The dramatic swings in the Mexican economy in the late 1970's and the early 1980's had a
significant impact on the transport sector. The surge in the economic activity in this period, with the
GDP rising by an average of 6% per year in real terms and an unprecedented demand for imported
grains led to a period of high traffic growth for all modes of transport with the ports registering an
average annual growth of 8% in cargo tons from 1978 to 1981, the railways 5% per year and the
highways an unprecedented growth of 13% per year. As a result investment in transport which had
declined in relative terms from 20% of public sector before the 1970's to 9%, was accelerated,
particularly for ports and railways. The sectoral focus was on providing sufficient capacity to
support the oil-fed grovth of the economy.
2.2    By 1982, however, the rate of expansion of the economy, led by public sector expenditures
became untenable. The fiscal deficit reached over 17% of the GDP, capital flight accelerated and
the Mexican peso was devalued by 268% in 1982. GDP fell, and as the Government's stabilization
and demand-management program took hold, traffic declined and investments were curtailed.
Recovery of the economic activity did not come till 1987. However as budgets remained limited the
emphasis in transport tended to be on tackling the backlog of maintenance and rehabilitation works,
on minimizing new construction, and on continued rationalization of public sector expenditures.
This project was initially proposed to be a sector project, however, it was felt that the planning
functions in the port agencies concerned needed further strengthening before a sector type operation
could be handled by the port sector, and therefore it was proposed that a two-phase approach would



- 2 -
be adopted. The proposed project, scheduled for 1988 would cover a limnited time period (1988-94)
and four main ports i.e. Guaymas, Manzanillo, Tampico-Altamira and Veracruz, and the National
Dredging Service (SEDRA). This project would also start to address some of the sector policy
issues with the DGP, the central planning body of the Secretariat for Communications and Transport
(SCT), and thus lay the foundation for a follow-up project of a broader sectoral nature.
2.3    The first project brief was actually made in February 1986. This was refined in May 1986
and resulted in the final project brief in mid November 1986. The appraisal of the proposed project
took place from November 23 to December 10, 1986, and focused the project on improving the
efficiency of port operations in four of the main ports (Guaymas, Manzanillo, Tampico-Altamira
and Veracruz) and in strengthening the capacity of SEDRA.. However, the appraisal mission was
unable to complete the appraisal for want of completed investment and action plans, an adequate
dredging study and a draft Ports Policy Paper. A letter to the Secretary of Communications and
Transport in December 1986 spelled out the outstanding requirements and target dates for the
various plans and studies, and the finalization of the project was deferred. Another Bank mission
visited Mexico in September 1987, reported progress in the various plans and reports, but suggested
more work on the Ports Policy Paper which had not quite come up to the standard required. In
March, 1988, the management of the Bank authorized negotiation while still expressing concerns
over the need for a) having a firm plan for carrying out the project in the various ports, and b) the
revision of the cost estimates on the basis of more recent prices. Negotiations were held in April
1988 and the Board Approval for the project was given on May 31, 1988.
III. Project Obectives and Descriptio
3.1    Project Objectives. The principal objectives of the Bank's support for the Ports
Rehabilitation project, were to:
a) improve port efficiency through the rehabilitation and modernization of port operations,
infrastructure and equipment;
b) assist in the acquisition of dredging equipment, maintenance and operational training,
and help with the administrative reorganization of the dredging finctions; and
c) strengthen port investment planning and financial management.
3.2    Port efficiency had been an important element in Mexico's economic recovery and in the
Govermment's and Bank's efforts to strengthen the country's transport infrastructure. The last two
port projects had helped establish a basis for rationalizing the system of port administration and the
pricing of port services This project was designed to improve investment planning, operational
efficiency, and cost recovery policies.
3.3    Project Description.   The project comprised primarily the rehabilitation of port
infrastructure and equipment. procurement of replacement equipment, replenishment of spare parts
stocks, technical assistance and training. In addition there was procurement of new container and
bulk grain handling equipment for Guavmas, Manzanillo and Veracruz, and container equipment for
Altamira and Veracruz, as well as measuring and survey equipment and auxiliary craft and barges
for SEDRA. Details of the various project items are given below:

entrance of the existing container terminal; (b) construction of bridge at same site for accessing
container yard at west side of site; (c) rehabilitation of break-bulk and container handling equipment;
and (d) acquisition of container and grain handling equipment.
Part B: SEDRA
Rehabilitation and modernization of the basic fleet of trailing suction hopper dredges and
cutter suction pipeline dredges; acquisition and utilization of auxiliary vessels and craft, measuring
equipment and spare parts; carrying out and implementing studies of nationwide dredging needs and
of strengthening SEDRA's management and planning capacity for future needs.
Part C: Technical Assistance
Carrying out of: (a) studies to assist SEDRA to implement its Action Plan; (b) a cost-
benefit study of relocating bulk traffic facilities from the Panuco river to Altamira; (c) assistance in
the preparation and implementation of equipment maintenance programs; (d) assistance in
developing port management accounting systems; and (e) supervision of construction of major civil
works.
3.4    The total estimated cost of the project including contingencies was about $90.2 million. The
expected foreign exchange component was about $50.0 million which was proposed to be financed
by the Bank loan. The local costs of $40.2 million were to be financed by internally generated funds



from the ports ($20.6 million) and by the Government ($19.6 million). The projects was slated for
completion on December 31, 1993.
IV. Project Design and Or,ganization
4.1    SCT through the Directorate General for Maritime Works (DGOM), the National
Commission for Port Coordination (CNCP), the various Port Services Companies (ESPs) (for
Guaymas, Manzanillo, Tampico-Altamira, Veracruz) and SEDRA would be responsible for the
implementation of the project. A project coordinator with some support staff was appointed in the
Ports and Systems directorate of CNCP and was made responsible for the implementation of the
project and for monitoring its progress, including the preparation of quarterly reports to the Bank.
The project coordinator was also responsible for obtaining the required budgetary appropriations
from the Secretariat for Programming and Budgeting (SPP). A detailed program for project
execution was prepared, and during negotiations, agreement was reached with SCT and the
concerned agencies on the program and the project implementation schedule.
4.2   In order to maintain close control of project execution activities, performance indicators and
targets were agreed upon with the borrower in the form of an Action Plan covering a range of
operational targets relating to the quality and efficiency of port operations. Responsibility for the
various procurement activities were clearly earmarked and the methods of procurement (ICB, LCB,
other) specified for each group of activity in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement.
During negotiations, agreement was reached on the Terms of Reference for consulting services for
technical assistance, for studies, and for design of improvements and supervision of construction.
BANOBRAS was the designated Borrower of the Bank's loan at the current terms of 15 years,
including 5 years of grace. BANOBRAS would onlend to the other entities at the same terms plus a
small fee for its intermediary role. In order to reduce the time interval during which the government
would finance the Bank's share of project costs with its own funds, a Special Account was set up
with Banco de Mexico under the control of BANOBRAS. Agreement was reached during
negotiations that annual audits of the Special Account and SCT's project accounts would be carried
out in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
V. Project Implementation
5.1    Loan Effectiveness and Project Startup.  Although the Board approval of the loan was
given in May 1988, the Loan Agreement was not signed until a year later in June 1989. Initially
there was a problem with the availability of counterpart funds which delayed the preparation of the
budget. Subsequently, as a result of the reorganization of the ports sector, and the creation of
Puertos Mexicanos (PUERTOMEX) there were further delays in loan signing. The loan finally
became effective only on May 4, 1990. The changes effecting the Ports Sector were incorporated in
the Loan and Guarantee Agreements with an eight page Amendment letter signed by BANOBRAS
and the Bank on February 15, 1990. This letter covered both the Loan Agreement and the
Guarantee Agreement and, in addition to the organizational changes arising from the formation of
PUERTOMEX and the liquidation of SEDRA, covered also the improvement of the container
terminals in Manzanillo and Veracruz and the acquisition of container handling equipment for these
ports. The modifications to the Guarantee Agreement particularly spelled out the Guarantor's role in
acting through SCT via PUERTOMEX to carry out the Guaymas Action Plan, the Manzanillo
Action Plan, the Tampico-Altamnira Action Plan, the Veracruz Action Plan and the Dredging Action
Plan and further to cause ESPs of Guaymas (SEPOG), of Manzanillo (SEPOM) and of Veracruz



- 5 -
(SERPOVER), with the assistance of the various CDPs (Port Development Committees) to carry out
their respective Action Plans.
5.2    Project Changes.   Following the first amendment of the Loan/Guarantee agreements in
February 1990, the following further changes were made:
- March 8, 1990:     Regarding date of effectiveness of the first Amendment
- May 30, 1990:      Clarification of Procurement procedures as indicated in
Schedule 4 "Procurement and Consultant's Services."
5.3    Project Execution.  The World Bank carried out eight supervision missions from August
1989 to July 1993 (see table 9). During these missions Bank staff met with PUERTOMEX and
visited the project ports of Guaymas, Veracruz, Manzanillo and Tampico-Altamira. Additional
container handling facilities were provided in Veracruz, Manzanillo, Altamira, and Lazaro Cardenas.
The work of improvement of grain storage facilities in Veracruz was entrusted to the private sector.
A review and reallocation of equipment to the various ports improved equipment utilization and
maintenance, due to the grouping and standardization of port equipment. A national dredging study
highlighted the organizational and equipment problems of SEDRA which was liquidated by decree in
1989 when its equipment operations and human resources were passed to the control of
PUERTOMEX. In 1993, dredging operations were privatized. A set of studies pertaining to the
various ports, and Bank-Borrower conferences helped strengthen port investment planning and
define investments for the port sector. Cost studies to indicate the appropriate level of port dues and
tariffs resulted in an overhaul of the tariff structure, a more effective recovery of port charges, and,
over the period, significant improvements in financial performance (paras 6.3 and 6.4).
5.4    There were some delays in the start up, due largely to the reorganization of the ports sector,
and in the implementation of individual sub-projects. However, implementation of the project was
completed by the scheduled date of December 31, 1993.
5.5    Project Costs. Analysis of project costs during the project period (1988-1994) has been
difficult not only due to the relatively high and fluctuating inflation rates but also because the parity
between the dollar and Mexican Peso varied considerably during the project years. A comparison
between the appraisal estimates and the actual costs is given in Table 3 (Part III). The estimated and
actual Financing Plans are shown in Table 4 (Part III). The actual cost of the project at $127.4
million was substantially (41%) in excess of the Appraisal Estimate of $90.2 million, mainly
because of inflation and some changes in the project (paras 5.1 and 5.2).
5.6    Overall, local costs of the project were $58.5 million instead of $40.2 million estimated at
appraisal and the foreign exchange costs were $69.4 million instead of $50.0 million foreseen. $3.8
million of the Bank loan of $50.0 million was canceled.
5.7    Disbursements.      Table 5 (Part III) gives the estimated and actual Schedule of
Disbursements. Due to the late signing and effectiveness of the loan, disbursements started in the
quarter ending June 1990 instead of the quarter ending December 1988 as foreseen at appraisal.
However, the pace of disbursements picked up thereafter and by the end of December 31, 1993,
$45.8 million had been disbursed. Disbursement totalled $46.2 million by June 30, 1994 when the
project was closed and the balance cancelled.

VI. Project Results
6.1    Ports Objectives.   The principal objectives of this project, namely to (i) improve port
efficiency through the rehabilitation and modernization of port operations, infrastructure and
equipment; (ii) improve equipment management and maintenance; (iii) assist in the acquisition and
maintenance of dredging equipment and operations; and (iv) strengthen port investment planning and
financial management, were largely achieved (para 5.3). Clearly, the most significant results of the
project emerged from the reorganization of the ports sector and the revision of priorities pertaining to
the inclusion of container terminals in Veracruz, Manzanillo. Altimara, and Lazaro Cardenas, to
cater to the increase in container traffic. Notwithstanding these changes, the project remained within
the scope of the original objectives. The other important contributions of this project were the
review, reallocation and acquisition of port handling equipment for the various ports, the
privatization of dredging operations and the improvement of financial management and performance
(para 6.3), achieved largely through the appropriate revision of port dues and more effective
recovery of port charges.
6.2    Traffic.    Traffic forecasts for the four project ports were based, at appraisal, on the
general premise that the Mexican GDP would grow at 2 to 4% p.a. on average over the next decade
and that with increasing trade liberalization international trade through the ports system, would grow
by 3-5% p.a. on average. In fact, total port traffic through the project ports' rose from 10.2 million
metric tons in 1985 to 12.7 million tons in 1993, and had a peak of 13.9 million tons in 1992.
Import and export traffic representing international trade rose over the same period from 8.8 million
tons to a peak of 12.2 million tons in 1990 and 10.8 million tons in 1993, i.e. an overall increase of
29%. Total port traffic therefore, did increase substantially. This, coupled with the upward revision
of tariffs and the improved recovery procedures for port dues, enabled the project ports to
significantly improve their finances (para 6.3).
6.3    Financial Performance.     The financial position of the four project ports improved
substantially during the project period, with the exception of Guaymas where there was a reduction
in the traffic after 1992, as reflected in the 1993 financial results. In the ports of Manzanillo,
Tampico-Altamira, and Veracruz the revenues improved, particularly in the port of Veracruz.
6.4    A summary of the financial position of the ports of Guaymas, Manzanillo, Tampico-
Altarnira and Veracruz for the years 1990 to 1993 is given in Table 6, and the details of the revenues
and expenditures are in Table 7. There is a clear pattern over the project period of increasing
revenues which increased 284% over the 3-year period 1991-1993 whereas operating expenditures
went up by 26% thus leading to an improvement in the operating ratio from .91 to .84. The
corresponding improvement in Manzanillo was from 0.97 in 1990 to 0.85 in 1993, and in Tampico-
Altamira from 0.97 in 1990 to 0.85 in 1993.
6.5    Economic Re-evaluation. Traffic growth averaged about 6.5% p.a. in the project ports
compared to about 4.5% forecast at appraisal. With the substantial increases in traffic and
productivity at the four project ports, the re-evaluated economic rates of returns (ERR) for the ports,
except for the Guyamas port, are slightly higher than the appraisal estimates as shown below. The
overall return for the four ports is 29% compared to 22% at appraisal. No ERR has been estimated
for the purchase of dredging equipment since the dredging service was privatized in 1993 and it
' Including cabotage



-7 -
for the purchase of dredging equipment since the dredging service was privatized in 1993 and it
would be unrealistic to forecast the retums to the private operator. Also, Government is in the
process of concessioning both container and general cargo handling at the project ports, which is
expected to lead to more efficient operation and, possibly, even higher retums than those evaluated.
6.6    . The main benefits used in the re-evaluation include the savings arising from less costly
handling of existing and future traffic and the additional income from increased traffic which could
not have been handled at the ports in the 'without"project case. This was essentially the assumption
upon which the appraisal economic evaluation had been based. On the institutional side, the re-
organization of the ports sector management to consolidate it in the PUERTOMEX made a positive
contribution to coordinating ports sector planning, policy formulation and regulation. These benefits
have not, as was the case at appraisal, been quantified in the re-evaluation.

VII.   Sustainability
7.01   Although this project was implemented during a difficult period of considerable economic
adjustment, the essential components of the project were all implemented, and within the time
schedule foreseen at appraisal. The project witnessed the maturing of the institutional set-up of the
ports sector and the rehabilitation of the subject ports was significant and important. This will
enable over time the realization and maintenance of the benefits of the project. The work is expected
to continue in the follow-up project currently under preparation.
VIII. Bank Performance
8.1    The Bank spent 88 staff weeks to prepare and appraise this project, including 216 person-
days in the field (Tables 9 and 10). A total of 105 staff weeks was spent on supervision, including
252 person-days in the field. This was, therefore, a carefully prepared project which was well-
monitored during its implementation.  As a result the project was completed on time, port
productivity improved, and there was significant improvement in the finances of the ports. Perhaps
the main challenge to the Bank was the evolving institutional set-up of the port sector in Mexico, the
formation of PUERTOMEX (in 1989), and the setting up of the independent Administraciones
Portuarias Integrales (API).
IX. Borrower Performance
9.1    This project was implemented by a Borrower whose organizational set-up was in a
continuous state of change during the period of implementation of the project. At the time of
appraisal of this project, several agencies dealt with the affairs of the ports in Mexico. In 1989, with
the creation of PUERTOMEX, this organization assumed the functions of the CNCP, DGP, DGOM
and SEDRA which actually ceased to exist. PUERTOMEX was charged with the function of
planning, programming and implementation of all marine and port works, and also the
administration, operation and control of the ports in coordination with the 'Empresas de Servicios
Portuarios"(ESPs). The intention was to entrust maximum responsibility for operations to the ESPs
while retaining the definition of policy planning etc. at the central level of PUERTOMEX. Once the
process was well under way and the objectives of creating PUERTOMEX were met, the Government
ordered the dissolution of PUERTOMEX in 1992 and started the process of creation of the
independent APIs . The APIs are really entities charged with the objective of decentralization of
decisions pertaining to the principal ports. This process was completed in August 1994. At the
same time, for taking care of the regulatory and policy matters pertaining to the ports and marine
matters the Coordinaci6n General de Puertos y Marina Mercante (CGPM) was created and within
this set up the Direcci6n General de Puertos (DGP) was entrusted with the regulation and monitoring
of port affairs.
9.2    Although the Loan was approved by the Board in May 1988, hardly anything happened in
1988 or the greater part of 1989 till PUERTOMEX was formed and started coordinating the project.
It was under the direction of PUERTOMEX that the civil works designs and contracting was done
as also the coordination for the assessment and review of the port equipment done in the years 1990,
1991 and 1992, and the improvement of the container terminals in Manzanillo and Veracruz (paras
5.1 and 6.1). The Borrower in his report has complained, emphatically, in respect of the delays
caused in the delivery of the Ansaldo Cranes which were ordered on the insistence of the World Bank
and against the definitive recommendation of PUERTOMEX. The World Bank's position rested on



- 9 -
the Ansaldo offer being the lowest; no alternative was possible under the Bank's Procurement
Guidelines.
X.    Project Relationships
10.1   Bank relationships with the Government and various agencies dealing with the
implementation of the project were generally satisfactory. The procurement process was in general
properly executed, although there was disagreement between the Bank and the Borrower (para 9.2)
which appears to indicate the need for some flexibility on the part of the Bank in procurement
matters and perhaps the need for improved communication in controversial matters.
Xi.    Consulting Services
11.1   A list of the studies conducted during this project is attached in Table 11. Particular
reference needs to be made of the importance of the National Dredging Study (June 1988 to March
1989), the techno-economic studies for the acquisition of container equipment (1991), modernization
of the system for recovery of port charges, the Study for Optimization of Dredging Operations and
the Strategy for the Privatization of Port Services. These studies helped provide the data useful for
the continued improvement of the efficiency and the effectiveness of the ports sector in Mexico.
XII.   Proiect Documentation and Data
12.1   The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) was the basis for framing the legal documents, and
provided the take-off point for the terms of reference for consulting services and for the supervision
of the civil works and the procurement. Given the eventual duration of the project (more than six
years), the changes in the Bank's supervision teams, changes in the Government and the Borrower's
management, the SAR also provided a frame of reference concerning the project origins, and for
alterations/amendments to the project content, which ensured that the basic objectives of the project
were maintained.
12.2   Periodic reports from the borrower were received regularly although often with delays. The
Borrower sent a brief 'Informe de Terminacion de Proyecto" (Project Completion Report) in August
1994 which is enclosed as Part 11 of this report. At the request of the Bank, the Borrower sent, in
October 1994, a report on the financial performance of the four ports of Guaymas, Manzanillo.
Tampico-Altamira and Veracruz, and in November 1994, some economic data which formed the
basis of the review of the Financial Performance (paras 6.4 to 6.6) and the Economic Re-evaluation
of the project (paras 6.6 to 6.8).

PART II
PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    INSTITUTION BUILDING
In view of the multitude of entities responsible for port-related matters at the time of project
preparation in 1987, one of the project's recommendations was to strengthen certain agencies in order
to avoid the duplication of responsibilities.
In March 1989 an independent entity was created within the Secretariat of Communications and
Transport, viz. PUERTOMEX, to take over the functions of the following Government agencies: the
Comision Nacional Coordinadora de Puertos - CNCP, the Direcci6n General de Puertos DGP
(fonnerly the Direcci6n General de Operaci6n y Desarrollo Portuario - DGODP), the Direcci6n
General de Obras Maritimas - DGOM and the Servicio de Dragado - SEDRA, all of which ceased to
exist as of that date.
PUERTOMEX assumed responsibility for the planning, programming and execution of maritime and
port works and also the administration, operation and control of ports, in coordination with the
Empresas de Servicios Portuarios - ESPs.
In September 1992 it was decided that, since PUERTOMEX had served the purpose for which it had
been created, it should be disbanded. The process then began of creating the Administraciones
Portuarias Integrales, APIs, i.e. commercial enterprises that were to manage the ports on an
autonomouis basis, the ultimate aim being to establish decentralized decision-making on port-related
matters. This process was completed in August 1994.
At the same time, the Coordinaci6n General de Puertos y Marina Mercante was established as the port
and maritime regulatory agency, within which the Direcci6n General de Puertos was formed to assume
responsibility for regulating and supervising port matters.
The aim was thus to give ports autonomy and enable them to participate in the port investments and
operations of the private and social sectors.



- 11 -
2.  ESTIMATED PROJECT COSTS AT APPRAISAL COMPARED TO ACTUAL
COSTS
There were considerable differences in the actual costs of the port works compared to estimates. They
were 43.5% higher in terms of total costs, 45.5% higher in terms of local costs and 41.8% higher in
terms of external costs.
These variations were attributable to the fact that when Puertos Mexicanos was formed, changes were
made in the objectives and programs for the port sector, including the decision to build and equip four
container terminals in Altamira, Veracruz, Manzanillo and Lazaro Cardenas in order to respond to the
growing demand for container traffic.
More than variations in the estimated costs, since contingencies only accounted for 8% compared to
the 19% of the cost originally budgeted for, what occurred was rather a redistribution of investment
priorities in the project ports, with cuts being made in some and increases in others; as a result, it is felt
that, with the changes, the original objectives have been more than accomplished.
It should be pointed out that rehabilitation of the dredgers declined in 1993 because the fleet was sold
to the private sector at the Bank's recommendation.
The operating goals were not met, this being partly due to the fact that the shipyards where the
dredgers were rehabilitated took too long to do the repairs, which meant that less operating time was
available.
3.  ORGANIZATION FOR PROJECT EXECUTION AND REASONS FOR DELAYS
As mentioned earlier, responsibility for organizing project execution was divided among several
different departments. The Direcci6n General de Obras Maritimas was responsible for the execution of
the civil works; the Empresas de Servicios Portuarios of Manzanillo and Guaymas, the Tampico-
Altamira Port System and the Direcci6n General de Operaci6n y Desarrollo Portuario were responsible
for procuring port equipment, and the Servicio de Dragado (Dredging Service) was in charge of
everything related to dredging equipment. There was, however, no department within the Secretariat
of Communications and Transport responsible for coordinating project implementation.
This lack of coordination resulted in virtually no progress being made on the project in 1988 and 1989.
With the creation of Puertos Mexicanos in March 1989 responsibility for coordinating the project was
assigned to this decentralized entity, which proceeded to revise it and to reschedule the various
activities for the construction and rehabilitation of port infrastructure and for the procurement of
equipment.
Under the coordination and responsibility of Puertos Mexicanos, preparations were made during 1989
for the engineering plans for the civil works and for the procurement of the equipment, with
implementation of these plans taking place during 1990, 1991 and 1992. Because of the restructuring



- 12 -
of the port sector, the loan proceeds had not yet been used in 1993 and the works were completed with
local funds, the use of loan funds being limited to paying for debts predating the procurement of
equipment.
Attention must be drawn to the delay that occurred in the manufacture of the four gantry yard cranes,
the two assigned to Lazaro Cardenas being delivered 18 months late and the two for Altamira 21
months late, with all the economic and financial repercussions that this entailed for Mexico.
The reason for the delay was the technical and administrative incompetence of Ansaldo Industria, the
manufacturing company, to which the contract had been awarded on the World Bank's
recommendation, despite the arguments presented by Puertos Mexicanos against selecting that
company.
The problem occurred when the World Bank, in 1990, thought that Puertos Mexicanos had not
complied with the two-step international bidding procedure, which prompted Ansaldo to complain and
resulted in the competition being declared null and void.
PUERTOMEX was obliged to organize another international bidding competition linited to the
participation, by invitation, of those who had competed in the earlier competition.
This time the lowest bid was that of Ansaldo, to whom Puertos Mexicanos had no choice but to award
the contract on December 20, 1990, despite its opposition, as previously mentioned.
4.    AVAILABILITY   OF  COUNTERPART  FUNDS  AND   OTIIER   FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT FUNDS
From 1990 onwards the project had no problems with the allocation of local funds, either as regards
the counterpart loan funds or the supplementary civil works undertaken in the project ports, since
PUERTOMEX had had the foresight to program them into its annual budgets.
As for the other Government funds, these were made available in a timely fashion in the form of both
local funds and the proceeds of loans from other countries.
Financing for the gantry yard cranes allocated to the Port of Veracruz was obtained from Bardella, the
supplier, under the Brazil-Mexico Agreement, while those allocated to the Port of Manzanillo were
financed by the Line of Credit from the King of Spain. Both loans were used without any problem.
Sufficient fuiids were made available to the project to cover the contractual commitments, which were
43.5% higher than estimated in the project appraisal studies.



- 13 -
5.    FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE PORTS DURING AND FOLLOWING PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION.
The financial position of the project ports during project implementation improved as their facilities
were rehabilitated and their equipment was procured, with the exception of Guaymas, which
experienced a reduction in cargo volume from 1992 onwards, reflected in its financial performance.
In the other three ports, revenues from port dues and cargo handling increased considerably during the
period, especially in the Port of Veracruz, and since costs did not increase proportionately, they
achieved good financial results.
The Servicios Portuarios of the Port of Veracruz (SERPOVER) company was liquidated in July 1991
and Puertos Mexicanos was put in charge of managing the port thereafter.
The Servicios Portuarios of the Ports of Guaymas and Manzanillo declined to use some of the loan
funds allocated to them and decided to procure their equipment with their own resources.
Some of these funds were used by Puertos Mexicanos, and US$3.8 million was canceled because of
the liquidation of this decentralized entity.
The financial position of these ports may have deteriorated a little since project implementation,
particularly in terms of operating ratios, because of the inclusion of depreciation of the new container
terminals and their gantry cranes, for both wharf and yard.
6.    LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
We feel that the following main lessons can be learned from the implementation of this project:
That the components to be financed by the loan proceeds need to be identified as precisely as
possible during project preparation.
*     That an administrative unit needs to be set up to coordinate the activities of other departments
involved in the loan and to assume responsibility for conducting all business with the World Bank.
*     That the World Bank should, in special cases, be more flexible in the application of the rules
and conditions established in its regulations in order to avoid situations like the one that occurred with
the Ansaldo company.
*     While requests for World Bank approval were generally answered in a timely fashion, there
were some long delays. The response time therefore needs to be as short as possible.
*     That when counterpart funds and funds for supplementary works are assured, the project
objectives can easily be met and even exceeded.



- 14 -
*     Finally, that the good relationships maintained with the World Bank staff in charge of the
Project were key to its successful implementation.
