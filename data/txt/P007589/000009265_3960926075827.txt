MEMORANDUM AND RECOtMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE BANCO NACIONAL DE OBRAS Y SERVICIOS PUBLICOS
GUARANTEED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF
THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A PORTS REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed Loan to the Banco Nacional de
Obras y Servicios (BANOBRAS) for US$ 50 million equivalent for a Ports
Rehabilitation Project to be executed by the Secretariat of Communications
and Transport (SCT) is submitted for approval. This pToposed Loan would be
repaid over 15 years, including 3 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable Interest rate.
2.        Background:  Mexico is currently making efforts to increase and
diversify its non-petroleum foreign trade. To this end, the Bank has
approved a Second Export Development Loan (Loan 2745-ME), a Second Trade
Policy Loan (Loan 2882-ME) and, very recently, loans to help restructure the
fertilizer (Loan 2919-ME) and steel industries (Loan 2916-ME). Port
efficiency is an important element in Government efforts to stimulate trade.
The Mexican port system contains some 13 ports which handle international
trade. Though the theoretical capacity of these ports is sufficient to
handle the traffic expected in the coming years, effective capacity in the
main port? has been depleted as many facilities are in disrepair and
specialized equipment for handling containers or bulk traffic like grain or
minerals is inadequate. Port operations are carried out by financially
autonomous companies owned by the Government and Unions in different
proportions for each port. Overall, responsibility for port administration
and ownership of the installations are the Government's. Investments are
firanced by Government's development budget but have not always been based on
economic criteria, and cost recovery has been deficient. Recent Government
strategy in the sector is to consolidate and strengthen the central planning
function on the one hand and to decentralize responsibility for port
operations, on the other. Consistent with this, all transport modes have
been brought together under one ministry (SCT). The Government has also
started to adjust port pricing for greater investment cost recovery by
linking ship dues to the dollar exchange rate. It also intends to improve
port productivity through the establishmernt of targets and action plans.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would
complement Bank efforts directed at stimulating Mexican foreign trade by
rationalizing investment decision-making and reducing transport cost. The
Bank has played an active role in developing a transport strategy and pricing
policy which would progressively reduce Government subsidies to the highway
and railway subsectors. In the ports subsector the last two port projects,
(Loan 1964-ME of May 6, 1981, and Loan 2450-ME of September 21, 1984) though
limited in scope, have helped to establish a basis for rationalizing the
system of port administration and the pricing of port services. Continued
Bank involvement would help improve investment planning, operational
efficiency and cost recovery policies, and reduce the level of regulation in
the sector which, in turn, should reduce constraints to the growth of trade.



-2-
4.        Project Objectives:  The project objectives are to:  (a) improve
port efficiency through the rehabilitation and improvement of port
operations, infrastructure, and equipment; (b) improve equipment management
and maintenance; (c) assist in the improvement of the efficiency of dredging
operations; (d) strengthen port investment planning and financial management,
and (e) progressively reduce subsidies.
5.        Project Description.  In order to attain the above objectiits in
the principal ports, the proposed project would finance specific investments
in 1988-1994, primarlly in the rehabilitation of port infrastructure and
equipment in the four ports of Guaymas, Tampico-Altamira, Mansanillo and
Veracruz which handle about 70% of non-petroleum sea-borne foreign trade (30%
of total costs). It would also help finwnce the acquisition of specialized
equipment for containers and bulk grain equipment, spare parts, and technical
assistance to make the recently formed Dredging Unit (SEDRA) more efficient
and less costly (67%), and provide technical assistance to the SCT with
regards to investment planning, organization and studies in the
port-subsector (3%). The environment impact of the project Is expected to be
minor but the project would finance the necessary studies. Implementation of
the civil works will be by DGOM. Port operating equipment and parts will be
acquired by the port operating companies of Guaymas and Manzanillo, and by
the Sistema Portuario Tampico-Altamira (SPTA). For Veracruz, port equipment
will be acquired by CNCP and dredging equipment by SEDRA.  SCr has designated
CNCP to be responsible for coordination, monitoring and reporting progress.
CNCP has already appointed a project coordinator with the necessary staff for
this purpose. The estimated total cost of the project is US$ 90.2 million
equivalent, including US$ 22.3 million equivalent in taxes, with a foreign
exchange component of US$ 50 million (55%). Retroactive financing of
payments made after appraisal (December 1986) would not exceed US$5 million.
Costs and financing plans are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement and the disbursement schedule are in Schedule
B. The timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map showing
the location of the proposed project is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report
No. 6743-ME, dated April 25, 1988, is being distributed separately.
6.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with
BANOBRAS and the Government on the following: (a) continued consolidation of
planning in the federal ports system in one federal Port Planning Bureau; (b)
scope and timing of consulting services for improving equipment maintenance,
scrapping and acquisition programs for each of the project ports over the
period to December 31, 1992; (c) Action Plans for ports and SEDRA covering
financial and operational targets, and annual review of progress with the
Bank; (d) the carrying out of cost studies to indicate appropriate levels of
port dues and tariffs by November 30, 1989; (e) cost and tariff adjustments
to attain Action Plan targets; (f) establishment of consolidated financial
reports by CNCP with help from each of the port development and operating
organizations; (g) the preparation by June 30, 1989 of a program of actions
to give greater control by SPTA over operational contractors; (h) annual
review with the Bank of the overall port investment program and use of agreed



-3-
evaluation methodology for port investments; (i) that Bank agreement will be
required for additional investment in the project ports; and (j) that
investment in the project ports would be in accordance with an agreed
schedule and corresponding Government budgetary provisions.   A condition of
effectiveness would be the signing of at least two of the subsidiary
agreements between the Government and the executing agencies for the
individual ports. Conditions of disbursement will be as follows: (a) for
Veracruz; the signing of a program-contract, satisfactory to the Bank,
between the port operating company and SCT for the purpose of implementing
the action plan for tlat port; (b) for the other ports, the signing of a
subsidiary loan agreement (covering transfer of funds and action plan
targets) with the respective port operating agency.
7.        Benefits and Risks:  The proposed project yields an estimated
economic rate of return of 22% based on conservative assumptions about
traffic growth and productivity increases. Relatively small investments in
rehabilitation and equipment and improvements in port organization and
operations wlll reduce cargo handling costs and ship turn-around time, thus
facilitating Mexico's international trade. The main risk concerns the
possible failure by the Government to allocate sufficient budgetary funds on
a timely basis because of the need to curtail public sector spending to
achieve macroeconomic policy targets. However, this risk is small since the
items included in the project constitute the essential core of the sector
investment program which will be kept under close review in the context of
our overall relationship with Mexico. Future progress on institutional
changes and policy issues such as increased port charges, may face political
resistance. However, actions already taken by the Government have confirmed
its commitment to such reforms. Another risk is that dispersion of authority
in Veracruz may delay project implementation. This has been addressed by
making the disbursement of funds for Veracruz contingent on the signing of a
program-contract, between the port operating company and SCT.
8.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
