F. Results Framework Analysis


Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The global environment objective was to increase the ecological security of globally
significant biological resources, especially within threatened tropical moist forest
ecosystems. Specific objectives were to: (i) protect a significant portion of forest
biodiversity through implementing an ecosystem approach to management within the
high forest zone that involves strengthening management of national parks and taking
selected high-biodiversity forest reserves out of production; (ii) improve knowledge of
the distribution and status of rare, threatened and endemic species through targeted
surveys to better focus conservation measures; (iii) enhance biodiversity protection
within multiple-use production forests through exclusion of critical habitats from logging;
and, (iv) ensure sustainability and preserve genetic diversity of non-timber forest species
that are collected by rural populations for medicinal and consumptive uses, by improved
data collection, monitoring, harvest regulation, and sustainable management within forest
reserves and/or at currently deforested areas at the forest margins.

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives and Design (this section is
  descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative):

1.1     Context at Appraisal (brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank
  assistance):

  Country and Sector Background: Ghana comprises two broad ecological zones: the high forest and the
  savanna. The high forest zone covers roughly one third of the country and supports two thirds of the
  population. Most of the country's economic activities (cocoa, oil palm, rubber, timber and mining) are
  concentrated in this zone. At the turn of the century, the area of high forest was 8.2 million ha, by 1998 this
  had been reduced to about 1.7million ha, of which 1.64 million ha was within the 216 forest reserves
  gazetted in the 1930s. Since then, almost all off-reserve forest had been clear-felled under a deliberate
  policy to open up farm land. It was not until 1994 that this policy was reversed and controls were put in
  place to extend harvesting of the small remaining off-reserve resource over a longer period. Within the
  reserves, about 0.4 million ha were degraded (mainly by bushfires) and in need of replanting, 0.35 million
  ha were classified as needing permanent protection (hill and swamp sanctuaries, biodiversity, etc.), and the
  remaining 0.9 million ha were classified suitable for timber production. Based on forest inventories, the
  estimated sustainable annual allowable cut (AAC) from the high forest was 1.0 million m3 of round logs for
  the wood processing industry, with half coming from reserve forests and half from scattered trees on
  farmland, off-reserve.

  The key natural resource management issues in Ghana were land and forest degradation and the loss of
  biodiversity associated with unsustainable harvesting levels, in the high forest and the savanna zones, and
  with inappropriate farming practices. In the high forest, where the problem was more easily quantifiable,
  the logging rate was unsustainable, and the commercial existence of several tree species was under severe
  threat. The main underlying problems included: (i) a forest royalty system that did not price trees at their
  real economic value; (ii) ineffective sectoral institutions with overlapping responsibilities; (iii) insufficient
  involvement of communities who owned the trees and woodlands in the management of the resource; (iv)
  weak institutional capacity in the wildlife sector and little involvement of communities in the management
  and sustainable use of the wildlife resource; and (v) weak inter-agency coordination in planning and
  monitoring natural resource use, particularly at the regional and district levels.

  In Ghana all forest and savanna woodland reserves are owned by the local communities and traditional
  authorities, and government's role was to manage these resources in trust for the people. This situation was
  reflected in Government's natural resource policy embodied in the Forestry and Wildlife Policy and the
  Forest Development Master Plan (1996-2000). This policy aimed to: (i) ensure a sustained and adequate
  supply of forest and woodland products; (ii) prevent further environmental degradation due to forest
  depletion and inappropriate farming practices; and (iii) stimulate community involvement in the
  management of the resources and enhance the economic well-being of rural residents.

  Other strategies included the National Biodiversity Strategy and the Forest Protection Strategy. These
  strategies sought to: (i) safeguard genetic and indigenous species diversity through an ecosystem approach;
  (ii) improve knowledge of the distribution and status of rare, threatened and endemic species through
  targeted surveys; (iii) enhance the protection of critical areas for migratory species through improved
  monitoring and habitat management; and (iv) ensure sustainability and preserve genetic diversity within
  timber and non-timber forest species through data collection, regulation of harvesting, and proactive
  management for sustainable production within forest reserves.

  Rationale for Bank assistance: The GEF-supported High Forest Biodiversity Conservation Project (the
  project) was fully blended with the Natural Resource Management Program (NRMP), which was originally
  planned as a ten-year multi-donor financed investment lending. Phase I of NRMP (NRMP-1) aimed at


                                                                 1

assisting the Government of Ghana (GOG) to implement its policy of protecting, rehabilitating and
sustainably managing national land, forest and wildlife resources by: (i) institutionalizing viable sustainable
land, forest and wildlife management systems nationwide; and (ii) establishing effective national policy and
institutional framework and developing collaborative natural resource management systems. The NRMP I
closed in June 2003, without the planned Phase II becoming effective. However, the GEF agreed that its
funded Component 5 of the NRMP should continue as a project on its own. This resulted in the High Forest
Biodiversity Conservation Project (HFBCP). The project complemented NRMP-1 by aiming to establish
effective systems for the protection of 30 globally significant biodiversity areas (GSBAs) in all tropical forest
biomes in Ghana in four regions within the High Forest Zone, namely; Ashanti, Eastern, Central and Western
regions. The project focused on communities living at the periphery of these GSBAs.

The project was consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)1 for Ghana (dated August 13,
1997). One of the aims of the CAS was to promote environmentally sustainable, social and economic
development through capacity building within communities to encourage environmental protection and
sustainable natural resource management; and also contribute to rural poverty.

The project aimed to build and expand on advances made in natural resource management under Forest
Resource Management Project (FRMP) and Environmental Resource Management Project (ERMP) and on
pilot experience gained under Forestry Investment Management Project (FIMP) and the Forest Sector
Development Project (FSDP), both financed by Department for International Development (DFID). A
considerable number of bilateral and multilateral donors were involved or interested in financing activities
within the sector. Leadership by the Bank would encourage adoption of necessary structural reforms to
improve sectoral performance overall through a multi-donor financed sector investment program. Ministry of
Lands, Forestry, and Mining (MLFM) strongly supported this coordinated approach by donors.

1.2 Original Global Environmental Objectives (GEO)and Key Indicators [as approved]:

Global Environment Objective. The global environment objective was to increase the ecological security of
globally significant biological resources, especially within threatened tropical moist forest ecosystems.
Specific objectives were to: (i) protect a significant portion of forest biodiversity through implementing an
ecosystem approach to management within the high forest zone that involves strengthening management of
national parks and taking selected high-biodiversity forest reserves out of production; (ii) improve knowledge
of the distribution and status of rare, threatened and endemic species through targeted surveys to better focus
conservation measures; (iii) enhance biodiversity protection within multiple-use production forests through
exclusion of critical habitats from logging; and, (iv) ensure sustainability and preserve genetic diversity of
non-timber forest species that are collected by rural populations for medicinal and consumptive uses, by
improved data collection, monitoring, harvest regulation, and sustainable management within forest reserves
and/or at currently deforested areas at the forest margins.

Key Indicators: See Section 2.3 (M&E Design)

1.3 Revised PDO (GEO) (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification:

The objective was not revised.

1.4   Main Beneficiaries (original and revised; briefly describe the "the primary target group" identified in
the PAD and as captured in the PDO/GEO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to
benefit from the project):

·     Community-Based Groups: Traditional authorities, women's groups, and farmers: The project would
      provide alternative livelihood support to many community members through the Community
      Investment Fund (CIF) also referred to as the Alternative Livelihood Fund (ALIF). Some community
      members were expected to earn additional incomes through boundary cleaning, anti-poaching, and
      patrolling against fire whilst enhancing their understanding of the importance of natural resources
      management and biodiversity conservation.

·     Government institutions: The Ministries of Lands, Forestry, and Mines (MLFM) and Food and
      Agriculture (MOFA), Forestry Commission (FC) especially Forestry Services Division (FSD) and
      Wildlife Division (WD), and District Assemblies (DAs) were to receive capacity building to establish a
      robust result-based M&E system and collaborative resource management, and logistical support in the
      form of vehicles, office equipment, and computers and accessories.

·     Private Institutions: Apex Bank and Rural and Community Banks: By disbursing CIF funds, the project
      would contribute to increasing the capital base and client base of these banks and help them improve on
      their micro-credit and client management skills and knowledge, and monitoring and evaluation.

·     Research Institutes and Academia: The project envisioned working with institutions such as Kwame
      Nkrumah University of Science & Technology (KNUST), Forest Research Institute of Ghana (FORIG),
      and the University of Ghana. By their close collaboration, the project would benefit them indirectly by
      providing them with adequate financial resources to strengthen their research capacity.

·     School clubs: Students participating in school clubs would be introduced to the importance of
      biodiversity conservation. The project would educate them and build awareness on the importance of
      biodiversity protection at the community and district levels.

1.5   Original Components (as approved):

The project consisted of five components as follows:

Component 1: GSBA Site Preparation and Development of Management Plans. Analysis of global
priorities for conservation of botanical diversity in Ghanaian forests had identified, within the existing forest
reserve system, a potential network of thirty reserves which were proposed for either full (11) or partial (19)
protection to provide global security for floristic diversity. The total area of these reserves represented
approximately 400,000 ha or 25 percent of the existing forest reserve system that would be included in the
conservation program. Of this total, approximately 130,000 ha would be permanently excluded from logging
exploitation or other consumptive harvesting. These areas included both the finest remaining examples of
"pristine" or "old growth" forests as well as some of the last surviving remnants of forest formations that were
extremely rare in Ghana and elsewhere in the sub-region.



                                                              3

Through a systematic process of participatory, strategic and operational planning, the project would develop
integrated management plans for the GSBAs to be implemented under a collaborative management program
with local communities. Specific project financed activities would include: mapping, delineation and
demarcation of GSBAs; establishment of a community-based monitoring program for key indicators; support
for development of community based enterprises with direct linkage to biodiversity conservation objectives;
and integration of biodiversity conservation with the general FD initiative for collaborative management of
forest resources both on and off reserve. The baseline studies would be completed and 25 percent of the
proposed GSBAs demarcated in the first two years of the program, corresponding to NRMP-I.

Component 2: Baseline Surveys, Applied Research and Monitoring. The project would finance
applications-oriented research in support of the objectives of sustainable conservation and locally based
management. The project would draw on completed work such as the recommendations on forest protection
in Ghana from the National Forest Inventory, emerging priorities from ongoing work such as the Important
Bird Areas surveys, and studies to be commissioned under the project such as a national assessment of
primate conservation priorities and options.

Component 3: Identification and Establishment of Provenance Reserves. For identification of GSBAs,
the project would seek to extend conservation more effectively into the domain of the production forest
reserves which represents some one million ha, or about 60 percent of the reserved forest estate. By extending
the botanical and zoological surveys into this domain the project will identify critical natural habitats for
fauna and important sites for preservation of genetic diversity in tree stocks and other flora.

Component 4: Alternative Livelihood Investments. The project would establish a revolving facility to
finance income generating small scale enterprises and invest in alternative livelihood projects that would: (i)
improve the economic status of the communities living around the GSBAs and encourage them to participate
in the program and forgo income previously generated from the newly designated GSBAs; and (ii) relieve
pressure on biological resources by supporting alternative development options. Investment in plantation
development, whereby communities who forego income from harvesting rights in GSBAs would be
compensated with shareholdings in new plantation developments off-reserve would be strongly supported

Component 5: National Capacity Building. An explicit aim of the project was to involve national NGOs,
CBOs, academic and research institutions in implementation to build country capacity for collaborative
resource management with maximum involvement of local communities in planning, implementation and
monitoring activities. This component would emphasize the empowerment of local communities to play a
lead role in reserve management. To this end the project would finance decentralization of management to
district and community levels and grassroots public awareness activities under the wildlife component as well
as specific site enhancement activities such as fire break establishment, border clearing and enrichment
planting as pilots in five reserves during NRMP I.

1.6   Revised Components:

During the extension of the project in 2004, it was agreed that activities in the PA peripheries needed to be
intensified to enhance off-reserve landscape management and this led to the project placing emphasis on
targeting areas lying within 5km. radius from the boundaries of the GSBAs. This was meant to ensure a
holistic approach to the whole issue of PA management to include landscape management that ultimately
secures the integrity of the GSBAs in the long-term.          This refocusing however did not constitute a
restructuring.




                                                              4

1.7    Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and
funding allocations):

While there were no changes in the project's design, scope and scale, there were changes in the project's
schedule, implementation arrangements, and funding allocation as mentioned below:

Project Schedule. The schedule of the project was revised twice. The closing date of the project was extended
first by 18 months from September 30, 2004 to June 20, 2006, so as to complete all outstanding activities,
with the aim of achieving the project's objectives and to impact positively on beneficiaries. It was extended
for a second time for 12 months to June 20, 2007, in order to complete some ongoing critical activities such
as Community Investment Fund, Ecotourism and Off-Reserve Landscape Management.

Implementing Arrangements. Initially, the project was coordinated from the Forestry Commission secretariat
with the Project Coordinator directly under the supervision of the Chief Executive of the Commission.
However, in 2004, a new Project Team Leader was appointed under the direct supervision of the Executive
Director of Forest Services Division (FSD), which is one of the three divisions under the Forestry
Commission. Under the new management, the implementation of project activities was mainstreamed into the
activities of the Regional and District Forest Service Division offices and implementation of field activities
were decentralized to the District Managers and Range Supervisors. Resources (human and financial) were
deployed to the field level to ensure effective project implementation and supervision. This change helped in
speeding up the project implementation and to ensure mainstreaming of project activities and long term
sustainability. For further details, see Section 2.2 (Institutional and implementation constraints).

Funding Allocations. During implementation, the Grant Agreement amount of $8.7 million was revised three
times to reallocate funds among expenditure categories. The reallocations are shown in the table below.

The reasons for the first reallocation of funds in September 2004 were as follows: (i) Civil Works: The funds
originally allocated under this category were reduced due to the fact that most of the scheduled activities
under this category had been completed at a lower cost than originally estimated. (ii) Goods and Equipment:
In order to sustain the enthusiasm and active participation of communities in biodiversity conservation, a
number of community-based interventions had been identified. These new interventions required additional
resources and hence the need to increase the budget under this category. (iii) Consultancy, Workshops and
Training: In addition to the ALIF, it was proposed that GSBA fringe communities would be supported in
other livelihood activities such as fruit tree crop production and agro-based initiatives. This would require
additional funds for community sensitization, organization of training workshops, consultancy and
NGO/Community contracts to design the modalities for implementation.

The second reallocation, in May 2006, was done for the following reasons: (i) Civil Works: Due to the
extension of the project, it was decided that the demarcation and pillaring of the 42 PPAs could be done and
this required reallocation (ii) Goods and Equipment: The project had financed most of the planned goods


                                                                5

and equipment that were needed to support the execution of project activities, and sustain the enthusiasm and
active participation of communities in biodiversity conservation. Therefore funds could be released for
reallocation to other categories to finance outstanding activities during the extension period like the 42 PPAs.
(iii) Consultancy, Workshops and Training: In addition to the ALIF, it was proposed that the project would
continue to provide support to GSBA fringe communities in other livelihood activities such as fruit tree crop
production and agro-based initiatives. This required additional funds for community sensitization,
organization of training workshops, consultancy and NGO/Community contracts to implement identified
activities. (iv) ALIF: The increase in the proposed new budget for the ALIF was to support business
activities. (v) Operating Costs: Additional resources were needed to support the implementation of project
activities, track progress and evaluate impact. Some funds under Category 2 were moved to Category 5.

The reasons for the third reallocation in June 2007 were as follows: (i) Civil Works: As a result of price
fluctuations over the years on the domestic market, cost of eligible expenses rose by the time certain activities
such as demarcations were approved and commissioned. This had caused an overrun of the budget under this
category. (ii) Goods and Equipment: The funds originally allocated under this category were not adequate to
cover the expenses, which resulted in over-spending. In order to cover the additional expenses, funds had to
be reallocated from the Training Category (Category 3) (iii) Consultancy, Workshops and Training:
Having completed most activities under this category, part of the remaining funds were reallocated to cover
additional expenses needed in categories 1, 2 and 5. (iv) ALIF: There was no movement of funds in this
Category. (v) Operating Costs: Additional resources were needed to cover the implementation of the
remaining activities. Therefore, funds were reallocated from Category 3 to cover the amount needed.

2.    Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1   Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry (including whether lessons of earlier operations
were taken into account, risks and their mitigation identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as
applicable):

During preparation, the project design took into account lessons learned from previous Bank-assisted projects
in the forestry sector in Ghana. Likewise, the design considered the risk factors and appropriate measures
were adopted to mitigate all major risks identified at appraisal. The project also provided a participatory
framework involving stakeholders and direct beneficiaries in the preparation processes.

Lessons Learned from previous Bank-assisted projects.

Lessons learned from Forest Resource Management Project included the following:

·     natural resource management projects should be envisaged as long-term programs made up of a series
      of projects, or phases with the requisite skill set in implementing Ministries and agencies
·     prior to a major infrastructure development or wide-scale resource management there is need for an
      effective sector policy environment and efficiently operating sector institutions
·     institutional strengthening may imply fundamental change far beyond training programs and provision
      of improved facilities and equipment
·     all stakeholders need to be involved in the planning of resource use, and local communities should
      gain an equitable share of the revenue generated
·     effective monitoring and evaluation systems is an important element in project implementation.




                                                               6

Principal lesson from the Environmental Resource Management Project:

·     Strengthening the capacity of sectoral agencies for environmental management and mainstreaming
      environmental protection should be a standard value of sectoral activity.

Principal Lesson from the Coastal Wetlands Management Project (CWMP)

·     Involvement of the Wildlife Department in project management helped in gaining valuable experience
      in locally-based cooperative management of protected areas. Such experience translates into
      achievement of project goal of safeguarding globally important biodiversity within a management
      regime that recognizes the use and access rights of local residents and seeks to stimulate economic
      growth compatible with acceptable conservation values.

Risks and Risk Mitigation Measures. The table below shows the risks and mitigation measures identified in
the Project Appraisal Document (PAD).

  Adequacy of Participatory Processes. The project was characterized by a strong participatory approach
  from the outset. Project preparation included consultation, collaboration, and information sharing with
  stakeholders and beneficiaries such as cultivators/community groups, intermediary NGOs, academic
  institutions, local governments, and donors. Project preparation included a number of innovative pilots to



                                                                    7

involve communities and specifically targeted stakeholder groups (e.g., rural women, youth groups) in
harvesting and management of non-timber forest resources, maintenance of boundaries and firebreaks and
other revenue-generating enterprises.

Personnel of the Ghana Wildlife Society (GWS) and other agencies were consulted on the definition of
community education and public awareness components financed by the project, the design of research,
monitoring and evaluation procedures, and guidance on implementing community investment components
of the project based on the experience gained under the GEF-financed Coastal Wetlands Management
Project.

Quality of Design.

The GEF-supported HFBCP was a fully blended operation with the multi-year and multi-donor supported
Natural Resource Management Program. The Bank's lending instrument was an Adaptable Program
Lending which provided investment support while GEF financing supported incremental expenditures in
establishing sustainable protected area management systems. The HFBCP which was a component of the
NRMP-1, was affected by the drawbacks of the mother project. For example, the NRMP-1 was considered
to be ambitious and complex, with a very short time frame for preparation. Modalities for the ALIF
component were considered as part of implementation activities and not factored into the design and the
implementation of major policy, institutional and legislative reforms expected to be completed within 2
years. This was an uphill task in a country that was re-introducing democratic principles in national
governance. In addition to other factors, these flaws in the design contributed to implementation delays.

2.2    Implementation (including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status,
and actions taken, as applicable):

The project was not restructured. In its early stages it was at risk status because of the slow pace of
fulfillment of the main loan conditions and implementation of project activities, inadequate and untimely
release of counterpart funding, and lack of trust in communities on the formation of GSBAs despite the
sensitization and consultations made during the preparation and implementation stages. The Bank
conducted a Mid-term Review (MTR) in June 2001, focused on the attainment of the GEO, its relevance,
and the expected project and global outputs, using the key performance indicators as indicated in the PAD
with emphasis on the forestry and wildlife activities. One major outcome of the MTR was the
recommendation to step up and expand PA management activities to the off-reserve landscape. This shift of
emphasis but did not impact on the GEO or require any amendment to the Grant Agreement.

2.3    Factors outside the control of implementation agency

The technical steps in processing regazettement of the selected GSBAs include surveying and pillaring,
demarcation and formulation of legal descriptions. The implementing agency has completed these steps as
in 2006. The legal descriptions have been approved by the Attorney General's Office and the Cabinet. The
final step that remains to be done is for Parliament to declare through law the establishment of these sites as
Globally Significant Biodiversity Areas, a process which is completed with a publication in the Ghana Law
Gazette. This final process of proclamation is beyond the direct control of the implementing agency, i.e. the
Ministry of Lands, Forestry and Mines.

2.4    Factors subject to government control or implementation agency

· Parliamentary Processes: These processes that include approval and ratification by Cabinet and
    Parliament, respectively of policy, institutional and legislative reforms took longer than anticipated.



                                                            8

  These delays affected project effectiveness for about one year since the approvals were part of the pre-
  loan effectiveness conditions and subsequent implementation activities.

· Institutional and Implementation Constraints. In the initial years the project was constrained by
  institutional and implementation arrangements (staffing numbers and quality, collaboration and
  coordination, partnerships and participation, communication flaws, etc.). The procurement process was
  also marked by delays, resulting from cumbersome MLFM's internal administrative approval processes
  and procedures, and delays from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning for providing
  exemptions of customs duty on imported goods and equipment. Barely a year after loan effectiveness
  was obtained, the project lost the services of the procurement officer and a good replacement was
  difficult to find. Therefore, for most part of the project's lifespan there was also no qualified
  procurement officer for the project and this resulted in disturbing disbursement lags.

  Execution of the project activities, however, picked up significantly after suggestions from the Bank in
  December 2003 for a review of the implementation framework/mechanisms. The suggested measures
  included the appointment of a team player as project leader and a core project team of highly dedicated
  professional staff. Also, the Bank's recommendation requested a decentralization of project
  implementation by empowering frontline regional and district forestry offices to be in-charge of the
  execution of project activities. HFBCP activities were mainstreamed into core forestry activities at the
  district forestry level. Besides, MLFM had appointed a qualified procurement officer and financial
  management specialist and these recruitments plus the associated training in procurement and financial
  management helped to improve and shorten considerably the procurement processes. These changes
  proved positive, contributing to the success and gains achieved in several parts of the project in the
  field.

· Lack of Mutual Respect and Understanding. The project implementation was initially fraught with lack
  of mutual respect and understanding between communities fringing the forest reserves and the staff of
  the Forestry Commission (FC). In spite of consultations with communities, some were still hostile to
  the idea of constituting GSBAs due to lack of understanding of their roles and fate regarding the use of
  the resources. To overcome this challenge, the project management helped in forming Community
  Biodiversity Advisory Groups (CBAGs) to assist in promoting public education and awareness, as entry
  point into communities, helping in building trust in the project implementation. The CBAGs through
  training, partnership and sensitization programmes helped to improve their livelihood security;
  improved community voice in decision-making and resource management and alerted communities of
  their rights and responsibilities towards the management and sustainable conservation of natural
  resources.

· Lack of Counterpart Funds. In the first 2-3 years of the project, the GOG could not provide counterpart
  funding on time and in the amounts estimated by the project. The Government had found it difficult to
  meet the expenditure financing requirements under each disbursement category of the GEF Grant
  Agreement. This was mainly because the ratios of financing were tied to project age rather than to
  levels of disbursement. Under this method, GOG's matching fund required for incremental operating
  costs had changed from 10% in 1999 and 2000 to 50% in 2001, and this made it difficult for the GOG
  to come up with timely and adequate counterpart funding, Strict adherence to this financing
  arrangement had slowed down implementation of the components. After the MTR, the Bank increased
  GEF's proportion of the expenditure ratio to 100% for incremental operating costs, and the issue of
  counterpart funding was thus resolved for the rest of the project period.

· Delay in the Development of Appropriate Modalities for the Alternative Livelihood Fund Component,
  had led to implementation delays. The first modality developed was an Endowment Fund. This model



                                                          9

    was however found to be inappropriate for this project. Subsequently, the concept of Revolving Fund
    was developed and implemented as a pilot project within five GSBAs in 2004, and then rolled out to the
    remaining GSBAs in 2006. In addition, it was a challenging task to adequately sensitize community
    members on what the models entailed and required since most of them were not financially literate to
    appreciate the concept of savings, banking services, and micro-credits. Further, the project had given
    more priority to establishing GSBAs, and conducting socio-economic survey and flora and fauna
    surveys, and less priority to CIF.

· The Institutional Reforms at the FC under the NRMP framework also accounted for the delays in
    project implementation. The changes in the FSD including the staff redundancies led to reposting of
    staff and in the process, the project lost staff members who had been trained specifically to assist in the
    project implementation. The frequent changes in the `home' of the Project and its Coordinator also
    affected project performance. Furthermore, the development of the CIF and modalities for
    implementation brought on board additional institutions which needed to understand the project and
    flow with their respective roles. These institutions specifically, the APEX Bank and the participating
    Rural and Community Banks needed to be effectively brought on board. This took some time to be
    completed through workshops and a number of meetings.

2.5 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

M&E Design. Two Project Outcome Indicators were developed at Appraisal to monitor the performance of
the project towards meeting the global environment objective: (i) Integrity of fragile habitats and
ecosystems (GSBAs) secured; and (ii) The stability of threatened and rare species populations. However, no
baseline values were available at the beginning of the project.

The M&E portion of the project was very weak at the design stage. The PAD had indicated that M&E
would be undertaken by the Project Planning and Monitoring and Evaluation Department (PPMED) of the
MLFM. Some of the problems related to M&E in this project were: (i) No baseline studies (matrix of
indicators and levels of monitoring). (ii) No M&E system in place at appraisal. (iii) Technically competent
officers lacked hands-on training in M&E and administrative guidance.

M&E Implementation. In 2004 the project contracted the University of Ghana Business School to develop
a comprehensive electronic tracking system for monitoring and evaluation. The M&E system used the
logical framework with a comprehensive matrix of output indicators (See 1, Annex 10 for details), and
activity-output-impact linkages which provided a conceptual framework for both impact evaluation and
performance monitoring. The framework established a baseline indicator for evaluation and ensured that the
project deliverables were clearly linked to the expected results, and clearly specified impact indicators and
their measurements. A reporting system to monitor implementation of project activity and output
achievements from community levels through to district regional and national levels. Data collection was at
the district and regional levels whilst aggregation using ACCESS software was done at the regional level
and forwarded to the project headquarters.

M&E Utilization. Appropriate data collected by the FC were used for formulating decisions and for
resource allocation in the sector and to guide overall project and sector development. For example, M&E
data were used for finalizing collaborative resource management policy for the country. The M&E system
for the project has now been adopted as the building block of the FC.

2.6    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance (focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable):

There were no safeguard and fiduciary issues related to the implementation of the project. Especially,
during implementation, the project did not encounter any social issues such as displacement, relocation,
resettlement, and land appropriation.

2.7 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase (including transition arrangement to post-completion
operation of investments financed by present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements,
sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable):

(a) Transition arrangements.

Institutional. At the community level, community members have become collaborators in resource
management as they are clearly convinced of the benefits of conservation of natural resources. As a result,
Community Fund Management Committees which are comprised of stakeholders from communities will be
responsible for activities such as boundary cleaning, patrolling, anti-poaching, and anti-lumbering. The
formation of CBAGs has institutionalized the involvement of local communities in natural resources
management. The FC will continue to fund the activities of the CBAGS in order to sustain the enthusiasm
of the communities in resource management. At the district level, District Assemblies will continue to
provide the FC with the same kind of support given during implementation. At the central level, the project
activities have been mainstreamed into the regular operation of the FC itself, which would be adequately
financed from its internally generated funds and budgetary allocation from the treasury.

The next phase will involve the implementation of the GSBA management plans that were developed under
the project. This will be implemented through central government budget support and by donors. With the
assistance of GEF Small Grants Program and other donors, some of the potential GSBAs in the Dry
Marginal Forest ecosystems are being transformed into ecotourism site with active participation of the local
communities.

Financial. The introduction of the CIF is a big incentive to the communities and as a revolving fund, it is
expected that when well managed, the communities will continue to collaborate with the FC in the
management of the natural resources. At the district level, part of the revenue collected by District
Assemblies from the sale of timber and non-timber products will be earmarked for natural resource
management and environmental management. At the central level, the Bank and five other development
partners are currently discussing support to the MLFM through a sector budgetary support facility in
support of the Natural Resource Environmental Governance Program (NREG), a Development Policy Loan
(DPL), which would ensure continuous funding of natural resource activities in specific areas for the next
three (3) years. In addition, under the Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS) the Government has
approved a financial framework that would guarantee the FC a 100% release of approved budget.

Operation and Maintenance Arrangements. The FC will be absorbing most of the costs through internally
generated funds, together with the support from the Central government and the District Assemblies.

Staffing. Generally the quality and quantity of staffing in the Ministry of Lands, Forestry and Mines, the
Forestry Commission in particular and the sector institutions are considered adequate.

Policies. Since 1998, the Government through the NRMP has pursued a number of policy reforms in the
forestry sector. The new focus of these policies is granting greater autonomy in forest management and sharing
of benefits to local land owners and forest fringing communities. The Timber Resource Management Act (Act
547) and the Timber Resource Management Act (Amendment, Act 617) are currently under review and is



                                                             11

aimed at supporting reforms associated with the legality of timber harvesting. The Forestry Development
Master Plan will be reviewed and revised under the proposed NREG/DPL.

Monitoring and Evaluation. A robust M&E system that tracks progress and assessing project impacts on
beneficiaries and the status of the GSBAs is in place for future operation.

Follow-up project by the Bank that might contribute to sustaining benefits, including further monitoring of
the project's operation; discuss the desirability of follow-on projects. Through the Sustainable Land
Management Initiative of TerrAfrica and Sector Budget Support Program under the Natural Resource and
Environment Governance Program (NREG), the government and its Development Partners including the
Bank, are developing a longer term support program for the sector. This program would build on lessons
learned from this and other natural resource projects and also replicate some good practices in off-reserve
landscape management, which are now likely to be the focus of communities as the GSBAs are now wholly
protected. The Bank would be putting more emphasis on engaging communities and land owners in trying
to incorporate conservation practices on their individual agricultural landscapes.

Suggested priority and optimum timing of any future impact evaluation. An impact evaluation is expected to
be done in December 2008 and March 2009. This evaluation is likely to be repeated until the protected area
management issues are incorporated into subsequent DPL operation.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global priorities, and
Bank assistance strategy):

The project objectives are still critical to addressing key environmental problems confronting biodiversity
conservation in Ghana, and also to protect, rehabilitate, and sustainably manage national land, forest, and
wildlife resources within the Upper Guinea forest ecosystem and to sustainably increase the income of rural
communities who own these resources. The project had responded directly to a number of national policies
related to the environment, especially natural resource management, and biodiversity conservation as
stipulated in the National Environment Action Plan, as well as the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy
of Ghana (GPRS-II).

The project is also consistent with Pillar 1 of the 2007 CAS (Report No: 39822) which aims at sustainable
management of natural resources and environment, and priorities include: reforming and building capacity
of key regulatory agencies to help them adapt and fulfill their mandates as subvented agencies.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives (including brief discussion of causal linkages between
outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in Annex 4):

Satisfactory. The project was successful in achieving its objectives. With the inception of the project,
conditions of the forests within the GSBAs located in the four regions within the High Forest Zone;
Ashanti, Eastern, Central and Western regions, have improved as a consequence of the sustainable
management regimes and enforcement of forest protection and resource conservation rules and regulations.
The identification of 30 forest reserves and their exclusion from timber harvesting on the merit of their high
significance as biodiversity-rich areas has led to: (a) improved forest regeneration; (b) reduced illegal tree
felling and group hunting; (c) significant reduction in the drying up of water bodies. It must however be
stated that it takes about 10 years for a canopy closure to take place. (See Table 1, Annex 10 for the Map of
Ghana showing gazetted Forest Reserves and Protected Areas)




                                                            12

 The following specific achievements through project implementation demonstrate the direct correlation
 between the project's outputs and their resulting outcomes.

 · biodiversity management is now fully integrated into the core business planning of the FC.

 · awareness on the importance, willingness and need to protect forest by community members has been
     high as they now appreciate and recognize a link between forest health and their own livelihoods.

 · biodiversity issues have been incorporation into national processes, including the current Growth and
     Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS-II).

 · communities, traditional leaders and District Assemblies are now involved            in natural resource
     management, monitoring and coordination of environmental protection and improvement of activities at
     district and community levels

 · through the livelihood support program the project might have contributed toward the establishment of
     positive relationship between economic development and natural resource conservation within the rural
     economies. This has made environmental quality a key element in supporting rural economic and social
     development in the forest regions.

 · A sense of ownership of the project as a result of massive sensitization measures, campaigns, joint
     programs and collaborative approaches to project activities has been created.

 Summary of quantitative results achieved under the project are shown in the table below:

The details of the project's major outcomes and achievements are as follows:




                                                             13

(i) Protecting a significant portion of forest biodiversity through implementing an ecosystem approach to
management within the high forest zone

Area of high conservation priority forests brought under effective management.

Under the project, 30 GSBAs totaling an area of 130,000ha and 42 Provenance Protected Areas (PPAs) were
identified and demarcated (i.e., surveyed and pillared) as gazetted forest reserve areas that deserve special
conservation and management regimes. These areas have been taken out of production and commercial
harvesting of timber and other non-timber forest products (For details of GSBAs, see Table 2, Annex 10).

The identification of 30 forest reserves and their exclusion from timber harvesting on the merit of their high
significance as biodiversity-rich areas has led to: (a) improved forest regeneration; (b) reduced illegal tree
felling and group hunting; (c) significant reduction in the drying up of water bodies. It must however be stated
that it takes about 10 years for a canopy closure to take place.

Community members have recognized positive trends across the broad spectrum of elements that have
traditionally been the bane of forest reserves. In the Beneficiary Assessment survey, about 1,500 out of 2,120
(70%) respondents saw a decreasing trend in farming, clearing and burning in the GSBAs. This was across
the board, for all districts and all GSBAs. An even higher percentage (86%), indicated a decreasing trend in
accidental fires in GSBAs. 83% of respondents said that the trend of game hunting in GSBAs is decreasing.
However, according to 64% of respondents the trend in the production of NTFP production in the GSBAs is
increasing.

The health of the GSBAs has improved according to 50% of the respondents. They have noted that the forest
canopy has improved since the start of the project; over 72% indicated that vegetation along the banks of
streams and rivers has improved; whilst a further 76% feel that their rivers and streams now hold water over
longer periods.

Over 52 km of green firebreaks have been established and are being maintained through community contracts
against possible fire hazards. Fruit trees have been planted by community members as buffer with the dual
purpose of serving as green fire breaks and income generation for farm owners. Through awareness creation
there has been significant reduction in the incidence of wild fires. The CBAGs have been the main rallying
point for most of the activities at the community level including cleaning and maintenance of SDF
boundaries.

Using the perception index to assess the project's impact, about 98% of respondents in the Beneficiary
Assessment survey indicated a satisfactory level of being aware of the project; almost 90% of respondents
indicated that the project has achieved its objectives; 90% of respondents were unequivocal that the project
had benefited them. Public awareness, interest and perception in sustainable forest management and
biodiversity conservation among target and non-target but neighboring communities have increased and this
has resulted in community adoption of sustainable production practices including conservation agriculture,
agro-forestry, buffer zone management, incorporation of fruit trees in crop production practices. They further
concretize these improvements by noting that the streams and rivers that fringe their communities are able to
hold water for longer rather than shorter periods. This is confirmed by about two-thirds of respondents.

The project has enhanced the capacity of various stakeholder groups through informal training and skills
upgrading in business management, nursery establishment, conservation practices and team building.




                                                              14

 ·      (ii) Improving knowledge of the distribution and status of rare, threatened and endemic
 species through targeted surveys to better focus conservation measures.

 Stability of threatened and rare species populations.

 Due to the high level of human pressures on the forests of the high forest zone, several species are now
 threatened with extinction either at the national or global levels. Most species found in the GSBAs were
 threatened with extinction at the global level (according to the 2004 IUCN Red List of threatened species).
 For mammals, it is noteworthy that four of the six threatened taxa are primates and the Miss Waldron red
 colobus is now supposed to be extinct in Ghana (although few individuals may survive in Côte d'Ivoire) are
 found in the project area. Other threatened flagship species occurring in the area include the elephant, the
 forest-dwelling bongo antelope and for birds the rare bare-headed rockfowl (Picathartes gymnocephalus).
 (For details see Table 2, Annex 10)

 A fauna inventory carried out in 2004 in all 30 GSBAs recorded a total of 291 different bird species
 representing 48 families. The family Pycnonotidae had the highest number of species found in the areas. Four
 globally threatened species2 are protected in nine GSBAs.

 In 2007 seven (7) GSBAs were selected to ensure representation of the different high forest vegetation type
 and also assess how the different intervention measures of the project have helped in stemming habitat
 degrading activities by local communities. The inventory focused on avifauna, birds, butterflies and large
 mammals. The 2004 and 2007 surveys however cannot be compared because of variations in scope,
 methodology and other factors like different ecological zones. The 2007 survey was to give a representation
 of current status of the threatened species for the purpose of the ICR.

 This rapid avifauna survey recorded 245 species from 43 avian families. Species recorded comprised of seven
 (7) globally threatened species and twenty (20) nationally wholly protected species. The threatened species
 recorded are in the Vulnerable, Near Threatened and Data Deficient Categories of the IUCN Red List of
 Threatened Species.

 Included in the species recorded at the seven GSBAs are 150 of the 180 bird species whose global distribution
 are restricted to the Guinea-Congo forest of West and Central Africa as well as six Upper Guinea Forest
 endemics. More species of birds were recorded in all the seven GSBAs in this current assessment than in the
 baseline study, but a relatively high proportion of the species are typically associated with forest edges and
 open habitats.

 Thirty (31) large mammal species, of which ten are globally threatened, were recorded from the seven GSBAs
 during the rapid assessment. The threatened large mammal species included three Globally Endangered and
 seven Near Threatened species. Seven (7) of the 31 species area are wholly protected under Schedule I of the
 Wildlife Conservation Regulation. The presence of the globally endangered species such as Chimpanzee,
 Yellow-flanked Duiker and Bongo, imputes a lot of conservation value to the sites where they were recorded.

 A total of 92 species of butterflies belonging to nine (9) families were recorded. (For details see 6, Annex 10)

 With the exception of Tano Offin and Atewa GSBAs, all the other sites assessed have maintained their habitat
 integrity, with very minimal physical signs of human disturbances. (For details see 7, Annex 10)



2­ Baumann's Greenbul (Phyllastrephus baumani) at Cape Three Points Green-tailed Bristelebill (Bleda eximia) at nine
 locations including Fure and Ndumfri GSBAs; Rofous-winged Illadopsis (Illadopsis rufescens) at Subri and Yellow-
 bearded Greenbul (Criniger oliveraceus) at Cape Three Point, Disue and Ebi Shelter GSBAs.



                                                                       15

Combination of traditional values and the intervention measure from the project appear to be working really
well for the three Southern Dry Forests. Members of the CBAG in the Southern Dry Forests area
demonstrated a great deal of commitment to the protection of the reserves. The boundary lines were well
cleaned and their enthusiasm for the GSBAs was very evident.

Challenges and Issues. An issue of grave concern to the integrity and biodiversity value of the GSBAs is
hunting pressure in almost all the seven GSBAs assessed. (For details see 4 (iii) Annex 10)

(iii) Enhancing biodiversity protection within multiple-use production forests through exclusion of critical
habitats from logging.
Key findings of the floral surveys in the seven GSBAs were the following. (For details see 8, Annex 10) :


·      Most of the GSBAs assessed maintained a relatively healthy condition during the project
       implementation period. Vegetation quality of Abasumba, Ahirasu 1&2 are currently found to be in a
       more healthier state than reported in 1995 and 2002.

·      Some CBAGs are playing their roles effectively in community policing, forest boundary maintenance
       and eco-tourism promotion. CBAGs at Asiakwa (Atewa), Asikuma (Subri), Tumantu (Cape Three
       Points) are commendable.

·      Bioquality (a measure reflecting how much biodiversity hotspot a sample of forest is) of seven (7)
       GSBAs are within acceptable limits of fluctuation compared with baselines obtained during the 2002
       floral surveys.

·      Cape Three Point topped the list of GSBAs in terms of floristic diversity, bioquality and vegetation
       integrity. A tree species new to science, Schefflerodendron ekpei, was recently described from there.

·      Atewa and Cape Three Point are attracting a good number of local and international tourists and
       researchers. Records kept by Asiakwa CBAGs showed 114 tourists and researchers visited Atewa
       between August 2005 and August 2007. Records were not available for the rest of GSBAs.

Illegal logging which was rampant in some of the forests (e.g. Cape Three Points Forest Reserve, the cluster
of Southern Dry Forests, etc) have been largely curtailed. Also, the rampant bushfires that engulfed most of
the southern dry forests continued to be curtailed, resulting in steady improvement of overall health of the
sites. The coverage of the endemic species, Talbotiella gentii, found only in few hilly sites in Ghana, has
increased as a result of fewer bushfires and control of harvesting of fuelwood. 42 PPAs that have been set up
and demarcated (surveyed and pillared) in 45 Production Forest Reserves will help protect critical natural
habitats for fauna and preserve genetic diversity in tree stocks and other flora. In the Beneficiary Assessment
survey, about 50% of respondents thought that the trend of timber exploitation in the GSBAs is decreasing.

Security of natural habitats.

Prior to the project implementation, all forest reserves covering the 30 GSBAs had been declared and gazetted
as either production forest reserves or protection forest reserves. Regazettement of these sites would give a
higher level of protection to them. However, the legal descriptions necessary for regazettement as GSBAs
have already been cleared by the Attorney General's Office and approved by Cabinet, The remaining task,
which is the legal declaration by Parliament is beyond the control of MLFM. Meanwhile, all GSBAs have
been excluded from timber production and institutional capacities of major stakeholders at both the center and
community levels have been built during the project implementation to ensure effective management and
protection of these global and national endowments.



                                                             16

The project has, in a participatory and consultative way, completed the development of management plans to
cover all the 30 GSBAs using the new Manual of Procedures (MoPs) developed by the project. These
management plans have been disseminated to the district assemblies, district forest offices, CBAGs and other
stakeholders who were all involved in their development for implementation.

Baseline information on flora and fauna. (See 9, Annex 10).

(iv) Ensuring sustainability and preserve genetic diversity of non-timber forest species that are collected by
rural populations for medicinal and consumptive uses, by improved data collection, monitoring, harvest
regulation, and sustainable management .

Enhancing Off-Reserve Landscape Management.

A number of communities have started reconfiguring their farming system approaches by incorporating
perennial woody fruit-bearing plants such as mangoes and citrus. 25 communities and educational institutions
have developed tree nurseries in all project regions. Significant progress was made in engaging the private
sector and NGOs in product development and marketing. Some communities within Enchi and Winneba
Districts were supported to preserve existing sacred groves to ensure their sustainability.

Alternative Livelihood Impact.

The CIF was implemented late in 2005 under the following structures:

·     National Fund Management Committee with oversight responsibility and final approval of CIF
      applications
·     Community Fund Management Committee responsible for vetting and selecting prospective
      beneficiaries, and monitoring use of CIF including ensuring the revolving principles are adhered to
·     ARB Apex Bank as the Fund Manager and Community/Rural Banks as disbursing banks

The overall monitoring of the CIF was under the project management team. However, at the community level
the rural banks and the CFMCs were responsible for tracking implementation progress of the CIF.

The US$2.5 million Community Investment Fund (CIF) established under this project was fully disbursed
through rural banks and over 8,000 individuals in communities that fringe the GSBAs have benefited from the
fund. Group or individual beneficiaries in beneficiary communities have invested loans contracted under the
CIF into setting up alternative income generating ventures at the community level.

The type of small business enterprises that were initiated by the project were: grass cutter rearing; bee-
keeping; oil palm processing; cassava processing; livestock rearing; flour-based enterprises e.g. baking;
plantation development e.g. establishment of woodlots, nurseries, horticulture; snail farming; mushroom
production; crop farming; fish farming; and non-timber forest products cultivation e.g. black pepper and the
sweetener, Thaumatococcus danielli.

Since the actual implementation of CIF on the ground started only in September 2005, it is premature to make
a full assessment of its impact on the communities' alternative livelihood. Besides, in the absence of a well
structured surveys and therefore lack of representative empirical data, the ICR team is constrained to depend
on the qualitative evidence from the Beneficiary Impact Assessment and the interviews conducted during the
field visits to project sites to make a full and concise evaluation of CIF. Household income data collected in
2004, 2005, and 2006 has shown that ALIF beneficiaries were experiencing rise in income levels. Again,
qualitative evidence also shows significant improvement in their lifestyles. Furthermore, engagement of



                                                             17

beneficiaries in these schemes seem to contributed to wean them off the forest for hunted animals, fruits and
other non-timber forest products, which hitherto were the main source of protein or income for these
communities.

Community members have also indicated a number of benefits that the project has brought in its wake as
shown in the Table below. About 90% of the respondents were unequivocal in their perception that the project
had benefited them.

         District                   Benefits/Comments
         Winneba                   Access to CIF funds and benefit of equipment such as boots,
                                   cutlasses, etc'
         Enchi                     Improvement in the knowledge base of facilitators and
                                   implementers
         Somanya                   Benefit of equipment such as boots, cutlasses, etc
         Tarkwa.                   Earning additional income.
         Asankragwa                Claimed no benefit from the project

In spite of the progress made, community members also complained about problems, including: (a) difficulty
in forming viable business groups; (b) difficulty in qualifying as a business group; (c) bureaucratic processes
at banks; (d) delays in accessing loans; (e) delays in withdrawals; (f) complicated structuring of loan
disbursements; (g) inadequate funds for all business groups at the same time; (h) inadequate funds for specific
businesses that seek to expand and meet other costs; and (i) high interest rates. Some community members
who did not receive their loans appeared jittery knowing that the project had ended. This implied that the
concept of a revolving fund was not well understood by some community members. (For other challenges,
see 10, Annex 10).

3.3   Efficiency (Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least
cost, and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return):

The project did not lend itself to conventional economic and financial analyses since no monetary value can
be placed on species and ecosystem conservation. However, the project outcome is deemed efficient based on
Section 3.2.

3.4   Justification of Overall Outcome and GEO Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of
PDOs/GEO, and efficiency):

Rating: Satisfactory

Based on the discussion given in Sections 3.2, the overall outcome is rated as satisfactory.

3.5   Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously covered or to amplify
discussion above):

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts. The project helped communities fringing the GSBAs to improve their lives through the
implementation of a CIF to provide alternative livelihoods to compensate for lost revenues and/or
opportunities as a result of biodiversity conservation for the `global community'. Consequently, many people
are engaged profitably in several income generating initiatives. M&E data show that within the beneficiary
category of the CIF people's household incomes have improved. In addition, people have developed saving



                                                             18

habits with the disbursing rural banks. Similarly, people are able to provide basic formal education for their
children and also avail themselves of medical care facilities.

Gender Aspects. Even though gender issues were not clearly developed in the project document, there was
nevertheless a strong gender orientation in the last couple of years of implementation particularly during the
formation of the CBAGs. Both men and women were sensitized on the importance of involving and giving a
major role to women in all decision-making and project activities. As a result, women were well represented
and integrated into the project and in some places women played lead roles in the implementation of activities
of the project.

Many women are currently engaged in village-level businesses and trade, and supplementing their income
with other eco-friendly activities like snail farming, mushroom production and animal rearing. They have
learned to do batik and tye-and-dye cloth for additional incomes. Now they are in a position to contribute
financially to household keeping, have become more bold and confident, are taking part in community
activities and decision-making process, and thus making meaningful contributions to their families and
communities. Project beneficiaries received financial literacy training and are skilled to transact banking
operations.

Social Development. The implementation of the project has brought a lot of social development in the project
areas. It has empowered community members in natural resource management, such as participation in
decision-making and actual resource management on the ground by actively doing anti-poaching, boundary
patrols and cleaning, bush fire prevention and control, etc. The formation of the CBAGs has also created a
social platform where groups meet regularly to plan for their communities and undertake social activities
aimed at helping one another in the society.

(b)   Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and
institutional development):

The project resulted in a substantial institutional development impact as demonstrated by the following:

·     At the community level, 30 CBAGs formed, trained and empowered under the project have
      strengthened community involvement in biodiversity conservation. These Groups will continue to be
      involved in the maintenance and patrol of GSBA boundaries.

·     At the District Assembly level, capacity of environmental management committee members has
      improved because of the training they received under the project.

·     At the national level, the project helped in strengthening the institutional capacity of the sector agencies
      at all administrative levels. For example, the project assisted MLFM in establishing Policy Planning and
      M&E Department. The project was also instrumental in setting up digitized M&E system in the
      Ministry for monitoring its overall activities.

·     Institutional reforms that were initiated in the forestry sector have created the necessary culture to
      ensure efficiency and transparency in resource management.

·     The establishment of Biodiversity Unit within the FSD is a significant step for the institutionalization of
      biodiversity conservation in Ghana.

·     The project has assisted in the implementation of National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan.




                                                              19

·     The project facilitated improvements in the relationship between the FC and the communities around
      forest reserves. By introducing the participatory approach in forest management the project succeeded
      in catalyzing this relationship.

For details see Annex 2, Component 5 (National Capacity Building)

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

Positive Impact

·     The project led to increased stakeholder interests in environmental conservation issues in the rain
      forests and southern savannah ecosystem. The FC's interest now encompasses not only exploitation but
      protection of natural resources, whilst public and private agencies have a stronger realization that forest
      management is not only timber harvesting but also biodiversity conservation and ecosystem protection.

·     The project has increased the awareness of communities on the importance and need to protect forest
      and its resources. There is also a better recognition and appreciation of the link between forest health
      and the livelihoods of fringe communities.

·     The project helped in raising financial literacy in communities, leading to better interaction of
      rural/community banks with customers, development of saving habits and understanding of basic
      banking principles/operations.

·     The project helped communities to identify other opportunities besides forest as source for livelihood.
      This is important knowledge because of its implications for sustainability of project achievements.

·     Rural and community banks have been enthusiastic in getting additional credit from NGOs, government
      and other Bank-funded projects leading to streamlining of credit administration, which has been a big
      challenge for the RCBs. This has brought a different level of engagement in rural banks and their clients
      who are mainly rural people. As a result of the project, RCBs have taken M&E more seriously and
      using it for selection of beneficiaries, disbursement of loans using the concept of group collateral which
      is found to be working quite effectively.

Negative Impact

·     Realizing that the CIF is a reality, a larger number of community members than originally envisioned
      have shown interest in the CIF. Unfortunately, the amount provided under the project to support the
      scheme was inadequate for the larger numbers. As a result, those community members who have not as
      yet benefited from the CIF were disgruntled and felt that there was no fairness in the system.

4    Assessment of Risk to GEO Outcome

Rating: Moderate

On the one hand:

· The project has been firmly established with institutional and legal structures which will ensure its
   sustainability. The GSBA sites are within legally constituted forest reserve areas, and they have been
   surveyed and pillared within the broader conservation principles with active stakeholder participation that
   can produce significant gains for biodiversity conservation as well as the development of rural economies.

· In terms of individual outputs, there are outputs and/or activities that will be sustained by the stakeholders
   themselves without any outside technical, financial, and logistical support. Some of the activities which
   could be sustained are management of community forests, management and maintenance of community
   fruit crops on farmlands as buffer, agro-forestry and soil improvement technologies. These activities
   conform to the indigenous system of farm management.

· Many community members, mostly men, who were helping in the clearing and demarcation of
   boundaries, pillaring etc have been employed as staff of FC to help continue what was started under the
   project. The development of the management plans are also part of the plans for continuity and
   sustainability of project activities.

· Overall, the government is interested in ensuring that a bigger portion of the nation is put under
   conservation and that adequate resources are allocated for maintenance.

· At the policy level, the government is seriously committed to biodiversity conservation. Government's
   active negotiations of the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) with the European Union (EU) for
   managing forests and timber exploitation in Ghana attest to this commitment. Under VPA, all exported
   timber should be from sustainably managed forests to ensure that illegal harvesting is totally eliminated.

On the other hand:

· There is a potential risk if the government does not create more new forests, there will be a depletion of
   forest resources. The installed capacity for wood in Ghana is five times higher than what Ghana's forests
   can provide annually on sustainable basis.

· For the financial viability of the existing Revolving Fund, it is important for the Fund Management
   Committees and the RCBs to ensure that beneficiaries who received loans under CIF repay their loans
   without default.

· Change in government policies to release GSBA for other land uses will affect the project's overall long-
   term goal. A good number of the designated GSBAs are within mining areas and there are strong
   agitations from some quarters against mining in these areas. There is a growing concern that the GOG is
   inclined to allocate rights for mining bauxite at Atewa and Tano Offin (GOG has already given out
   prospecting and exploration right to a mining company in the Atewa Forest Range).

· If the FC fails to provide adequate and appropriate inputs such as boots and cutlass to people who are in
   charge of boundary cleaning and patrolling GSBAs, they may lose interest in carrying out these activities
   properly and effectively.

5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design, implementation and outcome
issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e., performance through lending phase):

Rating: Unsatisfactory.

The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project was unsatisfactory. On
the one hand, the project was consistent with the CAS and government priorities in the sector at the time and
was consistent with the Bank's environmental protection and safeguard strategies. In addition, major risk
factors and lessons learned from other earlier projects in the forestry sector were considered and incorporated
into the project design. Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists who had
the technical skill mix necessary to address concerns. The Bank provided adequate resources in terms of staff
weeks and budget to ensure quality preparation and appraisal work.

Given the potential impact of the project on environmentally sensitive areas, a full project Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out, and an Environmental Management Plan was prepared and
integrated into the final project design. In the course of EIA preparation, twenty-five communities were
surveyed, the majority of which were situated adjacent to forest reserves or protected areas. Comments
received during the public consultation process were taken into account in producing the final project EIA and
the Environmental Management Plan.

On the other hand, as mentioned in Section 2.1, being an integral part of NRMP-1, the HFBC project suffered
from NRMP-I drawbacks. For example, NRMP-1 was ambitious, the project design was complex, and it was
prepared in a rush. On the Bank's part, there was the lack of oversight to signal the risks associated with the
complex project design and to take appropriate corrective measures. In addition it failed to properly assess the
implementing agency's capacity to coordinate the different project activities and donors. Also, effectiveness
was obtained very late because the project had set ambitious effectiveness conditions that were impossible to
achieve in the anticipated time. These conditions related to the passage of specific laws to guide the issuance
of timber utilization contracts and the formulation and implementation of a National Biodiversity Strategy and
Action Plan. These issues led to serious implementation delays of the NRMP-1 and also of this project.

(a) Quality of Supervision (including of fiduciary and safeguards policies):

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was moderately satisfactory. The task team
focused on the project's development impact. Project supervision was intensive, with a mission at least every
six months throughout the life of the project. The task team visited project sites and held discussions with key
officials of the District Assemblies, rural/community banks, traditional/customary authorities, communities,
community-based natural resources management committees (e.g. CBAG, OEF), consultants and other civil
society organizations.

Clear and detailed ISR and Aide Memoires attest to the detail-oriented missions and the superior quality of
recommendations for each component of the project. Supervision, particularly at the MTR, helped to turn the
project around. Bank's procurement and financial management proficient staff worked with the PCU staff to
explain the rules and procedures to be applied during project implementation, with regard to procurement of
goods and works, and selection of consultants, accounts and audits, based on the Grant Agreement. These
achievements were rather late in coming.


                                                             22

However, in the beginning of the project, supervision could have been better had the task team ensured that
there were baseline data, an M&E system earlier, that the CIF was implemented earlier and that the M&E
recommendations provided at the MTR were followed through. In addition, the task team could have played a
more proactive role in its dealings with the government for resolving those issues which were dragging the
project implementation.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

Based on the Bank's performance during lending phase and supervision as discussed above, overall Bank
performance is rated as moderately satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance

NOTE: When the government and implementing agency are indistinguishable, provide rating and
justification only for Overall Borrower Performance.

The Borrower performance at preparation was unsatisfactory. The project was developed by the Government
with the active participation of the MLFM, FC and Ministry of Finance. Indicators of government
commitment included the preparation of the National Biodiversity Strategy and the Protected Areas Systems
Plan, and implementation of the Forest Development Master Plan. Assurances were given at negotiations that
the GSBAs to be established with GEF financial support would be re-gazetted with appropriate restrictions on
uses to safeguard the biodiversity they were designed to protect.

Borrower's implementation performance is rated moderately satisfactory. In the first 3-4 years, government
commitment was low in terms of adequacy and timely allocation of counterpart funding. After MTR, the
Bank changed the expenditure ratio to 100% and the issue of counterpart funding was thus resolved.
Government commitment improved considerably in the later part of the project. The government officials
worked closely with the Bank's project team on a continual basis, and cooperated fully with the task team.
The supervision missions were frequently joined by staff of the MLFM, Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning, Forestry Commission and officials from ARB Apex Bank (Managers of the Community Investment
Fund under the Project).

MLFM. Performance of MLFM in the first two years was affected because of delayed appointments of
management staff. The Ministry delayed resolving this issue and only well after the MTR were the required
adjustments made (by filling two key positions - a new Technical Director for Forestry and a Director for
Policy and Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation). Other significant problem was MLFM's inaction in
carrying out the recommendations by the MTR for improving the M&E of the project.

Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The project secretariat was able to strengthen coordination of activities
through collaboration with implementing institutions, NGOs, academic institutions and forest fringe
communities. The project management was quick to adopt recommendations from the World Bank and other
donor-assisted missions.

Procedures and requirements of the procurement were adequately followed. Standard procurement regulations
according to the World Bank procedures and Ghana Government Procurement Acts were followed. After the
MTR, the PCU developed and adopted a monitoring and evaluation operating system as an administrative
control mechanism for tracking project performance and taking corrective measures to ensure efficiency and
effectiveness of delivery. The overall project financial management system was adequate and satisfactory.



                                                            23

The project had an accounting procedures manual, which guided the accounting staff in the performance of
their functions.

In light of the above discussion, the overall Borrower performance was Moderately Satisfactory.

6.     Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)

Important factors for the success of a project:

·      There is a need to make a determination, during preparation and appraisal about the level of
       government commitment to the project. This helps in determining the appropriate type of project design
       and implementation arrangements

·      Decentralization of operations to lower administrative levels with financial support and clear
       responsibilities for disbursement and reporting lines contributes to effective project implementation

·      Collaboration, cooperation and a good mix of technical staff among the Bank, the Government, and
       stakeholders during implementation enhances effective project implementation.

·      Sense of ownership by communities resulting from sensitization measures, campaigns, joint programs
       and collaborative approaches to project activities is critical for the success of a project.

Project Design:

·      Project designs should not be complex and must be tailored to the skills and institutional capacities of
       the implementing agency. For an agency with lower capacity, the design should focus on fewer, core
       project activities.

·      Conditions that need parliamentary and cabinet approvals should be avoided as pre-effectiveness
       conditions/triggers, as they are likely to delay the start of project implementation.

·      All key aspects of projects like the CIF concept should be part of both preparation and design to enable
       implementation to start early for outcomes to be adequately measured by project closure. The design
       should be comprehensive enough to encompass key aspects like modus of access, disbursement and
       marketing.

·      Clear baselines should be established before the start of project implementation or at least in the 1st year
       of implementation, so that the progress and impact of the project can be realistically measured.

·      Projects addressing issues such as biodiversity conservation need a specific national anchor agency and
       champion in order to succeed.

Implementation:

·      When local communities are engaged upfront in project implementation they develop trust to work with
       project teams.

·      Communities who are dependent on forests for livelihood can be mobilized and engaged in other
       profitable ventures not based on forests and forest resources.




                                                                24

·    A clear communication strategy that provides operationally relevant information to beneficiaries and all
     stakeholders on a strategic basis should be a key implementation, exit and sustainability pillar for
     forestry projects involving numerous actors.

Monitoring and Evaluation:

·      Monitoring and evaluation needs and capacities should be assessed in the first two or three
       supervision missions to ensure that capacity building issues are addressed by the implementing
       agency.

·      For a GEF grant, the period under which monitoring of the site is done to measure the project's
       impact, especially on biodiversity conservation projects, should extend for a longer period of time. In
       addition, the indicators should be realistic and not ambitious.

Sustainability:

·      A linkage between livelihood and conservation of forest resources is critical for sustainability of
       achievements on forest resources management under the project.

·      A link between communities and rural financial institutions to ensure regular source of funding and
       financial support for livelihood activities and non-forest activities is significant in sustaining
       alternative livelihood programs.

·      Strengthening capacity and skills through adequate training in the management of micro-enterprises
       will ensure sustainability of livelihood activities without depending on forests.

·    A watchdog mechanism is necessary to follow-up with rural banks and their beneficiaries, on
     repayment of loans from the CIF to ensure that the fund actually revolves to ensure additional
     disbursement of loans.

Annex 2.                Outputs by Component

Component 1: GSBA Site Preparation and Development of Management Plans

a.    Site Preparation and Management Planning for GSBAs

A total number of 30 forest reserves were identified and excluded from timber harvesting on the merit of their
high significance as biodiversity-rich areas. Earlier forest inventory activities had established that these forest
reserves have a high content in biological diversity, particularly in terms of their flora. Eleven (11) of these
forest reserves are wholly protected while the remaining nineteen (19) are partially covered.

These reserves have been categorized as GSBAs and SDFs, with the latter occurring mainly in the Winneba
forest district, which has a different, rare ecological setting that makes it amenable to some unique diversity of
plants.

All the thirty (30) GSBAs were surveyed, demarcated and pillared. The Attorney General's Department
completed legal description for the GSBAs and they have been forwarded to Cabinet for approval and re-
gazetting.

The survey, demarcation and pillaring of Forty-two (42) PPAs were also completed to ensure continuous
protection of these areas for reliable supply of high genetic materials for desired timber species.

b.    Management Plans

In collaboration with the Ghana Wildlife Society and other NGOs, as well as key community members,
biodiversity management plans have been written for all GSBAs following the development of a Manual of
Procedures. The process involved extensive consultation with local communities and other key stakeholders.

c. Capacity Development for GSBA Management

The project started with the establishment of the High Forest Biodiversity Conservation Unit within the
Forestry Commission. A large number of officers of the FSD and over 1500 members of CBAGs were trained
in various aspects of environmental science and forest ecology and biodiversity conservation. The project
conducted several workshops and technical review meetings to develop and sharpen skills in the writing of
biodiversity management plans. Within the capacity building drive of the project, the herbaria at the Botany
Department of the University of Ghana and Resource Management Support Centre (RMSC) have been
equipped with computers and an assortment of herbarium supplies.

d.    Creation of Community Biodiversity Advisory Groups (CBAGs)

Through the intervention of the project, CBAGs were formed for all the 30 GSBAs. The CBAGs represent a
vital structure that serve as rallying points for ensuring voluntary community participation in project
implementation. These groups were involved in forest protection through their patrolling activities. They were
of immense help in facilitating data collection/database building within their communities where they worked
closely with project consultants in some cases. Regular training programmes were organized for them in order
to enhance local capacity in resource management/conservation. Some exposure to forest laws and regulations
and general environmental education was provided through such training activities.




                                                                28

Component 2: Research and Monitoring

Baseline studies were conducted for some critical areas of biodiversity maintenance and these are:


Socio-economic survey

Socio-economic surveys were conducted for forest communities living close to 24 of the GSBAs. All socio-
economic survey reports for these GSBAs were submitted which have been very useful inputs in the
management planning process. They also provided the baseline information that was required for the design
of the alternative livelihood investment scheme.

Feasibility studies on Ecotourism Potential

The project financed studies to determine potentials of the GSBAs and SDFs for ecotourism development.
The studies indicated that most of the sites including Atewa and Apedwa Forest Range, Cape Three Points
and the cluster of SDFs could be prime areas for community-based ecotourism development. The project was
in touch with the Tourist Board to do an initial assessment and to build the right linkages with District
Assemblies. The initial assessment included identification of caves, possible locations of walk trails, canopy
walkways, among others.

Aerial survey and videography

Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the FC and Conservation International, the latter
conducted an aerial survey and videography that covered 22 GSBAs for the establishment of digital database
to support management decisions. This was executed and the product of this activity was installed.

Research into modern perspectives of provenance protection

Through inventories conducted in the early 90s by the FSD, some provenance areas that possess a
considerable population of scarlet species of some desirable features and characteristics were identified and
these areas were designated appropriately as Provenance Protection Areas (PPAs). These areas are to serve as
sources of genetic material or gene banks for the sustenance of economically threatened, highly commercial
timber species.

Under the project, a study was conducted to provide modern perspectives on the need for provenance
protection of these heavily exploited timber species. A report was submitted and based on this a workshop
was organized to validate the recommendations of the study for implementation.

Floral surveys

Botanical survey was conducted for all the GSBAs to assess their floral content and also to provide vital
knowledge on the vegetation e.g. occurrence and distribution of species of very high conservation priority,
such as the black star species. An innovation that resulted from the study was the identification of focal areas,
which were, intended as permanent areas within the GSBAs with good documentation of species content, for
various purposes e.g. research, ecotourism, etc.

Faunal Surveys

A MoU was signed with the Institute of Renewable Natural Resources of the Kwame Nkrumah University of
Science and Technology to conduct faunal surveys for some 24 priority GSBAs.



                                                              29

Conservation Strategy for Talbotiella gentii

The project through the Environmental Conservation Unit of RMSC and in collaboration with the Department
of Botany, University of Ghana formulated a conservation strategy for Talbotiella gentii.

Great Ape Survival Plan

The project initiated the development of the Great Ape Survival Plan with the Wildlife Division as the
supervising agency. A consultant completed a study on targeted primates which was validated at a stakeholder
workshop.

Component 3: Management of Southern Dry Forest Areas (SDFs)

The objective of this component was to establish six representative protected areas within the southern dry
forest ecological belt under the full management of local communities. Floral and fauna surveys were
completed for 4 SDFs in the Winneba Forest District. The project also completed the surveying, demarcation
and pillaring of 4 SDFs as part of the 30 GSBAs. In addition, over 52 km of green firebreaks have been
established and are being maintained through community contracts against possible fire hazards. Fruit trees
were planted by community members as buffer with the dual purpose of serving as green fire breaks and
income generation for farm owners. The CBAGs have been the main rallying point for most of the activities
at the community level including cleaning and maintenance of SDF boundaries. CBAG members noted
reductions in forest fires and increasing good health of the sites and adjourning farmlands, which have been
attributed to the successful execution of project activities as well as increased levels of awareness and
participation.

The project financed studies to determine potentials of the GSBAs and SDFs for ecotourism development.
The studies have indicated that most of the sites including Atewa and Apedwa Forest Range, Cape Three
Points and the cluster of SDFs could be prime areas for community-based ecotourism development. The
project was in touch with the Tourist Board to do an initial assessment and to build the right linkages with
District Assemblies. The initial assessment included identification of caves, possible locations of walk trails,
canopy walks among others.

Component 4: Enhancing Livelihood through the Community Investment Fund (CIF)

This component aimed at providing alternative livelihood opportunities to communities fringing forest
reserves that have been demarcated as GSBAs in order to mitigate the loss of economic opportunities and
other benefits obtainable from these reserves. Actual implementation of CIF (also known as the ALIF) started
in September 2005. This Component has made significant progress since the last mission in May 2006. The
structures and systems established at various levels for the implementation of the scheme continue to work
relatively well. Beneficiary and community perception of the ALIF facility and the project as a whole keeps
growing and misperceptions and doubts are gradually diminishing. This may be due to the increasing level of
community participation and broad-based sensitization that has occurred.

Implementation of CIF

Actual implementation of CIF started in September 2005. Structures and systems for the implementation were
established and a number of enterprises were initiated the structures for the implementation were the
following: The National Fund Management Committee, Community Fund Management Committee, ARB
Apex Bank, and participating rural banks. The project management team had oversight responsibilities.

Enterprises supported under the CIF

The type of small business enterprises that were initiated by the project were as follows:

              · Grasscutter rearing
              · Bee-keeping
              · Oil palm processing
              · Cassava processing
              · Livestock rearing
              · Flour-based enterprises e.g. baking
              · Plantation development e.g. establishment of woodlots, nurseries, and
                   horticulture
              · Snail farming
              · Mushroom production
              · Crop farming
              · Fish farming
              · Non-timber forest products cultivation e.g. black pepper and the sweetener,
                   Thaumatococcus danielli

Component 5: National Capacity Building

Capacity building occurred in three ways: (a) planned training and skills upgrading for all kinds of
stakeholder groups, (b) sourcing out specific activities to firms, academia and research to perform, and (c)
doing-by-learning approach by contracting out specific traditional forest activities such as patrolling,
boundary cleaning, and bushfire prevention. The spectrum of stakeholders that received capacity building
under the project included:

Research Institutes & Academia

·    Institute of Renewable Natural Resources (IRNR) of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and
     Technology (KNUST) in Kuamsi, Botany Department of the University of Ghana, and Forestry

      of project activities. Carried out: (i) tourism feasibility studies; (ii) aerial photography and videography
      work under the project; and (iii) feasibility studies on the community investment fund. Also assisted in
      the preparation of the management plans and impact assessment.

Enhancing Off-Reserve Landscape Management

Interventions targeted areas lying within 5km. radius from the boundaries of the GSBAs and were meant to
ensure holistic landscape management that ultimately secures the integrity of the GSBAs in the long-term.
Implementation of activities in the off-reserve landscapes has shown significant progress. Community support
has grown and participation in the scheme is remarkable. The project created partnerships with academia and
research agencies, NGOs and village-level structures and traditional authorities to facilitate the
implementation of agreed upon activities. A number of communities have started reconfiguring their farming
system approaches by incorporating perennial woody fruit-bearing plants such as mangoes and citrus. 25
communities and educational institutions have developed tree nurseries spread in all four project regions.
Project sites were selected and progress was made in engaging the private sector especially in the area of
product development and marketing. Again some communities within Enchi and Winneba Districts have been
supported to preserve existing sacred groves to ensure their sustainability.

     Annex 5.                         Beneficiary Survey Results (if any)

The Beneficiary Impact Assessment study adopted an in-depth, comparative and exploratory design method
to operationalize the research objectives and to execute the assignment. This approach divided the study into
two elements: review of relevant project documents and field data collection.

i/. Review of relevant project documents: this involved a desk study of various project literatures including
the project document, work plans, evaluation and other reports. The analysis of these documents helped
establish the project profile prior to the execution of the study as well as provide a background and context for
the study.

     ii/. Field data collection: this involved primary data collection using a multiplicity of tools:
                               a.         A Survey Instrument (SI)
                               b.         Key Informant in-depth Interviews (KII)
                               c.         Focus Group Discussions (FGD)
                               d.         Direct Observations (DO)

     Data was collected using a variety on tools:

i/. Survey Instrument (SI) ­ a structured questionnaire was designed and executed on the field to selected
respondents.

ii/. Key Informant in-depth Interviews (KII) ­ this approach targeted key people from the community and its
institutions who could comment on the project's impact on the community. Both structured and unstructured
interviews were held with identifiable key informants including the national CBAG chairman, various CBAG
leaders, CFMC members, business group leaders, FSD officials, opinion leaders, traditional leaders, District
Assembly members, District Chief Executives, staff of rural/community banks associated with the CIF and
officials of ARB Apex Bank.

iii/. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) ­ community-level discussions were held with key focus groups
including community members, business groups, CBAG members, women and youth groups.

iv/. Direct Observations (DO) ­ this was done on selected actors in the community and their institutions.
There were several interventions: a number of rural/community bank project staff was followed in their
rounds to their clients; a number of business group premises were visited; and a number of CBAG members
were also joined on their patrols.

Sampling Techniques
Both the random and purposive sampling techniques were used to select the various categories of respondents
for the study. A purposive sampling method was used to ensure that all four (regions) covered by the project
were selected for the study. Random sampling techniques were then used to select eight out of the 10 forestry
districts in which the project was implemented. A combination of purposive and random sampling was used
to select 22 out of 30 GSBAs that were covered by the project, ensuring that adequate numbers of both fully
protected and partially protected GSBAs were selected. Purposive sampling was employed to ensure that all
the communities fringing each GSBA were selected. Random sampling was used to select 20 members per
forest fringe community. In total, 2,120 community members took part in the study.




                                                               37

Data Analysis


Given the investigative nature of the study and to meet the objectives of the assignment, both qualitative and
quantitative methods were used to analyze the data. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was
the main tool employed. Descriptive accounts, using a thematic analysis and clustering of findings was used
for the qualitative aspects whilst summary statistics in the form of frequencies and percentages were used for
quantitative analyses.

FINDINGS

The following are the major findings in respect of the beneficiaries of the High Forest Biodiversity
  Conservation Project:

· Awareness creation ­ the project has raised awareness to very high levels and consequently, there exists
    an enormous sense of awareness of the need to protect the forest and a willingness to do so on the part of
    the community members as they now appreciate and recognize a link between forest health and their own
    livelihoods.

· Sense of ownership ­ as a result of massive sensitization measures, campaigns, joint programmes and
    collaborative approaches to project activities, community members now share a sense of ownership of the
    project.

· Enthusiasm ­ beneficiaries are enthusiastic about the project on two fronts, its activities and the CIF
    component. There are, however, some misgivings about whether the level of CIF support can sustain
    community members and keep them away from the forest forever.

· In terms of overall achievements, it is evident that the HFBCP is perceived to be a roaring success; with
    almost 90% of all respondents indicating that the HFBCP is achieving its objectives.

· The cross tabulation analysis by districts showed that in terms of percentages, Somanya had the highest
    positive responses; followed by Winneba, Nkawie, Tarkwa, Enchi, and Asankragwa. Conversely,
    Takoradi had the most negative responses, followed by Begoro.

· The sectoral cross tabulation analysis of the respondents' perceptions by GSBA also showed that the
    GSBA with the highest number of positive responses was Fure Headwaters, followed by Sapawsu,
    Abasomba, Akrabong and Obotomfo. In addition, several GSBAs indicated zero negative responses;
    Yongwa, Yogaga, Akrabong, Sapawsu, Aboben, Abasomba, Ahirasu I, Ahirasu II and Ndumfri.
    However, two GSBAs had particularly high numbers of negative responses; Atewa, where there were
    more negative responses than positive; and Cape Three Points, where 70% of all respondents thought the
    project had not achieved its objectives.

· The introduction of GSBAs and PPAs has undoubtedly, brought many changes into the lives of the
    communities that fringe these reserves. A majority of them note that the overall effects on their individual
    livelihoods as well as the economic lives of their communities have been positive. However, there is also
    the recognition that some community members have suffered some hardships which could be
    characterized as economic.

· It is also quite clear that community members recognize positive trends across the broad spectrum of
    elements that have traditionally been the bane of forest reserves. Over 70% of community sees a
    decreasing trend in farming, clearing and burning in the GSBAs; 86% indicate a decreasing trend in


                                                             38

  accidental fires in GSBAs; 83% say that the trend of game hunting in GSBAs is decreasing; 50% think
  that the trend of timber exploitation in the GSBAs is decreasing. In contrast, only about 20% of
  respondents indicate that the trend of mining activities in the GSBA is decreasing; in fact, about 30% say
  that the trend has remained the same; 64% of respondents say the trend in the production of NTFP in the
  GSBAs is increasing.

· It is universally recognized that the HFBCP has also engaged in activities that have improved the health
  of GSBAs, PPAs and sacred grooves as well as on flora and fauna. Indeed, the picture painted of the
  health of the GSBAs, PPAs, sacred grooves, etc is that, the project interventions have had a positive
  impact along a number of indicators; forest canopies have thickened, vegetation has become denser,
  animal populations have increased and water bodies seem fuller for longer periods.

· The CIF and the reasons for its establishment are widely known with about 93% of beneficiaries
  characterizing it as a `good thing'. Whilst it has brought many benefits, community members also
  complained about problems like delays in accessing loans, delays in withdrawals, complicated structuring
  of loan disbursements, inadequate funds for business groups in general, inadequate funds for specific
  businesses that seek to expand and meet other costs and high interest rates.

· Regarding the benefits that communities might have derived from the HFBCP, the respondents list
  several. The top listed benefit was `benefit of equipment and goods such as boots, cutlasses, raincoats,
  etc'; followed by `earning some income', `CIF funds', `improved knowledge base of facilitators and
  implementers', and `job creation.' However, some 10% of respondents indicated that they had reaped no
  benefit from the project. According to the cross tabulation analysis by district and benefit type, Winneba
  district indicated access to CIF funds and benefit of equipment/goods such as boots, cutlasses, raincoats,
  etc' as its top two benefits; for Enchi district, it was improvement in the knowledge base of facilitators
  and implementers; Somanya also mentioned benefit of equipment/goods such as boots, cutlasses, etc as
  its number one; whilst for Tarkwa, it was earning some income. Asankragwa had the highest number of
  respondents who felt they had gained no benefit from the project; followed by Tarkwa. These must
  however, be set in context because on the whole, about 90% of the respondents were unequivocal in their
  perception that the HFBCP had benefited them.

· The cross tabulation analysis of the benefits of the HFPCB by GSBA and benefit type shows that Fure
  Headwaters had the most responses followed by Sapawsu, Abasomba, Akrabong, Aboben, Obotomfo and
  Yogaga. Of this lot, Sapawsu had the highest number of responses for one benefit type, `benefit of
  equipment/goods such as boots, cutlasses, raincoats, etc,' followed by Yogaga and Aboben. Conversely,
  Fure Headwaters, with the most respondents overall, also recorded the highest number of respondents
  who felt they had gained no direct benefit from the project.

· In addition to the overall findings, sectoral analysis of different groups of beneficiaries was also made and
  these are also presented as follows:

  Challenges Faced by Community Members

       · They do not have a project plan of their own
       · They are unaware of the time-table for some project activities
       · It seems the CBAGs wield all the power at the community level
       · They would like increased consultation at the grassroots
       · Information on status of project activities in their individual communities
       · Controlling illegal farming, lumbering and logging
       · Controlling illegal mining

      · Inadequate logistics for CBAGs
      · The CIF process is fraught with problems
      · Initial misconception about CIF being grants and not loans
      · Difficulty in forming viable business groups
      · Difficulty in qualifying as a business group
      · Bureaucratic processes at banks

                  c.   Jealousies directed at successful business group members by other
                       community members
                  d.   Apathy of community members who are non-beneficiaries of CIF
                       towards other project activities

Challenges Faced by Key Informants

  CIF Management issues

      · Transparency ­ the beneficiaries of the CIF do not seem to be aware of how decisions are being
           taken
      · Participation ­ the extent to which beneficiaries are involved in the management of the CIF
      · Pre-appraisals ­ how extensively were project gestation periods done before the selection of
           businesses
      · Appraisals ­ how comprehensive and realistic were business plans
      · Integrity ­ the extent to which the system is being abused
      · Allocation ­ were some business groups disadvantaged from the start as a result of the quantum
           needed to commence operations?
      · Sustainability ­ the degree and extent of project outputs being maintained after project closure




                                                         40

CIF Service Delivery Issues

    · Quantum of resources ­ actual disbursements made
    · Technical knowledge ­ availability of appropriate skills training and capacity building for
        business group members
    · Start-up vs. sustainability ­ training emphasis not only at initiation stage but during
        implementation to ensure sustainability
    · Acceptability ­ whether all applications were considered irrespective of nature of business
    · Good faith ­ capacity and willingness of business groups to repay loans

Perception and Analysis of the Impact of the HFBCP ­ By Observation
This subsection presents the findings pertaining to the perceptions and impact of the HFBCP by
observation through interactions with all categories of beneficiaries: CBAG members, community
members, community institutions, focus groups, banks and business groups. The observations noted
include:

    · Enthusiasm ­ beneficiaries were enthusiastic about the project on two fronts, its activities and the
        CIF component. There were some misgivings about whether the level of CIF support could
        sustain community members and keep them away from the forest forever
    · Awareness creation ­ there exists an enormous awareness of the need to protect the forest and a
        willingness to do so as the community members recognize a link between forest health and their
        own livelihoods
    · Sense of ownership ­ community members' readiness to engage project team on issues of
        concern to them
    · Sense of helplessness ­ community members and business groups perceived the banks as
        unwanted interlocutors. The community was informed that there was money `coming' and then
        they have to apply to banks. Why can't FSD pay them the money directly?
    · Lack of commitment ­ community members perception of banks as shylocks who have no
        interest in their wellbeing except to collect money ­ which is not the bank's anyway
    · Demands ­ community members' expectation of additional project financial support
    · Expectations ­ initial views that CIF was grant and not loan
    · False hopes ­ community members thought CIF was compensation for their lands
    · Superiority complex ­ some bank officials had little regard for community members
    · Unprofitability ­ some banks felt CIF business was forced on them and were reluctant to offer
        advice and generally help business groups to thrive and be profitable
    · Apartheid - some banks treated CIF borrowers as a different breed of customer ­ troublesome and
        unprofitable
    · Poor housekeeping ­ poor monitoring of loans and businesses by some banks
    · Lack of Experience ­ some community members had no experience in business planning and
        access to market, etc.
    · Lack of perseverance ­ some community members too willing to blame everything on `bad luck'
        and `leaving everything to God'
    · Reservations ­ community members' fears about
                 a. Skills shortfalls in certain technical areas
                 b. The perceived unwillingness of RCBs to transact business with rural communities
                 c. Pressure to abandon pet projects

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the foregoing conclusions and challenges and particularly in view of the fact that the project has
come to an end, the following recommendations are made:

   · Establishment of an exit strategy for the project which addresses issues like
               a. Overall sustainability of the project
               b. Embedding and mainstreaming successes so that they can be carried forwards
               c. A sustainability plan for the provision of logistics for CBAGs

   · Improving and streamlining the CIF process

   · Improved sensitization about concept of CIF as a revolving fund which can only be sustained
       with prompt repayments

   · Pre-appraisals and appraisals for business group formation and businesses should be strengthened
       with targeted training initiatives

   · Access to loan, withdrawals and disbursements should be streamlined

   · CIF should accommodate the need for additional loans for business expansion

   · Issues of sustainability of the businesses should be seriously tackled

   · RCB project officers should be trained to offer more support and treat community members as
       clients not pariahs

   · Agencies identified as support groups should be up-and-doing (MOFA, etc)

   · Businesses must be helped with their market accessibility and availability issues

   · Community members must be trained and prepared for the vicissitudes of the cash economy

   · Transparency ­ the processes of the CIF must be more transparent. The CFMCs should make
       more efforts to inform their stakeholders of what is happening at all times

   · Participation ­ the membership/complexity of the CFMC must be looked at again. The committee
       is not an end. Rather it is a means to an end so its target beneficiaries must see that it is working
       for them and seeking their welfare at all times

   · Pre-appraisals and appraisals of business plans must be more comprehensive and realistic and
       must be done thoroughly.

   · CIF loans must be fit for the purpose and the quantum of resources must support the businesses
       planned for

   · Interest rates should be standardized for all beneficiary communities.

   · Technical knowledge ­ appropriate skills training and capacity building for business group
       members must be more readily available and targeted


                                                       42

· Issues of market access and general marketing of especially agricultural produce must be
   seriously addressed

· Good faith ­ community members must be sensitized on the concept of borrowing and repaying
   to keep the revolving idea going

There is a need to monitor the banks for better services to their clients.

Project Background

The High Forest Biodiversity Conservation Project (HFBCP) of Ghana was funded by the Global
Environment Facility (GEF) as a supplementary project to the Ghana Natural Resources Management
Program (NRMP). The project sought to develop and promote community involvement in the management of
the Globally Significant Biodiversity Areas (GSBAs) for ecological security of threatened tropical moist
forest ecosystems.

The project was implemented by the Ministry of Lands, Forestry and Mines (MLFM) from April 1999 to June
2007. As part of the Credit Agreement, this evaluation was compiled as part of the project completion reports.


The report was compiled by a team of independent consultants and the staff of the Project Management Unit.
The main method of collecting data was through desk review of project reports, interviews with key
stakeholders and field observations from 22 GSBAs in all the ecological zones.

Findings

The review of the project implementation has revealed that in general the project has achieved significant
results particularly at the outcome level. The following were the significant findings:

1.     The project has mainstreamed biodiversity conservation in conventional forest management practices
and enhanced the ecological security of globally significant biological resources, within the threatened
tropical moist forest ecosystems. The implementation of the project has enhanced biodiversity conservation
within multiple-use production forest through the exclusion of critical habitats from logging. The project
identified and demarcated 42 Provenance Protection Areas within production forests and pillared 30 GSBA
totalling 130,000 ha. There is a process to enact legislation for the permanent protection of these GSBA.

2.     A system for monitoring and evaluating the distribution and status of rare, threatened and endemic
species in the forest reserves has been created to enhance biodiversity protection within multiple-use
production forests.

3.     The implementation of the project has generated global environmental benefits which has contributed to
the attainment of the three objectives of the Convention of Biodiversity (CBD) i.e. the conservation of
biological diversity; the sustainable use of its component; and fair equitable sharing of benefits arising from
the utilization of genetic resources. This has reduced the loss of biodiversity in the country.

4.     The implementation of the project has provided a safe haven for 291 different bird species representing
48 families. Four globally threatened species ­ Baumann's Greenbul (Phyllastrephus baumani), Green-tailed
Bristlebill (Bleda eximia); Rofous-winged Illadopsis (Illadopsis rufescens) at Subri and Yellow-bearded
Greenbul (Criniger oliveraceus) are fully protected within the GSBA.

The project has led to the protection of first schedule species of Ghana's wholly protected species
(endangered species). This has increased the ecological security of globally significant biological resources,
especially within threatened arid and semi-arid, forest and mountain ecosystems.

5. The formation of Community Biodiversity Advisory Groups (CBAGs) has institutionalized the
involvement of local communities in natural resource management and enhanced off-reserve landscape


                                                              45

management especially in the management of woodlots, sacred groves and fruit trees in the dry marginal
forest areas. A new civil society which is active in sustainable forest management and which act as a pressure
group on resource service providers are emerging at community levels. The project developed adaptive
strategies that have improved community voice in decision-making and resource management including their
rights and responsibilities. The communities have been given a voice and space for participation in resource
management and improved access to, and transparency of, information on natural resource management in the
country

World Bank Performance

The Bank was flexible and adaptable in its lending approaches. During the lending phase, the Bank agreed to
extend the programme completion date twice to enable the programme meet its development objectives. The
Bank allowed re-allocation of funds to implement certain activities.

The Bank's Implementation Support Missions were constant and on schedule. Although, they turned to act as
supervisors and examiners in some cases, instead of partners, the actions agreed upon at the end of the
missions greatly helped to steer the programme to achieve the desired outputs. The Task Team Leader at the
Banks office in Accra provided technical back-stopping to the implementation process.

At various stages in the project implementation, the World Bank staff carried out a number of missions to
monitor and assess the project performance. The table 2.1 summarizes the number of missions conducted by
the World Bank during the project implementation, the personalities involved and performance rating from
the Government perceptive.

The project devised a reporting system to monitor implementation of project activity and output achievements
from community levels through district, regional, and national levels. Data collected were aggregated at
District and Regional levels and forwarded to the project Headquarters for the preparation of quarterly
reports. An electronic version of M & E system was designed and installed at district and regional offices
which were used for data aggregation. This reporting system provided the opportunity to establish databases
for biodiversity conservation monitoring and generated a lot of data on the biodiversity condition of the
GSBAs in the country. It also built the capacity of the Forestry Commission staff including the Managers and
the Range Supervisors in project management and resource management. These processes allowed the
beneficiary communities to participate in the project monitoring and evaluation.

The project developed adaptive strategies that have empowered communities in decision-making and resource
management including their rights and responsibilities.

Government Performance

The performance of the Ghana Government in the release of counterpart funds was satisfactory. The MFLM
managed to secure funding from other local sources to match the donor funds thus enabling the programme to
meet its development objectives. The project management complied with the credit agreements and
programme accounts were audited regularly.

A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was established, under the chairmanship of the Deputy Minister in charge
of forestry of the MLFM. The overall responsibility for project administration, procurement and financial
management and coordination rested on the Project Management Team which was headed by the Technical
Director in charge of Forestry of the MLFM.

The project partnered with various Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) during the implementation of
the project activities. Among these NGOs were the Ghana Wildlife Society, Friends of Rivers and Water


                                                             46

Bodies, Ecological Restoration, and ASNAPP. These NGOs were involved in community education and
awareness creation, training of community groups' project management and conflict resolution.

The project also engaged the services of financial institutions to nurture rural entrepreneurs in the
development of Alternative Livelihood Activities through banking and financial intermediation. The ARB
Apex Bank, disbursed US$2.53 million to participating rural and community banks for on-lending to project
beneficiaries. The respective rural banks are helping to cultivate the habit of savings and improve on their
financial literacy level.

The academia was also involved in the project implementation. Zypher Consult of the University of Ghana
Business School was contracted to develop Monitoring and Evaluation framework and an electronic tracking
system for the project. Focal persons were selected and trained in the application of the system. The faculty of
Renewable Natural Resources of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) was
contracted to conduct Flora and fauna surveys of all the GSBAs. The Centre for Biodiversity Utilization and
Development also at KNUST was engage in capacity development in small business enterprises and hand-on-
demonstration of biodiversity utilization for various business groups.

LESSONS LEARNED

        ·      The implementation of the project has created catalytic effects and has demonstrated the need
               to combine poverty alleviation and environmental concerns by investing in activities that will
               try to achieve tangible and immediate poverty alleviation through a more sustainable, or a less
               unsustainable use of the natural resource base.

        ·      Any strategy intervention that wishes to introduce a change from unsustainable to sustainable
               utilization must contain four basic, inter-linked, and interrelated services, namely:
:
               1    Financial incentives or investment opportunities for civil society to engage in improved
                    natural resources management that result in tangible poverty alleviation in the short and
                    medium term
               2    Extension/training/awareness creation
               3    Regulatory and conducive legal framework
               4    Effective implementation of the legal framework

        ·      The formulation and implementation of biodiversity conservation management plans as well as
               the implementation of alternative livelihood activities and the budgetary allocations to the
               Regional and District Forestry office on biodiversity issues demonstrate the existence and
               sustainability strategies put in place by the project.

Recommendations

a). Project implementation approach

        ·      Future biodiversity conservation project should have a comprehensive flexible logical
               framework with clear targets which could be used to assess project performance and adapt to
               changing conditions and build partnership in the implementation arrangement. The recipient
               through the logical framework should adapt to changes and adopt new strategies that can help
               achieve the project objectives without waiting for joint Implementation Support Missions with
               the donors before decisions on change could be effected.




                                                               47

b) Documentation and knowledge management


       ·    Biodiversity project should device means of ensuring continuous documentation and sharing of
            information. All data generated and lessons learnt should be shared not only with the
            technicians but also with the local communities who are the custodians and users of the
            resources. Future projects should consider knowledge generation and dissemination as part of
            the project management activities and not as a by-product.


c.)  Stakeholder participation

       ·    Stakeholder participation in project management should be well defined at all levels including
            consultation processes, information gathering sharing and dissemination. The participation of
            the civil society organization are very essential for project success, therefore project document
            should spell out the level of their involvement.

4.    Challenges and Issues

(i) The GSBAs and forest biodiversity in Ghana are currently facing some challenges. For example, in Ghana,
currently it is well known that mining prospecting and exploration concessions are being or have been given
out in the Atewa forest ranges and there is an ongoing discussion between the Government, environmental
agencies and local communities who are asking why the Government is granting bauxite prospecting and
exploration concessions in a designated GSBA. Other issues facing GSBAs are problems of illegal chainsaw
logging operators. There is a growing demand (3 times the export volumes) for timber and other wood
products domestically and this demand is far higher than what eligible timber utilization contract holders are
able to supply to the domestic market. Illegal timber harvesting may be a response to meeting the ever-
increasing demand for highly priced timber and other wood products on the domestic market, which are
unaffordable to most Ghanaians. In collaboration with the Forestry Commission, the project took a number of
steps to reduce illicit timber harvesting in the GSBAs. These included:



                                                            53

      · Deepening and intensifying public awareness and education campaign
      · Collaborating with communities in the fight against illegal timber harvesting operations by setting
          up and empowering CBAGs and Community Forest Management Committees (CFMC) at the
          community level to patrol on-and off-reserves
      · Instituting co-management and co-administration mechanisms and systems by engaging
          communities in conventional protected area management activities such as boundary cleaning, anti-
          poaching, patrolling, fire prevention and control, etc. Communities were paid wages for
          undertaking these assignments
      · Establishing social accountability systems by Government insisting that TUC holders seek
          concurrence from land owners and farm holders when submitting proposals for TUCs
      · Government review of the timber rights allocation procedure

(ii) Although the methodologies used in this rapid assessment does not support estimation of species densities,
medium to large mammal species appear to exist at relatively low densities throughout all the seven GSBAs.
A continuous drastic decline in large mammal populations in areas outside of the Wildlife Protection
Reserves or National Parks is one of the biodiversity conservation issues. This situation is attributable to the
combined effects of habitat loss and the ever increasing hunting pressure fueled by the economically lucrative
bushmeat trade.

(iii) Another issue of grave concern to the integrity and biodiversity value of the GSBAs is hunting pressure
in almost all the seven GSBAs assessed. The high dependence of people in most rural areas on bushmeat for
animal protein is such that hunting in most forest reserves and GSBAs may continue to increase with time
unless affordable alternative sources of protein are created in these localities. The CBAGs in the fringe
communities should be strengthened to prevent commercial hunting from the GSBAs. The intensity of
hunting pressure in most GSBAs is such that, the risk of local extinction of some large mammal species is
quite real. In areas such as Tano Offin and Atewa, the combination of high hunting pressure, chainsawing
and farm encroachments has the potential to erode the high biodiversity values for which they were
designated as GSBAs.

6. A total of 92 species of butterflies belonging to nine families were recorded. The nymphalids which are
typically associated with forest conditions were the most diverse with 35 species. Sixteen species of
Pieridae were encountered with Eurema spp, and Leptosia alcesta being the most abundant Eurema spp
usually associated with open spaces in and along fringes of the forest blocks whiles Leptosia spp, is usually
encountered in the undergrowths of high canopy forests.

7. With the exception of Tano Offin and Atewa, all the other sites assessed have maintained their habitat
integrity, with very minimal physical signs of human disturbances. Habitat conditions at Tano Offin and
Atewa have significantly deteriorated through chainsawing and extensive farm encroachments. The
implementation of activities of the project along with the various intervention measures such as the micro-
credit scheme in the neighboring communities appear to have achieved little in stemming the forest
degradation in the Tano Offin and Atewa GSBAs.

8. Rapid unmeasured sampling techniques employed widely in floral surveys in Ghana, was adopted for the
survey in the seven GSBAs selected subjectively to represent the forest types: Wet Evergreen, Moist
Evergreen, Upland evergreen and Southern Dry forests. The samples sites were chosen in relation to
position in landscape e.g. hilly areas, slopes, swamps, riparian strips, etc. Vascular plant species
encountered were recorded within the sample unit along existing roads, foot paths etc. Data obtained were
analyzed to generate indices of biodiversity measures e.g. Genetic Heat Index (GHI), Economic Index (EI),
and Pioneer Index (PI) for assessing the bioquality of the GSBAs using the `star rating system' (Hawthorne,
1996). Other derived parameters such as forest condition score, species richness, relative abundance, and
percentage of native and exotic etc. were used to make informed judgments on the vegetation quality..

9. Baseline information on flora and fauna.

Baseline studies were conducted for some critical areas of biodiversity maintenance as shown below:

Socio-economic surveys were conducted for forest communities living close to 24 of the GSBAs. All socio-
economic survey reports for these GSBAs were useful inputs in the management planning process. They
also provided the baseline information that was required for the design of the alternative livelihood
investment scheme.

Feasibility studies on Ecotourism Potential. The project financed studies to determine potentials of the
GSBAs and SDFs for ecotourism development. The studies indicated that most of the sites including
Atewa and Apedwa Forest Range, Cape Three Points and the cluster of SDFs could be prime areas for
community-based ecotourism development. The project was in touch with the Tourist Board to do an initial
assessment and to build the right linkages with the concerned District Assemblies. The initial assessment
included identification of caves, possible locations of walk trails, canopy walkways, among others.

Aerial survey and videography were effective tools for assessing resource status. Under a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) between the FC and Conservation International, the latter conducted an aerial survey
and videography that covered 22 GSBAs for the establishment of digital database to support management
decisions. This was executed and the product of this activity has been installed.

Research into modern perspectives of provenance protection. Through inventories conducted in the early
90s by the FSD, some provenance areas that possess a considerable population of scarlet species of some
desirable features and characteristics have been identified and these areas have been designated
appropriately as PPAs. These areas are to serve as sources of genetic material or gene banks for the
sustenance of economically threatened, highly commercial timber species.




                                                           55

Floral surveys. Botanical surveys were conducted for all the GSBAs to assess their floral content and also to
provide vital knowledge about the vegetation e.g. occurrence and distribution of species of very high
conservation priority, such as the black star species. An innovation that resulted from the study was the
identification of focal areas, which were, intended as permanent areas within the GSBAs with good
documentation of species content, for various purposes e.g. research, ecotourism, etc.

Faunal Surveys. An MoU was signed with the Institute of Renewable Natural Resources of the Kwame
Nkrumah University of Science and Technology to conduct faunal surveys for some 24 priority GSBAs.

Conservation Strategy for Talbotiella gentii The project through the Environmental Conservation Unit of
RMSC and in collaboration with the Department of Botany, University of Ghana formulated a conservation
strategy for Talbotiella gentii. The implementation of the strategy was carried out by an NGO, Ecological
Restoration, in collaboration with the communities.

Great Ape Survival Plan. The project initiated the development of the Great Ape Survival Plan with the
Wildlife Division as the supervising agency. A consultant completed a study on targeted primates which
was validated at a stakeholder workshop.

10. The CIF process was fraught with the following problems: (i) initial misconception about CIF being
grants and not loans; (ii) lack of a ready market for the produce of some business groups; (iii) some unique
problems such as: (a) interpersonal clashes between business group members; (b) opportunistic tendencies
of influential community members; (c) jealousies directed at successful business group members by other
community members; and (d) apathy of community members who are non-beneficiaries of CIF towards
other project activities; (iv) some banks had felt that CIF business was forced on them and were reluctant to
offer advice and generally help business groups to thrive and be profitable; and (v) poor monitoring of loans
and businesses by some banks. There were also a few pockets of discontentment, resulting likely from
miscommunication and impatience on the part of community members who could not access the Fund or
had some difficulty with the use of the funds.

Annex 11:             Additional Information (for GEF purposes)

1      Analysis of attainment of global environmental objectives

Achievements. The project was successful in achieving its objectives. With the inception of the project,
conditions of the forests within the GSBAs located in the four regions within the High Forest Zone; Ashanti,
Eastern, Central and Western regions, have improved as a consequence of the sustainable management
regimes and enforcement of forest protection and resource conservation rules and regulations. The
identification of 30 forest reserves and their exclusion from timber harvesting on the merit of their high
significance as biodiversity-rich areas has led to: (a) improved forest regeneration; (b) reduced illegal tree
felling and group hunting; (c) significant reduction in the drying up of water bodies.

Effective partnership arrangements were established for implementation of the project with relevant
stakeholders involved in the country/region. For example, in the course of EIA preparation, twenty-five
communities were surveyed, the majority of which were situated adjacent to forest reserves or protected areas.
Comments received during the public consultation process were taken into account in producing the final
project EIA and the Environmental Management Plan.

Lessons learned. During preparation, the project design took into account lessons learned from previous
Bank-assisted projects in the forestry sector in Ghana, including: (i) Forest Resource Management Project;
(ii) Environmental Resource Management Project; and (iii) Coastal Wetlands Management Project.

Logical framework was used during implementation as a management and M&E tool.


For additional information and analysis, please refer to sections 3.2 (Outcome/achievement of objective) and
Annex 2 (Outputs by components) of this document.

2      Country ownership and drivenness

The project concept was consistent with Ghana's national, sectoral or development plans, such as the
government's natural resource policy embodied in the Forestry and Wildlife Policy and the Forest
Development Master Plan (1996-2000). The project was developed by the Government with the active
participation of the MLFM, FC and Ministry of Finance. Indicators of government commitment included the
preparation of the National Biodiversity Strategy and the Protected Areas Systems Plan, and implementation
of the Forest Development Master Plan.

The project has been firmly established with institutional and legal structures which will ensure its
sustainability. The GSBA sites have been legally constituted and pillared within the broader conservation
principles with active stakeholder participation that can produce significant gains for biodiversity
conservation as well as the development of rural economies. Overall, the government is interested in ensuring
that a bigger portion of the nation is put under conservation and that adequate resources are allocated for
maintenance.

At the policy level, the government is seriously committed to biodiversity conservation. Government is
signatory to a number of global and international conventions and agreements, including the Convention on
Biological Diversity, CITES, Ramsar (Wetlands) Convention, the International Tropical Timber Agreement,
etc. The Government's active engagement in the Africa Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (AFLEG)
Initiative and the current round of negotiations on the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) with the
European Union (EU) for managing forests and timber exploitation in Ghana attests to this commitment.



                                                              57

In the first 3-4 years, government commitment was low in terms of adequacy and timely allocation of
counterpart funding. After MTR, the Bank changed the expenditure ratio to 100% and the issue of counterpart
funding was thus resolved. Government commitment improved considerably in the later part of the project.

3     Stakeholder participation and public involvement (including gender)

The project was characterized by a strong participatory approach from the outset. Project preparation included
consultation, collaboration, and information sharing with stakeholders and beneficiaries such as
cultivators/community groups, intermediary NGOs, academic institutions, local governments, and donors.
Project preparation included a number of innovative pilots to involve communities and specifically targeted
stakeholder groups (e.g., rural women, youth groups) in harvesting and management of non-timber forest
resources, maintenance of boundaries and firebreaks and other revenue-generating enterprises.

Personnel of the Ghana Wildlife Society (GWS) and other agencies were consulted on the definition of
community education and public awareness components financed by the project, the design of research,
monitoring and evaluation procedures, and guidance on implementing community investment components of
the project based on the experience gained under the GEF-financed Coastal Wetlands Management Project.

4     Replication approach/potential

Areas which have replication potential include the following:

      ·     Community Investment Fund (CIF). This would enable group or individual beneficiaries in
            beneficiary communities to invest loans contracted under the CIF into setting up alternative
            income generating ventures at the village level.

      ·     Decision-making and resource management.           The approach adopted by the project would
            empower community members in natural resource management, such as participation in decision-
            making and resource management. The formation of the CBAGs would also create a social
            platform where groups could meet regularly to plan for their communities and undertake social
            activities aimed at helping one another in the society.

5     Monitoring and evaluation

M&E Design. The M&E portion of the project was very weak at the design stage. The PAD had indicated that
M&E would be undertaken by the Project Planning and Monitoring and Evaluation Department (PPMED) of
the MLFM. Some of the problems related to M&E in this project were: (i) No baseline studies (matrix of
indicators and levels of monitoring). (ii) No M&E system in place at appraisal. (iii) Technically competent
officers lacked hands-on training in M&E and administrative guidance.

M&E implementation. In 2004 the project contracted the University of Ghana Business School to develop a
comprehensive electronic tracking system for monitoring and evaluation. The M&E system used the logical
framework with a comprehensive matrix of output indicators (See 1, Annex 10 for details), and activity-
output-impact linkages which provided a conceptual framework for both impact evaluation and performance
monitoring. The framework established a baseline indicator for evaluation and ensured that the project
deliverables were clearly linked to the expected results, and clearly specified impact indicators and their
measurements. A reporting system to monitor implementation of project activity and output achievements
from community levels through to district regional and national levels. Data collection was at the district and
regional levels whilst aggregation using ACCESS software was done at the regional level and forwarded to
the project headquarters.


                                                            58

M&E utilization. Appropriate data collected by the FC were used for formulating decisions and resource
allocation in the sector and to guide overall project and sector development. For example, M&E data were
used for finalizing collaborative resource management policy for the country. The M&E system for the
project has now been adopted as the building block of the FC.

6     Cost Effectiveness

The project did not lend itself to conventional economic and financial analyses since no monetary value can
be placed on species and ecosystem conservation. However, the project outcome is deemed efficient based on
the project's following outcomes.

      ·     biodiversity management is now fully integrated into the core business planning of the FC.
      ·     awareness on the importance, willingness and need to protect forest by community members has
            been high as they now appreciate and recognize a link between forest health and their own
            livelihoods.
      ·     biodiversity issues have been incorporated into national processes, including the current Growth
            and Poverty Reduction Strategy-GPRS II.
      ·     communities, traditional leaders and District Assemblies are now involved in natural resource
            management, monitoring and coordination of environmental protection and improvement of
            activities at district and community levels
      ·     through the livelihood support program the project has promoted positive relationship between
            economic development and natural resource conservation within the rural economies. This has
            made environmental quality a key element in supporting rural economic and social development
            in the forest regions.
      ·     A sense of ownership of the project as a result of massive sensitization measures, campaigns,
            joint programs and collaborative approaches to project activities has been created.
