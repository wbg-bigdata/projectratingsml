A. PROGRAM AND PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
1. Program development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1)
The development objective of the Natural Resource Management Program (NRMP) is to protect,
rehabilitate and sustainably manage national land, forest and wildlife resources and to sustainably
increase the income of rural communities who own these resources. Progress would be measured by: (i)
improvement in the policy and regulatory environment for high forest management and timber industry
development; (ii) enhanced local community involvement in management of the high forest and savanna
woodland zones and improved flow of benefits to communities from resource sales; (iii) community and
farner adoption of improved land and water management techniques; (iv) improved management of
wildlife resources while increasing their contribution to local livelihoods and economic development; and
(iv) implementation of the Forest Protection Strategy to enhance conservation of globally significant
biodiversity in forest reserves and national parks.
The ten-year program has been designed to be implemented in three phases: a first phase of two
years, followed by two four-year phases. The full program will address issues of conservation,
enhancement and sustainable utilization of Ghana's land, forest, savanna woodland and wildlife
resources. The first phase objective would be to establish an effective national policy and institutional
firamework for sustainable natural resource management and to develop and test collaborative resource
management systems. Project activities in this phase would therefore concentrate on finalizing policy
reform, undertaking institutional restructuring and strengthening and initiating baseline surveys/pilot
projects associated with collaborative resource management programs. Conditional on successful
implementation of the first phase, the second phase objective would be to establish collaborative
management systems for forest, savanna and wildlife resources, in priority sites from
environmentallsocial/economic perspectives. In the third phase, the objective would be to extend
implementation of the program country-wide and ensure institutionalization of collaborative management
systems of natural resource management. Benchmarks indicating the successful completion of each
phase and triggering the commencement of subsequent phase are outlined in Section C: Program and
Project Description Summary, and detailed in Annex 1, Tables 1 and 2.
2. Program global objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1)
The global environment objective is to increase the ecological security of globally significant
biological resources, especially within threatened tropical moist forest ecosystems. Specific objectives
are to: (i) protect a significant portion of forest biodiversity through implementing an ecosystem approach
to management within the high forest zone that involves strengthening management of national parks and
taking selected high-biodiversity forest reserves out of production; (ii) improve knowledge of the
distribution and status of rare, threatened and endemic species through targeted surveys to better focus
conservation measures; (iii) enhance biodiversity protection within multiple-use production forests
through exclusion of critical habitats from logging; and (iv) ensure sustainability and preserve genetic
diversity within non-timber forest species that rural populations use for medicinal and consumptive
purposes by means of improved data collection, monitoring, harvest regulation and sustainable
management within forest reserves. Progress would be measured by the number of hectares of high
conservation priority forests brought under effective management, the stability of threatened and rare
species populations and the increased security of natural habitats.

3. Project development objective and key performance indicators (seeAnnex 1)
The development objective of the first Natural Resource Management Project (NRMP I) is to
establish the institutional and policy framework for implementing ecologically and socio-economically
sustainable management systems for high forest, savanna woodland and wildlife resources, in
collaboration with local communities. Key indicators signifying the successful completion of NRMP I
are summarized as milestones in the Section C below and set forth in more detail in Annex 1, Table 1.
B. STRATEGIC CONTEXT
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project
The project is consistent with the Bank's CAS for Ghana (Report No. 17002-Gi, dated August
13, 1997 and discussed by the Board on September 2, 1997) in that it aims to promote environmentally
sustainable social and economic development by capacity building within communities to encourage
environmental protection and sustainable natural resource management; and contribute to rural poverty
reduction by increasing the sustainable production of tradable commodities by the rural poor.
2. GEF Operational Strategy/program objective addressed by the project
The project would address the conservation of tropical forest ecosystems by strengthening the
network of conservation areas in Ghana and reinforcing the development of sustainable use and
management systems for biodiversity resources. By financing the incremental cost of addressing global
and regional biodiversity conservation priorities within the framework of the National Biodiversity
Strategy and the Forest Protection Strategy, GEF funding would complement IDA and bilateral donor-
financed programs for development of forest production systems that are environmentally and socially
sustainable, and for management of protected areas. The project targets the approximately eight percent
of moist tropical forests in Ghana that, based on a comprehensive national forest inventory, rank highest
in terms of their global importance for biodiversity. This systematic evaluation of threat and rarity,
covering more than 1000 tree species, carried out under the DFID-financed Forest Inventory and
Management Project is unparalleled in the West Africa region in terms of its scope and
comprehensiveness. Protection of these forests would secure representation of a significant fraction of
the biodiversity of the upper Guinea-Congolean forest formation within a well-connected network of
forest reserves. Additional priorities to be addressed by the project include the biologically unique
southern dry forests of the Dahomey Gap that separates the two major high forest formations of western
and central Africa, and the montane outlier forest of the Kyabobo highlands, the last disjunct forest within
the savanna corridor that is the only place where elements of the eastern and western forest blocks
intermingle, forming a globally unique composite biota.
3. Main sector issues and Government strategy
Ghana comprises two broad ecological zones: the high forest and the savanna. The high forest
zone covers roughly one third of the country and supports two thirds of the population. Most of the
country's economic activity (cocoa, oilpalm, rubber, timber and mining) is concentrated in this zone. At
the turn of the century, the area of high forest was 8.2 million ha, but this has been reduced to about 1.7
million ha today, of which 1.64 million ha is within the 216 forest reserves gazetted in the 1930s. Since
then, almost all off-reserve forest has been clear-felled under a deliberate policy to open up farm land. It
was not until 1994 that this policy was reversed and controls were put in place to extend harvesting of
the small remaining off-reserve resource over a longer period. The boundaries of the reserves are still



-3 -
intact today, with very little farm encroachment. Within the reserves, about 0.4 million ha are degraded
(mainly by bushfires) and in need of replanting, 0.35 million ha are classified as needing permanent
protection (hill and swamp sanctuaries, biodiversity, etc.), and the remaining 0.9 million ha are classified
suitable for timber production. Based on recent forest inventories, the estimated sustainable annual
allowable cut (AAC) from the high forest is 1.0 million m3 of round logs for the wood processing
industry -- with half coming from reserve forests and half from scattered trees on farmland, off-reserve.
The actual tree harvest is difficult to quantify accurately because of illegal felling -- but it is generally
accepted to be at least twice this level.
The savanna zone covers the drier northern two thirds of the country, where the main economic
activities are the production of annual crops (cereals, root crops and cotton) and livestock. Woodland
covers about 9.4 million ha of the savanna zone, producing mainly woodfuel and a small amount of
building poles for local use. An estimated 70 percent of Ghana's primary energy requirements come
from woodfuel, and this comprises about 10.0 million m3 of firewood and an additional 4.0 million m3
converted into charcoal for use in urban areas. Although current aggregate woodfuel supply exceeds
demand, regional deficits occur in the Upper East, Volta and Brong-Ahafo regions.
Historically, the main cause of deforestation in the high forest zone has been the need for more
agricultural land, rather than the quest for timber or fuelwood. Other inter-linking factors contributing to
an expanding agricultural acreage are the declining productivity of land under shifting cultivation,
resulting from a shorter fallow period caused by increased population pressure, and the movement of
cocoa farmers into the Western Region in response to disease problems in the traditional growing areas.
Land degradation associated with loss of vegetative cover and improper farming practices is an
increasing problem in the country, and was identified in the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP)
as one of the major environmental issues in Ghana.
The national system of Protected Areas for wildlife includes fifteen gazetted conservation sites
encompassing 1.2 million ha. Shortages of operating funds and qualified personnel within the Wildlife
Department (WD) have left many of these areas lacking effective management for more than a decade.
Rural communities living adjacent to the reserves tend to be alienated and often engage in poaching,
which the WD is unable to control. Wildlife damage to crops is a chronic problem for farmers living
close to reserves, and at present no compensation is paid. To date, little effort has been made to engage
neighboring communities around Protected Areas in supporting wildlife management programs through
outreach and extension activities.
The key natural resource management issues in Ghana today are land and forest degradation and
the loss of biodiversity associated with unsustainable harvesting levels, in the high forest and potentially
the savanna zones, and with inappropriate farming practices. In the high forest, where the problem is
more easily quantifiable, the current logging rate is unsustainable, and the commercial existence of
several tree species is under severe threat. The main underlying problems include (i) a forest royalty
system that does not price trees at their real economic value; (ii) ineffective sectoral institutions with
overlapping responsibilities; (iii) insufficient involvement of communities who own the trees and
woodlands in the management of the resource, coupled with negligible economic returns when the
resource is utilized; (iv) a relatively inefficient milling industry with access to a dwindling but currently
underpriced natural resource -- and therefore not encouraged to invest in either new equipment or
industrial wood plantations; (v) weak institutional capacity in the wildlife sector and little involvement of
communities in the management and sustainable use of the wildlife resource; and (vi) weak inter-agency
coordination in planning and monitoring natural resource use, particularly at the regional and district
levels.



-4-
Ghana is notable in that all forest and savanna woodland reserves are owned by the local
communities and traditional authorities, and government's role is to manage these resource in trust for the
people. This situation is reflected in Government's natural resource policy embodied in the Forestry and
Wildlife Policy and the Forest Development Master Plan (1996-2000). This policy aims to: (i) ensure a
sustained and adequate supply of forest and woodland products; (ii) prevent further environmental
degradation due to forest depletion and inappropriate farming practices; and (iii) stimulate community
involvement in the management of the resources and enhance the economic well-being of rural residents.
To support this policy, reforms will be directed at forest revenue policy and concessions allocation
procedures, restructuring of sector institutions responsible for forest, savanna woodland and wildlife
resource management, and strengthening sector institutions responsible for environmental management
coordination. Work on these reforms has already begun. A new Timber Resource Management Act,
covering revised concession allocation procedures and providing for enhanced royalties, became law in
March 1998; and by late 1998 this is expected to be accompanied by a new Forest Service Act which will
pave the way for forestry institutional reform. Companion wildlife legislation is also being prepared, and
work has begun on a draft Land Policy.
Other relevant government strategy documents include the National BiodiversityStrategy and the
Forest Protection Strategy which seek to: (i) safeguard genetic diversity and diversity of indigenous
species through an ecosystem approach to management within the high forest zone; (ii) improve
knowledge of the distribution and status of rare, threatened and endemic species through targeted
surveys; (iii) enhance the protection of critical areas for migratory species through improved monitoring
and habitat management; and (iv) ensure sustainability and preserve genetic diversity within timber and
non-timber forest species by improved data collection, regulation of harvesting, and proactive
management for sustainable production within forest reserves.
4. Sector issues to be addressed by the program and strategic choices
The program would underwrite the implementation of the Forest Development Master Plan and
the Forest Protection Strategy and continue to support implementation of the National Environmental
Action Plan (NEAP) currently underway with support from the IDA- and GEF-funded Environmental
Resources Management Project (ERMP). It would address major sectoral issues and aim to sustainably
increase the supply of forest products through project interventions to: (a) support community-based high
forest, savanna woodland, and wildlife resource management; (b) stimulate private investment in off-
reserve tree planting and reforestation of degraded areas in forest reserves; (c) encourage efficiency of
the logging and wood processing industry; (d) support improved management and monitoring of forest
biodiversity through the establishment of special biological protection areas within the existing system of
forest reserves that explicitly incorporate biodiversity conservation as an integral management objective;
and (e) promote better coordination between ministries and agencies involved in management and
monitoring of environmental resources. These sectoral issues are closely inter-linked. Increasing
efficiency of the wood processing industry will require an increase in private investment that will only be
forthcoming if reliable supplies of raw materials can be assured. Reforestation of degraded areas of
reserves will be most efficiently achieved through private involvement in plantation development that
would contribute to more secure industry access to future supplies of raw materials. Community-based
forest and woodland management would both increase the economic retums realized by rural residents
and provide a direct involvement of the stakeholders with the most to gain in terms of environmental
benefits from improved resource management. Enhanced management of biodiversity resources,
including better fire control and assured access to sustainable supplies of non-timber forest products,



-5-
would benefit rural communities as well as preserve future options for the local, national and global
communities.
C. PROGRAM AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION SUMMARY
1. Ghana Natural Resource Management Program
The program would be implemented in three phases, the first covering a period of two years, and
the second and third covering four years each. The first phase (NRMP I), to be funded through an
Adaptable Program Credit (APC), would concentrate on finalizing policy reform and enacting legislation
related to resource pricing and forest concession allocation and management; restructuring and
strengthening sector institutions; completing resource assessments and undertaking baseline technical and
socio-economic studies; and piloting collaborative resource management programs. Conditional on the
successful implementation of this project, the second phase (NRMP II) would support the initial
implementation of the collaborative resource management programs, focusing on selected sites
considered priorities from environmental, economic or social points of view. The third phase (NRMP III)
would complete implementation of the program country-wide and ensure that the system of collaborative
management with local communities are properly institutionalized at national, regional and district levels.
The key indicators of successful completion of each phase are outlined below and detailed in Annex 1,
Tables 1 and 2. Achievement of these milestones would trigger the subsequent phase to be funded by
successive APCs. IThe total cost of the three-phase program is estimated at US$90 million, of which it is
proposed that IDA would finance US$30 million and GEF US$8.7 million. The remaining funds would
come from GOG and a range of donors who would fund discrete aspects of the program through parallel
financing arrangements -- under the coordination of the Ministry of Lands and Forestry (MILF).

2. Natural Resource Management Project I - Project components
NRMP I is designed to comprise five components: (i) High Forest Resource Management; (ii)
Savanna Resource Management; (iii) Wildlife Resource Management; (iv) Environmental Management
Coordination; and (v) Biodiversity Conservation. Total project costs are estimated at US$25.7 million.
High Forest Resource Management (US$14.2 million).  The project would assist the
government to design and implement further sectoral policy and institutional reforms to substantially
increase forest royalty rates and enhance revenue capture; improve concession allocation procedures and
concession management; improve sustainability of the forest industry through the introduction of new
legislation; and by streamlining mandates of forest sector agencies and strengthening their
implementation capacity. The project would build on the experience of the pilot Collaborative Forest
Management Initiative in participatory forest management and conservation education, and mainstream
collaborative management into the operational procedures of the new Ghana Forest Service (GFS), and
promote the development of privately owned plantations to supply the wood processing industry, as
harvesting from natural forests continues to decline. Specific activities of this component would be to: (i)
establish and operationalize the Ghana Forest service (GFS); (ii) merge the Timber Export Development
Board and the Forest Products Inspection Bureau to form the Timber Industry Development Board
(TIDB); (iii) introduce a forest certification and computerized log tracking system; (iv) undertake a log
export ban study; (v) prepare and publish a National Forestry Plan; (vi) prepare twelve priority Reserve
Management Plans and analyze the costs/benefits of collaborative management system in six of these;
(vii) initiate pilots to explore collaborative approaches to forest management off-reserve in two districts;
(viii) establish a central bushfire detection system and initiate green fire break program in five reserves;
and (ix) design a financing mechanism for private sector plantation development, including legal
framework and operating policies/procedures.
Savanna Resource Management (US$4.5 million). The project would help improve the
operational framework for harvesting and processing woodfuels; and strengthen field extension capacity
by creation of a multidisciplinary resource management center to work in collaboration with local
communities and the district level environmental and planning committees to promote integrated
management of soil, water, and natural land cover. Pilot activities to improve woodland management and
revenue generation with increased local community involvement would be developed, along with
initiatives to improve woodfuel marketing and utilization. Specific component activities would be to: (i)
establish and operationalize the proposed Savanna Resource Management Center (SRMC) with staff
from Ministry of Lands and Forestry (MLF), Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA), Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME); (ii) complete an assessment of



-7 -
natural resources of the savanna zone; (iii) plan and initiate six community-based resource management
pilots on-reserve; (iv) complete surveys and planning for pilots in six priority watersheds off-reserve; and
(v) complete a survey of woodfuel markets/marketing and organize a national woodfuels workshop.
Wildlife Resource Management (US$3.2 million). Based on a master plan currently being
finalized by the Wildlife Department (WD), the project would reorient and strengthen the management of
the Department, develop its capacity to enhance the economic and social sustainability of wildlife
management programs, and foster closer collaboration between WD and rural communities, the private
sector, NGOs and other partners. The project would also: support the implementation of management
and infrastructure development plans for selected protected areas; support community-based initiatives to
develop sustainable systems for bushmeat production; promote private sector and community
involvement in wildlife-related economic activities such as ecotourism, game ranching, and live animal
export; and improve public understanding and support for wildlife conservation and management through
public education. Specific NRMP I activities would be to: (i) restructure the Wildlife Department, recruit
new staff and initiate training programs; (ii) revise all Protected Areas management plans and
operationalize these through the introduction of annual work planning procedures; (iii) prioritize
proposed infrastructure development programs at each site to be implemented in later phases; and (iv)
develop extension capacity within WD to support district- and community-level wildlife conservation and
management.
Environmental Management Coordination (US$1.5 million). The project would support EPA
to implement its Strategic Vision for environmental management coordination; and, through EPA and the
Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD), strengthen the capacity of district-
level environmental management committees to prepare local environmental action plans based on
catchment-level land use planning. Support would also be provided for action required under the UN
Desertification Convention and for expansion and development of the existing EIS to encompass high
forest, savanna and wildlife resources. Specific NRMP I activities would be to: (i) implement EPA's
revised human resources development (HRD) Plan, based on the newly developed Strategic Vision; (ii)
develop regional and district EIS and the proposed geo-spatial information framework; and (iii) prepare a
National Action Program to Combat Desertification.
Biodiversity Conservation (US$9.4 million for a six-year program). With GEF support, the
project would implement key elements of the Forest Protection Strategy and the National Biodiversity
Strategy over a six-year program corresponding to the first two phases of NRMP. The project would
strengthen the biodliversity conservation and management capacity of GFS; protect priority conservation
areas within existing production forest reserves; establish selected reserves as Globally Significant
Biodiversity Areas (GSBAs) that will be taken out of production; and initiate pilot activities to generate
revenues from activities other than logging in selected forest reserves, including ecotourism, sustainable
production of non-timber forest products, and restoration of degraded forest lands through commercial
plantations. The project would assist the government in strengthening its capacity for community-based
participatory management and for implementing improved technical management practices to enhance
the environmental sustainability of production forest management. Specific biodiversity conservation
activities in the first two years of the program, corresponding to NRMP I, would be to: (i) undertake
baseline studies to identify GSBAs and demarcate 25 percent of the areas identified; (ii) establish a
Biodiversity Advisory Group and train GFS and WD staff to organize and implement collaborative
management programs for GSBAs; (iii) identify and demarcate provenance reserves within production
forest reserves; and (iv) define the scope and operating modalities for an alternative livelihood investment
program acceptable to communities, the government and GEF. The estimated cost of the first two years
of the program is US$2.26 million.

Project Costs. The total cost of the project (including only the first two years of the GEF-
financed program) is US$25.7 million. The cost of activities supported by IDA would be US$10.1
million, financed from  a proposed Credit of US$9.3 million. The six-year biodiversity conservation
program would cost US$9.4 million, supported by a GEF grant of US$8.7 million -- of which US$2.1
million would be disbursed in the first two years, corresponding to NRMP I. Total cofinancing would be
US$12.1 million. The major portion (US$6.8 million) has already been committed by DFID, and the
remaining US$5.3 million are expected to be committed by other donors (Danida, AfDB, EU, the
Netherlands and WFP) before the end of 1998. GOG's contribution to NRMP I would be US$2.2
million. A detailed description of NRMP 1 is given in Annex 2 and a detailed cost breakdown is given in
Annex 3.
3. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project
The key policy reforms to be addressed by the project relate to the sustainable use of timber from
the high forest zone, increasing the efficiency of the wood processing industry, and fostering plantation
development. These policy reforms are embodied in two pieces of legislation -- the Timber Resource
Management Act and the Forest Service Bill. The former was passed by parliament in December 1997
and became law in March 1998, while the latter is expected to be tabled in Parliament by mid-1998.
Major issues addressed in the first piece of legislation include increased forest royalty rates and systems
to enhance revenue collection; and improved concession allocation procedures and management
requirements, including better monitoring of concession management, independent technical auditing,
public reporting and some form of performance bonding. The Forest Service Bill would allow for the
establishment of GFS. A log export ban is currently in force, primarily as a result of the inability of
sector institutions in their present state to control illegal logging. The institutional problem would be
addressed by the project. At the same time, the log export ban would be reviewed, analyzing the use of
alternate mechanisms that might achieve the same objective, but at lower economic cost.
Institutional reform would include: restructuring the Forest Department into an autonomous
Forest Service; merging two existing public sector organizations to form the Timber Industry
Development Board; significant restructuring and management reorientation of the Wildlife Department;
and the creation of a multidisciplinary Savanna Resource Management Center, which in time would
devolve its functions to district assemblies.
4. Benefits and target population
The main benefits of the project would be (a) the sustainable management of Ghana's natural
resources with increased economic benefits from these resources flowing to the communities who own
them, and (b) more efficient government institutions providing better service to resource owners, at less



- 9-
public cost. The principal project beneficiaries would be rural communities who own the natural
resources; with secondary beneficiaries being the private sector operators who use the resources and the
public institutions responsible for planning and monitoring their sustainable use.  Institutional
restructuring within the public sector is aimed at improving public sector management efforts while
reducing government expenditure and improving forest and wildlife resource rent capture and collection.
Improved processing efficiency within the wood processing and finishing industry would benefit both
rural workers and artisans by increased employment, through investments in secondary processing (due
to more assured supplies of raw material) and a high level of sustainable forest industrial activity in the
medium to long term through enhanced efficiency of resource utilization and reforestation.
Environmentally sustainable woodland management in the savanna zone would enhance rural incomes as
well as generate ancillary environmental benefits to rural communities in the form of improved soil,
water and wildlife habitat management. Community participation in wildlife resource management
would increase revenues captured and retained, while development of compatible uses such as
ecotourism would increase locally retained revenues from wildlife resources by rural communities living
adjacent to the reserves. Improved conservation of biodiversity will ensure a sustainable supply of non-
timber forest products such as medicinal plants which contribute differentially to the health and well-
being of the poorest population segments. Expected global benefits include maintenance of genetic
diversity within natural populations of commercially valuable timber species, conservation of regionally
and locally endemic species within their native habitats, and preservation of unique ecosystems that
characterize the region through effective landscape-level management.  A properly functioning
monitoring and evaluation system is recognized by MLF as essential.
5. Institutional and implementation arrangements
The Government of Ghana -- through the Ministries of Lands and Forestry (MLF), Food and
Agriculture (MOFA), Environment, Science & Technology (MEST), Local Government and Rural
Development (MLGRD), and Mines and Energy (MME) -- would be responsible for ensuring that the
project is undertaken as planned. MLF would act as lead ministry for implementation of the project.
Executing agencies. The project would be implemented primarily through the existing
government institutions or departments of the relevant line ministries:
*  policy and institutional changes would be managed by MLF.
*  high forest resource management (integrated forest resource management; forest resource
management off-reserve; and biodiversity conservation activities) would be undertaken by
the proposed Forestry Service.
*  wildlife resource management would be undertaken by the Wildlife Department.
*  environmental management coordination would be undertaken by EPA.
Savanna resource management requires a multidisciplinary approach, and would be undertaken
by the proposed Savanna Resources Management Center, to be established under the project with staff
seconded from MLF, MOFA, EPA and MME. The Center will work closely with district assemblies, and
at an appropriate time its responsibilities would devolve to district assemblies, in line with government's
decentralization policy. Investments in plantation development and wood industry restructuring would be
undertaken solely by the private sector, including existing and new industrial investors and individual or
community landowners.
Project coordination. Interministerial cooperation and donor coordination would be achieved
through a Project Coordination Committee (PCC). It would be under the chairmanship of the Technical



- 10-
Director of MLF, with representation at Director level from all participating ministries, the private sector
(plantations/logging/processing, crop and livestock farmers), NGOs and relevant academic institutions. It
would meet as required, but at least on a quarterly basis, to review proposed work programs and budgets,
monitor implementation performance, and foster inter-agency cooperation in sound management of the
country's natural resources.
Project management Overall responsibility for project management and coordination (annual
work plan preparation; budgeting and finance; procurement; progress reporting) would rest with a Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) within the MLF, headed by the Technical Director and supported by an
experienced Project Administrator, a qualified Financial Controller, and four administrative staff. This
unit was established under the IDA-financed Forest Resource Management Project (FRMP) and has been
functioning effectively for at least five years. Staff of the unit are fully conversant with Bank
procurement guidelines and reporting requirements. Auditors' reports on FRMP have always reported
positively on the adequacy of the internal controls in the financial management system operated by the
PCU. Nevertheless, financial management arrangements for NRMP are currently being reviewed, and an
action plan to address any deficiencies identified would be agreed with IDA prior to Credit Effectiveness.
Auditing of project accounts for NRMP would continue to be done externally.
Monitoring and evaluation. This would be undertaken by the Project Planning and Monitoring
and Evaluation Department (PPMED) of MLF. This unit was established and equipped under FRMP, but
to date has performed inadequately. It would be considerably strengthened under NRMP through the
provision of technical assistance and training.
Community collaboration. Pilot participatory management programs within the high forest zone
have already been initiated by the Collaborative Forest Management Unit within the Forestry Department
(FD) of the MLF; and in the savanna regions local NGOs have been working successfully with
government and donors to promote community managed operations, particularly in potable water supply.
NGOs have also been engaged by the Wildlife Department to help in conflict resolution with
communities in areas adjacent to national parks. These provide a basis for expanding the formal
involvement of local organizations in wildlife and forest reserve management. The presence of an active
and growing community of conservation NGOs and the project's intention to engage this community in
monitoring and evaluation of program performance as well as in key aspects of program implementation
will improve transparency, accountability and, ultimately, performance of the public agencies responsible
for executing the program.
Cofinancing. Parallel financing of the program is expected from a number of donors. DFID has
cofinanced previous forestry and environmental projects in Ghana with IDA, and will participate in
NRMP, concentrating on high forest resource management -- establishment of the Forest Service (which
they are currently supporting under the US$6.8 million FSDP), and operationalizing collaborative forest
management programs. Further commitments will be decided at the end of their present program in
December 1998. Danida has also cofinanced both forestry and environment projects with IDA in Ghana,
and has indicated that it will support the savanna component of NRMP, specifically those aspects relating
to renewable (woodfuel) energy. Danida participated in the preappraisal of NRMP and is expected to
finalize its commitment in late 1998. AfDB has expressed interest in the plantation subcomponent and
has already fielded its own preparation mission, with appraisal expected in late 1998. The EU joined the
appraisal mission and is expected to become involved in specific (but not yet nominated) aspects of the
high forest component. The Netherlands plan to support both the wildlife component (Protected Area
development and institutional strengthening) and the district-level activities of EPA. Formulation
missions were fielded in April 1998 and a final commitment is expected later in the year. WFP plans to



- I 1 -
support tree planting in the Savanna zone and has proposed a program commitment of about US$4.5
million over five years, commencing in 1998.
D. PROJECT RATIONALE
1. Project alternatives considered and reasonsfor rejection
The original proposal was to follow up the recently closed IDA-supported Forest Resources
Management Project with further assistance to those aspects of that program that address the ongoing
problems of the forestry and wildlife subsectors, but which still need further external support. At the
same time, it was proposed to mainstream environmental issues in all future projects, across all sectors,
rather than to provide discrete project follow-up support to the Environmental Resources Management
Project which is due to close at the end of 1998. In view of the need for broad institutional and policy
reforms in the proposed program, the more structured investment project approach was rejected in favor
of a broader sector-based program approach. Such a program would focus on creating the right
environment to encourage community and other private sector involvement in sustainable management of
key natural resources, and on reducing poverty in the more disadvantaged rural areas. This approach
reflects the lessons learnt from the implementation of FRMP. The government wants to improve
coordination of aid coming from all donors in support of sustainable natural resource management and
regards this program as the vehicle for achieving this aim.
The project was initially planned as a five-year investment project. However, the recent
development of a new lending instrument by the Bank, Adaptable Program Lending (APL), allows for a
more logical sequencing of policy initiatives, institutional development, pilot resource management
programs, and associated investments in civil works, goods and services. The proposed program is
ideally suited to that approach and has therefore been designed as an APL operation, with a first phase of
two years -- at the end of which the necessary policy and institutional reform would be in place and the
stage set for country-wide implementation of the proposed collaborative resource management programs
in subsequent phases.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
The Forest Resource Management Project (FRMP) became effective in November 1989 and
closed in June 1997. Lessons learned from this project include the need to: regard natural resource
management projects as long-term programs made up of a series of projects, or phases; ensure that an
effective sector policy environment and efficiently operating sector institutions are in place before major
infrastructure development is started, or wide-scale resource management is initiated; realize that
institutional strengthening may mean fundamental change far beyond training programs and provision of
improved facilities and equipment -- requiring good planning and adequate implementation time; involve
all stakeholders -- including loggers and millers, but especially the local resources owning communities --
in the planning of resource use, and ensure local communities gain an equitable share of the revenue
generated; and develop within ministries/agencies responsible for sector policy adequate technical
support, especially in the areas of resource economics and planning, and effective monitoring and
evaluation systems, These lessons have been incorporated into the design of NRMP. The high forest
component of the first phase of this program will therefore concentrate on institutional restructuring and
policy reform that builds on ongoing analytical work under the Forest Sector Development Project
(FSDP) supported by DFID over the past three years.
The Environmental Resource Management Project (ERMP) became effective in March 1993 and
is due to close in December 1998. The project explicitly recognizes the intersectoral nature of
environmental management and has provided support for institutional strengthening of EPA in its central
role as a coordinating and regulatory body for environmental monitoring and management. The principal
lesson from this project has been the value of investing in strengthening the capacity of sectoral agencies
for environmental management and mainstreaming environmental protection as a standard element of
sectoral activity. The proposed program would build on this experience by targeting improvements in
policies and practices of forest and wildlife management to conserve biodiversity and reverse forest
degradation -- implemented by the sectoral agencies, with EPA maintaining its role as an independent
monitoring agency.
The Coastal Wetlands Management Project (CWMP) was financed by the GEF as an integral
component of ERMP and has addressed the issue of maintaining the ecological integrity of coastal
wetland ecosystems under a multiple use management regime, with significant involvement of local
stakeholders in both planning and implementation. This project has enabled the Wildlife Department to
gain valuable experience in locally-based cooperative management of protected areas, with the goal of
safeguarding globally important biodiversity within a management regime that recognizes the use and
access rights of local residents and seeks to stimulate economic growth that is compatible with
maintaining global and national conservation values.
Plans for institutional restructuring and strengthening under NRMP call for substantially
strengthening the Collaborative Forest Management Unit (CFMU) within the Forest Service and
development of more effective community outreach capacity within the Wildlife Department. The latter
will involve retraining and redeploying some wildlife personnel to the district level, where they will work
with forestry staff and local communities in developing appropriate regulatory mechanisms for bushmeat
harvesting and surveillance procedures for monitoring endangered species, such as primates. CFMU has
already initiated pilot programs with communities that involve licensing of community groups for
harvesting and limited propagation of non-timber forest products within production forest reserves. It has
also had some initial success in involving communities effectively in monitoring and surveillance of
timber harvest and hunting within reserves.

4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership
The adoption in 1990 of the National Enviromnental Action Plan and in 1994 of a new Forest and
Wildlife Policy and the subsequent preparation in 1996 of a Forestry Development Master Plan (FDMP)
by MLF provide a firm foundation for implementing this program. The FDMP includes strategies for
forest protection, forest production and increasing communities participation in forest and woodland
management and in revenue sharing from forest resources. Furthermore, the government's Forest
Protection Strategy defines its approach to safeguarding biodiversity. MLF has identified three critical
reforms necessary to upgrade sector performance and has recently introduced, or is about to introduce,
legislation to address all three issues: (i) reorganization of the Forestry Department into a responsive,
service-oriented agency; (ii) policy reforms to encourage private sector investment in forest restoration
within degraded reserves and outside reserves; (iii) introduction of resource price incentives to encourage
the private sector to invest in improving the efficiency of the logging and wood processing industry.
Indicators of Government commitment to implementation of the biodiversity conservation components of
the proposed project include the preparation of the National Biodiversity Strategy and of the Protected
Areas Systems Plan, completion of a national inventory of priority sites for conservation of forest tree
species, and inclusion of biodiversity protection and maintenance of bioquality as key elements in the
Forest Development Master Plan. Assurances were given at negotiations that the GSBAs to be
established with GEF financial support would be gazetted with appropriate restrictions on uses to
safeguard the biodiversity they are designed to protect. Almost all proposed project interventions,
including all institutional and most of the policy reforms, have grown out of previous projects funded in
part by IDA and other donors, particularly DFID. Government has identified the initiatives that make up
NRMP as programs it wants to expand, based on its experience with the earlier projects.
5. Value added of Bank and Global support in this project
The project would build and expand on advances made in natural resource management under
FRMP and ERMP and on pilot experience gained over the past three years under FIMP and the ongoing
FSDP, both financed by DFID. A considerable number of bilateral and multilateral donors are currently
involved or interested in financing activities within the sector. Leadership by the Bank would encourage
adoption of necessary structural reforms to improve sectoral performance overall through a multi-donor
financed sector investment program. MLF strongly supports this coordinated approach by donors and
has encouraged the Bank to assist in this regard and to adopt the role of lead financier. Inclusion of GEF-
financed enhancement of biodiversity conservation in the program will ensure that maintenance of
bioquality is securely embedded as an integral aspect of natural resource management.

E. SUMMARY PROJECT ANALYSIS
1. Economic
[x] Cost-Benefit Analysis (see Annex 4a):
High Forest Component - Collaborative Forest Management: ERR 20%
Savanna Component: NPV=US$ 17.3 million; ERR= 19%
Wildlife Component: NPV=US$ 12.6 million; ERR= 22%
[x] Incremental Cost (see Annex 4b):
Biodiversity Component: US$8.7 million
The main productivity benefits under the project's high forest component will come from the
reforms in the incentive framework, and in particular the increased royalty rates and improved collection
rates, as well as from the possible replacement of the log export ban by an appropriate export tax at the
end of NRMP I. A very tentative estimation suggests that the net welfare gains to Ghana of replacing the
log export ban with a 30 percent export tax would be in the range of US$28-78 million annually (Annex
4a, para. 7). Benefits are also expected from collaborative forest management, with preliminary estimates
suggesting an economic rate of return of about 20 percent (Annex 4a, para. 4). An in-depth study of the
log export ban would be undertaken during the first phase of the program to evaluate various options and
to make specific recommendations under which the net social benefits for the nation are maximized. The
pricing reforms would be designed in such a way that loggers and millers would have increased
incentives to reduce waste and to increase efficiency in their operations. The institution building to be
done is intended to help reap the full benefits of the policy reforms and to minimize or eliminate possible
negative consequences of the reform effort. It is also expected to reduce illegal logging and other
extractive activities, where private benefits are generated on the basis of public or common property
assets. Aside from net social welfare gains from a more efficient incentive system, there would also be
other economic benefits from an improvement in the protection and management of these forests, such as
biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, regulation of stream flow, and soil conservation.
The biodiversity component does not lend itself to conventional economic analysis since no
monetary value can be placed on species and ecosystem conservation. However, an analysis has been
undertaken of "incremental costs," i.e., the additional costs accruing to Ghana for protecting its globally
valuable biodiversity. This analysis is presented in Annex 4b, showing an incremental cost of US$8.7
million.
The main economic benefits of the savanna component would be increased production of
woodfuel, poles, crops and livestock, bushmeat and other non-wood forest products. Other important
benefits, more difficult to quantify, include: a reduction in the incidence of bush fires, a reduction in soil
erosion and flooding, stabilization of stream flows, and less siltation of reservoirs. Given the limited data
available, rough assumptions had to be made to estimate the economic benefits from increased fuelwood
production over the longer term. A rate of return of 19 percent was obtained. Likely benefits from
increased crop productivity were also estimated, suggesting a rate of return of 13 percent. During
NRMP-I, a baseline survey would be undertaken to assess relevant costs and benefits more accurately
and to set in motion monitoring and data collection so that a better evaluation would be possible before
the commencement of the second phase of the program.
The wildlife of Ghana represents a national heritage that needs to be managed wisely for the
overall benefit of society. From an economic and revenue-generating perspective, two outputs/services



- 16 -
of the wildlife component are most relevant -- bushmeat, and wildlife viewing and nature experiences.
For wildlife to provide a sustainable flow of bushmeat, overharvesting must be avoided. It is estimated
that in the "with-project case" the decline in bushmeat production could be slowed, beginning at about the
start of the third phase of the program. In recent years, a sharp increase in park visits by tourists has
occurred -- in spite of weak infrastructure and other visitor facilities, inadequate training of guides, and
an absence of interpretative aids. Based on a number of conservative assumptions, it has been estimated
that increased nature tourism would result in an economic rate of return of 6 percent, and a rate of return
of 22 percent if the bushmeat benefits are included.
The environmental management coordination component intends to continue the institution-
building, the coordination work and the information management work that has been going on during the
ERMP, which is expected to close at the end of 1998. That project has had satisfactory ratings, and
ongoing initiatives funded under this project merit continued support. The benefits of capacity building
and an improved information management capacity are indirect. It is therefore not possible to estimate
benefits associated with this component.
2. Financial (see Annex 4a)
Plantation Development Sub-component: NPV= (to be calculated); FRR= 12-18% depending on
plantation management model.
To achieve a sustainable forestry sector in Ghana over the medium to long term, development of
private sector plantations is considered essential, and a favorable incentive environment is crucial to
encourage the private sector to plant and effectively manage significant areas. The plantation sub-
component is currently being prepared by AfDB and is expected to be appraised during NRMP I and
parallel financed by AfDB during the second phase of the program. Based on earlier work by FAO/CP
on behalf of AfDB, a financial analysis was carried out on industrial plantation development, foreseen
under five different management models, and this analysis suggests IRRs ranging from 12 percent to 18
percent, depending on the model.
At present, wildlife park entry fees in Ghana are low by international standards. An entry permit
for Ghana's best known park, Mole National Park, is only US$1.80 for a foreign tourist, less that one
tenth of that charged in East Africa. Notwithstanding the more limited wildlife viewing options, and
limited infrastructure and other services, more could be charged without a significant reduction in the
number of paying visitors, for whom park entry fees are a very small portion of the overall expenses
connected with a visit to Ghana. Charging higher fees would be even more justified once the project is
underway and better conditions have been created for an improved nature tourism experience. For
purposes of the revenue analysis, it was estimated that in project year 1 there would be about 40,000
entries to individual parks by paying visitors and that total revenues collected would amount to
US$40,000. Under reasonable assumptions for increases in park entry fees, total revenues collected
could reach US$515,000 in project year 6.
3. Technical
The forest resource management component will implement the new manual of forest
management procedures which represent a demonstrable improvement over current management
practices and procedures and approach current "state of the art" protocols for environmentally sensitive
tropical forest management. The wildlife component will operationalize park management plans
developed in conjunction with IUCN. Implementation of watershed-focused local land management



- 17 -
methods based on best-practice experience from a number of pilot projects carried out recently within the
savanna zone under ERMP. The biodiversity component will employ an ecosystem approach to
management of natural forest landscapes that seeks to integrate biodiversity protection with production
forestry and with other land use objectives. By protecting critical areas within forest reserves from
logging and other inappropriate extractive uses, the project will enhance the security of globally
significant biodiversity resources. Alternative livelihood investments financed under the project will
stimulate economic development is areas bordering reserves and will be designed in collaboration with
these communities. lMajor initiatives proposed under the program have evolved from pilots undertaken in
earlier IDA and /or donor financed projects. As such, they are tailored to local implementation capacity.
For the same reason, program costing is realistic and contains adequate provision for physical and price
contingencies.
4. Institutional
Executing agencies: Both the Forest Department (excluding its Planning Branch - FDPB) and
the Wildlife Department are institutionally weak in their present form. Both are overstaffed with
unskilled labor and guards, while deficient in skilled and professional officers. In addition, both have a
control and command management ethic which is unsuited to today's approach to forest and wildlife
management. Radical reform of both institutions is a major aspect of the project. FDPB is institutionally
and technically stronger, having received support under DFID programs for a number of years.
Management of the savanna resource has in the past been largely neglected by govemment, and the
project will therefore create a special multidisciplinary, cross-ministerial unit to adopt this role, working
closely with district assemblies in line with government's decentralization policies. EPA, while well
managed and relatively effective, needs further strengthening at national and regional level, and in the
manner in which it relates operationally to district assemblies -- and this would be addressed by the
project.
Project management:  MLF and its Project Coordination Unit provided good project
management in the last four years of the FRMP, in terms of general coordination of implementing
agencies, and in implementation of IDA guidelines concerning procurement, financial management and
project reporting. The same PCU will now be responsible for managing NRMP and will be further
strengthened under the project, especially in regard to monitoring and evaluating development impact.
5. Social
The project will be characterized by a strong participatory approach from the outset. It will build
on lessons learned in community participation and management in FIMP and the GEF-financed Coastal
Wetlands Management Project and in the community consultation approach used in GEF-sponsored
coastal zone management sector work. The following consultation and participation mechanisms are
envisioned: (i) national and local government/private sector roundtables to discuss proposals for forest
policy and institutional reforms; (ii) devolution of responsibility for off-reserve savanna woodland
management to local communities and consultation on management plans for savanna woodland reserves
with affected communities; (iii) consultation with NGOs and communities living near protected areas and
forest reserves on proposed strategic and operation management plans through semi-structured interviews
and public meetings; (iv) establishment of pilot community-managed revenue-generating activities other
than logging in selected forest reserves and protected area buffer zones; and (v) increased community
employment through pilot private sector activities in and around protected areas.



- 18-
No voluntary or involuntary resettlement is planned. The project's aim is rather to effectively
engage rural residents in management and more sustainable exploitation of forest and wildlife resources.
Investments in alternative livelihoods to compensate for foregone short-term revenues due to adoption of
a more restrictive management regime for high-priority biodiversity conservation sites would be
channeled through community-based mechanisms to finance environmentally compatible development
enterprises.
6. Environmental assessment: Enviromnental Category  [x] A  []B      ]C
Given the potential impact of the project on environmentally sensitive areas, a full project
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out, and an Environmental Management Plan was
prepared and integrated into the final project design. Overall, the project is expected to have a number of
strong positive impacts on the environrment -- including increased sustainability of forest, woodland
savanna and wildlife resource management, improved soil, watershed and biodiversity conservation, and
enhanced effectiveness of environmental management and monitoring.
In the course of EIA preparation, twenty-five communities were surveyed, the majority of which
are situated adjacent to forest reserves or protected areas.  Discussions were also held with
representatives of the logging and milling industries, and a public hearing to discuss the preliminary
findings of the draft report was held in Kumasi and attended by a broad range of NGOs, industry
representatives, traditional leaders, sectoral agency personnel and the general public. Comments received
during the public consultation process were taken into account in producing the final project EIA and the
Environmental Management Plan.
Of the twenty-seven Important Environmental Components (IECs) identified and evaluated in the
EIA, the project would have significant positive effects for ten and both positive and negative impacts for
the other seventeen. Of those IECs with some negative effects, seven would be mitigated through
planned project activities, seven would be addressed through adoption of improvements in project design
and application of "best practice" guidelines, and the remaining three would be addressed by specific
mitigation measures to be incorporated in the project. Implementation of environmental mitigation
measures will be independently monitored by EPA and district environmental committees with resources
included in the project.
If poorly implemented, the project could provide significant risks to rare and endangered species
of flora and fauna and their habitats. As part of project preparation, extensive surveys were undertaken to
identify and determine the status of plant and animal species that are potentially at risk. The biodiversity
and wildlife resource management components are designed to explicitly address local, national and
global priorities for biodiversity conservation and monitoring. The project also makes financial
provisions for ongoing surveys to further clarify the status of organisms that are potentially at risk, to
establish an independent monitoring program to track project performance, and to explicitly enhance
biodiversity protection through the establishment of new protected areas and strengthening the national
capacity for protected area management.
A necessary reduction in the allowed logging volume in order to bring management of the forest
estate in line with ecologically sustainable harvesting will result in some loss of employment in the
logging and wood processing sectors. Project-financed mitigations such as worker retraining and project
actions to achieve ecologically sustainable timber production through managed plantations and
restoration of degraded reserves will, in the medium to long term, contribute to stabilizing job security.
In the "without project" scenario, the Ghanaian forest industry faces the likelihood of economic



- 19-
extinction due to severe domestic supply shortages within two decades, a situation likely to be more
lasting and devastating to the rural economy than the temporary decrease in employment anticipated
under the project.

b. Other key stakeholders. Project preparation included a number of innovative pilots to involve
communities and specifically targeted stakeholder groups (e.g., rural women, youth groups) in harvesting
and management of non-timber forest resources, maintenance of boundaries and firebreaks and other
revenue-generating enterprises. These were initiated by the Collaborative Forest Management Unit.
Lessons learned and experience gained will be put in practice under the project through the Cooperative
Forest Management Center to be established under the project within the reformed Forest Service. With
regard to the biodiversity component, senior personnel of the Ghana Wildlife Society have been
consulted and provided significant input into the definition of community education and public awareness
components financed by the project, the design of research, monitoring and evaluation procedures, and
guidance on implementing community investment components of the project based on the experience
gained under the GEF-financed Coastal Wetlands Management Project.
F. SUSTAINABILITY AND RISKS
1. Sustainability
Government's commitment in terms of sustaining policy reforms as well as staff and funding of
project initiatives and other support after the project ends is crucial.  Success in developing a
participatory approach involving all relevant stakeholders in project design and implementation is
necessary if there is to be enduring project ownership by the beneficiaries. Ensuring that resource owners
receive adequate compensation for their efforts in sustainably managing the resource is critical in this
regard, and this is a major objective of the project. The program seeks to establish a balance between
sustainable forest production and enhanced protection of globally significant biodiversity resources.
Long-term biodiversity protection is ultimately linked to success in achieving sustainable production that
adequately meets local needs for forest products. Enhancing protection of biodiversity in Globally
Significant Biodiversity Areas (GSBAs) will need to be based on negotiated agreements with the
responsible local communities that tie some benefits in the form of alternative livelihood investments, to
verifiable performance criteria if it is to be effective. The success of project in encouraging reforestation
of degraded forest areas within reserves and policy changes to encourage wood industry efficiency is
inextricably linked with the sustainability of the proposed biodiversity protection measures. To this end,
Government's commitment to improving institutional capacity, stabilizing sustainable logging levels (the



-20 -
AAC), increasing the share of benefits realized by rural communities, and improving community
knowledge and field capacity for effective stewardship of biodiversity resources through the
implementation of an integrated sector-wide strategy will ultimately determine the sustainability of
conservation achievements.

3. Possible Controve,sial Aspects
Proposed changes to concession allocation procedures and increased royalties are expected to be
opposed by less efficient wood processors, some of whom will eventually be forced out of the industry.
In the short to medium term this could cause limited unemployment -- but this will be offset by increased
opportunities for employment/small business generated by greatly increased income flowing to resource
owning local communities. Efficient timber millers are less concerned and regard sustained access to
supplies as more critical than resource unit costs. Local lumber prices will also increase as raw material
prices rise and improved log movement controls constrain illegal logging operations -- necessitating more
efficient use by the building and furniture trades.
G. MAIN LOAN CONDITIONS
1. Effectiveness Conditions
(i) successful passage through Parliament of the Legislative Instrument to increase timber
royalties to the agreed levels;
(ii) tabling of the Forest Service Bill in Parliament to enable establishment of the Ghana Forest
Service;
(iii) finalization and adoption by the government of the National Biodiversity Strategy;
(iv) establishment of a project financial management system acceptable to IDA; and
(v) finalization and submission of a Project Implementation Plan acceptable to IDA.
2. Other
Initiation of major policy and institutional reforms is already underway. Project conditionality
would seek to minimize risks and would address: (i) restructuring of the forest and wildlife management
and forest revenue collection agencies; (ii) gazettement under an appropriate management regime of
high-priority areas identified for biodiversity conservation; and (iii) adoption of an appropriate incentive
structure (resource pricing and export ban/levy reform) for mobilizing private investment and community
participation in forest plantations, protection of biodiversity, management of wildlife resources and
savanna woodland management.

GHANA: Natural Resource Management Project I
Detailed Project Description
Component 1: High Forest Resource Management
(Total program cost for NRMP I = US$14.2 million)
1.    The project would seek to alter the incentive structures operating in the sector, so that forestry
professionals are encouraged to adopt a service role for communities; industry is encouraged to invest in
more efficient equipment and value adding processing; private investors are encouraged to engage in
plantation development; and communities and district assemblies are rewarded for pursuing sustainable
forest management and conservation principles. The component would encompass five subcomponents:
policy and legislative reforn; sector institutional reform; integrated forest reserve management; forest
resource management off-reserve; and, plantation development.
2.    Policy and Legislative Reform. The project would help to expedite the implementation of new
government policies in the forestry sector, leading to enactment of legislation crucial to future efficiency,
productivity and sustainability of the forestry sector in Ghana. The core policy and draft legislative
package underpinning the project objectives have been developed over an extended period by MLF, with
input from DFID, IDA, FAO, ITTO, EU and other donors. The Forest and Wildlife Policy was adopted
by Government in 1994, and from this the Forestry Development Master Plan was developed and
released in mid-1996. Two major pieces of legislation were subsequently prepared to be enacted: the
Timber Resources Management Bill, and the Forest Service Bill.
3.    The Timber Resources Management Bill was enacted in March 1998, and provides for the
adoption of transparent procedures for awarding timber rights, and ensure that only capable and properly
equipped concessionaires will have access to the limited natural timber resource base -- repealing a range
of existing legislation and procedures that led to unauthorized and improper renting of concessions and
unsustainable management of the forest resource. Instead of granting concession leases, the rights to
harvest and utilize timber within strict resource management guidelines (timber harvesting manual) would
be awarded in the form of a timber utilization contract (TUC); and a streamlined procedure for awarding
timber rights would be adopted using objective criteria to pre-qualify capable applicants followed by a
competitive procedure to select a suitable applicant from this short list. The new Act would provides for
consultation with respective stools, landowners and district assemblies prior to advertising the availability
of the timber resource, and also during the evaluation of the shortlisted proposals, particularly in respect
of commitments to reforestation, environmental damage mitigation and support to local communities
through social responsibility agreements.
4.    The Act will also provide for timber stumpage (royalty plus forest administration fees) rates to
redress the current situation where the timber resource is substantially underpriced in the market. Royalty
rates will be increased significantly, especially for the scarce species group as identified by the forest
inventory program. These new rates will range from 7% to 20% of the FOB price, depending on the
scarcity of the species, based on a formula recommended in a DFID-financed study undertaken by the
UK Forestry Commission which, inter alia, automatically adjusts FOB prices on a six-monthly basis for
each species. Currently, an estimated 85 percent of logs being harvested would attract the maximum rate.
The aim is to increase stumpage to a level that will impact on demand to bring it in line with the annual
allowable cut for each species group, and at the same time be sufficient to provide financial incentives to
encourage loggers and millers to utilize the resource more efficiently; landowners to be more involved in
management of their resource; and investors to engage in plantation development. A realistic objective is



- 34 -                                 Annex 2
to bring the domestic market to somewhere near border prices for the resource within five years, and
royalty rates will need to be judiciously managed to achieve this, supported by the possible introduction
of an export tax (para. 7). To improve royalty collection, it is proposed to collect estimated stumpage for
each concession six months in advance.
5.    The Forest Service Bill is expected to go before Parliament in mid-1998. It will provide for the
establishment of the Ghana Forest Service and to define its' operating principles, including formation of
the Forestry Service Board. Subsequent legislation will proscribe required forest resource management
planning (a National Forest Plan, forest reserve management plans, and district forestry development
plans), creation and management of new forest reserves, creation and management of dedicated forests
outside the forest reserve system, ownership of trees and timber and the rights of land owners and
farmers, timber utilization provisions, and enforcement provisions and penalties.
6.    At this stage the government is not planning any action on the suspension of natural timber log
exports that had been applied progressively to selected commercially endangered species since the late
1980s, and was extended to cover all naturally grown timber in 1994 -- at the time of the introduction of
the "interim measures" aimed to stem the rash of speculative logging (not against firm export orders, and
often illegally felled) that resulted in large volumes of logs accumulating in the ports that were not being
shipped and were eventually auctioned off by TEDB. Much of the problem was caused by ineffective
concession management/monitoring by the Forestry Department and poor control and monitoring of log
movement by FPIB. Both these institutional problems would be addressed by the project, but until they
are, and concession management and log movement monitoring are greatly improved, Government
rightly will not consider lifting the log export suspension. However, once these controls are being
effectively enforced, Government will need to decide if an export ban is the most efficient way of
protecting the dwindling resource base, or whether some other policy, such as an export levy, would have
the same effect but at a lower economic cost.
7.    Sector Institutional Reform   Restructuring and operational reorientation of the public
institutions responsible for management of Ghana's forest resources is a crucial aspect of the project.
Based on the ongoing work being undertaken by the DFID supported Forest Sector Development Project,
the Forestry Department (FD) will be replaced by an autonomous Ghana Forest Service (GFS), operating
outside the civil service. As envisaged, GFS will be a smaller, more professional organization, with a
clear focus on conservation and sustainable development of forest reserves, and working in collaboration
with resource owning communities, rather than in a command and control situation. It will regulate
harvesting of all natural timber, in coordination with district assemblies and other sector agencies
involved in natural resource management; and be committed to transparency and cost efficiency in its
role as steward of the nations forest resources. Specific responsibilities of GFS will be to:
*  protect, manage and develop in a sustainable manner all forest reserves in the high forest zone, in
the national interest and for the benefit of the owners;
*  monitor the condition and extent of the Nation's forest resources;
*  advise the Minister of Lands and Forestry on forest policy formulation;
*  regulate the allocation and utilization of natural forest and timber resources;
*  provide management services on agreed terms to private individuals, traditional authorities,
communities, companies, unit committees, district assemblies and others for the protection,
management and development of forests outside the forest reserve system.
8.    GFS will enter into contract agreements with the government ministries/departments, corporate
bodies, district assemblies, land owners and any other clients for the provision of any of these services.
Compared to the past, the Service will be less concerned with forest industry development and timber



- 35 -                                Annex 2
marketing, both of which will be the responsibility of the new Timber Industry Development Board. In a
significant departure from the present arrangements, the proposed GFS would in future be concerned only
with resource management in the high forest zone. Management of woodland resource in the savanna
zone would be the responsibility of the proposed multidisciplinary Savanna Resource Management
Center, to be staffed by officers from the erstwhile FD and other relevant departments/ministries (EPA,
MOFA and MME).
9.    As currently proposed, the GFS would have only skeleton staffing at the central level, with most
operational authority and responsibility transferred to the regional level. Regional Officers will be given
authority to propose budgets and required to commit to timely achievement of clearly identified results.
Accounting and finance (including introduction of a computerized royalty accounting system) will be
managed at the regional level and consolidated centrally only to facilitate oversight and reporting. GFS
will be accountable to a Board that will include specialists appointed by MLF, along with representatives
of Forestry Commission, forest owners (nominated by the House of Chiefs), MOF, the wood industry,
and recognized environmental NGOs. The executive will be headed by a Managing Director, supported
by Directors for Corporate Services (finance/administration and human resource development), and
Technical Services. The latter will operate through three Divisions: HFZ Operations Division, the
"operational arm", responsible for preparation of forest management plans and control and monitoring of
timber harvesting; the Forest Management Support Center, the "technical arm", responsible for
developing, mainstreaming and monitoring the introduction of collaborative forest management
techniques into GFS operational methods; and the Resource Development Division, the "commercial
arm", responsible for day-to-day management of TUCs, monitoring of royalty billing and disbursements
of revenue to local government and landholders, and generation of statistics on the resource base and the
industry. The first phase staff redeployment associated with the establishment of GFS would involve the
shedding of about 2,000 staff, or about 45 percent of the current FD staffing level. Subsequent
redeployment would depend on further efficiency gains, and the ability to outsource additional GFS
activities to the private sector. DFID has provided US$5.0 million under FSDP for redundancy payments
following standard GOG guidelines. It is expected that GFS will not be financially self sufficient in the
early years of its operations and therefore for the initial three years of GFS and operations, selected
incremental operating costs would be supported by the IDA Credit to the level of 75% in Year 1 and 2,
and 50% in Year 3 -- provided the support in any year does not exceed 20% of total expenditure. It was
further agreed that if royalty collection drops below agreed thresholds, this Credit support for the
financing gap would decrease proportionally in a formula to be agreed at negotiations.
10.   Creation of GFS has been accepted in broad principle by the government, but the law instituting
it, the Forest Service Bill, has not yet been introduced to parliament. An agreement has been established
between the government and DFID to extend FSDP by one year to December 1998 to complete the Forest
Service institutional design, and to initiate the transformation of the FD into the GFS, and the Planning
Branch of FD into the Forest Management Support Center. Subsequent DFID support will depend on the
outcome of the current phase -- but is expected to include support for establishment of GFS, including FD
redundancy costs, and operational support for collaborative forest management initiatives.
11.   In a separate exercise, the Timber Export Development Board (TEDB) will be merged with the
Forest Product Inspection Bureau (FPIB) to form a new Timber Industry Development Board (TIDB).
TEDB's role is to promote timber exports, provide market intelligence and collate and publish statistics
on the Ghanaian industry. FPIB's role is to set and enforce standardized grading rules for export timber,
review all export contracts to prevent under-invoicing, and monitor ex-concession log movements.
Government involvement in export promotion and contract vetting will cease under the new TIDB
arrangement, and a computerized log tracking system will be introduced -- with installation and initial
operation of the system outsourced to the private sector. Consultants are working on the modalities of



- 36 -                                 Annex 2
merging TEDB and FPIB, and the final proposal is expected in late 1998 in conjunction with forest
certification proposals now being developed. At a later date, government has indicated it is willing to
consider privatization of all TIDB's functions.
12.   Integrated Forest Reserve Management. Under the project, strategic planning for forest reserve
management will take place at two levels. A National Forest Plan would be prepared to establish national
resource management objectives in accordance with the aims of the 1994 Forest and Wildlife Policy(e.g.,
the AAC for timber harvesting). At the resource level, existing forest reserve management plans will be
revised, or new ones prepared, for all reserves in the HFZ -- with priority given in NRMP I to the twelve
most productive ones. These plans will define the long-term forest management objectives for each
reserve, along with specific management zones and prescriptions. They will not only identify protection
and production management zones, but also clarify beneficiary objectives, specifically revenue sharing
and access to forest products for domestic use. The planning process will be collaborative, led by GFS,
but involving representatives of the different client and interest groups. The project will provide critical
support by establishing decentralized planning capacity at regional and district level with technical
support from the FMSC in Kumasi, in particular, building short- and long-term capacity to initiate
participatory planning procedures and undertake collaborative management programs. A temporary
collaborative forest management support team would be established in each region to assist in training
district GFS staff and community representatives to conduct socio-economic surveys and engage in
participatory planning.
13.   The project will pilot an improved integrated forest reserve management system, building the
capacity of all the main players in forest reserve management, in particular the Forest Service as
managers; rural communities as resource owners and resource users; district assemblies as beneficiaries
of forest utilization; and timber contractors as industrial resource users. Substantial work has been
undertaken over the last three years in Ghana on forest policy and pilot collaborative management
systems development for the high forest, and the project's aim will be to test and analyze the costs and
benefits of these new systems before they are operationalized country-wide during NRMP II and III.
14.   Also supported will be: the introduction of improved operational systems to ensure that
management plans are implemented with the most efficient use of human and financial resources;
capacity building for biodiversity conservation objectives, including development of programs for the
protection of faunal diversity as well as botanical diversity; watershed maintenance and wildfire
management; training for GFS staff and loggers on implementation aspects of the new Timber Utilization
Contract system and the use of the new Manuals of Operation; improved timber harvesting procedures
(including, possibly, low-impact logging); and introduction of a certification scheme to achieve
sustainable timber production objectives. Gathering, processing and trading non-timber forest products
(NTFPs) provide a source of supplementary income to many rural households, particularly important
during the "hungry" season when there is little farm work or when there is an emergency need for cash.
For this reason, community and institutional capacity building to encourage development of traditional
and new non-timber forest products, a hitherto neglected area of forest management, would be
specifically fostered, as would the promotion of forest-based rural enterprises to directly increase the
opportunities for poverty alleviation and job creation.
15.   Forest Resource Management Off-Reserve. Resource management strategies outside reserves
have only been developed since 1994, with the change in government policy from salvage felling to clear
land for agriculture to one of controlled exploitation of the remaining timber resource over a 50-year
period. Development of resource use strategies off-reserve are therefore not as advanced as in the
reserve situation, but some principles are emerging. Timber harvesting will be regulated through
implementation of a new Annual Allowable Cut (AAC), off-reserve district quotas, the (interim)



- 37 -                                 Annex 2
harvesting procedures, allocation of the new TUCs, the introduction of social responsibility agreements
with communities, anid more equitable sharing of timber revenue between resource owners and resource
users. Strategic planning may later be developed at district level, eventually leading to a forestry
component of the district development plan.
16.   The on- and off-reserve resource environments, while inter-related, are quite distinct. Outside
reserves forest resource management takes place in a primarily agricultural context and is led by the
holders of land title and land use rights. Forest management off-reserve, therefore, will not be based
upon forest reserve management concepts and parameters aimed at making forest production permanent
and sustainable. Off-reserve, land and tree management choices will be the prerogative of the farmers
and land owning communities. The objective will be to facilitate utilization of existing tree resources
gradually, and maximize economic benefits for forest owners and environmental benefits for all; and
where appropriate, to provide a framework for local communities to declare a "dedicated-forest status"
for sacred groves and other forest areas and woodlands of particular economic or cultural significance to
the community.
17.   Specific project-financed activities during NRMP I would include the creation of widespread
understanding of the radical changes in Forest Policy proposed in 1994 through a range of discussions
and innovative awareness creation campaigns; and the piloting in two districts of a collaborative approach
to strategic planning for forest resource management off-reserve, in coordination with LEAP initiatives
and possibly linking into the district development planning process. Strategic planning would aim to
create a better understanding of the potential for forestry to contribute to rural development in a district
(through use of the ongoing 'Farmer First' and similar participatory programs), and in turn improve the
ability of a range of public sector agencies, NGOs and CBOs to support local forest resource management
aspirations. Also supported would be the development and introduction of a system for operational
monitoring off-reserve to ensure all forestry operations, including those related to timber harvesting, are
implemented in accordance with service agreements and standards, in accordance with new codes of
conduct for social and environmental responsibility and new production quotas; equitable distribution of
timber revenues; individual and community forest resource management initiatives, in particular capacity
building for local management of discrete blocks of forest, through a new dedicated forest program; and
the establishment of a forest-based enterprise development scheme to directly support income generation
and job creation opportunities in rural areas.
18.    Wood Industry Reform. A wood industry study conducted in early 1997 concluded that over the
past five years, more than US$70 million has been spent by the wood industry in Ghana to upgrade and to
add to existing capacity, now estimated to be in the order of 3.7 million m3 per annum -- compared to the
annual allowable cut of 1.0 million m3. Eight new sawmills started operations (one large, and seven
medium/small mills), along with four veneer processing firms. At the same time, documented changes of
the wood processing sector over the same period show that the current trend is towards an erosion of the
logging industry's financial and managerial capacity; an increasingly wasteful use of resources; an
increase of the milling industry's reliance on illegal harvesting operations; and a stagnation of the milling
industry's efficiency -- despite the fact that an increased share of overall sectoral production is going to
higher value-added products. This means that over this period the processing section has moved even
further out of balance with the resource base.
19.   One policy objective of the Forest Development Master Plan is that measures would in future be
adopted to discourage marginal and inefficient wood processing plants. These measures are not defined
in the Plan, but, in the longer run, the development of any strategy to increase wood processing efficiency
will need to be based on an increase in forest fees, greater enforcement of the AAC and phased
introduction of open market competition in the wood sector. With forest fees at 1987 real-cost levels, full



-38 -                                  Annex 2
protection from international competition for raw materials, and a logging and processing sector that
captures more than 95 percent of the estimated stumpage value, the industry lacks incentives to invest in
becoming more efficient and competitive.
20.   The 1997 study also concluded that an additional US$150 million would be necessary to
completely upgrade industry processing capacity in Ghana, and that adequate commercial bank credit
facilities are available for interested investors with good bankable operations. On this basis no direct
financial support to industry upgrade therefore would be justified under the project -- although the project
would seek to create the right environment to encourage investrnent to take place, including plantation
development to increase the availability of future raw material supply. At the same time, NRMP would
also support measures to ensure that adequate institutional capacity to control illegal forest exploitation
will be established, including the introduction of new technologies to perform computerized log tracking;
monitoring of concession management and timber harvesting operations; and increased timber royalties
and an improved forest revenue collection system. Training programs at the Wood Industry Training
Center would also be supported aimed at improving operational efficiency in mills and supporting firms
moving towards value adding. These approaches are key to encouraging transparency and efficiency
within the wood industry.
21.   Plantation Development. Investment in tree plantations in Ghana is a potentially attractive
proposition for a number of reasons: favorable conditions for tree growth and quality wood development;
reasonable local infrastructure and access to ports; strong domestic market for wood products and good
access to major European markets; a favorable labor market in terms of skills, price and availability;
existing processing capacity; and extensive areas of degraded forest within forest reserves suitable for
tree planting, and by statute dedicated to permanent forest status. The project would seek to capitalize on
these circumstances and promote the development of privately financed plantations by fostering an
increasingly favorable investment policy environment; facilitating allocation or availability of land to the
private sector for forest plantation activities; investigating the need for creation of a Plantation
Development Fund; establishing a seed bank and fostering development of a private, decentralized seeds
distribution system; promoting adaptive research; and providing selective technical assistance and
training for all stakeholders.
22.   The project would develop an effective land allocation system within existing forest reserves and
assist in identifying suitable land off-reserve where communities are interested in a joint venture with
plantation investors, in the latter case in collaboration with local Chiefs and District Assemblies. Initial
emphasis would be placed on allocating land within reserves, where inventory work carried out by the FD
in recent years has identified up to 0.4 million ha of degraded forest -- caused almost entirely by
bushfires, rather than farm encroachment. NRMP I activities would include an initial technical survey
(site indexing involving soil surveys and site mapping), followed by socio-economic survey of the
potential plantation land inside forest reserves -- designated as degraded forest areas suitable only for
regeneration; and the definition and implementation of procedures for land allocation inside forest
reserves.
23.   The financing of tree planting is currently a major problem in Ghana because loans for long term
investments with specialized financing needs such as plantations are currently not available. Under these
circumstances, the need for a dedicated plantation fund should be investigated. The requirement for such
a fund, the form of such a fund and its' operational modalities would be investigated during NRMP I. It
established, such a fund could be created from a variety of potential sources, including multilateral and
bilateral donors and investors such as local and foreign pension funds, insurance companies and banks;
and with grant assistance from GEF through the alternative livelihood investment initiative for
communities who forgo income when forest is taken permanently out of production for biodiversity



-39 -                                 Annex 2
conservation purposes. Because of the carbon absorption aspect associated with plantation development,
support for such a find might also be sought from the Global Carbon Initiative.
24.   For potential investors in industrial scale plantations, access to some area of existing plantation to
improve early cash flows may be crucial, and here the release of government owned teak plantations and
the Gmelina plantation at Subri through full divestiture or by simply allocating harvesting rights will be
necessary, and therefore promoted by the project. NRMP I activities would involve technical (by species
and condition, in terms of yield and timing), and financial assessments of these resources and detennining
the terms and conditions for allocation of harvesting rights. Significant areas of rubberwood also exist at
the partly government-owned Ghana Rubber Estate, where planned replanting programs could release up
to 500 ha of old trees for timber harvesting annually for the next twenty years.
25.   To overcome the current shortage of planting material, the project would establish of an
autonomous and self-financing Seed Bank and support development of a decentralized private sector seed
distribution system for the sale of certified tree seeds linked with the Forestry Research Institute of Ghana
(FORIG) and its field stations. Initially it would be necessary to identify teak and other species which are
genetically superior to those that are currently distributed in Ghana. In the longer term, the seed bank has
to be involved in selection, mating and genetic testing which will ensure a continuing supply of ever
improving genetic material. Tree plantation research would also be supported with the aim of improving
the quality and diversity of forest plantations products and would initially concentrate on; the
rehabilitation of existing teak trials and the establishment of new non-teak species trials for industrial and
commercial purposes; socio-economic surveys to determine farmer preference for planting material and
focused research programs on those species; improved husbandry practices for nursery and plantations
(optimum spacing, fertilizing, enrichment planting and other methods of restoring natural forest cover,
fire control techniq[ues, etc.) and the subsequent preparation of technical manuals; improved agro-
forestry/land use planning; and wood technology practices to promote rational utilization of plantation
products.
26.   Given the potentially innovative nature of this subcomponent, involving the creation of an
investment environment that encourages the private sector to engage in plantation development, along
with the current institutional/financing mechanism uncertainties and need for collecting more technical
and socioeconomic iinformation prior to the final design of this sub-component, the government requested
assistance from the FAO Technical Cooperative Program (TCP). This was followed by an FAO/CP
preparation mission on behalf of AfDB in February 1998 the report of which is still awaited. Provided
this report is positive, the final scope of this sub-component will be based on the AfDB appraisal mission,
expected to be undertaken in late 1998.
Component 2: Savanna Resource Management
(Total program cost for NRMP I = US$4.5 million)
27.   The objective of this component is to promote community management of natural resources,
including rehabilitation of degraded areas. Communities would be encouraged to take ownership of these
resources and manage them in a sustainable manner, while at the same time extracting the maximum
benefit. An estimated 70 percent of Ghana's primary energy needs come from woodfuel, and most of this
from the savanna zone, but to a large extent this satisfied through the subsistence practice of women and
children looping branches, felling small trees and collecting dead wood. Currently, only very limited
commercial woodfuel is harvested from reserves, plantations or woodlots/agroforestry plots. As a result,
distances from the major collection areas to the main marketing/consumption centers are increasing.
NRMP I would therefore focus on developing integrated institutional capacity at national and district
level capable of designing and implementing collaborative resource management programs, and



-40 -                                 Annex 2
designing pilot programs in the woodland reserves to determine the best approaches to developing the
needed community capacity to sustainably manage and exploit these resources, and to determine the most
cost effective way to achieve this result. The pilots would also examine how to organize and plan in
close association with local communities and stakeholders in the non-reserve areas, integrated watershed
management programs involving practical, cost-effective measures for sustainable use of the land, water,
vegetation and animal resources. These measures would take into account the threat of desertification in
the areas where the soils have been severely eroded and where regeneration of vegetation presents a
major challenge.
28.   Communities would be encouraged to take most, if not all, of the responsibility to implement
catchment management plans and would be provided with the necessary training to do this. Part of the
labor provided by the communities for implementing the program would be their contribution to the
investment, and they would be provided with food under the World Food Program (WFP) to the value of
the remainder of the labor input. The intention is to have the communities in a better position to increase
their food production capacity by improving their operational and managerial skills as well as the fertility
of the land they farm. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of this work, a special unit would be
created, the Savanna Resource Management Center (SRMC), based in Tamale. The head of the Center
would be recruited competitively, while technical staff would be seconded from MLF, MOFA, MME and
EPA. The SRMC would eventually devolve its functions to the respective district assemblies, as these
developed the necessary resource management capabilities.
29.    Woodland Reserve Management.  This program would focus on developing appropriate
management systems and procedures that could be tested on a pilot basis. While implementation of the
planned management programs would be primarily by the communities with guidance of the social
forestry officials, the planning and the front-line extension staff of the relevant district assemblies be fully
involved in the initial planning exercise. These forest reserve management plans would be included in
the overall district plans and be partially supported by the DA Common Fund. The district assemblies
would also have implementation monitoring roles, especially since the status of these resources would
have strong bearing on the welfare of the communities, including income generation capacity, and the
effects on the physical environment.
30.   Six pilots programs in established woodland areas would be initiated -- in the Upper East, Upper
West and the Northern Region. The pilots would be located in reserves which satisfy specific eligibility
criteria -- primarily that local communities and the DA show commitment to participate in the program
under a formal collaboration agreement, with communities contributing time and labor and the DA
contributing some counterpart funds. Initial surveys and species inventory and density determination
would be undertaken, involving mapping watershed boundaries within pilots using satellite images and
ground surveys, determining the composition and quality of natural resources and infrastructure, and
collecting relevant socio-economic data. This would be followed by the definition of the activities to be
incorporated in the management plans, the implementation of which would begin in the second year of
the project. This planning and design work requires special skills in land resources management, and it
would be necessary to engage resource persons with such skills from local research institutions to assist
SRMC and DA staff working with the local community.
31.   Community awareness and training programs would be accorded high priority in this exercise,
and would be undertaken by competent NGOs, supported by specialist technical staff of SRMC and
resource persons from other local institutions including extension personnel. The project would finance
the cost of training and capacity building as well as materials and equipment required for rehabilitating
degraded areas and establishing essential infrastructure such as access tracks, water facilities etc. In this
latter regard, collaboration with the new Village Infrastructure Project (VIP) would pursued.



-41-                                 Annex 2
32.   Off-Reserve Integrated Catchment Management. This program would focus on planning for
sustainable land use, through collaboration with farming communities in planning and implementing land
management programs. The programs would start with identifying communities who are interested and
willing to collaborate in integrated watershed management, and would build on local experiences in soil
and water conservation activities. Planting trees and other vegetation in rehabilitating and conserving the
soil, water and wildlife resources would be important measures to be promoted. Advantage would also
be taken of the community collaboration experiences of the EPA in assisting stakeholders to manage
recognized sacred groves, to ensure the sustainable participation of the stakeholding communities; and
with the land and water management component of ERMP
33.   The activities under this subcomponent would be wide ranging in scope and would require
technical assistance to plan and implement. As with the pilots in the reserve areas, eligibility criteria on
similar lines would be applied in selecting the catchments to be included in the program. Implementation
would be primarily by the beneficiaries, working in groups or individually, following an integrated
physical plan prepared in close consultation with them. In addition to formal training activities, a
Technology Development and Demonstration Center would be established under the project at Walewale,
working in close collaboration with local participating villages to promote the application of the various
rehabilitation and conservation measures. Field demonstrations would involve communities in the
practical application of a range of activities, including:
(a) Integrated Watershed Management Plans: Surveys would be conducted to determine the status
of the existing resources and to design measures which would be applied in rehabilitation and
management programs. Because of the present limitations of experienced technical staff in the rural
areas, arrangement would be made for technical assistance in the initial years primarily from
competent local research/training institutions, such as the University of Development Studies (UDS)
in Tamale and the Institute for Renewable Natural Resources (IRNR) which have ongoing programs
of training and investigations in catchment management in the savanna region. The target for
NRMP I would be to complete land management plan development for six priority off-reserve
watersheds.
(b) Nursery Development: Managing the watershed resources and keeping headwaters under
continuous cover of trees and associated vegetation is a crucial aspect in this program. Preferably,
such trees and vegetative cover would be managed as a reserve, excluding agriculture which would
deplete the protective cover effect of the natural vegetation.  The communities and other
stakeholders would be assisted with materials and simple tools and equipment to operate their own
nurseries to produce the needed planting material. They would also be assisted in the field
establishment and trained in the proper field management techniques. The project would promote
the establishment of privately run community nurseries. Infrastructure development to be supported
would include watering systems, propagation bins, bagging or potting facilities and spray equipment.
Nursery operators would be provided with training in nursery operations and plant propagation.
Introduction of improved planting material would be supported under the project, initially from
selected trees in the region. For the longer term, provision would be made under NRMP II and III to
establish about 240 ha of seed producing tree gardens by private outgrowers or nursery operators to
meet the future needs of natural resources regeneration programs.
(c) Bush Fire MWanagement: Annual bush fires are prevalent in the Savanna zone and not only
destroy wildlife and the ground cover, but also greatly reduce soil organic matter recycling. This
situation could be alleviated by prudent management of the annual bush fires to avoid hot fires
which destroy the low shrubs and severely damage the trees. Under the project, and with support



-42-                                 Annex 2
from local fire services, communities would be encouraged to manage the bush fires through early
burning at the beginning of the dry season leaving some unburned organic matter to absorb some of
the raindrop impact and to support soil micro-organisms; minimizing the spread of fire by
establishing firebreaks before the onset of the dry season; and undertaking essential bush control
between planted tree seedlings. The project would support programs of awareness building and
training communities in managing bush fires to reduce their frequency and damage potential. Use
would be made of the Non-formal Adult Education Unit of the Ministry of Education, where
possible, to achieve this. Communities in the high fire risk areas would be assisted in establishing
fire breaks where needed.
34.   Woodfuel Market Development. Fuelwood and charcoal producers would be assisted to develop
the capacity to market of their products more effectively. This would enable them to retain for the benefit
of the communities a greater proportion of the market value of their production, and to devote some of
the increased returns into the sustainable management operations of the woodlands. The increased cost
of the woodfuels at the collection points to the buyers and transporters would be expected to be financed
from improved market efficiency, and not be transferred to the final consumer. The approach to be
adopted would be similar to that proposed in the off-reserve situation in the high forest zone, involving
collaboration with all stakeholders (rural producer groups, transporters, retailers and district assemblies)
to address issues such as rationalization of the multitude of levies and market taxes applied to woodfuel;
strengthening of woodfuel traders; and strengthening of the regulatory powers of district assemblies. A
pilot project would be undertaken in NRMP I to develop and test the progressive introduction of
initiatives leading to more equitable revenue sharing between stake holders, including standardized unit
of sale and firewood auctions and a National Workshop organized in NRMP I to discuss these issues.
35.   At the same time, increased effort would be made to promote more effective systems of charcoal
production and efficient use of wood and charcoal as sources of heat for domestic and industrial
applications. This would build on work already initiated by MME in the north. Project interventions
would include training for charcoal producers; strengthening of the "pito" brewers association; training of
artisans in improved stove fabrication and promotion of the use of new stoves; and public awareness
campaigns on energy conservation. The first phase of this work would be initiated in NRMP I. To
implement this program, a Traditional and Renewable Energy Unit would be established within the
SRMC.
36.   Combating Desertiflcation. The threat of desertification is more pronounced in the north of the
savanna zone, where persistent drought in the 1970s and 1980s prompted initiation of a number of
mitigation schemes with mixed success. In 1991, the National Environmental Action Plan recognized
land degradation as a major environmental problem in the country. Ghana was among the first countries
to sign the UN Convention to Combat Desertification in 1994 and ratified it in 1996. Under this
convention each country must prepare a National Action Program to Combat Desertification (NAP).
Development and implementation of the action program would not create any new institutional structure,
but follow the existing desertification control institutional arrangements, which would now be
harmonized with the implementation arrangements planned for the savanna component of the NRMP. A
National Committee on Desertification already exists, and it is proposed to establish under this a
Technical Committee on Drought and Desertification, co-chaired by EPA and MLF, to oversee the
development of the NAP, with support from the project. This would involve: review of the 1987 National
Plan of Action to Combat Desertification, the NEAP and other relevant documents; preparation of a draft
NAP; design and implementation of land, water and vegetation programs (incorporated within NRMP
pilot activities); a national awareness campaign; district and regional workshops to review the draft NAP;
and a national forum leading to finalization of the NAP. These activities are expected to be completed
during NRMP I, with implementation of the NAP to be initiated under subsequent phases of the program.



-43 -                                 Annex 2
This would be coordinated by the SRMC in Tamale, but implemented primarily by the district assemblies
through the district and community environmental management committees, in collaboration with
interested NGOs.
Component 3: Wildlife Resource Management
(Total program cost for NRMP I = US$ 3.2 million)
37.   Based on a sectoral master plan that is currently being finalized by the Wildlife Department
(WD) with support from IUCN, the project would re-align and strengthen WD capacity to enhance the
economic, social sustainability and relevance of wildlife management programs and foster closer and
more effective collaboration between WD, the private sector, rural communities, non-governmental
organizations and other partners. WD has initiated an integrated package of needs assessments,
workshops and strategic planning initiatives, and has commissioned specific thematic studies to assist in
defining an investment program and identifying priorities for:
(i)   institutional restructuring;
(ii)  training needs and human resource development;
(iii)  community based conservation initiatives;
(iv)   ecotourism development and promotion;
(v)   wildlife utilization and other wildlife-based income generation;
(vi)  protected area infrastructure development;
(vii)  public education; and
(viii)  development of appropriate research and monitoring capacity.
38.   Activities in this component will incorporate institutional restructuring and strengthening;
implementation of park management plans and development of priority park infrastructure; community
empowerment; public education; and encouragement of private sector and NGO involvement in activities
such as ecotourism, park concessions operation, and selected park management functions. Project
interventions will be based primarily on the preparation work undertaken by WD/IUCN, but also taking
into account the experiences of PADP which is already testing many of the ideas and interventions
proposed under NRMP.
39.   Institutional Strengthening. Institutional strengthening will be effected through organizational
restructuring and management reorientation of the Wildlife Department. The objective of a more
decentralized WD management structure will be to enhance the economic and social sustainability of
wildlife management programs and foster close collaboration between the WD and local government,
rural communities, the private sector, NGOs and other partners in management of protected areas, and
wildlife in general. This will involve significant management reorientation of WD through implementing
changes in the management structure based on the recommendations from the recently completed
Institutional Review; implementation of the recently prepared human resource development plan;
changing the approach to wildlife management from regulation and enforcement to collaboration with
local communities; and improvement in WD's management capacity through introduction of improved
planning and management systems, monitoring and evaluation procedures, information management
systems, and necessary technical assistance and training to implement them. During the period of
institutional strengthening, interim measures to protect the wildlife estate will be needed, involving an
interim management unit comprised of personnel already available in WD which would systematically
visit each of the protected areas providing stop gap technical assistance and laying the groundwork for
management plan review.



- 44 -                               Annex 2
40.   Park Management Plans. The implementation of key elements of the Protected Areas Systems
Plan and the individual Protected Areas management plans prepared under the recently-closed Forest
Resource Management Project, as well as necessary environmental and social assessments of proposed
project-financed interventions would be supported by NRMP. The main emphasis would be on the
implementation of priority elements of management plans for Mole, Digya, and Shai Hills. The project
would also finance limited and prioritized infrastructure improvements and operational costs for other
selected protected areas. Specific investments will include upgrading of interior roads to facilitate tourist
access for game viewing, completion of range camps to improve security, and limited investment in
upgrading tourist facilities. Decisions concerning specific investment priorities within individual
protected areas would be arrived at through the proposed new system of decentralized management
authority. The management plans for all parks would be revisited during NRMP I. Only limited critical
infrastructure development would be done in NRMP I, with the majority of this work planned to be
undertaken in successive phases of the program. The project would finance technical and operational
support for initiation of consultation and collaborative planning with communities surrounding the
Kyabobo NP and development of a management plan for the area to be financed, in part, by the GEF.
The project would also promote increased private sector/community involvement in wildlife related
economic activities such as ecotourism and enable the WD to systematically explore options for
expanding the role of NGOs and the private sector in taking on selected protected area management
functions, concession operation, and related activities. Financing for studies to identify private sector
options and seed money for community-based initiatives would be provided under the proposed GEF
grant.
41.   Community-Based Wildlife Management The project would support development of a stronger
and more effective extension program for community-based wildlife management through developing an
outreach program to communities adjacent to reserves, and developing district level community-based
wildlife conservation in three districts. The project will support pilot community-based bushmeat
production programs and address necessary legal and regulatory reforms. The project will finance
operational support for WD to provide extension expertise and monitoring input for development of
integrated community-based land management programs under the Savanna resources component. The
project will finance technical and operational support to enable WD to support the Forestry Department in
identification, planning, management, and monitoring of GSBAs to be established for biodiversity
conservation under the project and to support the overall FD collaborative management initiative.
Implementation would be carried out in collaboration with national NGOs and CBOs as partners.
Planning for these activities will start in NRMP I, recognizing the ongoing work at Kakum and PADP
involving liaison with both the traditional authorities and district assemblies in their project areas..
42.   Public Awareness. To promote increased public awareness of wildlife conservation issues, the
project would support improved capacity of WD to manage contracts and work in partnership with NGOs
and CBOs to support programs for conservation education and environmental awareness. In this context
infrastructure improvements to upgrade and modernize the management of the zoological gardens in
Accra and Kumasi in partnership with national NGOs will be planned in NRMP I. Implementation of
these plans and operational support would be undertaken in subsequent phases of the program.
Component 4: Environmental Management Coordination
(Total program cost for NRMIP I = US$1.5 million)
43.   Coordination and Monitoring. The project would support the implementation of EPA's Five-
Year Strategic Plan, which is now under preparation with assistance through a twinning arrangement with
the Environmental Protection Authority of Victoria. This plan is expected to be completed in late 1998.
The project would support those aspects of EPA's operations that relate to coordination and monitoring



-45 -                                Annex 2
of natural resource management in Ghana -- including training and staff attachments as laid out in the
HRD plan to be developed to support the strategic plan implementation. Building on initiatives
commenced under ERMP, EPA would be further strengthened institutionally at the national level and also
at the level of the regional offices. The project would also, through EPA and MLGRD, strengthen the
capacity of the district-level environmental management committees to enable them to prepare local
environmental action plans and participate in district-level land use planning.
44.   Information Management. The management of information would address both the objectives
that are specific to each of the project components, as well as the strategic consideration relative to
environmental information that cuts across project agencies and other institutions. This would include
both administrative and thematic aspects for each project component, including systems to track project
activities and expenditures.  These would provide the information necessary to monitor project
performance relative to objectives, and integrate and strengthen the information systems of each of the
implementing institutions.
45.   The Forest Service would develop a Forest Management Information System to meet project and
FS reporting requirements, and to monitor forest revenue and forest exploitation. The system would
build upon current information modules used by the Forest Department to manage royalty billing, log
information forms, certificates of conveyance, and permits. The system would support the production of
maps required for the preparation of management plans, and support the monitoring of forest operations
and biodiversity conservation initiatives. The use of GPS to be provided under the project would allow
data collected during stock surveys to be tied with log movement information, to provide for seamless
monitoring of forest resource use. A similar Savanna Management Information System (SMIS) would be
developed, and include modules to manage geo-reference natural resource information such as land
cover, soils, biodiversity and topography, required for woodland management pilot areas in reserves, and
for the integration of sound catchment management practices in non-reserve savanna areas. Data base
development would involve the participation of local populations to incorporate their perception of the
status of natural resources and historical changes. A Wildlife Management Information System (WMIS)
would include modules to manage biodiversity information, in particular information collected from the
fifteen conservation areas managed by WD. The project would provide GPS capabilities for mapping of
observations collected form the field, and the development of simple and targeted software applications
(including GIS capabilities). System costs would include computer equipment for all of these units; the
establishment and maintenance of databases; the development of software applications that target specific
management functions; and specialized training and technical assistance.
46.   Building on the Environmental Information System (EIS) capacity developed under ERMP, the
project would foster further development and dissemination of EIS capacity at national, regional and local
level. Five key data sets have been produced to date: topography; soils; land use; land ownership; and
climate. These data sets cover the entire country, and constitute the basic information on which
environmental management decisions should be made, together with other specific resource or socio-
economic information. Under NRMP, these data sets would be developed on regional basis for
distribution to various stakeholders in electronic format (CD-ROMs) to facilitate their use for planning
and decision making. This will involve integrating the data sets and developing a set of decision-support
applications. The capacity of agencies to use the product will be enhanced through training workshops
and the provision of appropriate software. The land use database will be updated under a separate
contract to the RSAU, and new satellite imagery will be acquired for the purpose. As part of its program
to support district-level environmental management, five high-priority districts would be selected as
pilots, and EPA would commission the development of a district-level EIS to support environmental
management at the local level in selected districts, covering topography, soils, land use and land
ownership, all at the scale of 1:50,000. As with the regional-level EIS, the project will provide support



- 46 -                                Annex 2
for the development of data sets to be integrated for each district. A set of decision-support applications
will be developed to facilitate the use of these data. The products will be pressed on CD-ROMs for
distribution to the respective district assemblies.
47.   The project will also support the development of a Geo-spatial Information Framework (GIF) as
the main vehicle for coordinating the production and exchange of data sets among institutions, expanding
on the Land Information Project Operations Committee (LIPOC) established under ERMP. The
development, distribution and maintenance a metadata catalog will also be supported, as well as the
development and maintenance of a Web site to disseminate information about available data sets.
Establishment of a GIF is expected to have high-level government support, and a stakeholders workshop
would be organized under the project to determine roles and responsibilities, as well as to formulate
operational mechanisms. Work on the component MIS, the regional and district EIS, and the geo-spatial
information framework would commence in NRMP I and be continued in subsequent phases of the
program.
Component 5: Biodiversity Conservation
(Total program cost for 6-year GEF-financed program: US $9.4 million, including $1.6 million for
qualifying expenditures under the Wildlife Component)
48.   Financed by the GEF, this component would confirm, refine and document priority areas within
the high forest zone that are of global importance for biodiversity conservation to be excluded from
future logging; develop and implement community- based management plans for protection of these
areas; finance alternative livelihood schemes for affected communities; and provide for ongoing
monitoring and evaluation of biological and social indicators of program performance. The component
will address priorities for global biodiversity conservation in three ways: (i) reclassification of high
biodiversity value forest reserves and major fractions of reserves as Globally Significant Biodiversity
Areas (GSBAs) where future logging would not be permitted; (ii) systematic identification and
demarcation of high biological priority zones within production forest reserves, and their designation as
Provenance Reserves where logging and other consumptive uses will be eliminated or tightly regulated,
and (iii) improved fire protection for dry forest remnants and outliers that are of high biological
importance and under threat from bushfires.
49.   Baseline Surveys, Applied Research and Monitoring. The project will finance applications-
oriented research in support of the objectives of sustainable conservation and locally based management.
The project will draw on completed work such the recommendations on forest protection in Ghana from
the National Forest Inventory, emerging priorities from ongoing work such as the Important Bird Areas
surveys, and studies to be commissioned under the project such as a national assessment of primate
conservation priorities and options. The purpose of this project subcomponent is to pull together into a
consistent and analytically robust framework, the results of these analyses of different biological taxa and
to define an effective program to address conservation priorities within the forest reserve network.
Implementation of this subcomponent would involve close inter-institutional collaboration between the
FD and the WD and significant input from Ghanaian universities and research institutes with
demonstrated sectoral experience.  Where domestic expertise is limited, institutional twinning
relationships would be sought with external organizations with a demonstrable interest in long term
cooperation and academic collaboration.
50.   Establishment of GSBAs. Analysis of global priorities for conservation of botanical diversity in
Ghanaian forests has identified, within the existing forest reserve system, a potential network of thirty
reserves which are proposed for either full (1 1) or partial (19) protection to provide global security for
floristic diversity. The total area of these reserves represents approximately 400,000 ha or 25 percent of



-47-                                  Annex 2
the existing forest reserve system that would be included in the conservation progran. Of this total,
approximately 130,000 ha would be permanently removed or excluded from logging exploitation or other
consumptive harvesting. These areas include both the finest remaining examples of "pristine" or "old-
growth" forests as well as some of the last surviving remnants of forest formations that are now
extremely rare in Ghana and elsewhere in the region. Through a systematic process of participatory
strategic and operational planning the project would develop integrated management plans for the GSBAs
to be implemented under a collaborative management program with local communities. Specific project-
financed activities will include: mapping, delineation and demarcation of GSBAs; establishment of a
community-based monitoring program for key indicators; support for development of community based
enterprises with direct linkage to biodiversity conservation objectives; and integration of biodiversity
conservation with the general FD initiative for collaborative management of forest resources both on and
off reserve. The baseline studies would be completed and 25 percent of the proposed GSBAs demarcated
in the first two years of the program, corresponding to NRMP I.
51.   Alternative Livelihood Investments. It is generally accepted that rural residents who are the legal
owners of resources held in trust by Government within the reserved forest estate, should not be made to
bear the full cost in terms of lost revenues and/or opportunities of forest protection to conserve
biodiversity for the "global" community. Acknowledging this, the project would establish a foundation to
finance income generating small scale enterprises and invest in alternative livelihood projects that would:
improve the economic status of the communities living around the GSBAs and encourage them to
participate in the program and forgo income previously generated from the newly designated GSBAs; and
relieve pressure on biological resources by supporting alternative development options. Investment in
plantation development, whereby communities who forego income from harvesting rights in GSBAs
would be compensated with shareholdings in new plantation developments off-reserve would be strongly
supported. The direct cost of establishment and maintenance of approximately thirty GSBAs is estimated
at $ 3.5 million. The form, scope and operational modalities of community development activities and
alternative livelihood investments to be implemented as part of the management"contracts" developed
under the collaborative management scheme would be developed during NRMP I and agreed with
communities, govermment and GEF.
52.   National Capacity Building. An explicit aim of the project is to involve national NGOs, CBOs,
academic and research institutions in implementation to build country capacity for collaborative resource
management with maximum involvement of local communities in planning, implementation and
monitoring activities. Following the same methodology and general approach as the integrated forest
management component for production reserves and the village-based land management approach of the
savanna resource management component, this component will emphasize the empowerment of local
communities to play a lead role in reserve management. To this end the project will finance
decentralization of management to district and community level and grassroots public awareness
activities under the wildlife component as well as specific site enhancement activities such as fire break
establishment, border clearing and enrichment planting as pilots in five reserves during NRMP I.
53.   Identification and Establishment of Provenance Reserves. Building on the methodology and
local expertise developed under the project for identification of GSBAs, the project would seek to extend
conservation more effectively into the domain of the production forest reserves which represents some
one million ha, or about 60 percent or the reserved forest estate. By extending the botanical and
zoological surveys into this domain the project will identify critical natural habitats for fauna and
important sites for preservation of genetic diversity in tree stocks and other flora.
54.   The biodiversity conservation activities of the project will be managed by a GSBA coordinator
situated within the Forest Management Support Center of the GFS. A GSBA Technical Advisory Group



-48 -                                 Annex 2
would be established to support subproject implementation, under the guidance of the PCU. The GFS
will collaborate with WD under a Memorandum of Understanding to ensure an integrated approach to
faunal and floral diversity and habitat within an ecosystem-based management system for biodiversity in
the GSBAs and other forest reserves. At the local level, site management committees will play an
increasing role in management decision making and locally-recruited community forest monitors will
play a significant role in routine surveillance.
Implementation Schedule
55.   The program would be implemented in three phases, the first covering a period of two years, and
the second and third covering four years each. The first phase (NRMP I) would concentrate on finalizing
policy reform and enacting legislation; institutional restructuring and strengthening; completing resource
assessments and undertaking baseline technical and socio-economic studies; and, finalizing plans for
implementation of collaborative resource management programs. Provided NRMP I is successfully
implemented, the second phase (NRMP II) would be initiated, focusing mainly on the country-wide
implementation of these resource management programs. The third phase (NRMP III) would complete
country-wide implementation, taking into account the experiences of NRMP II. The main component
activities in NRMP I can be summarized as follows:

protected; (vi) promoting establishment of private tree nurseries; (vii) expansion of ongoing bushfire
prevention program; (viii) baseline surveying of firewood/charcoal marketing and consumption; (ix)
inception workshops with woodfuel stakeholders in pilot districts -- leading to National Woodfuels
Workshop in mid- 1998; study tours to Burkina Faso; and preparation of the National Action Plan to
combat desertification.
Wildlife Resource Management: (i) restructure management organization of WD in accordance with
findings of the Institutional Review; (ii) recruit qualified staff to fill vacancies in senior management,
administrative and technical posts; (iii) implement staff training in line with recently prepared human
resource development plan; (iv) establish NGO liaison function; (v) define and adopt policies and
procedures for expanding NGO participation in protected area management, public awareness, and
facilitating collaborative management of wildlife resources; (vi) develop and implement policy,
guidelines and procedures to actively encourage and facilitate private sector involvement in protected
area management; (vii) review protected area system plan and prioritize infrastructure investments for
rehabilitation of parks, zoos and other managed areas -- prepare designs and contract documentation
for priority infrastructure; (viii) develop extension capacity for supporting district and community
level wildlife conservation and management; and (ix) finalize the MOU between WD and the Forestry
Service for cooperative management and monitoring of GSBAs.
Environmental Management Coordination and Monitoring: (i) implementation of EPA's HRD plan;
(ii) development of MIS for forest, savanna and wildlife components; and (iii) development and
installation of regional and district level EIS, and the Geo-spatial Information Framework.
56.   With the strengthened institutions and required policy reform in place, and baseline studies and
surveys completed, subsequent phases of the program   would concentrate on the country-wide
implementation of the collaborative management programs for forest and NTFPs, savanna woodland and
wildlife resources, on a scale and timetable to be determined during NRMP I.

GHANA: Natural Resource Management Project I
Financial and Economic Analysis'
1.     The Natural Resources Management Program  is a complex operation, consisting of five
components which together seek to improve natural resources management in Ghana. The program is
divided into three phases of two, four and four years duration, respectively. Most of the activities in each
component in the first phase focus on policy reform, building local capacity and strengthening institutions
and do not lend themselves to standard economic analysis since the linkages of improved institutional
capacity to productivity or health benefits are indirect. Also, some of the expected benefits, like
biodiversity conservation, wildlife protection and soil moisture retention, are difficult to assess accurately
from a technical standpoint and even more so from an economic one. Therefore, the strategy for financial
and economic work for this program is aimed at: (i) quantifying economic benefits where possible (e.g.,
woodfuel and wood products and crop benefits in the Savanna zone, improved efficiency of timber
harvesting in high forests, bushmeat and tourism benefits under the wildlife component, wood output
benefits under the high forest and plantation components); (ii) qualitatively describing expected benefits
in all other cases; and (iii) suggesting where baseline and monitoring work should focus, so that improved
financial and economic analyses could be undertaken before commencing NRMP II. Important work to
be undertaken during NRMP I will, therefore, be the collection of critical baseline data and the
implementation of pilot operations to generate information needed for more detailed analysis and, if
necessary, modification of program implementation parameters for the second and third phases of the
program.
High Forest Component
2.     The main productivity benefits under the program will arise due to the reforms in the incentive
framework, and in particular the increased royalty rates (prior to Credit effectiveness) and the possibility
of a replacement of the log export ban with an appropriate export tax.2 The envisaged institution
building is intended to help reap the full benefits of the policy reforms and to institutionalize the system
of collaborative management of natural resources with local communities. It will also help reduce or
eliminate illegal logging and other extractive activities, where private benefits are generated on the basis
of the public or common-property assets.
3.     The logging and sawmilling industries are an important part of the Ghanaian economy. It is
estimated that in 1996 they generated US$350 million of value added, or about 5 percent of Ghana's
GDP.3 Forest revenue collection, while significant, has been well below optimal levels and as a result of
project initiatives, is expected to be increased substantially. Revenue collected by the Forestry
Department during 1996 was only  14.1 billion, or about US$9 million,4 and originated almost entirely
from the high forest. Some p5.7 billion (or about US$3.6 million) were transferred to local authorities
representing the resource owners. It is expected that royalty collection under the project will increase
significantly compared to a without-project situation as a result of higher royalty rates, improved
collection procedures, increased institutional efficiency and the introduction of computerized log
tracking. Commitments on the proportion of royalties to be distributed to local communities and the

taken until the study of its implications has been completed during Phase I.

modalities of doing this effectively will be sought at negotiations. Higher (i.e., more realistic) resource
pricing would be expected to: (i) provide higher returns to the local communities who own the forest
resources and thereby strengthen their motivation to play an active part in collaborative resource
management, (ii) induce sawmillers to become more efficient and less wasteful, and (iii) promote private
investment in timber plantations.
4.     Twelve collaborative forest management pilots are to be initiated during NRMP I. These will
provide practical experience with the new approaches to promote effective collaboration between staff of
the Forest Service and the local communities, with the objective of improving overall management
efficiency. In South Asia, a similar approach has proven quite successful. No empirical data for this
approach are available as yet, but some results are expected from six of the twelve collaborative pilots to
be undertaken during NRMP I. In the absence of data, some illustrative calculations have been done,
using basic assumptions.5 They indicate a rate of return of about 20 percent. Main questions about this
illustrative quantification relate to differing actual growth rates in the with and without project cases and
to whether significant improvements in collaborative forest management could actually be achieved
without a significant improvement in the incentive framework.
5.     A comprehensive study to be undertaken during NRMP I to assess the effects of the log export
ban and evaluate alternatives such as an export tax and phased reductions in the export tax rates over time
during subsequent phases of the program (see the attached draft TOR). Tentatively, the effects of
replacing the log export ban with an export tax of, say, 30 percent (with slow/gradual reduction over
time) would be as follows: tree owners would benefit, since the value of their asset would increase, and
even land values may be positively affected. Sawmillers and furniture manufacturers would incur higher
input unit costs, but would still be favored compared to world market prices.6 In response to these higher
input unit costs, they vwould improve their operating efficiency and reduce waste so as to reduce their
input volume and, hence, overall input costs. The pricing reforms would be designed and implemented in
a way to provide the appropriate incentives for the local industries. Local consumers of furniture might
have to pay higher prices than they do at present, if higher input costs were not fully offset by increased
efficiency.
6.     Figure 1 illustrates the effects. Pw is the world price or the free market export price of logs. Pa
is the current domestic price, and Pt is the price that would prevail domestically if the export ban were
replaced by a 30 percent export tax. Because of the policy change, timber owners/producers would incur
a welfare gain in the amount of DECA. Consumers would experience a loss in the amount of DEBA (yet
would still be better off than the world's average log consumer/purchaser). The country would obtain a
net social gain shown by area ECB.
7.     Using upper and lower-bound assumptions regarding supply and demand elasticities, the welfare
effects can be estimated. The current fob export price for tropical hardwood logs is about US$240/m3.
With the log export ban, domestic log prices have been severely depressed and are only 20-25 percent of
the fob export price. The mid-point of 22.5 percent is equal to about US$54/m3. With a 30 percent tax,
the domestic price would be about US$168/m3 (at the wholesale level near the point of export). To make
5  Total log production of 1 million m3, declining over time by 3 percent p.a. in the without project case; a value of
US$200/m3 (border price minus US$40/m3 transport costs); a decline of 3 percent p.a. until project year 6 and a rate
of decline of 1.5 percent per year from then until year 20. As costs, the costs of the high forest component are used,
including an imputed cost of US$400,000 annually from year 7 (to maintain the investments undertaken during the
initial six project years).
6  Log prices in Ghana are much below international prices, partly because of the log export ban, and partly because the
FD sells the wood of the farmers at prices which were set years ago. FORIG, for example, which is not bound by the
official royalty rates, sell their occasional logs at several times the FD prices.

economy would continue to incur
significant net welfare losses. In addition
to the net welfare gains that can be obtained by replacing the export ban with an export tax, incremental
revenues are expected to accrue to the Treasury under an export tax option. The very significant
producers' surplus would be obtained by current tree owners which are mostly people in rural, local
communities, so that there would be a significant poverty alleviation impact. The reform, while very
beneficial for the country as a whole, would also have negative effects on certain groups, however: the
less efficient sawmills would have to close, and this would entail some losses in jobs. This would be
outweighed, however, by job creation elsewhere, such as in the plantations sector where improved
incentives for private tree production would generate employment. Employment gains would also be

realized in the nature tourism sector (see below). The log export ban study would refine the above
estimates within a multi-market framework.
9.    Plantation-grown logs are already exempt from the log export ban. Plantation owners therefore
can export the produced timber at world market prices. A financial analysis was carried out for tree
planting operations in Ghana by the FAO as part of NRMP preparation activities.7 Five different
plantation management models were analyzed, and the financial rate of return for these models ranged
from 12 to 18 percent. Private sector plantations are a key element for creating a sustainable forestry and
wood processing sector over the medium to long term -- and a favorable incentive environment is
essential to encourage significant acreages to be planted and properly managed by the private sector. The
plantations component is being prepared by the AfDB and is expected to be appraised during NRMP I,
when detailed financial and economic analyses will be carried out. Depending on the outcome of this
work, and the private sector response, plantation development stimulated by the project would begin
during NRMP II.
10.   Aside from net social welfare gains from a more efficient incentive system, there would also be
other economic benefits from an improvement in the protection and management of these forests, such as
biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, regulation of stream flows, and soil conservation.
Biodiversity Component
11.   This component does not lend itself to economic analysis since no monetary value can be placed
on species and/or ecosystems. However, an analysis has been undertaken of "incremental costs" -- i.e.,
of the additional costs accruing to Ghana for protecting its globally valuable biodiversity. Since
differentiating between costs incurred for biodiversity protection from a strictly national point of view
and those supporting biodiversity values of global interest is most difficult, the simplifying assumption
was made that incremental costs are equal to total costs. This analysis is presented in Annex 4b.
Savanna Component
12.   The main economic benefits of the savanna component would be increased production of
woodfuels, poles, roofing and fencing material, crops, livestock, bushmeat, and other non-wood forest
products. Other benefits, more difficult to quantify, include: a reduction of the incidence of bush fires
which, in addition to their effects on vegetation, wildlife, soil fertility and water supplies, cause air
pollution and affect the health of the local population; reduced soil erosion; improved in-situ soil moisture
conservation; a reduction in the incidence and severity of floods, which damage productive assets; a
stabilization of stream flows, which enhances the reliability of water for economic use; and an improved
living environment due to increased green vegetation.
13.   The project would provide use rights to woodland reserves, and it is expected that legal
harvesting would increase and access would be more equitable. With proper management, it is expected
that sustainable wood outputs (mainly fuelwood and charcoal, but also poles, etc.) increase over the
without project situation -- or that a decline in output would be smaller than it would otherwise be.
Information for an economic analysis is extremely sketchy. One source indicates that there are an
estimated 9 million ha of woodlands in the Savanna zone of Northern Ghana.8 Another estimates that in
the whole of Ghana about 16 million m3 of fuelwood, valued at about US$200 million (or US$12.50/m3),
are consumed annually. Roughly one half of this is produced in the Savanna zone. For purposes of a
rough economic analysis it is assumed that in the "without project" scenario fuelwood output would

decline by 1 percent per year during the 20-year time horizon of the analysis. In the "with-project" case,
declines would become smaller by 0.1 percent each year, beginning in project year 4, until output
stabilizes in project year 13. Assuming a constant fuelwood price of US$12.50/m3, and comparing the
benefit stream with the project costs of the Savanna component, this results in a rate of return of 14
percent (see Table 2). Given the lack of data on current wood output, a baseline survey is needed in
NRMP I, along with monitoring of project and non-project areas (see below).
14     Benefits from increased crop productivity will need to be determined through pilot operations
during Phase I, but an attempt was made to determine an order of magnitude of these likely benefits. It is
assumed that productivity benefits would begin in project year 3 and stabilize from year 6 onward. It is
estimated that the project would induce incremental production of some 11,250 tons of foodgrains, 7,000
tons of cassava and 2,400 tons of groundnuts and cowpeas in year 6 and thereafter. Taking into account
incremental labor and capital costs associated with this increased production,9 the incremental benefits
are estimated to increase from US$767,250 in project year 3 to US$3,645,000 in years 6 through 20 (in
constant 1997 prices). The analysis indicates a Net Present Value of US$2,004,000 and an internal rate
of return (ERR) of 13 percent (see Table 2). 10
15     During NRMP I, work would be undertaken to assess the cost and benefits discussed above and
to set in motion monitoring and data collection so that a better evaluation would be possible at a later
time:
(i) Additional, more reliable information on biomass production and utilization, and especially
woodfuel and charcoal originating from savanna woodlands, will be sought. Second, information
will be collected regarding crop productivity increases in "with project" and "without project"
situations for on-going operations that use the terroir approach, particularly for pilot projects in
Ghana. Third, data will be collected and analyses undertaken concerning livestock and livestock
products. Fourth, work on determining the levels of wildlife populations would be done to
facilitate an assessment of sustainable levels of bushmeat "harvesting" and how this could be
increased with the project (or how a decline could be prevented). Finally, information is needed
on trends in natural resources degradation, extent of areas affected, differences between areas,
etc.
(ii) Appropriate base line surveys will be designed and undertaken in target communities.
(iii) An effective monitoring and evaluation mechanism will be designed to track productivity
trends in project communities and in control groups.
9 Labor costs are assumed to be US$2.00/day. Whether labor should be shadow priced depends on the extent of un-
and underemployment in the region. It is assumed here that there is no significant adult underemployment during
key agricultural seasons. If shadow pricing were applicable, net benefits would rise somewhat. A reduction in the
price of labor by 30 percent would result in an ERR of 14 percent and an NPV of US$3,251,000, while a 30 percent
increase in the cost of labor would result in an ERR of 11 percent and an NPV of US$756,000.- The other key issue
relevant for the ERR is the amount of project costs "charged" to the crops component. If no such costs were
incurred, and/or if the productivity gains could be obtained without them, the profitability would be very high.
Conservative assumptions have been made for purposes of this analysis. Since the relationship between these costs
and the projected production increases is not known, the economic assessment of necessity is based on judgment.
10 A 10 percent lower estimate of incremental yields would result in an ERR of 10 percent and an NPV of minus
US$33,000. 20 percent lower incremental yields would give an ERR of 7 percent and an NPV of minus
US$2,070,000. And a 30 percent reduction would yield an ERR of 4 percent and an NPV of minus US$4,108,000.

Wildlife Component
16.    Ghana's wildlife is a national heritage that needs to be managed wisely for the overall benefit of
society. From an economic and revenue-generating perspective, two outputs/services are particularly
relevant: (i) wildlife viewing and nature experiences, and (ii) bushmeat production.
17.    Statistics are not available concerning tourists visiting Ghana primarily for nature tourism
purposes or those that may visit for other purposes and include one or more nature tourism visits in their
program. But in 1992 there were 5,688 paying visitors to a least one of the five major protected areas,
and in 1996 this number had increased to 27,425. Much of this increase has been concentrated on one
single park, Kakum, which has seen effective improvements in management, visitor facilities, and
provision of experienced guides, in recent years. It has been estimated that visitors to at least one park
would total about 32,800 in 1997,11 and this number may reach 35-38,000 in 1998. Many of these
visitors are in Ghana for other reasons (business, or cultural tourism), and some of them visit a park. For
an economic analysis it is important to know for how many of these park visitors the availability of nature
tourism sites (flora and fauna) was a key decision factor in visiting Ghana or not visiting it. It is
conservatively assumed here that this currently applies to about 4,000 visitors (or about I percent of all
tourist arrivals).
18.    For the "without-project" situation, starting from this base of 4,000 visitors, one would expect the
growth in foreign nature tourism to increase at a declining rate, with the total number of tourists visiting
Ghana mainly for ecological reasons stabilizing at about 6,400 visitors per year in 2007/08. By contrast,
for the "with project" case, it is assumed that visitor numbers would continue to increase at 10 percent per
year during the project period, at 5 percent p.a. for the following five years, and then stabilize at about
8,200 visitors annually. The incremental stream of visitors would reach a plateau of about 1,800 visitors
annually in year 11. Combining incremental visitor numbers with their estimated average expenditures
results in a rough estimate for incremental foreign exchange earnings (or incremental benefits), which
increase from zero in year 1 to US$1.3 million in year 2008 and remain stable thereafter.12 Taking into
account project costs and subsequent O&M costs, this analysis suggests that the proposed investment in
the wildlife sector would result in an economic rate of return of 6 percent and a Net Present Value of
US$2.2 million (see Table 3).13 Specific data collection and analyses would be carried out during Phase
I to provide more definitive parameters on the economic and financial benefits of this program
component.
19.    The second -- and more significant -- major benefit associated with the wildlife component is
likely to be the production of bushmeat. To obtain a sustainable flow of bushmeat, overharvesting must
be avoided. Hunters estimate that bushmeat availability is decreasing by about 5 percent per year, but a 3
percent decline per year may be more realistic. A bushmeat study estimates that about 260,000 tons of
bushmeat are harvested each year. At an assumed price of US$0.5/kg, this would be equivalent to a retail
value of US$130 million at "the farmgate." In the "with-project" situation the decline of the relevant
wildlife populations is slowed, beginning in project year 6. Adding the benefit of a reduced rate of

12 In 1996 tourist arrivals totaled about 300,000, and foreign exchange earnings from tourism were estimated at US$248
million, implying that the average tourist spent about US$827 in the country. It is assumed here that nature tourists
spend the same amount of foreign exchange as the average tourist, and that this number (in constant 1998 Dollars)
remains constant over time.
13 The rate of return is reasonably robust: a 20 percent lower level of initial tourists visiting mainly for purposes of
nature tourism (i.e., a drop from 4,000 to 3,200) would reduce the rate of return from 6 percent to 3 percent.
Similarly, if nature tourists, on average, spend 20 percent less foreign exchange than the average tourist (i.e., US$662
instead of US$827), this would also result in a rate of return of 3 percent.

decline of bushmeat harvesting to the benefits from tourism, a rate of decline of bushmeat production of
1.5 percent would result in an internal rate of return of 31 percent for the wildlife component. A 2
percent rate of decline would render an IRR of 26 percent, and a 2.5 percent rate of decline would give an
IRR of 19 percent.
Revenue Capture
20.   At present, park entry fees in Ghana are very low by international standards. For East African
parks it is now common to charge around US$20 per person per day, while an entry permit for Mole
National Park is only US$1.80 for a foreign tourist. Even at present, with limited infrastructure and other
services and recognizing that East African parks offer more spectacular experiences, more could be
charged without a significant reduction in the number of paying visitors, for whom park entry fees are a
very small portion of the overall expenses connected with a visit to Ghana. Charging higher fees would
be even more justified once the project is underway and better conditions have been created for an
improved nature tourism experience.
21.   Whereas the economic analysis above considered incremental foreign tourists visiting Ghana
because of improved nature viewing possibilities, this section deals with all paying visitors, whether
foreign or local. It is assumed that in project year 1 (1998/99) there would be about 40,000 entries to
individual parks by foreigners. Assuming that park entry fees are about US$1.00 per visit, this would
imply revenues of US$40,000 per year. If the entry fees (combined with rental fees for tents, water cans,
etc.) were increased in steps to an average of US$8 in year 6, and using the earlier assumptions about
visitor growth rates, this would increase revenues to US$515,000 in project year 6 and to US$658,000 in
year 1 1.
Environmental Management Component
22.   This component will continue the institution building, the coordination work and the information
management work initiated under the Environmental Resources and Management Project, which is
expected to close at the end of 1998. NRMP would support those activities that relate to management and
coordination of natural resources management, including training. Through EPA and MLGRD, the
project would also assist with district-level capacity building to prepare environmental action plans and to
participate in district-level land use planning. Most of the costs associated with this component are those
of information management equipment.
23.   The benefits of capacity building and an improved information management capacity are indirect.
It is not possible to estimate benefits associated with this component, but it is reasonable to assume that it
will contribute to an improvement in the overall efficiency in decision making about resource
management and resource use at the national, regional, and district levels. Since the ERMP has helped
build up "institutional capital," such capital would be drawn down in the "without project" case. The
"with project" scenario would help maintain and further increase that institutional capital. Such capital
must be built up in the public sector, given the externality issues associated with many natural resources
management problems as well as the productive uses of resources owned by the government and local
communities.

GHANA - Natural Resource Management Project I
Log Export Ban Study Draft Terms of Reference
Objective
The development objectives in the forest sector are to achieve sustainability over the longer term
and maximize the social net benefits for Ghanaian society from this sector. The main purpose of the
proposed analysis are to assess different policy options and determine how conducive they are for
creating an incentive system that will move Ghana's forest sector toward improved efficiency at all
levels, toward sustainability and toward maximizing net social welfare gains. For each option to be
considered, the impacts on key stakeholder groups must be analyzed and quantified -- including tree
owners, loggers, sawmillers, furniture manufacturers, private tree growers, and consumers of wood and
wood products. Government revenue impacts are also to be estimated (from different import/export tax
regimes). Social and environmental impact are to be qualitatively assessed and mitigating measures
discussed and costed, where feasible. Impacts of policy scenarios on illegal activity cannot easily be
quantified, but the study team should use its best judgment in reaching qualitative conclusions about the
incentives created by different policy and regulatory frameworks, given the institutional capacities for
monitoring. Political feasibility must not be a criterion in analyzing the various options; the study must
be of highest technical quality and thereby provide the inputs -- or foundation -- for an informed policy
discussion.
The following policy scenarios should be considered and analyzed by the study:
Option 1: Status Quo. This option assumes that present policies remain in effect, i.e., a log export ban,
actual collection of royalty rates, current export tariffs on processed wood and furniture, as well as a 25
percent duty on all furniture imports.
Option 2: Removal of the Log Export Ban Without Replacement by an Export Tax. This option
may neither be in the best interest of the country nor politically feasible. Nevertheless, the study team
should quantify the impacts for this scenario. The main problems with this option may be the pace of
reform; in the long run, this may actually be close to a socially optimal case.
Option 3: Replacement of the Log Export Ban by an Export Tax. This option entails a replacement
of the log export ban by an export tax of, say, 30 percent and subsequent annual decrease in the rate of
2.5 percent to reach a final rate of 10 percent in year 8 or a rate of 5 percent in year 10. Various
suboptions may have to be considered, such as a replacement of the export ban by an export tax of 40
percent and a subsequent annual decrease by 5 percent to reach a "final" rate of 10 percent in year 6 or 5
percent in year
Options 2 and 3 should also make assumptions about export and import tax rates on processed wood and
furniture (and calculate the corresponding effects).
Other Options
The study must quantitatively assess the above options, but it is not limited to these. It may also consider
and assess other options in various degrees of detail in consultation with Government.

GHANA: Natural Resource Management Project I
Incremental Cost Analysis - Biodiversity Conservation
Development Goals
1.    Ghana's forests are part of the Guinea-Congolean phytogeographical region, and their flora and
fauna show strong affinities with the forests of C6te d'Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The general
pattern is of wetter forests in the south-west, and drier forests toward the north and east. The forest
resources are divided into two broad ecological zones; (i) the high forest zone of southern Ghana and (ii)
the savanna woodland of northern Ghana. The high forest zone covers about 82,000 km2, approximately
one third of the entire land area, and has been the main focus of the country's forest management efforts.
Today, about 20,000 km2 of natural forest cover remains of which 80 percent is within gazetted forest
reserves.
2.     The Forest and Wildlife Policy (1994) and Forestry Development Master Plan (1996) are the
foundation for current forest management policy and the basis for the project. The Forest and Wildlife
Policy "...aims at conservation and sustainable development of the nation's forest and wildlife resources
for maintenance of environmental quality and perpetual flow of optimum benefits to all segments of
society." The Master Plan includes strategies for forest protection, forest production and increasing
community participation in forest and woodland management and in revenue sharing from forest
resources.
3.     The key development objectives of the Government's forest policy and of the project are to: (i)
ensure a sustainable supply of forest products and an equitable distribution of the benefits from
sustainable exploitation of those products; (ii) prevent any further environmental degradation of forest
resources due to unsustainable depletion; and (iii) stimulate community involvement in sustainable
management of the forest resources.
Baseline Situation
4.     The baseline project activities which Ghana could reasonably have been expected to undertake on
national development grounds to achieve these goals, had it not explicitly taken global environment
considerations into account, are: (a) facilitation of forest management policy reforms to increase forest
resource rent capture and revenue collection, plus restructuring and capacity-building of public sector
forest management bodies ($21.4 million); (b) design and implementation of participatory and sustainable
forest management plans in forest reserves to match production to sustainable supply and promote
community involvement and benefit sharing in forest resource management and exploitation, plus the
restoration of degraded reserves ($5.1 million); (c) design and implementation of participatory
management plans for the Savannah woodlands and associated capacity building ($13.0 million); (d)
strengthening of national park planning and operations to the extent justified by national conservation
objectives and the potential for additional tourism benefits ($9.9 million); further strengthening
environmental management capacity at the national, regional, and district levels ($4.1); and (e) modest
management planning and operations support for selected biodiversity-rich high forest reserves that will
be taken out of production to more effectively conserve their biodiversity ($0.5 million). The total cost of
the baseline program is $54.0 million.

Global Environment Objectives
5.    The project's global environment objective is to better conserve the rich biodiversity of Ghana's
forests. Over 2,100 plant species are present in the biologically-rich moist tropical forest zone. In the
closed canopy forest, over 730 tree species have been recorded. The fauna of the forest zone includes
over 200 species of mammals, many of which are rare or endangered, including the bongo, Ogilby's
duiker, golden cat, chimpanzee, forest elephant and the pygmy hippopotamus. Twelve primate species
occur within the forest zone, of which three are highly endangered. It also contains over 200 species of
birds, 74 species of bats, 37 rodents and numerous reptiles. Under the baseline course of action, Ghana
would have continued to manage its national park system at the level of expenditure it can currently
justify, but opportunities to improve conservation in the national parks through more effective
management would have been missed. In the forest reserves, some of which are richer in terms of
biodiversity than the national parks, Ghana would have continued to exploit the forest resources for
national development purposes to the detriment of the biodiversity therein.
6.     To achieve its global environment objectives, the GEF alternative aims to: (i) protect a significant
portion of the forest biodiversity through an ecosystem approach to management within the high forest
zone that involves strengthening national park management and taking selected high-biodiversity forest
reserves out of production and put them under participatory and effective conservation management; (ii)
improve knowledge of the distribution and status of rare, threatened and endemic species through
targeted surveys so as to be able to better focus conservation measures; (iii) enhance the protection of
areas that are critical for migratory species through improved monitoring and habitat management; and,
(iv) ensure sustainability and preserve genetic diversity within non-timber forest species that are collected
by rural populations for medicinal and consumptive uses by improved data collection, harvesting
regulation and their sustainable management within the forest reserves.
GEF Alternative
7.    Under the GEF alternative, Ghana will enhance the conservation of its globally-significant forest
biodiversity by supplementing the baseline activities with the following additional measures: (a) further
strengthening conservation planning and management of the national park system; and (b) in the forest
reserves, (i) classifying areas that are particularly rich in biodiversity as Special Biological Protection
Areas, taking them out of production, upgrading the conservation of their biological resources and
compensating the affected communities for the forest product income they will lose through alternative
livelihood schemes, such as ecotourism, sustainable use of non-timber forest products and restoration of
degraded woodlands; and (ii) designing and adopting more environmentally-friendly logging practices
and additional conservation measures within the production forests.
8.     To achieve these objectives, the following additional activities will be financed under the GEF
alternative: (a) the design and implementation of more effective management plans for biodiversity
conservation in the national parks and in the forest reserves that remain in production ($1.6 million); and
(b) the design and implementation of community-based conservation management plans for the forest
reserves that will be taken out of production, which includes (i) fire protection, baseline species
inventories, population monitoring and conservation of threatened and endangered species ($4.3 million
net, after deducting cost savings of $1.9 million in avoided concession management costs) plus (ii)
alternative livelihood investments to compensate the communities affected by taking these reserves out of
production for the economic benefits they will forego as a result ($2.8 million net, after deducting $0.2
million in avoided crop and homestead losses from reduced incidence of forest fires, making the
additional cost of this component $7.1 million). The total cost of the GEF alternative is $62.7 million.

Incremental Costs
9.            The agreed incremental costs for which GEF funding is requested in order to achieve the global
environment benefits of the GEF alternative are therefore $8.7 million.

GHANA: Natural Resource Management Project I
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
1.    All works, goods and services financed under the IDA credit and the GEF grant would be
procured in accordance with the appropriate IDA guidelines (Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans
and IDA Credits, January 1995 and as revised in January & August 1996; and Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997 and as revised September 1997).
Procurement of goods works and services would be the responsibility of the Project Coordination Unit
(PCU) of the Ministry of Lands and Forestry. This unit already has staff fully familiar with Bank
procurement guidelines, having implemented the recently closed IDA-funded FRMP. The procurement
unit established within the EPA under the ongoing IDA-supported ERMP would be maintained and
would procure selected works, goods and technical assistance required specifically for EPA under the
proposed project. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) would be used for the procurement of
all works and goods, and the Bank's Standard Request for Proposals would be used for all consulting
assignments.
2.    A General Procurement Notice (GPN) is mandatory and would be published in the UN
Development Business and in a national newspaper as provided under the Guidelines. The GPN would
be updated on a yearly basis and would show all outstanding ICB for goods and works contracts and all
international consulting contracts. In addition, a Specific Procurement Notice (SPN) is required for all
ICB and all consulting services with a value in excess of US$200,000 prior to the preparation of the
shortlist.
3.    Works (IDA US$0.97 million/GEF US$0.81 million). Project-financed civil works mostly relate
to the establishment of regional offices of implementing agencies under the savanna and wildlife resource
components; upgrading of district offices; rehabilitation of infrastructure in national parks and zoological
gardens; and construction of limited staff housing. The construction sites are dispersed within regions
and districts. The total value of the construction program is small, and the dispersed location and modest
value of its individual components would be unlikely to attract the interest of international contractors.
Therefore, the recommended mode of procurement for civil works is National Competitive Bidding
(NCB).
4.    Goods (IDA US$ 2.06 million/GEF US$0.79 million). The project would finance procurement
of vehicles, furniture, office equipment, computers, field equipment and communication equipment for
use by the implementing agencies. To the extent possible and practicable, goods and equipment to be
purchased under the project would be combined into packages estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$200,000 or more and would be procured under ICB procedures using IDA Standard Bidding
Documents. Limited International Bidding procedures would be used where there is only a limited
number of suppliers. Contracts for goods available locally for an aggregate amount of US$0.74 million
with contracts between US$50,000 and US$200,000 each would be procured through National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) using procedures acceptable to IDA. Office furniture would be procured
locally under NCB. Procurement for readily available off-the-shelf goods that cannot be grouped or
standard specifications commodities for individual contracts of less than US$50,000 and not exceeding an
aggregate amount of US$100,000 for the life of the project would be procured on the basis of comparison
of quotations from at least three eligible national suppliers. If these goods are not available in the
country, international shopping procedures would be followed.



- 67 -                                Annex 6
5.    Services (IDA US$1.52 million/GEF US$2.77 million). These services consist of technical
assistance, studies, trairning and workshops. Consultancy packages relate to institutional strengthening
and restructuring of the GFS and the WD; the technical implementation of new resource management
procedures, forest revenue accounting and auditing procedures; design and execution of surveys, research
and monitoring of forest ecosystems and implementation of the alternative livelihood investment program
under the GEF-financed biodiversity component; and resource surveying and development of GIS and
remote sensing-based analytical and monitoring capacity under the savanna component. Selection and
appointment of consultants for studies, technical assistance and support of project execution will be
carried out in accordance with the Consultant Guidelines. As a rule, consultant services will be procured
through Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS) methodology. All consultancy assignments estimated
to cost the equivalent of US$200,000 or more would be advertised in a national newspaper and in
Development Business (UNDB). In addition, the contracts may be advertised in an international
newspaper or a technical magazine seeking "expressions of interest." All consulting assignments in the
range of US$100,000 to US$200,000 would be procured through QCBS. In the case of assignments
estimated at US$100,000 or less, the assignment may be advertised nationally and the shortlist may be
made up entirely of national consultants, provided that at least three qualified national firms are available
in the country and foreign consultants who wish to participate are not excluded from consideration.
Consultant services estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$50,000 may be contracted by
comparing the qualifications of consultants who have expressed an interest in the job or who have been
identified. Auditors would be selected using Least-Cost Selection procedures. The training program is
geared toward improving management and technical capacity of the GFS, WD and EPA. The overall
program (international and national) amounts to US$1.6 million and each agency's costed annual training
program would be subject to the Bank's prior review and approval, as would the workshop programs.
6.    Investment Fund (GEF US$2.48 million). The Alternative Livelihood Investment Fund is
available for use by communities forgoing income from GSBAs and provenance reserves, to finance a
range of small enterprise investments and to enter into agreements with other investors to develop
plantations. It is assumed that half of the procurement activities will follow NCB guidelines and half will
be effected through the use of force account.
7.    Miscellaneous (IDA US$4.48 million/GEF US$2.78 million).  The project provides for
recruitment of limited incremental technical and managerial staff for the savanna, high forest and wildlife
implementing agencies. This includes approximately 360 FD staff transferred to SRMC when GFS is
established who will eventually be absorbed by district assemblies under the government's
decentralization program. In addition the project provides funding to cover the costs of operation and
maintenance of the works and goods supplied by the project. Incremental staff would be recruited in
open competition, or otherwise in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Civil Service
Commission. Local Shopping would be used primarily for procurement of goods and services which are
required for operation and maintenance of the project, although a limited amount would also be procured
through NCB. The project would also cover the cost of limited incremental operating costs of GFS in the
initial three years of operation (two years of NRMP I and the first year of NRMP II) -- 75% in the first
two years, reducing in the subsequent year. This support would not exceed 20% of GFS total operating
expenditure in any one year and would be linked to GFS performance in collecting forestry fees from
concessionaires, in a formula agreed at negotiations and incorporated in the PIP.
8.    IDA Review. All goods and works contracts estimated to cost US$100,000 or more will be
subject to IDA review of bidding documents including draft contracts and technical specifications prior to
inviting bids and IDA review of bid evaluation prior to contract award. The TOR for all consulting
assignments irrespective of value will be subject to IDA prior review. For consultancy contracts with



-68 -                                 Annex 6
firms an estimated value of US$100,000 or more, and US$50,000 or more in the case of individuals, the
draft Request for Proposals (RFP) and the shortlist of consultants must be cleared by IDA prior to
inviting proposals from consultants. In addition, the evaluation of technical proposals must be cleared
with IDA before financial proposals of the qualifying firms are opened. All the procedures in Appendix I
of the Consultants Guidelines would apply. With respect to each contract for the employment of
consulting firms estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or more but less than the equivalent of
US$100,000, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 1,2 (other than the second subparagraph of paragraph
2(a)) and 5 of Appendix I to the Consultant Guidelines shall apply. Contracts which are not subject to
prior review will be selectively reviewed by the Bank during project implementation and will be
governed by the procedures set forth in paragraph 4 of Appendix I to the Guidelines.
9.    Procurement Plans. At negotiations, two standard bidding documents (one for Works and the
other for Goods) were agreed. The Borrower is preparing and Global Procurement Plan (GPP), and a
Detailed Procurement Plan for the first year of the project showing processing time for each contract, and
will send these documents to IDA before Credit effectiveness. Three months prior to the start of each
subsequent fiscal year, MLF and EPA would submit up-dated versions of the GPP, and the annual DPPs
in respect of the following year.
Disbursements
10.   The proceeds of the IDA Credit and of the GEF Grant would be disbursed over a two-year and a
six-year period, respectively. A period of four months after closing date of the Biodiversity Conservation
Component would be allowed to make disbursements for expenditures incurred until the closing date of
the GEF Grant. The IDA Credit is planned as a first phase of an Adaptable Program Loan, to be followed
by two four-year phases.
11.   Statement of Expenditures.  Disbursements for all expenditures would be against full
documentation, except for items of expenditures under contracts and purchase orders below US$100,000
equivalent each, for works, goods and consulting firms, and US$50,000 for consultants services
(individuals), training and incremental costs for which disbursements would be based on statements of
expenditures (SOEs). Supporting documentation for SOEs would be retained by the Borrower for review
by IDA missions and external auditors.
12.   Special Accounts. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account for the Ministry of Lands and
Forestry would be established and operated in US$ at a commercial bank/Bank of Ghana, under terms
and conditions satisfactory to IDA. Upon credit effectiveness, a sum of US$500,000 would be deposited
by IDA into this account. Further deposits by IDA would be made into this account against withdrawal
applications supported by appropriate documentation. A second Special Account would be opened for the
MLF and operated in US$ under terms and conditions satisfactory to the GEF. Upon credit effectiveness
a sum of US$ 500,000 would be deposited by the Global Environment Trust into this account.
13.   Financial Reporting. The project accounts, SOEs and the special accounts would be audited by
the Auditor General, or any other independent auditors acceptable to the IDA. The auditors' reports and
certificates in respect each of these statements of accounts would be furnished to IDA within six months
of the close of the fiscal year. In addition, audited financial statements for the Ghana Forest Service
would be submitted within six months of the close of the financial year.

GHANA: Natural Resource Management Project I
Social Aspects of Sustainable Natural Resource Management in Ghana
The proposed interventions under NRMP to facilitate sustainable community-based natural
resource management are based on a working paper entitled "Community Participation in Natural
Resource Management in Ghana," summarized as follows:
(i)  The participatory approach for community mobilization in forestry and natural resource
conservation is now widely recognized as the only sustainable strategy. Measurable gains
have been recorded in several African countries with this approach, but only limited practical
experience is as yet available in Ghana. In this regard, the activities of the Collaborative
Forest Management Unit of the Ghana Forestry Department which has pioneered initiatives
in both the high forest and savanna zone have concentrated to date on developing the process
of collaborative management. However, the costs and benefits to all stakeholders are yet to
be tested in the field -- a proposed activity of Phase I. To promote the effective application
of this approach on a broader scale in Ghana requires, inter alia, capacity-building in many
agencies and especially for front-line field staff in the form of training in participatory
approaches to development interventions. It also requires shifting emphasis and people's
expectations from immediate rewards (e.g., food as compensation for participation) to being
focused on the long-term returns attainable from better management of resources that local
communities depend upon.
(ii) While traditional extension and outreach activities by government agencies have been in the
past characterized by fairly rigid sectoral and institutional parallelism and separation (that
between agricultural and forestry services being a prime example), the approach under Phase
Is designed to focus on rural communities' and people's needs and circumstances and to
ensure consistency and coherence of information conveyed, advice given and assistance
provided. A key objective is to ensure that resource management messages and production
messages are mutually reinforcing. Collaboration between MLF and MOFA in this regard is
a basic tenet of the program. In the savanna region, this inter-ministerial collaboration will
be extended to include the Ministry of Mines and Energy, who have responsibility for
renewable energy (woodfuel/charcoal).
(iii) Program activities are designed to move beyond the past preoccupation of natural resource
management personnel with the preservation of forest reserves and the exclusion of people
from such resources. The current objective is to incorporate other aspects important to
reducing rural poverty, while simultaneously improving the environmental resource base.
Attention will be directed to enhancing rural people's income-generating activities and food
security mechanisms that are resource-dependent as an important benefit of proper
management of natural resources. Particular stress will be placed on reaching and involving
the rural poor and those in more isolated communities.
(iv) Efforts to improve natural resource management will be targeted at many potential
participants -- individual farmers and entrepreneurs, groups, families, school children and
communities. Inter-community cooperation will receive particular emphasis to protect
developed areas and established trees from damage or destruction by livestock and bush fires.



-77-                                 Annex 11
(v) Many useful traditional management practices are being used by rural people.  The
indigenous knowledge and techniques embodied in these practices will be utilized and built
upon under the proposed program. To the extend that certain aspects of the local socio-
cultural environment may be -- or may appear to be -- inimical to effective natural resource
management, efforts will aim at facilitating adaptation and change with proper and
appropriate regard for existing social values, norms and beliefs. In this regard, information,
communication and awareness campaigns are an important element of the proposed program.
Multiple channels and media will be utilized (including radio, posters, personal contacts,
music or drama), with messages from one source reinforcing those from others.
(vi) Gender differences are significant determinants of rural people's involvement in managing
natural resources in rural environments, and program activities will be based on gender-
sensitive management strategies to ensure the maximum involvement and benefit for both
men and women. In the case of women, group mobilization and activities will receive special
attention, as this has proven to be effective in reaching women and in facilitating their access
to resources and opportunities which would be unavailable to them as individuals.
Monitoring mechanisms will be designed and put in place to track the degree of integration
of women into local management strategies, the effectiveness of program activities in serving
their needs and interests, and the short- and long-term impact of program activities.
(vii) Special efforts will be made early in the program to facilitate and foster effective
coordination among the various governmental and non-governmental development agencies
working to ensure the sustainable management of the environment in rural Ghana. Given the
vast geographical area and dispersed population of northern Ghana in particular, needs far
exceed the combined capacity of all these agencies, and this underscores the importance of
coordination and collaboration so as to minimize confusion, duplication of efforts, and waste
of scarce implementation capacity.

THE VICE PRESIDENT, AFRICA REGION
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION & DEVELOPMENT
1818 H STREET
WASHINGTON, D. C., USA
Dear Mr. Vice President,
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME:
STATEMENT OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
Under the long-term policy framework of GHANA-VISION 2020, the Government of
Ghana has initiated action to implement the Forestry Development Master Plan (1996-
2020) which is aimed at achieving sustainable development of forest and wildlife
resources, modernization of the timber industry, and conservation of the environment and
biodiversity. This statement outlines the objectives of the Master Plan and the related
strategies and reforms to be pursued.
In reviewing the broad spectrum of the natural resources sector, it should be noted that
the forestry has been, and continues to be, vital to the national economy through its
contribution to export earnings, employment generation and supply of timber for export
and local markets. Historically, forestry and the timber industry has accounted for 5-6% of
total Gross Domestic Product and were ranked as the third most important export
commodity in Ghana. It is now the fourth largest foreign exchange earner (10.4%) after
minerals (36%), cocoa (35%) and tourism (12%). The timnber industry provides direct
employment for about 100,000 people (in logging firms, processing mills and public
institutions) and several thousands of self-employed artisans engaged in the manufacture
of furniture, doors and other constructions for the housing industry. Thus, more than 2.5
million rural Ghanaian families derive a livelihood from forestry. In addition, wood is by
far the most important source of energy for domestic and industrial use, as about 14
million m3 of fuelwood, valued at US $200 million, is consumed annually as energy, i.e.
more than 75% of total energy consumption in the country. The local economy of the
savanna regions, largely depends on the production and trading of fuelwood and charcoal,
as well as primary agriculture and mining products, with agriculture accounting for about
46% of the GDP and employing over 70% of the active labour force. Non-wood forest
products - including bush meat, construction, fencing and roofing materials, medicinal
plants and edible plants - are of vital importance for the vast majority of rural people. The
country's forest and woodlands provide critically important environmental services, such



-79 -                               Annex 12
as water storage, soil protection, protection of headwaters and watercourses, micro-
climate regulation, habitat for endemic fauna and flora.
The forestry sector had been plagued with certain constraints which limited realization of
its potential and threatened its sustainable use over time. Timber royalties had been low
and did not reflect the real economic value of trees; the forest and wildlife administrations
had been weak, with overlapping institutional responsibilities; there had been insufficient
involvement of communities in the management of the resources, coupled with negligible
economic returns to the land and resource owners; the logging and milling industries had
been relatively inefficient in their use of the dwindling but cheap natural resources; and
there has been a lack of inter-agency coordination in planning and monitoring of natural
resource use, with its consequent threat to environmental stability. Similarly, in the
savanna zone, unregulated exploitation of natural resources to satisfy socio-economic
needs had resulted in deforestation, destruction of wildlife habitat, loss of biodiversity, and
severe resource depletion.
During the past decade, the Government implemented a donor-assisted Forest Resource
Management Project (FR1MvP) so as to reverse the decline experienced during the 1970s
and the early 1980s,. The FRMP was aimed at sharpening policy programmes in the
forestry sector through: (i) managing industrial forestry production and export earnings in
accordance with a sustained yield policy; (ii) promoting conservation and tree planting on
farms to counteract fuelwood shortage and ecological deterioration; and (iii) strengthening
the structural base of the sector and its institutions to enable them carry out the necessary
reforms, increase revenue generation, improve protection and management of the forest
and wildlife resources and lay foundations for developing a methodology to quantify
environmental and ecological benefits. At the same time, the Government formulated and
adopted a National Environmental Action Plan in 1993 and designed the Ghana
Environmental Resource Management Project (GERMP) to support the implementation
the objectives of the plan. The GERNP has attempted to develop environmental resource
management systems, ensure land and water management and establish sustainable
management of the coastal wetlands. The project has also strengthened the capacity of
sectoral agencies for improved environmental management to conserve biodiversity and
reverse environmental degradation.
The successful implementation of the FRMP has resulted in the introduction of sustained
yield forest management and an improvement in forest management procedures;
introduction of agro-forestry programmes; policy reforms and enactment of new
legislation critical to achieving high standards of technical and economic efficiency of
forest and logging; institution of higher forms of forest fees, institutional strengthening and
private sector-oriented reforms to encourage value-added exports. The timber industry has
rebounded and production has began to be rationalized along the lines of value-added
processing.
During the implementation of the FRMIP, the government promulgated a Forest and
Wildlife Policy and formulated a master plan to implement the policy. The stated aim of
2



-80 -                               Annex 12
the policy is "conservation and sustainable development of the nation's forest and wildlife
resources for maintenance of environmental quality and perpetual flow of optimum
benefits to all segments of society" and has the following objectives:
1. management and enhancement of Ghana's permanent estate of forest and
wildlife resources for preservation of vital soil and water resources,
conservation of biological diversity and the environment and sustainable
production of domestic and commercial produce;
2. promotion of viable and efficient forest-based industries, particularly in
secondary and tertiary processing, so as to fully utilize timber and other
products from forests and wildlife resources and satisfy domestic and
international demand for competitively-priced products;
3. promotion of public awareness and involvement of rural p.eople in forestry and
wildlife conservation so as to maintain life-sustaining systems, preserve scenic
areas and enhance the potential of recreation, tourism and income-generating
opportunities;
4. promotion of research-based and technology-led forestry and wildlife
management, utilization and development to ensure resource sustainability,
socio-economic growth and environmental stability;
5. development of effective capacity and capability at national, regional and
district levels for sustainable management of forest and wildlife resources.
The Forestry Development Master Plan has the identical objectives and has attracted the
interest of the donor community. It has thus provided the Ministry of Land and Forestry
with the opportunity to develop country-led initiatives towards this goal. The key
objectives of the Government's natural resource policy therefore is to: ensure a sustained
and adequate supply of forest and woodland products and of environmental service
provided by the forest and woodland; strengthen the biological conservation and
management capacity of the FD; establish selected reserves as Special Biological
Protection Area that will be taken out of production; safeguard genetic diversity; prevent
further environment degradation due to forest degradation/depletion and inappropriate
logging and farming practices; and, stimulate community involvement in resource
management and enhanced economic well-being of rural residents. Specific policy and
reformns are being directed at three areas: forest revenue policy and timber rights allocation
procedures; restructuring of sector institutions responsible for forest and savanna
woodland and wildlife resource management; and environmental management
coordination. In pursuant of these objectives, the Government intends to carry out the
following specific policy and institutional reforms:
* forest revenues are to be increased to reflect the stumpage value of trees, by
imposing rates ranging from 7 - 20% of FOB timber prices, depending on the
3



- 81-                               Annex 12
demand and inventory levels of the species. The FOB timber prices would be
reviewed every six months according to market trends. Furthermore, the
Forestry Department (and successor Forest Service) is to pursue the collection
of all outstanding forest fees;
* implement the provisions of the Timber Resources Management Act, 1998
(Act 547) and its regulations to eliminate the inadequacies of the previous
concession allocation procedure, introduce the requirement to fulfill social
responsibilities and implement a commensurate reforestation/afforestation plan
in timber utilization contracts and promote the active involvement of local
people in resource management;
*  transform the Forestry Department into a semi-autonomous Forestry Service
and implement staff redundancy programme; merge the Timber Export
Development Board and Forest Products Inspection -Bureau into Timber
Industry Development Board; restructure the Wildlife, Department into a more
effective resource management agency in touch with related communities;
establish a Savanna Resource Management Centre to facilitate capacity
building in the District Assemblies of the northern regions; and, support the
institutional strategy of the EPA;
* finalize and implement a National Biodiversity Strategy which seeks to
safeguard genetic diversity of indigenous species, as well as a national forest
protection strategy through an ecosystem approach to management of forest
reserves. This will entail strengthening of the Forest Service's capacity for
biological conservation and management, protection of priority conservation
areas within existing production forest reserves and establishment of selected
areas as special biological protection areas that will be taken out of production.
The Government therefore intends to demarcate and declare 117,322 ha of
Forest Reserves as Globally Significant Biodiversity Areas (GSBA), as listed in
the attachment to this letter. These areas have been excluded from logging and
will be so protected hereafter;
* initiate and complete a carry out a study on the effects of the log export ban
and its ramifications or the sustainability of planned forest management systems
and restructuring of the wood processing industry;
* introduce a forest management certification system, including computerized
log-tracking to eliminate illegal logging activities, monitor the chain of custody
of timber products and secure the sustainability of the forestry sector.
The legislative actions that would complement the policy programme to be pursued
include: (i) rationalization of stumpage fees and timber utilization contracts rents; (ii)
implementation of comprehensive Timber Resources Management Regulations to give
effect to the Act; (iii) implementation of a Forest Service Act to transform the Forestry
4



-82 -                              Annex 12
Department into an autonomous Forest Service; (iv) updating and amending existing
forest laws, including provision to protect GSBAs; (iv) passage and implementation of a
Timber Industry Development Board Act; (v) enactment and implementation of revised
wildlife regulations.
It is the Government's firm resolve to institute without delay, this package of policy
reforms, so that it may start to have an immediate bearing on performance and
productivity of Ghana's forestry and wildlife sector and on the quality of environmental
management. It is also hoped that the policy reform programme will lay the foundation
and pave the way for an economically efficient and financially stable natural resource
management sector.
