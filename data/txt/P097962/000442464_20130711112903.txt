1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1   Context at Appraisal

Country context

1.1.1 At appraisal, South Sudan had not yet become an independent country1, but was part of
Sudan and in the process of emerging from over two decades of civil war.2 The Government of
South Sudan (GoSS), created with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA)
as Government of National Unity in 2005, inherited none of the institutions associated with an
independent state, and thus was faced with the challenge of construction and state building
rather than post-conflict re-construction alone. The prolonged conflict affected every aspect of
South Sudanese life, led to wide spread emigration of skilled people internal displacement of
the population, isolation and absence of basic social services.

1.1.2 South Sudan was amongst the poorest regions in the world, with 90 percent of the
population earning less than US$1 per day and its human development indicators were among
the lowest in the world. Only 27 percent of the population over 15 years was able to read and
write. Infrastructure was non-existent in rural areas, e.g. there were no paved roads outside the
three major towns of Juba, Malakal and Wau. Only 15 percent of households owned a phone
and mobile penetration of households was only 2 percent in 2006. South Sudan had an
estimated population of 8.3 million, of which about 83 percent was residing in rural areas. The
very low population density and lack of infrastructure made basic service delivery extremely
challenging and costly. The long conflict also prevented the emergence of a class of
entrepreneurs. Few businesses owned by South Sudanese exist even several years after the end
of the war. This meant that almost all goods had to be imported from neighboring countries,
increasing cost and making easy access to inputs difficult. Security concerns and outbreaks of
violence in parts of the country, e.g. conflicts over land and cattle, also created a challenge.

1.1.3 At the time of project identification and appraisal, no formal ministry of education was
in place, neither physically or in terms of personnel. The country’s public financial
management and procurement systems likewise urgently needed to be built from the ground
up. Commercial banks did not yet exist in the country, making disbursements from donor funds
a challenge. Before the CPA, NGOs and UN agencies largely provided basic services. The
CPA created high expectations among the population for quick peace dividends. Adding to this
pressure were the millions of IDPs returning to the South. Moreover, there was the strong
desire on the part of the new government to assume its responsibility for delivering public
services and substantial pressure to shift them away from donors and NGOs. The context of the
World Bank’s engagement in South Sudan was unique, even among fragile states, firstly
because there are very few experiences with state building in “new? countries3; and secondly,
even among new nations, South Sudan is unique in that it did not have any previous
government systems and structures.
                                                                  
1
    The Republic of South Sudan became a new country on July 9, 2011, following a referendum on self-
determination in January 2011, and effectively became the World’s newest country.  
2
    South Sudan was at the center of two long-lasting civil wars (the first, from 1955-1972 and the second, from
1983-2005). 
3
   The only recent examples that come to mind are East Timor and Kosovo.  

                                                                     1 
       
          

Sector context

1.1.4 South Sudan’s education indicators were among the lowest in the world. An estimated
85 percent of the population was illiterate and the country had the highest rate of out-of-school
children in Sub-Saharan Africa, about 1.4 million. The gross enrolment rate at the primary
level was only 20 percent. Gender inequalities were marked, with only one in four students
female. The illiteracy rate was 92 percent for women and 80 percent for men. Geographical
location was another factor contributing to disparities in enrolment. In 2003, more than 80
percent of total primary enrolment was concentrated in three states; the other seven states had
rates of less than 40 percent. School facilities were almost non-existent; 38 percent of classes
were held outdoors; and basic pedagogical materials such as textbooks and black boards were
lacking. The majority of teachers had no formal teaching qualifications, and many had never
completed primary education, much less secondary education. Opportunities for non-formal
education were limited. While the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army (SPLA) and NGOs
provided some education services during the decades of war, there was not much of a structure
or system to build on after the CPA. The Ministry of Education was about to be established as
were other GoSS ministries; there was no fully fledged civil service system, and no national
curriculum upon which instruction could be based. The language of instruction, duration of
primary and secondary schooling and curricula varied widely by region, e.g. depending on the
region, school used the Sudan curriculum or curricula from neighboring countries such as
Kenya and Uganda.4

1.1.5 In 2007, South Sudan replaced Arabic with English as the official language of
instruction. The local language would be the primary language of instruction for grades 1-3.
English would be introduced as a subject in the first grade and adopted as the primary language
of instruction in the later grades of primary school. Though this relatively sudden switch from
largely Arabic instruction to English promoted national unity, its implementation created
immediate practical challenges for the education system, since a considerable share of teachers
spoke no or little English.

Project context

1.1.6 A Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) was undertaken in 2005 by the World Bank, the
United Nations, the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army (SPLA) and the Government of Sudan
(GoS). The JAM provided the technical analysis and framework for project identification,
estimated financing needs and laid out the key sector issues, which the Multi-Donor Education
Rehabilitation Project (ERP) was designed to address in a comprehensive manner. The project
included activities formulated to support the GoSS in achieving the goals set in its national
Education Sector Plan (ESP) 2005-2011: (i) access to and quality of education; (ii) curriculum
and learning materials; (iii) teacher education and training; (iv) alternative learning
opportunities; (v) capacity building; and (vi) co-ordination, monitoring and evaluation. Thus,
the project formed part of a larger, national program in the education sector, funded by donors
as well as the government.

1.1.7 Beyond the sector, the project was designed within the collaborative framework of the
Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF-SS), set up by several key development partners to support

administered by the World Bank (see annex 10 for more information on the MDTF).

1.1.8 The overarching goal of external assistance to South Sudan was to build state capacity.
Specifically, it was to support an emerging government in creating and promoting national
unity; and promoting the legitimacy and visibility of a new government through tangible
benefits to communities in all states, even if only symbolically. These primary objectives,
though not explicitly stated in the project documents, pervaded all aspects of preparation and
implementation, not only for the ERP, but also the other MDTF projects. The ERP, together
with the Health and the Rapid Impact Emergency projects constituted the earliest phase of
human development assistance under the MDTF, followed by the subsequent phases of
reconstruction and development.

1.2   Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 The US$25.5 million Emergency Recovery Grant for the Multi-Donor Education
Rehabilitation Project (ERP) was approved on March 30, 2006 and became effective on July
27, 2007. The project was designed as part of a national education sector program, as indicated
in the Project Proposal. The (PDO) as stated in the Project Proposal Document (PPD) is as
follows:

    “Primary school students, returning population, demobilized soldiers, and other non-
    traditional learners have improved access to enhanced quality of education; alternate
    learning opportunities, development of life skills and basic occupational skill training.?

1.2.2 The PDO is broken down into two parts to facilitate assessment of PDO achievement:
(i) improved access to enhanced quality of education for primary school students; and (ii)
improved access to alternate learning opportunities, development of life skills and basic
occupational skill training for returning population, demobilized soldiers, and other non-
traditional learners.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification:

1.3.1 The Project Development Objective (PDO) remained the same throughout the life of the
project. The results framework was refined during implementation with the June 2011
restructuring6 to include new available data and core sector indicators and to adapt to the
realities on the ground. Most of the original PDO indicators were retained or were shifted to
the intermediate indicator level. Out of the original PDO indicators, two indicators were
maintained at PDO level,7 three were monitored at the intermediate level; and another three
were dropped. In addition, two new indicators were added at PDO level. The revised PDO
indicators and intermediate indicators were better able to capture the progress of the project’s
development objectives. For assessment purposes, the PDO indicators and intermediate
indicators updated in the June 2011 restructuring will be used in the ICR. The funds disbursed
for the various project activities are consistent with the revised PDO indicators as outlined in
Table 2.8

1.4   Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The PDO clearly identified the main target groups of the project interventions. The direct
project beneficiaries were: (i) primary school children; (ii) youth and adults such as
demobilized soldiers, IDP’s, overage learners, other non-formal learners; (iii) existing and new
teachers; (iv) Ministry of Education officials at the national, state and local levels.

1.5   Original Components

1.5.1 The project supported part of a larger national program, the education sector plan. It
originally had five components and was to be implemented in two phases. Components 1-4
focused on basic education and comprised the first phase of ERP to be implemented within the
first three years (2006-2008). Component 5 consisted of planning for the second phase of the
project, post-basic education, from 2009 onwards. The total cost of the government’s education
sector program for three years was estimated at US$152.7 million; US$51 million to be
financed by the MDTF and the remaining US$102.7 million by the GoSS, as per Project
Proposal. However, MDTF financing was in tranches, therefore the Grant Agreement only
refers to the first year tranche of the project. The total project cost for year 1 (2006) was
estimated at US$23.4 million, of which US$15.4 million was to be co-financed by the
government and the remainder by a first tranche of MDTF funding of US$7.7 million. The first
amendment of the Grant Agreement dated November 2007 provides additional MDTF
financing in the amount of US$17.8 million, and thus changed the amount of total MDTF
financing for the project to US$25.5 million (see table below).

1.5.2 The original project components are as follows:

      Component 1: Enhance and Expand the Management and Delivery of Education Services
at the County Level (US$18 million). The objective of this component was to provide a model
for a decentralized training program based on the development of multi-purpose County
Education Centers (CECs), which could also serve as training centers for teachers. The
activities consisted of the construction of 20 CECs; provision of in-service and pre-service
training to administrative, managerial and pedagogical education staff; use of a ‘fast track’
teacher training approach as a first step in developing a more comprehensive in-service teacher
training program to upgrade teacher qualifications; launch of accelerated/alternative learning
programs at the county level; and capacity strengthening of county level education
administration.

      Component 2: Responsive Resources for the Provision of Alternative Education and/or
Skill Development for Non-Formal Learners (US$12 million). The purpose of this component



                                                  5
       
       

was to enable demobilized soldiers, IDPs, overage learners, females and other non-formal
learners’ access to second chance education opportunities through the Alternative Education
System (AES). The activities consisted of the completion/review of the Accelerated Learning
Program (ALP) curriculum and materials for Christian Religious Education (CRE), Arts, and
Agriculture; a rapid needs assessment for skills training; the delivery of training with additional
printing of textbooks and materials; development of a draft strategy for AES; assessment and
identification of areas of short-term occupational skills training for demobilized soldiers and
IDPs; development of criteria for selecting trainees/learners of skills training programs; and
development of an evaluation system.

       Component 3: Ministry of Education, Science and Technology: Institutional Capacity
Development (US$9 million). This component consisted of a phased and integrated program of
institutional capacity development inputs to address the full continuum of MoEST9
responsibilities.10 The key activities consisted of leadership training for education management
personnel at all levels; development and roll-out of the Education Management Tool Kit
(EMTK) to county-level education managers; establishment of two key institutions, the
Curriculum Development Center (CDC) and the Examinations and Learning Assessment
Center; development of curriculum and learning assessment tools for primary and secondary
levels; printing and distribution of textbooks in core subjects; and development of teacher
guides and curricula.

      Component 4: Rehabilitation and Construction of School Level Infrastructure (US$6.5
million). The purpose of this component was to commence with a rapid assessment of
rehabilitation as well as detailed planning of new construction needs, followed by a program to
undertake civil works activities.

      Component 5: Phase 2 Planning and Project Preparation (US$1.5 million). This
component would finance the establishment of a forum composed of the MoEST and
development partners to determine priorities and programs to receive support under Phase 2, as
well as undertake analysis to fully prepare Phase 2 (post-basic education) program proposal.

1.5.3 The remaining US$4 million was to be allocated to program management, monitoring
and evaluation.

1.6   Revised Project Components

1.6.1 During implementation the project activities were appropriately adjusted to effectively
adapt to conditions on the ground and to reflect shifting government priorities. A formal
restructuring11 of components and sub-components did not take place. Once more data and
information became available on the status of the education system, unit costs and capacity
limitations at the national and state level, it was decided to focus on basic education and not to
proceed with phase 2 of the project focused on post-basic education, given the delays with the
launch of phase 1, limited institutional capacity and priorities. As a result, component 5 (i.e.

 Phase 2) was canceled,12 which contributed towards simplifying the project design more
 suitable to the country environment. The original PDO, centered on basic education, was
 maintained, because it remained achievable and was not impacted by the above adjustments.
 After the June 2011 restructuring of the project activities, the project components included the
 following:

       Component 1: Enhance and expand the management and delivery of education services
 at the county level (US$4.4 million): Intensive English language training for teachers and
 education staff; pre-service teacher training; fast track (3 week) pre-service pilot training for
 new teachers; and in-service training of teachers; and construction of 14 CECs.

      Component 2: Provision of alternate education and/or skill development for non-formal
 learners (US$2.9 million). Key activities included: AES instructor training; training of local
 education authorities; financing of AES courses for learners; piloting the pastoralist education
 program (PEP) for youth and adults.

      Component 3: Institutional Capacity Development (US$ 1.9 million. This component
 consisted of technical assistance, training and support to education managers; improvement in
 working conditions of education managers (such as rehabilitation of staff houses at the Maridi
 Curriculum Center); and acquisition of a printing press to conduct the national end of primary
 exams.

      Component 4: Construction and Rehabilitation of Schools (US$ 14.2 million). This
 component financed the rehabilitation and construction of primary schools, including student
 desks and benches.

 1.6.2 The remaining amount of the grant, US$2.1 million, was allocated to project
 management.

 1.7   Other Significant Changes

 1.7.1 At project closing all activities were completed, made possible by several project
 extensions. The original project closing date of September 30, 2009 was extended four times:
 (i) from September 2009 to March 31, 2011; (ii) from March 31, 2011 to June 30, 2011; (iii)
 from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012 (which also included the revision of the results
 framework); and (iv) from June 30, 2012 to December 30, 2012. A last restructuring was done
 on December 11, 2012 to increase the percentage of expenditures financed by the MDTF from
 56 percent to 100 percent to allow for full disbursement of the grant.

 2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

 2.1 Program Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

 2.1.1 Project preparation was a major challenge. The project had to be prepared within the
 context of a country emerging from civil war, conducted under very difficult institutional,
 technical as well as physical conditions and within a very short preparation time frame. As with



                                                           8
        
       

most projects prepared under emergency guidelines, this meant that part of the preparation and
implementation readiness was pushed to the first phase of implementation. Moreover, there
was an almost complete lack of background information (such as e.g. past project evaluations
and reports, studies, reliable cost estimates) and data on the education system. The government
had no past experience implementing similar projects and the organizational structure of the
ministry had yet to be formalized and key staff to be appointed. The ministry essentially
consisted of a handful of South Sudanese senior education planners, still based in the garrison
town of Rumbek (and not yet in Juba, where the center of government was established) at the
time of identification.13 In addition, overall lack of communications, transportation and other
infrastructure added to the difficulties of preparation, e.g. the World Bank office was initially
housed in a tent (and later in a container).

2.1.2 Engagement of emerging government and other stakeholders during preparation. In
spite of these severe difficulties, the Bank team managed to engage and work with the
incoming government in the preparation of the project. However, given that there were only
rudimentary government institutions in place and no clear accountability structures in the
ministry at appraisal, government ownership could not be promoted as much as would have
been desirable. When the ministry and its key personnel were fully established in October
2006, their buy-in into the project first had to be developed and a new consensus reached on
various key issues. This caused problems at the early stages of implementation and led to some
changes in activities and their scale; and in implementation approaches. e.g. instead of using
NGOs, the ministry insisted on implementing most of the activities directly themselves,
regardless of capacity constraints at national and regional levels, e.g. for the in-service teacher
training program. The primary reason for the ministry taking hands-on approach was the need
to show government presence on the ground, build a public education system and take
responsibility for service delivery; and the high costs of using NGOs. Further evidence of the
collaborative nature of the preparation is the week-long stakeholder preparation workshop that
took place in Juba in December 2005, which brought together representatives from the
government, teachers, NGOs, and bilateral and multilateral donors.

2.1.3 Striking a balance between enormous post-conflict needs and expectations and very
limited capacity. The project design was in line with government priorities and
comprehensively addressed the country’s many critical needs and sector issues for building an
education system from scratch. This meant that the design was ambitious, especially given the
relatively short implementation time frame. The difficulty for the Bank team consisted of
reconciling needs, ambitions and the realities of the political economy with the human,
institutional and physical constraints. The project activities were to be implemented in all 10
states due to the need to promote national unity in a very fragile context and show tangible
benefits quickly across the country. However, this geographic spread, though politically
necessary, complicated project implementation and supervision and taxed the limited
implementation capacity of the government.

2.1.3 Few experiences from emerging new countries/state building available to inform
project design and approach. Though lessons from Bank experience in supporting education
reconstruction in other post-conflict countries informed the project design, few lessons from
                                                                  
13
  Though the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology was formally established with the MoF on Oct 23,
2005, this was largely only on paper at the time.



                                                                     9
       
       

projects in newly emerging countries with minimal institutional and human resource capacities
were available. The only cases were East Timor and Kosovo, but both of these had some
existing institutions and structures, unlike South Sudan.

2.2   Implementation

2.2.1 Implementation Arrangements. The Education Rehabilitation Project (ERP) became
effective on July 27, 2006; and closed on December 31, 2012. Thus, implementation took place
over 5.5 years, which is a more appropriate implementation time frame for such a
comprehensive project than the originally proposed three years. The implementation
arrangements consisted of a small coordination unit inside the ministry (Development Project
Implementation Support Team, DPIST), responsible for day-to-day coordination. The team
was to be staffed by personnel with relevant specializations such as procurement, financial
management, monitoring and evaluation etc. The DPIST would provide support to the MoGEI
(formerly MoEST14) in coordination, monitoring, financial reporting, communication and
procurement. The specific technical departments within the MoGEI were responsible for
implementing each of the different activities/components of the ERP, supported by an inter-
departmental Component Working Group (CWG), led by the head of the department
overseeing the component implementation. The working group would draw upon the technical
expertise of state ministries, the county level and NGOs. An inter-ministerial Project Steering
Committee (PSC), led by the Minister of Education and including representatives of the state
education ministries, key directors of the MoGEI and representatives of the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) was to provide policy guidance, was established in 2007, though it did not
assume its role as planned and remained largely nonfunctional. Streamlining implementation
directly into the respective line ministries instead of using Project Implementation Units (PIU)
was the explicit request of the GoSS across all MDTF projects and was non-negotiable. This
ministry-led implementation contributed to increasing ministry ownership and capacity over
time, though it also led to substantial implementation delays.

2.2.2 Overall factors across MDTF projects affecting implementation. Implementation was
severely hampered by security concerns, inaccessibility of sites, weak banking system (the
designated account was in Kenya, leading to disbursement delays), poor communications
infrastructure and low technical and fiduciary capacity. Given its short existence, the GoSS
was still in the process of building its own institutions at central and local levels. This meant
that personnel, clear roles and responsibilities, policies, procedures, equipment, operational
budgets and information and management systems were not yet in place or not adequately
developed. The periodical fiscal shocks, hiring freezes and shortage of operational funds also
contributed to draining the government’s technical and implementation capacity. The economic
crisis of 2009 led to a freeze in the recruitment of civil servants. This led to delays in staff
appointments, thus slowing down staff capacity building activities, which in turn slowed down
implementation progress.

2.2.3 Project-specific factors leading to implementation delays: no-full time project staff,
frequent changes in key ministry staff and leadership. Frequent changes in ministry
leadership also negatively affected project implementation, resulting in changes in priorities

                                                                  
14
  The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology is now the Ministry of General Education and Instruction
and the Ministry of Higher Education. Henceforth, we will use the current name MoGEI.


                                                                     10
       
        

and personnel. During the course of the project, there were three ministers, four
undersecretaries and three changes in ERP project coordinators.15 The frequent turnover in the
leadership and the lack of a full-time project coordinator and staff in the early stages of
implementation further complicated implementation.

Implementation progress and issues related to specific components/activities:

2.2.4 Disbursements: The initial phase of the ERP implementation was focused on launching
and completing the procurement processes to start the activities. Not surprisingly for an
emergency project, initial disbursement was low. As of mid-2008, only US$ 3.38 million of the
total 25.5 million had been disbursed. The low disbursement rate was tied to the low progress
in achieving the indicators. Following the mid-term review in 2008, disbursements rose to
US$8.83 million or 35 percent of the total by end 2009. After mid-2010 disbursements, and
subsequently implementation, increased at a rapid pace. By the end of 2010, half of the project
funds had been disbursed. By the end of 2011, US$24.47 million or 96 percent of funds had
been disbursed. As of closing in December 2012, all funds had been disbursed. This shows that
though there were considerable delays, the project managed a turn-around in 2009-2010 once
critical issues were resolved.

2.2.5 Rapid Results Initiative (RRI) contributed to accelerating implementation: The Bank
provided Rapid Results coaches in 2009 to work with the ministry teams implementing the four
components to develop and implement action plans to achieve clearly specified process-
oriented results. Based on feedback from ministry staff, this initiative succeeded in clarifying
each team member’s roles and responsibilities in the implementation process, and creating a
system of accountability for results, and advancing implementation progress.16

2.2.6 Issues related to civil works (school construction and county education centers): The
construction component encountered substantial delays due to insufficient procurement
capacity, lack of experienced contractors and suppliers, and the long selection process of
school sites. For political reasons, the government insisted on building schools in each of the
10 states rather than concentrate on states with the lowest enrolment rates. This dispersion of
sites amplified the above implementation difficulties. Furthermore, initial cost projections were
underestimated due to lack of cost data for South Sudan at preparation. These factors led to the
scaling down of the component from the initially planned 100 schools to a more manageable
52 schools. The conditions of the road/transportation network and insecurity in several regions
contributed to further construction delays and constituted a challenge for Bank supervision, as
staff could not inspect all sites. However, despite these challenges, all construction activities
were completed at project closing.

2.2.7 Issues related to teacher training: The in-service training program was implemented
directly by the ministry through the CECs. About 1,649 primary school teachers were trained
through the program. However, the training program encountered some problems, such as
difficult access to training sites, transportation of trainees and project staff, inadequacies in the
accommodations of many of the CECs, identification of candidates for the program, and the

                                                                   
15
    But there were only three different coordinators in total, as one of the coordinators was later re-instated.  
16
    In spite of its usefulness, the ministry requested to end the Rapid Results Initiative because of the high
consultant rates. 


                                                                      11
        
       

high proportion of Arabic, non-English speaking teachers in some states. Most importantly, the
in-service training program encountered considerable fiduciary issues, notably inadequate
financial management and accounting for operational funds. Though the ministry addressed
and resolved these fiduciary issues, the remainder of the in-service teacher training program
was suspended after the completion of only the first of the 11-term program.

2.3   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 M&E Design: The PDO outcome and intermediate indicators are in line with the PDO. A
more simplified results framework would have facilitated tracking of project performance and
implementation progress. The initial establishment of PDO indicators and intermediate
indicators, and realistic target values was difficult, given the lack of baseline data. The results
framework was therefore adjusted as data became available with the progressive set up of the
Education Management Information System (EMIS) and the administration of additional
surveys as part of the sector diagnostic. Furthermore, there were several consistency issues
with PDO indicators in the early project stage across project documents, which were resolved
with the updating of the results framework as part of the June 2011 restructuring (though this
updating of the results framework could have taken place earlier in the implementation phase).

2.3.2 M&E Arrangements, implementation and utilization: Especially in the early stages of
implementation, the M&E system was not very functional. Baseline data collection and M&E
was to be undertaken at the state and county level with support from NGOs, but this did not
occur as planned. A MDTF-wide M&E workshop was conducted at the start of the MDTF,
attended by government and Bank staff. Even though it was well received, the conclusions
were not adopted by the projects. The PPD envisioned that the Development Project
Implementation Support Team (DPIST) would establish simple and measureable monitoring
indicators on process, output, and outcomes, whereas the DPIST Planning, Monitoring and
Evaluation M&E Specialist would identify data sources and be responsible for data collection
and reporting by the Component Working Group (CWGs). However, an M&E specialist was
not part of the project implementation team. Many of the other MDTF projects encountered
similar M&E challenges, i.e. lack of a dedicated M&E specialist, lack of documentation/filing
system baseline data and M&E tools for data collection. The MA conducted field visits and
submitted quarterly monitoring reports, which detailed the implementation progress, but the
primary focus of the reports was fiduciary. The June 2011 restructuring solidified and
simplified the results framework of the ERP and the reporting and data collection significantly
improved. Once data collected through EMIS became available, the data was used for the
development of the next education sector plan. A comprehensive evaluation of the Alternative
Education System took place in 2012, which was used as a basis for a large scale student
learning assessment currently in progress. This ongoing learning assessment will inform further
quality improvements of the AES.

Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

2.3.3 Safeguards: The preparation phase identified two potential safeguard issues: (i)
environmental (OP4.01) and (ii) involuntary re-settlement related to land acquisition for civil
works (OP4.12). The potential environmental risks were related to construction and
rehabilitation of schools, training centers, and administrative offices, more specifically, the
need for safe water supply and adequate sanitation and waste disposal arrangements. The


                                                   12
       
      

World Bank and the Ministry of Environment had prepared an Environmental and Social
Assessment Framework (ESAF) for the entire MDTF-SS portfolio. Using this framework as a
base, the development of an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was required. The frameworks were to be prepared,
approved and disclosed by GoSS and the MDTF administrator within six months of project
effectiveness. However, the ERP decided to adopt the overall ESSAF prepared by the Bank
and the GoSS to monitor the social and environmental impact of project activities. The
Ministry of Environment, Wildlife Conservation and Tourism agreed to coordinate a MDTF
Safeguards Management Committee, comprised of safeguards officers appointed by each
Ministry benefiting from MDTF. This was done to facilitate training, capacity building and
effective implementation of safeguards requirements for all MDTF projects. While some issues
arose during implementation, overall compliance with safeguards policies was rated as
moderately satisfactory throughout the project.

Financial Management and Flow of Funds

2.3.4 Fiduciary Compliance: The 2005 Joint Assessment Mission (JAM) carried out an
analysis of the financial management system with the conclusion that the entire fiduciary
system needed to be built from scratch. Accordingly, the overall fiduciary risk rating was high,
given low institutional fiduciary capacity and the probability of financial mismanagement. To
minimize the risk, a fiduciary framework was put in place which included (i) a Monitoring
Agent (MA) to ensure that funds were being used for the purposes intended, fiduciary
standards were being complied with; and (ii) an External Audit Agent (EAA) to provide an
independent opinion on the systems and internal control mechanisms used to control the flow
of funds. The Project Accounting Agent (PAA) would handle the financial management (FM)
for the government. The PAA would prepare a FM manual which would cover accounting
policies and procedures, banking arrangements, flow of funds arrangements, budgeting
arrangements and procedures related to the transaction cycle. A Project Financial Management
Unit (PFMU) was established in the MoF that was responsible for the overall FM for all MDTF
projects.

2.3.5 At the early stages of the project, several cases of unaccounted advances and ineligible
expenditures occurred. Several other internal control issues such as alterations, non-
acknowledgement of payments by payees etc. were identified. The majority of these issues, in
particular the ineligible expenditures, was caused by an inadequate understanding of Bank
procedures and later resolved, thanks to significantly improved coordination between the
MoGEI and the PFMU. The issue of ineligible expenditures occurred mainly in the teacher
training sub-component, directly implemented by the ministry. The MoF did not want to
provide funding to the states to pay teacher salaries because of improper accounting; therefore
the MoGEI used the MDTF funds to find another way of paying teachers, e.g. paying for hotel
expenses, which were ineligible expenditures. In addition, central ministry leadership training
was conducted at Juba University, which occurred without knowledge or non-objection from
the Bank. Finally, payment was advanced to construction contractors who then disappeared
without returning the advance or starting construction. In this case, the Bank suggested that the
government use interest from the counterpart contribution to reimburse the project, especially
in light of budgetary constraints in the government. The Bank team worked closely with the
government in ensuring that all ineligible expenditures were reimbursed and accounting for
outstanding advances was completed. Despite the aforementioned issues, an adequate FM


                                                  13
      
       

system was in place by the end of the project. Given the proactivity of the government and the
Bank in addressing and resolving the issues and the visible improvement in fiduciary capacity,
overall financial management is rated as moderately satisfactory.

2.3.6 Procurement: At the time of appraisal, in early 2006, the public procurement system in
South Sudan was non-existent. There were no national procurement procedures, institutional
framework or capacity for procurement. Other procurement constraints included lack of limited
media for procurement notices and low capacity of local private sector. Initially, procurement
was to be centrally processed in two phases. In the first phase, the GoSS would prepare and
publish an interim public procurement procedure and establish a procurement policy unit in the
Ministry of Finance to oversee tasks. The second phase would consist of decentralization of the
systems designed in the first phase; and the enactment of a public procurement law. The
Interim Public Procurement and Disposal Regulation (IPPDR) was issued by the MoFEP in
June 2006 to guide public procurement in the country. Further, based on the recommendations
of the JAM, a Procurement Agent (PA) was recruited to assist the government in the central
processing of procurement and institutional capacity building. However, this arrangement did
not function properly, as the PA found it difficult to recruit staff with the right mix of skills to
be based in-country. As a result, the ERP, like other MDTF projects, hired an individual
procurement consultant to execute procurement processes and to help build counterpart
procurement capacity through on the job training of government staff. This arrangement, which
lasted until project closing, proved successful for accelerating procurement processing and
capacity building. The ministry was able to overcome the above mentioned constraints and
complete all major procurement processes by the end of the project. Thus, procurement was
rated moderately satisfactory.

2.4   Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

2.4.1 The government is committed to achieving universal primary education and further
developing its system capacity. It is continuing the activities of the ERP such as AES, teacher
training, county education centers, school construction, by integrating lessons learned. Further
evidence of this commitment is the preparation of a second education sector plan in 2012, the
General Education Strategic Plan 2012-2017 (GESP) with technical support from the World
Bank and other partners; and the ambition to raise education spending from the current 7
percent to 10 percent of total government spending. The GESP priorities are the same as those
of the ERP, which highlights the continued relevance of the ERP’s PDO and activities. In
support of the implementation of its plan, the government received grant funding in the amount
of US$36.1 million from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), a multi-donor initiative,
which became effective in April 2013. In addition, several other donors are currently financing
education, such as Denmark, USAID, and DFID. In terms of continued Bank technical and
financial support to education, the following activities are currently being undertaken,
complementary to other partner interventions: (i) support to community-based school
construction through the Local Government and Service Delivery project; and (ii) in-depth
student learning assessment of the Alternative Education System to help guide policy.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Substantial


                                                   14
       
          


3.1.1 The project objectives remain highly relevant to the country’s needs and the groups
targeted by the project, such as primary school students, IDPs and ex-combatants who continue
to be key beneficiaries of current government and donor programs. The PDO addressed the
critical challenges of the education system as indicated in the JAM and in line with the
government’s priorities as indicated in Article 13 of the 2005 Interim Constitution, its
education sector plan 2005-2011, and the 2003 Sudan Country Re-engagement Note. Further
evidence of the continued pertinence of the PDO is its consistency with the South Sudan
Development Plan (SSDP) 2011-2020 and the new education sector plan 2012-2017, which
includes as its mission to “improve access to, quality and funding for general education as well
as tackle the issue of illiteracy […] and low institutional and human capacity in the general
education sub-sector […]?.17 The PDO is reflected in the components of the project.
Components 1, 3 and 4 correspond to the first part of the PDO, improved access to enhanced
quality of education. Component 2 focuses on the second PDO, improved access to education
and life skills for non-traditional learners. The project design proposed addressed the key sector
issues and needs as identified in JAM and in consultation with stakeholders, which are still
relevant today. Evidence of the continued relevance of the project activities, such as support to
school construction, teacher training, the Alternative Education System and institutional
capacity building, is their continued funding through the government and other donors.

3.1.2 Despite the extremely difficult environment and some shortcomings in the design, the
PDO and project design remain highly relevant. In spite of frequent delays, especially in the
first two years, the adaptation of the project activities throughout implementation and the
restructuring of the results framework (though at a relatively advanced stage of
implementation) consistent with on the ground realities and constraints, and in response to
shifting government priorities, improved the relevance of the project design, facilitated
monitoring and contributed to implementation progress. The Bank was in step with the
changing needs of the country by being able to re-allocate funds from original
components/activities that were not considered as urgent once implementation started to
priority activities. For example, the funds initially allocated to Component 5 were allocated to
civil works of Component 1, once it became clear that initial construction cost estimates were
too low. As a result of these adjustments, disbursement and completion of activities picked up
substantially in 2009, the year after the mid-term review; and even further in 2010-2011.
Ultimately, the project succeeded in achieving, surpassing or was close to achieving the revised
PDO indicators and intermediate performance indicators. Therefore, relevance is rated
substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Substantial

3.2.1 The ERP provided support to the emerging new state at an early stage in the form of a
basic package of interventions for primary school children. This package essentially consisted
of classrooms, teacher training and textbooks, and thus benefitted the same beneficiaries,
primarily school aged children, in multiple ways and contributed to the scaling up of the
delivery of education services early on, improving enrolment and retention. The provision of
tangible inputs such as textbooks and classrooms encouraged parents to send their children to

school. The project also contributed to laying the foundations of a national education system
through capacity building in planning, implementation, supervision and technical aspects of
national, state and local level education staff, and a distribution system for education supplies
put in place. Although there was a substantial learning curve for the government as well as the
Bank, the project succeeded in completing the activities and in largely achieving the PDOs.
Two of the four PDO indicators are surpassed, one is achieved and the last one close to
achievement. Though less tangible, the project also contributed to institutional strengthening of
the ministry and thus contributed to the larger, overarching objective of the MDTF of state
building. The above justifies the overall outcome rating of moderately satisfactory.

Overall PDO indicator: Direct project beneficiaries (Surpassed)

3.2.2 This core indicator consists of two other indicators, children enrolled in primary
education and demobilized soldiers, returning population, overage learners and other non-
formal learners enrolled in alternate learning programs or basic skill training provided under
the project (though the final ISR only counts the latter one, thus underestimating the number of
total beneficiaries). It was surpassed substantially, with almost 3 million beneficiaries
compared to the target of 0.75 million. Given that the total population of South Sudan was 8.3
million in the 2008 Census, this means the project could have benefitted almost 35 percent of
the population (though with one caveat: the total number of children enrolled represents the
national figure, not the number of children enrolled in schools constructed by the project, since
this would have been too difficult to track and schools were constructed in all 10 states of
South Sudan). The percentage of female beneficiaries, which is part of this core indicator, was
not tracked in the ISRs.

PDO Objective 1: Improved access to education for primary school students
PDO indicator: Children enrolled in primary education (Achieved)

3.2.3 Long distances to school play a considerable role in children’s non-enrollment in school,
especially for girls.18 Thus, school construction supported by the project was an appropriate
intervention for improving access to education. In addition, as mentioned above, school
construction was part of a package of interventions promoting enrolment. Impressive progress
was made in improving access under the project. The number of children enrolled in primary
school more than doubled, from 669,000 in 2005 to 1,391,704 in 2012. The end target of
1,500,000 is thus close to achievement.

3.2.4 The total number of children enrolled represents the national figure, not the number of
children enrolled in schools constructed by the project, since this would have been difficult to
track, and schools were constructed in all 10 states of South Sudan. In addition, the project
constituted part of the national education program. Therefore, it is justified to use national
enrollment figures. The project funded the construction of 52 schools, with 6-10 classrooms
each (depending on location).19 Each school has three administrative offices, three latrines (two
for students by gender and one for staff) and a library. The classrooms are equipped with desks


                                                                  
18 Majgaard, Mingat, 2012, Education in Sub-Saharan Africa – A Comparative Analysis.

  Enrolment in the schools constructed by the project can be estimated at 21,000 children, which represent about 2
percent of total children enrolled in primary schools in 2012.


                                                                     16
       
       

and benches. Furthermore, the project promoted girls’ enrolment in the primary schools built
through the inclusion of latrines for boys and girls, as evidence from other countries suggests.20

3.2.5 School construction under the project also likely contributed to increased school
operating and learning time for the children enrolled. Schools without buildings or in structures
that cannot withstand rain are unlikely to operate for the entire school year, leading to loss in
learning time. About 33 percent of classrooms were open air in 2009, whereas now about 54
percent are either permanent or semi-permanent structures. Since most of the project-funded
schools were completed in 2011, the project likely contributed to reducing the above share of
open air classrooms, thus increasing the amount of students’ instruction time throughout the
school year.

PDO Objective 1: Enhanced quality of education for primary school students
PDO indicator: Textbook-pupil ratio (Achieved)

3.2.6 Learning inputs in the form of textbooks are used as proxy for enhanced education
quality, because they are one of several important inputs for improving learning.21 About 2.2
million textbooks in core subjects were purchased and distributed to primary schools by the
project in 2008-2009.22 The textbook-pupil ratio at project closing was 1:4 (i.e. one textbook
for four students) for both subjects, Math and English. Thus, the target of 1:5 was exceeded.

3.2.7 In addition to textbooks, teacher training and teacher guide books are other critical
elements for improving education quality. The project financed pre- and in-service teacher
training and pedagogical guides/materials for teachers. Before the project start, about 80
percent of the about 25,000 primary teachers were unqualified and most had no training. The
project trained a total of 1,629 primary teachers, reducing the percentage of total untrained
teachers by 7 percent, to about 73 percent. Of the teachers trained, 1,217 were trained as part of
the Fast track teacher training, 1,649 as part of the in-service teacher training23 and 412 pre-
service trainees.24 Teachers in primary grades 1-8 were also provided with teacher guides to
help them teach more effectively. These guides were essential, given the low qualifications of
the large majority of teachers. The project also contributed to providing the foundations for a
teacher training system by funding the construction of 14 CECs with 2 classrooms each, a
library and a laboratory. In addition, five teacher houses were renovated in the Maridi
Curriculum Development Center. Thus, the project contributed to PDO 1 in several ways,
beyond textbooks.

PDO Objective 3: Improved access to alternate learning opportunities, development of life
skills and basic occupational skill training for returning population, demobilized soldiers,
and other non-traditional learners
PDO indicator: Demobilized soldiers, returning population, overage learners and other non-
formal learners enrolled in alternate learning programs or basic skill training provided under
the project (Surpassed)

3.2.8 PDO 3 was largely surpassed by more than double the amount of learners. The actual
number of beneficiaries of alternative education programs consists of 1,556,554, compared to
the target of 750,000. This number constitutes the total number of learners enrolled in the AES
system at the national level, since it would have been too difficult to track the number of
learners funded by the project. In addition, the project was conceived as contribution to a larger
national education program. The project funded two of the seven branches/programs of the
Alternative Education System, the Accelerated Learning Program and the pastoralist education
program (PEP), which was piloted by the project. Nationally, the ALP is the largest branch of
the AES, and represents about 70 percent of all AES students. With regards to the ALP, the
project benefitted directly about 50,000 learners of the total 165,000 ALP learners, i.e. about
40 percent of total ALP learners. For the PEP, the number of students enrolled financed by the
project is 6,417; which represents almost 60 percent of total pastoralist enrolment (11,000).

3.2.9 Moreover, the project promoted older girls’ attendance of second chance education
programs by distributing sanitary pads to girls. Numerous studies from other countries such as
Ghana, Uganda, and Malawi found that these pads improved school attendance25.

3.2.10 In addition to contributing to increasing access to various alternative education options,
the project also contributed to enhancing the quality of AES. Training was provided to 1,000
AES instructors and teaching and learning materials were distributed to ALP and adult literacy
classes. AES learners received 529,000 textbooks in core subjects. A small scale evaluation of
AES undertaken by the project26 indicates that the quality of AES is relatively satisfactory,
though room for improvement exists. For example, numeracy and literacy test scores of
participants in the ALP, an accelerated second chance primary education program for 12-18
year old students funded by the project, range between 70 and 80 percent in grades 3 and 4, and
are close to student performance in comparable primary school grades.27 Some ALP learners
are successful in progressing to secondary education (many students of the AES program sit for
the national primary examinations) or vocational training. In addition, there are indications that
the AES overall also has another additional social impact: participants use a wide range of
media (63 percent use the radio, 42 percent books or other materials) and are engaged in their
communities (25 percent discuss problems in South Sudan with their community and almost 15
percent participate in some form of community group).

3.2.11 The project also contributed toward providing a solid basis for the overall AES system
and thus facilitated the implementation/financing of AES programs by other partners. Notably,
support consisted of providing two rounds of English Language Courses to 2,435 AES
instructors and staff and training of 150 local education authorities to enable them to coordinate
and supervise the AES programs, and curriculum development.

3.3 Efficiency
Rating: Substantial

3.3.1 External rate of return. The critical role of education in human capital formation,
economic growth and development has been extensively documented.28 At the individual level,
people with more schooling tend to be more productive, earn more, be healthier, have fewer
children and are more likely to send their children to school.29 In South Sudan, as in most other
countries, there is a positive external rate of return on investment in education, which increases
with each level of education. Each additional year of education results in about 10.3 percent
higher earnings. Individuals with a primary education earn 50 percent more than those with no
education. However, this only applies to formal employment, whereas the large majority of the
economically active population in South Sudan is in the informal sector. Nevertheless, the
above external return to education implies that investment in education in South Sudan is
justified.

3.3.2 Cost effectiveness of project interventions.30 The project activities are effective for
improving access and quality of education. Increasing the supply of schools in South Sudan
promotes access because long distances to schools create barriers to enrolment. In addition,
cost-efficient improvement of school infrastructure can indirectly contribute to student learning
through enhanced instruction time. Textbooks are among the most cost effective investments
for student learning. Teacher training is likely to achieve greater results through a combination
of short pre-service and increased in-service training (as funded by the project), rather than a
long and more costly pre-service training.

3.3.3 Cost-efficiency. Unit costs are very high in South Sudan, much higher than in other
countries in the region, for a number of reasons, including: (i) under-developed private
construction sector; (ii) need to import almost all materials; (iii) high transport costs due to the
lack or poor condition of roads; (iv) heavy rains that cause flooding; (v) overall shortage of
skills in the country; and (vi) high living costs for international staff. Therefore, adequately
estimating the costs of activities proved to be difficult at preparation and international
benchmarks for unit costs do not apply to South Sudan. Nevertheless, unit costs of activities
funded by the project, though appearing high, are in line with other donors unit costs for
similar activities and therefore are considered cost-efficient.

3.3.4 School construction: Almost 80 percent of total project funds were spent on school
construction. Therefore, the cost efficiency analysis will focus on this component. In addition,
cost information from other donors for other project interventions to draw comparisons is not
available. The school model used for the schools constructed by the ERP consisted of
permanent structures with glass windows, solid board ceilings, rain water goods, walls
constructed in solid 230 width concrete blocks embedded in mortar, and steel used in some
roofs, with an estimated average life span of about 25 years. Though more expensive than other
types of structures, the advantage of this model is its durability, weather resistance and
relatively low maintenance costs compared to other models, such as semi-permanent

constructions or classrooms built from less durable, local and potentially weather-affected
materials. Less durable construction types could negatively affect the number of school
days/hours, especially during the rainy season, but permanent construction designs can stay
open throughout the school year. Costs vary considerably by location, depending on soil
condition, and accessibility, but the average cost per school constructed by the ERP (6
classrooms, 3 offices, 3 latrines, 1 library) was about US$396,94531. The cost per classroom
was about US$40,000 (latrines are included in the cost since a detailed cost break down is not
available). Though the construction cost per school and per classroom was high, it is in line
with costs for similar, permanent school construction designs by other donors in South Sudan
(see table 5 below).32 Therefore, school construction funded by the project can be considered
cost efficient.

                                                                                                               latrines


3.3.5 National exam printing press. The project also funded the acquisition of a printing press
to facilitate the national end of primary school exams, which are a prerequisite for entry to
secondary school. Though the upfront cost of this investment is considerable, the in-county
printing of exams will contribute to lowering the annually recurring costs of importing the
exams from neighboring countries.

3.3.6 Sustainability: The Ministry of General Education and Instruction has gradually
developed stronger technical and management capacity. Evidence of this is the development of
the national Education Sector Plan. The key activities of the ERP including teacher training,
AES, school construction and rehabilitation among other activities are continuing with
financing from other donors or the government and constitute critical elements of the ESP.
Thus, the outcomes of the ERP will be sustained.

3.3.7 In summary, the project interventions improved access to primary education and
contributed to a higher external rate of return for the project beneficiaries, were relatively cost
efficient and are being continued and sustained through the government and donors. Therefore,
efficiency is rated substantial.


                                                                    
31
     Six of the 52 schools built with support from the ERP had 10 classrooms, but a detailed breakdown of per
schools is not available.  
32
    One caveat on these comparisons: The cost figures are not completely comparable across different donors, since
the number of additional facilities, such as administrative offices, latrines etc. varies slightly from project to
project, as well as the square footage per classroom, on which information is not available.  


                                                                                 20
         
         

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1 Despite the extremely difficult environment and some shortcomings in the design, the
relevance of the PDO and project design continue to be substantial; PDO achievement and
efficiency are substantial. Although there was a steep learning curve for the government as
well as the Bank, the project ultimately succeeded in completing the activities and achieving
the PDOs. Though less tangible, the project also contributed to institutional strengthening of
the ministry and thus contributed to the larger, overarching objective of the MDTF of state
building. The above justifies the overall outcome rating of moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development (see Annex 12)

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening (see Annex 12) 

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative) (see Annex 12)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 No formal beneficiary surveys/stakeholder workshops were undertaken for the project,
but informal stakeholder feedback was collected during field trips and supervision missions.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

4.1 Overall political and economic fragility and sustainability of sector financing. Due to
political tensions with Sudan, security concerns remain an issue. In addition, there are a high
number of returnees and localized conflicts over land and resources. Providing education and
other basic services to the many returnees from Sudan (close to 1 million)33 is another
challenge, adding pressure to the already strained capacity and resources of the central and
local governments. South Sudan is classified as a lower middle income country, but
government revenues are greatly dependent on oil revenues (98 percent) and real GDP per
capita has declined every year since 2008, when GDP was first recorded. Within its short
lifespan, the South Sudanese economy has already weathered several fiscal shocks due to
fluctuations in oil prices and the early 2012 shut-down of production due to a tariff dispute
with Sudan. The austerity measures introduced due to the 2012 shut-down resulted in a severe
fall in the share for education of total government expenditures, from 7-8 percent to 4 percent
in 2012. Thus, in spite of considerable government commitment, the sustainability of education
financing is a risk to the Development Outcome and could negatively affect the rapid
expansion and improvement of the quality of education services.

4.2 Strong government commitment and continuation of ERP activities. In its recently passed
General Education Bill the government showed its commitment to achieving education for all
by committing itself to spending at least 10 percent of total government budget on education. It

                                                                       21
         
          

is continuing to finance and implement the activities of the ERP such as AES, teacher training
and school construction, through its own resources and external funding. Further evidence of
this commitment is the preparation of a second education sector plan 2012-2017. Lastly, the
risk of financial sustainability is mitigated slightly by the development and implementation of
more financially sustainable and more targeted approaches in school construction and other
areas.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

5.1.1 The project had four different TTLs, from preparation to closing. But for most of the
implementation, i.e. from after appraisal in February 2006 to May 2011, the same country-
based, well-qualified TTL provided extensive implementation support.

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.2 The Bank correctly identified the main sector issues and collaborated with the GoSS,
other external partners and NGOs in project preparation. The development objectives of the
project were in accordance with the goals set by the GoSS in its Education Sector Plan (ESP)
2005-2011, consistent with the recommendations of the JAM, and continue to be highly
relevant. An internal review of the project proposal took place and the recommendations were
integrated into the final document. The PDO wording could have been formulated in a more
simple and specific manner, which would have facilitated the formulation of indicators and
made attribution of achievements to the project more straightforward. Considering the weak
capacity, infrastructure and security issues, the project design was ambitious in scope and
timeline, the implementation arrangements not appropriate for the context, and the risks not
sufficiently identified and mitigated. The identification and establishment of adequate fiduciary
accountability mechanisms through the selection of a MA and an EAA proved to be highly
appropriate for the context and functioned well. Though the tremendous effort of the Bank
preparation team under uniquely difficult country circumstances and a very short preparation
time frame at a critical time for the country is to be commended34, in light of the above, the
performance of the Bank in ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3 The Bank’s implementation support was responsive with a large, well-qualified and
dedicated team based in-country throughout the project life time, consisting of technical,
operational and fiduciary experts. The substantial efforts, continuous support and dedication to
advance implementation progress of the Juba based staff was displayed throughout the project.
Most of the Bank team’s time was spent on procurement. The Bank conducted regular
supervision missions, with the number of missions varying between two to three annually.
These missions identified issues of concern and worked with the ministry to remedy them. The
missions were staffed with appropriate personnel including senior fiduciary specialists. Even
                                                                     
34
     For example, at preparation, the WB office was a tent.


                                                                        22
          
       

outside of the regular missions, team members conducted field visits. The MA also conducted
regular supervision missions.

5.1.4 Though there were shortcomings in Bank management attention, oversight and support in
the earlier project stages, this changed when the sector manager and senior staff joined a
supervision mission in 2009, and continued to closely monitor the project, provide guidance
and proactively address key issues, together with the country-based Bank team. This also led to
more frequent and improved dialogue with government officials and donors, though a greater
effort could have been made by the Bank earlier to include the external partners more in
supervision missions and to improve the dialogue at different stages of the project. Once Bank
management focused on the ERP and participated in missions, disbursements and
implementation progress improved considerably starting in 2009-2010. By end 2010, half of
the project funds had been disbursed, by end 2011, US$24.47 million or 96 percent and at
closing in December 2012, all funds had been disbursed. This shows that though there were
considerable delays, the project managed a turn-around in 2009-2010 once more resolute
actions were taken to clear obstacles. In addition, the Bank team introduced the Rapid Results
Initiative which contributed to accelerating implementation.

5.1.5 It is also worth noting that many of the implementation issues were not unique to the
ERP, but also affected other MDTF-SS projects.35 Though the scope of the project could have
been scaled down formally earlier in the process, this was eventually addressed by the 2011
restructuring.

5.1.6 The revision of activities within the components along with intensified Bank supervision
ensured that disbursements and implementation moved at a steady pace, after the post-midterm
review and especially starting in 2010. Therefore, in light of the challenges and successes of
the Bank team, the rating of quality of supervision is moderately satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.7 In spite of substantial effort in an extremely difficult country environment, the quality at
entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory due to the complexity of the design. However, the
design was subsequently adapted to the environment during implementation as more
information and data became available, and in line with disbursement for the various project
activities. Over the lifetime of the project, the Bank stepped up its performance in supervision
and oversight, which accelerated implementation the year following the midterm review. The
Bank also managed to ensure adequate safeguards and fiduciary compliance in a high risk
environment where the respective capacity, government institutions and legal frameworks were
just being established in parallel with implementation. At closing, all project activities were
completed and the PDO indicators were largely achieved or surpassed. Therefore, the Bank’s
overall performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

5.2   Borrower Performance

                                                                  
35
  See for example MDTF-SS ICRs for the Private Sector Development Project, (P102319), Support to
Agriculture and Forestry Development Project (P104786), Water Supply and Sanitation Project (P111061) and the
Gender Support and Development Project (P115717).


                                                                     23
       
      


(a) Borrower Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1 The government actively participated in the JAM carried out by the Bank and the UN.
The education sector plans 2005-2011 and 2012-2017 indicate the priority the government
places on education. The borrower, i.e. the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning also
displayed its commitment to the project by providing the full counterpart funding in advance at
the outset of the implementation phase. This is all the more remarkable in view of the difficult
institutional context. Therefore, the performance of the borrower is rated satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.2 The implementing agency, MoGEI, experienced setbacks during the implementation
process, especially in the beginning due to severe capacity constraints and frequent changes in
ministry leadership. These leadership changes in turn led to frequent changes in technical and
project personnel, which significantly contributed to implementation delays. In addition,
project staff initially was not assigned full time to the project and thus could not devote their
complete attention to the ERP. Moreover, the PSC, though established, did not meet as
regularly as planned to provide oversight and guidance, and thus was mostly non-functional.
Several fiduciary issues also occurred, such as several cases of unaccounted advances and
ineligible expenditures (for more details see above section on fiduciary compliance), though
these were later resolved/reimbursed. Overall, the MoGEI was not able to execute activities on
a timely basis and to proactively identify and swiftly address issues that were causing delays.
However, the pace of disbursement and implementation both picked up notably in 2009, and
even more so starting in 2010; all project activities were completed and the PDO achieved. The
learning curve for the government was steep, but major lessons have been learned and already
been integrated into current work. In light of the above, the overall performance of the
implementing agency is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.3 Borrower performance was satisfactory and implementing agency moderately
unsatisfactory, but PDO achievement is substantial. Therefore, the overall performance of the
borrower is rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1 Given the unique project context of support to a new emerging state with minimal
institutional structures, the following key lessons may help inform future support to projects
new and emerging/fragile countries:

6.2 Comprehensive MDTF approach across sectors. In hindsight, an in-depth discussion and
the adoption of a common approach across MDTF-funded projects would have been beneficial,
because many issues across projects/sectors were similar and related to state building and



                                                  24
      
       

development of government systems, e.g. the establishment of a civil service and ministry
structures, and technical and fiduciary capacity building.

6.3 Readiness for implementation and realistic implementation time frame. ERP would have
benefited from a more rigorous assessment of project readiness for implementation, realism of
its targets, and time frame. As capacity building is a slow process particularly in a newly
emerging state, a more realistic time frame and modest targets would have avoided the
unrealistic high expectations among the government and donors. Furthermore, if essential full
time qualified staff (FM, Procurement, M&E and Safeguards) are in place from effectiveness,
delays are less likely.

6.4 Building strong Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) systems as integral part of project
implementation from the start is essential. This is also a lesson learned from education
projects in Kosovo and East Timor36 as well as the MDTF Private Sector Project. Since overall
capacity is very limited and initial focus is predominantly on launching the activities, M&E
system establishment, baseline data collection and monitoring tend to be neglected. However,
the M&E system could help with planning and establishing greater accountability for results
through tracking of project implementation progress and results. Sufficient numbers of
qualified and full time personnel would be needed for building such M&E systems from
scratch.

6.5 Greater outreach and engagement of stakeholders. It is vital to begin stakeholder dialogue
early on and maintain it throughout preparation and implementation. This includes dialogue
and regular communication with donors, but also beneficiaries and their communities. An open
line of communication and involvement of the local communities and NGOs in project
implementation and monitoring, e.g. through a community-based school construction approach
etc., would have greatly helped the implementation process.

6.6 The project would have benefited from an even larger staff presence on the ground and
intensified management guidance and support. The Bank task team leader had to spend most
of the time and effort on procurement, thus an additional full time person assisting the TTL
would have enabled a greater focus on technical aspects and policy dialogue with the
government and partners. The need for a larger task team appears to be common across
fragile/new countries and is also highlighted as a lessons learned for an education project in
East Timor.37

6.7 State capacity building approach may slow down implementation initially, but will pay
off in the medium to long term through enhanced ministry ownership and capacity. Though
the use of a dedicated PIU38 would likely have lessened initial delays, the implementation of
the project by the Ministry of Education directly resulted in substantial commitment and
capacity strengthening, thus providing a basis for long term development.

1. In South Sudan, as in other countries, the poverty incidence rate is correlated with the level
of education. At the national level, about 51 percent of the total population lives below the
extreme poverty line (less than US$1.25 a day). The poverty incidence falls with each
progressive level of education. For example, an estimate from the National Baseline Household
Survey (NBHS) 2009 reveals that about 58 percent of the workforce with no education lives
below the extreme poverty line compared to 43 percent with primary education, 28 percent
with some secondary and only 18 percent with some post-secondary education (figure 1).
Similarly, only about 15 percent from the post-secondary education category fall within lowest
expenditure quintile, while more than 50 percent fall in the highest expenditure quintile, and
the corresponding figures for the no education category are 25 percent and only 0.8 percent,
respectively (figure 2). However, in spite of these high returns to education, the largest share
of the labor force, more than 70 percent, has no education.

2. Estimates from the NBHS 2009 show South Sudan’s labor market clearly signals for
investment on education. Figure 3 shows average wage earnings by level of education and age
group. Higher levels of education rewards a higher lifetime earning horizon. Furthermore,
education leads to better earning employment sector and status. For instance, the estimate from
the same survey show that earnings from wage employment is 516 SDG per month compared
to only 351 SDG and 209 SDG per month for self-employment and informal work in the
agricultural sector (e.g. contributing labor to the household’s agricultural activities),
respectively. Similarly, about 83 percent of the population with some post-secondary education

secures wage employment, 52 percent with some secondary, 42 percent for some primary,
compared to only 7 percent of the population with no education who are formally employed.

3. Cost-efficiency. Unit costs are very high in South Sudan, much higher than in other
countries in the region, for a number of reasons, including: (i) under-developed private
construction sector; (ii) need to import almost all materials; (iii) high transport costs due to the
lack or poor condition of roads; (iv) heavy rains that cause flooding; (v) overall shortage of
skills in the country; and (vi) high living costs for international staff. Therefore, adequately
estimating the costs of activities proved to be difficult at preparation and international
benchmarks for unit costs do not apply to South Sudan. Nevertheless, unit costs of activities
funded by the project though high, are in line with other donors and therefore are considered
cost-efficient.

4. School construction: Almost 80 percent of total project funds were spent on school
construction. Therefore, the cost efficiency analysis will focus on this component. In addition,
cost information from donors for other project interventions to draw comparisons is not
available. The school model used for the schools constructed by the ERP consisted of
permanent structures with glass windows, solid board ceilings, rain water goods, walls
constructed in solid 230 width concrete blocks embedded in mortar, and steel used in some
roofs, and has an estimated average life span of about 25 years. Though more expensive than
other types of structures, the advantage of this model is its durability, weather resistance and
relatively low maintenance costs compared to other models, such as semi-permanent
construction or classrooms built from less durable, local and potentially weather-affected
materials. Less durable construction types could negatively affect the number of school
days/hours, especially during the rainy season, but permanent construction designs can stay
open throughout the school year. Costs vary considerably by location, depending on soil
condition, and accessibility, but the average cost per school constructed by the ERP (6
classrooms, 3 offices, 3 latrines, 1 library) was about US$396,94540. The cost per classroom
was about US$40,000 (latrines are included in the cost since a detailed cost break down is not

with costs for similar, permanent school construction designs by other donors in South Sudan
(see table 1 below).41 Therefore, school construction funded by the project was cost efficient.

5. National exam printing press. The project also funded the acquisition of a printing press to
facilitate the national end of primary school exams, which are a prerequisite for entry into
secondary school. Though the upfront cost of this investment is considerable, the in-county
printing of exams will contribute to lowering the annually recurring costs of importing the
exams from neighboring countries.




                                                                    
41
  One caveat on these comparisons: The cost figures are not completely comparable across different donors, since
the number of additional facilities, such as administrative offices, latrines etc. varies slightly from project to
project, as well as the square footage per classroom, on which information is not available.

                                Annex 7: Summary of Borrower’s ICR

1. The following summarizes the main points of the Government ICR. The ICR team received
the ‘Implementation Completion Report for the Education Rehabilitation Program’ from the
government on May 28, 2013. In the following section, the main points from the Government
report are summarized.

2. Based on the recommendations of the Joint Assessment Mission (JAM), the MDTF-SS
provided funding for an Education Rehabilitation Project (ERP) for South Sudan. The project
was set amid a country reeling from a devastating civil war, and the education indicators were
among the worst in the world. The Government ICR gives an overview of the background for
the project, the project design, impleentation plans and process, achievements, challenges and
recommendations for the future.

3. The main achievements of the project are: While the teacher training component did not
achieve all of the objectives, some teachers were still trained through the pre- and in- service
teacher training programs. In the AES component, AES teachers were trained, a pastoralist
education program was piloted successfully, and the anticipated beneficiaries of the AES
programs were successfully educated. 52 schools were built as part of the construction
component. Equipment including a printing press for examination was procured, education
managers were trained as part of the capacity building component.

4. The key implementation challenges were:

          The structure of the ministry was not formalized at the time of project appraisal.
          Changing political leadership – The priorities of the project sometimes underwent
           changes because of the priorities at the top of the government. Turnovers of the
           political leadership did not aid in making the implementation process smooth.
          Infrastructure – The implementation and project design did not consider the existing
           infrastructure conditions in South Sudan. In particular, the road network in South Sudan
           was minimal, making even transportation of materials difficult.

5. Bank Performance: The Bank performance is rated as moderately satisfactory. The
performance at the Bank to ensure ‘quality at entry’ is rated as satisfactory. The Bank was
significant in the planning and preparation of the project. The Bank provided guidance on
design and staff on a permanent basis to assist the ministry in the preparation of documents that
would lead to the disbursement of the grant. The performance of the Bank’s supervision is
moderately satisfactory. The Bank did a good job in providing technical support and guidance
to the procurement and implementation processes. The Bank could have been better in
orienting the project implementation team about Bank procedures and enhanced the skills and
capacity of the implementing team.

6. The recommendations for future projects are:

          Many of the challenges faced by the project were due to the lack of Ministry capacity.
           To avoid these challenges, it is suggested that henceforth, prior to implementation, a




                                                    37
        
          

             needs assessment of the existing capacity must be conducted and specific capacity
             building plans be created and inserted as part of the implementation plan.
            It is vital to have concrete baseline data on the indicators that will be used to track the
             progress of the project. The lack of baseline data will affect not only the planning
             process, but also the design, implementation and results process.
            Consistency in the management team is the key to project success – this includes the
             management team in the Ministry and the Bank. Leaving politicians out of the planning
             and implementation process will be a step forward. Developing a unit devoted to
             implementation would also be helpful.
            The government and the Bank should devote more time to ensure that the procedures
             and processes of the Bank are understood by the government and the implementation
             team.

                      Annex 10: Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Southern Sudan (MDTF-SS)42


1. The Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) is a partnership between the international donor
community and the governments of both North and South Sudan to fund developmental
projects in both countries. MDTF in South Sudan has funded projects that aim to build the
country after the decade’s long armed conflict. The MDTTF-SS has five strategic priorities,
presented in Figure 1.

                                  Source: Preliminary Report – Final Evaluation of the MDTF-SS (Apr, 2013)


2. The major contributors to the fund are listed in the figure below along with their contribution
into the fund (see fig 2). The MDTF-SS disbursed US$274 million to projects in 2010 and
2011. As of March 2012, out of the $541 million committed to the trust fund by the donors and
the World Bank, $505 million was disbursed. This represents over 90 percent of the trust fund.

         Annex 12: Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, Social Development and Institutional
                                           Change

1. Poverty impact of education. In South Sudan, as in other countries, the poverty incidence
rate is correlated with the level of education. At the national level, about 51 percent of the total
population lives below the extreme poverty line (less than US$1.25 a day). The poverty
incidence quickly falls with the level of educational attainment. For example, an estimate from
the South Sudan National Baseline Household Survey (NBHS, 2009) reveals that about 58
percent of the workforce with no education lives below the extreme poverty line compared to
only 43 percent for those with primary education.

2. Gender aspects. Girls’ attendance in primary school and in the Alternative Education
System was promoted through the inclusion of latrines in the school design and the provision
of sanitary pads respectively (see also section on PDO achievement).

3. Social impact of the Alternative Education System. The AES program overall also has had
a positive social impact: participants use a wide range of media (63 percent use the radio, 42
percent books or other materials) and are engaged in their communities (25 percent discuss
problems in South Sudan with their community and almost 15 percent participate in some form
of community group).

Institutional Change/Strengthening

4. While not explicitly stated, the ERP objective was not only building an education system,
but also state building. Therefore, the underlying outcome from the activities and components
was to enhance institutional capacity. Building the institutional capacity emerged as the area of
good performance for the overall MDTF performance, based on field visits. There has been a
gradual expansion of the institutional capacity of the state, most pronounced at the center, but
also at state level, to a large extent due to the combined efforts of the government, and
contributions from MDTF-SS and other international assistance.43 However, the MDTF-SS
played an essential and catalytic role. In particular, component 3 of the ERP focused on
building capacity within the Ministry of Education. About 357 education managers trained in
planning, implementation and supervision, of which 317 from the state ministries and 40 from
the central ministry. In addition, the World Bank trained government staff on procurement
procedures and laws, project management and fiduciary compliance, which improved
throughout the project implementation. In interviews with ministry staff during the ICR
preparation, the Rapid Response Initiative in particular was frequently mentioned as helping
each of the team members better understand their roles and responsibilities and enabling them
to more effectively do their jobs. Evidence of the impact of the institutional strengthening on
ministry capacity is the (i) accelerated implementation pace in the last two years of the project;
(ii) the preparation of the first comprehensive sector diagnostic; (iii) the development of a
second education sector strategy; (iv) consultations with the regions on the sector strategy,
which is a sign of increased collaboration between the center and the states; and (v) gradual
increase in the programs implemented by the ministry itself, e.g. the ministry has been
gradually and successfully taken on more of the coordination and implementation of the AES,
which was initially predominantly implemented by NGOs..

The evaluation of the overall MDTF states that “from observations at the state level, many of
the institution building assets of the MDTF-SS were in place and contributing to the
functioning of Government. Physical infrastructure, MDTF-SS trained officials and systems
were still in place and part of the essential institutional core that Government is attempting to
preserve until revenues resume. This includes physical infrastructure, payroll and accounting
systems, and training of officials to better perform their responsibilities. In the constrained
austerity environment, MDTF-SS contributions were important to sustaining the core functions
of institutions.?44
