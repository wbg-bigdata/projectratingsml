SUBJECT: Impact Evaluation Report on Morocco
Socioeconomic Influence of Rural Roads
Fourth Highway Project (Loan 2254-MOR)
Attached is the Impact Evaluation Report (IER) on the Morocco Fourth Highway project (Loan
2254, approved in FY83). The main objective of the impact evaluation was to understand the impact of
rural roads, five to ten years after completion of the improvements carried out under the project. The
study focused on impacts on: (i) transport infrastructure and services; (ii) agriculture; (iii) social
services; and (iv) the environment. The impact study also assessed the economic benefits of the
improvements and their sustainability. The study focused on four of the ten rural roads improved under
the project; the sample roads were geographically distributed in the North, Center and Center-South of
the country to represent a variety of climate, agricultural, and economic conditions. The study was
conducted during 1995.
The impact study compared present conditions in the areas of project roads to the situation prior
to the improvements, and to conditions in comparison roads located nearby and which were not subject
to improvements during the project period. The study's main finding is that the benefits of paving rural
roads extend considerably beyond making traffic easier, lowering the cost of operating cars, trucks and
other vehicles, and improving the quality of transport services. The extended benefits include triggering
major changes in the agricultural economy, including higher outputs; transformation of the agricultural
output mix, for example, from low-value cereals to high-value fruit orchards; increased use of modern
inputs, especially fertilizers. Improved access to health and education facilities increased enrollment
rates in rural education as well as frequency of visits to health care services, and allowed to recruit
professional personnel to staff schools and health facilities. The biggest impact was on girls' enrollment
in primary education, which more than trebled in the project zones during the study period. Women also
benefited as the existence of paved roads sharply increased the affordability of butane for cooking and
heating, dramatically reducing women's daily chores for the collection of fuelwood. In preparing the
IER, surveys were conducted at the household and village levels, followed by focus groups in each of the
villages covered by the study. In January 1996, as part of the preparation of the study's final report, an
OED mission, together with personnel from the Ministry of Public Works, attended meetings in the road
areas which included local officials from all economic sectors as well as elected, county-level
representatives. These meetings were essential to interpret data and draw conclusions.
The study also showed that economic benefits were substantial, resulting in satisfactory
economic returns, and that the investments were not premature. The transport, agriculture, and social
impacts are likely to be sustainable.

Preface
This is an Impact Evaluation Report (IER) of rural roads financed under the Bank's
Fourth Highway Project (Loan 2254-MOR, for US$85 million, approved in March 1983 and
closed in December 1990) in Morocco. This evaluation aims to understand the impact of rural
roads on transport infrastructure and services, as well as on the region's economy and social
welfare, five to ten years after completion of the improvements carried out under the project.
Two mrain reasons prompted the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) to undertake
this study. First, rural roads account for a significant proportion of Bank clients' rural
infrastructure programs, and of Bank lending for roads, thus, better understanding of the impact
of these operations would be of wide interest. Second, Morocco has launched a large program to
improve rural roads, and the Government expressed strong support for conducting the study. In
addition, the study would be of interest to countries that are undergoing fast urbanization and
that are seeking to better comprehend the cost-effectiveness of infrastructure investments to
improve living conditions in the rural milieu.
The study was started in Morocco in January 1995, with the recruitment of a team of
local consultants. A study launch workshop in May 1995, attended by central and local
government officials, the consultants, and OED staff, initiated the field work. Subsequent OED
missions to Morocco reviewed, together with the Ministry of Publics Works' Road Directorate
(MPWRD), the progress in the consultants' work, and discussed with central and provincial and
county-level officials the study's findings.
The study selected for analysis four out of the ten roads whose paving was financed by
the project. These four roads, located in three distinct regions of Morocco-Northern, Central
and Central-Southern-were chosen to maximize diversity in agro-climatic conditions, economic
characteristics of the zones, and economic function of the roads. For each project road, a control
road, located nearby, was selected, which had not been subject to improvement during the study
period. Socioeconomic data for the project and the control roads was collected mainly through
five types of surveys, of which three were at household and village levels, one at provincial level
for public works, and one at local level for agriculture. In addition, focus groups were carried
out in each of the villages covered by the study. Once the interim consultants' report was ready,
an OED/MPWRD mission conducted meetings in the field in January 1996 that included
representatives from all economic sectors and elected county-level representatives; these
meetings were essential to interpret data and to refine or correct the consultants' findings.
Copies of the draft IER were sent to the relevant Government officials and agencies
concerned for their review and comments. No comments were received.

Evaluation Summary
Background
1.    Despite sustained urbanization through the 1980s and 1990s, about 50 percent of
Morocco's population remains rural. Rural inhabitants have benefited less from the country's
economic growth over the last decade than urban dwellers. A result is that over 70 percent of the
poor population lives in rural areas. Consequent with its objectives to improve the welfare of its
rural population, the Government is launching a plan of road investments for the period 1996-
2000 that aims to improve or pave 10,000 kilometers of rural roads. This report, by examining
the results after several years of operation of a rural road component included in a broader road
project financed by the Bank (the Fourth Highway Project, approved in March 1983), seeks to
understand the impacts that emanate from improving rural roads, and how they filter beyond the
physical investment to the agricultural economy and the social sectors. The intention is to derive
lessons that can help Morocco and other countries better assess the long-term value of investing
in rural roads.
Methodology
2.     This study assesses the impact of paving and other improvements (completed between
1987 anid 1991 ) to four rural roads located in three different regions of Morocco: North, Center
and South. As a starting point, the study formulated four sets of hypotheses about the impacts of
the road improvements: (i) direct impact on transport infrastructure and services; (ii) impact on
the agricultural economy; (iii) impact on the social sectors such as health and education; and (iv)
impact on the environment.
3.     To test these hypotheses, the study utilized two types of analyses: first, for each of the
roads considered, it compared current conditions with those before the investments and, second,
it compared conditions in the project road relative to a control road which did not benefit from
improvements over the period of the study. Data was obtained from extensive surveys
conducted at the farm, regional and village levels, and focus groups discussions at these levels
helped interpret the data. A monitoring system prepared by consultants under the road project,
intended to provide a large set of indicators, was not put in place as public works officials
doubted its cost-effectiveness.
4.     A study limitation is that since comparison roads were judgmentally selected at the end
of the project because they had no improvements over the study period, we cannot definitively
attribute changes in the communities studied to road improvements. The communities near
improved roads may have been systematically different from those in areas where the roads were
not improved. For example, communities near improved roads may have been targeted for other
improvements. In addition, the sample is not generalizable. We believe, however, that viewed
as case studies, the four improved roads and the four unimproved roads offer useful illustrations
of some of the impacts of road improvements.
Impact on Transport Infrastructure and Services
5.     All four roads studied were improved from an originally deteriorated gravel or
unengineered track condition to an asphalt surface (mostly 4-meter paved width). The



6
most direct impact was elimination of frequent road closures during rainy periods, as the
improved roads are open to traffic year-round. The road users benefited in several other
ways: the cost of operating vehicles diopped, leading to lower prices for freight and
passengers services than in roads that were not improved. Traffic on project roads
increased at rates higher than before the improvement, and comprised a bigger proportion
of larger, more efficient trucks. TIhe supply of road passenger services increased
substantially, especially share-ride taxis offering frequent service, whereas in the past the
only service was a rural bus offering as little as one run a day. Ownership of motorized
vehicles increased, both of cars and trucks. The access time by the rural population to
markets and social services fell drastically. In some cases, the time to  access county and
village administrative offices, agricultural extension personnel, health centers and rural
markets, was cut by at least 50 percent. This improvement was a result of both better
roads and new facilities, whose construction was made possible in part by the roads.
Impact on Agriculture
6.     The study found that in the road project areas overall levels of agricultural activity
increased in volume of production, productivity of the land, and monetary values of the output.
The agricultural production mix was transformed as farmers were able to shift land from low
value cereals to high value fruit orchards, which yield higher profits, thanks to the reduction in
perishability risks brought about by the better quality and year-round operability of the
improved roads. In two of the three study regions, land used for vegetables and fruits increased
over 40 percent over the study period. Livestock production shifted towards pure breed cows,
also a higher yield activity. The use of modern agricultural inputs, especially fertilizers,
increased as improved transport made distribution channels better. Use of agricultural extension
services by the small farms increased by more than four times over the study period. The shift to
higher value products, combined with improved yields for traditional crops, raised the value
added per unit of cultivated land.
7.    Improvements in the agricultural economy led to related economic changes in
workloads, employment on farm and establishment of new shops; these changes followed
different patterns depending on the region. Off-farm employment grew overall by more than six
times in the project zones (compared to about three times in the control zones) and happened
across all three regions. The study found that agricultural practices in the control zones, which
did not benefit from improved roads, remain essentially the same today as a decade ago.
Impact on Social Services
8.     The surveys showed that while enrollment in primary education increased throughout all
areas covered by the study, the gains in the areas served by the project roads, where enrollment
more than doubled between 1985 and 1995, was much higher than in the control roads. In
parallel, the quality of education improved, as it became possible to recruit teachers to staff the
schools, and absenteeism of both teachers and students dropped. The rural population also
nearly doubled their use of health care facilities (hospital and primary care), and, similarly to
education, the quality of health services was enhanced as the supply of medicines improved,
health officials launched a campaign to staff rural health care centers with a doctor, and
immunization and other health prevention programs became easier to implement.

9.     Some of the social impacts were especially large for women: girls' enrollment in primary
education trebled over the period; expanded or new maternal and child care programs were made
available and accessible, and the introduction of butane at affordable prices thanks to the
existence of paved roads dramatically reduced women's chores of daily collection of fuelwood
for cooking and heating. Rural-urban interaction increased several-fold in the two directions:
urban dwellers visiting their rural relatives, and farm household members visiting cities.
Impact on the Environment
10.    Changes in transport conditions and in the agricultural economy had both negative and
positive impacts on the environment although, overall, no environmentally sensitive areas were
at risk by the road projects, which did not involve new construction. Negative impacts were
those resulting from the increased traffic and economic activity, especially air and noise
pollution and road accidents, and the increased used of fertilizers and other chemicals which in
all likelihood contaminated the water table. Positive impacts resulted in part from the
transformation of the agricultural economy, notably curtailment of extensive goat and sheep
herding-that damages the soil cover-and increased tree plantations, and from broader use of
butane substituting for fuelwood, whose demand is larger than the size of Morocco's sustainable
forests.
Economic Analysis
11.    The improvements in the agricultural economy and in access to social services translated
into increases in the roads' traffic levels at rates substantially higher than on unpaved rural roads.
The study quantified the economic benefits accruing to road users in the form of savings in
vehicle operating costs compared to the original, unpaved roads, and the economic gains
resulting from people and freight being able to move at any time, without the risk of road
closures. Social impacts, although real, could not be isolated for attribution to the road
investment and were not quantified in the analysis.
12.    The economic returns as well as the timing of the improvements for all project roads
were found to be satisfactory (economic rates of return ranging between 16 and 30 percent).
Even under a worse case scenario assuming lower traffic growth and reduced benefits from
operating costs savings, the returns would have remained acceptable. The benefits from the
investments are expected to accrue to farmers in the form of expanded use of commercial freight
services substituting for non-motorized carriage of loads, including operation of heavier, more
efficient trucks. The rural population in the roads' areas is expected to benefit mainly by the
availability at affordable prices of frequent services by share-ride taxis.
13.    Although some of the benefits appeared to be dependent on paved surfaces and the
economic returns are satisfactory, this does not ensure that paving was an optimal economic
solution, compared, for example, to rehabilitating the roads to a gravel surface maintained at a
good standard.
Sustainability of Benefits
14.    Historic trends showing steady traffic growth over long periods on Morocco's paved
roads, even during drought years when agricultural production fell, suggest that the stream of



8
benefits is likely to be sustainable. The main issue is route 603 which currently, seven years
after completion of the works and in part because traffic reached unexpectedly high levels, is in
poor condition. While improvement of this road is included under the MW's maintenance
program for 1994-1998, inadequate budgetary allocations for road maintenance raise uncertainty
about the level of benefits on this road over the long-term. The transformation and improvement
of the agricultural economy is based on sound business decisions and is likely to be sustained,
with the possible exception of the sugar beet planting in the North (a small component of traffic
on route 603) which is uneconomic and may lose market depending on the outcome of the
privatization program for the state-owned sugar factories. The gains in agriculture are also
dependent on government trade and fiscal policies, and as well as the access of Moroccan
produce to European Union markets. The sustainability of the social service impacts appear as
likely in view of the high value assigned to them by the direct beneficiaries and because of
government policies and the increased funding it is allocating to improve social services.
Recommendations
15.    The following recommendations are offered:
(a) Establish a practical rural road monitoring system. In the current program to pave 10,000
km of rural roads, an effective monitoring system could be set up with the following
characteristics: (i) comprise a small number of road, agriculture and social sector indicators;
(ii) arrange for each type of indicator to be collected by the respective sectoral, local-level
authority, maybe once every two or three years; (iii) integrate the collection of agricultural
and social indicators in the annual surveys carried out by these sectors; (iv) arrange for local
authorities, ideally with assistance by a university, to compile the data into a single report for
each selected road, and disseminate the report to local and central authorities
(b) Increase local community participation in rural roads through: (i) exchanges such as "village
.neetings", at the planning stage, to ensure that road plans are properly and timely taken into
account within the planning of all local-level activities, and (ii) for road maintenance, by
direct participation of local stakeholders in the funding allocation for this activity, through,
for example, the establishment of local "road boards".
(c) Consider and require if cost-effective, the introduction of mitigation measures such as
education campaigns and road signs to reduce and or prevent the likely increase in road
accidents and their consequences, resulting from the increased traffic levels and speeds when
rural roads are paved.
(d) Consider adopting identification and evaluation methodologies based on multi-criteria
indicators for rural roads that: (i) combine a minimum acceptable economic return with well
defined social sector (mainly education and health) objectives and with social sectors
investments integrated in local government budgets, or, (ii) for very low traffic levels and for
a small part of the budget for rural roads (20 percent is a good practice), apply multi-criteria
based solely on attaining social objectives represented by well-defined indicators.
(e) Reassess the optimal pavement width for rural roads and compare with rehabilitation to
gravel surface maintained in good standards. The very latest version of the Bank's Highway
Design Model (HDM) model allows to conduct this kind of analysis.

1.   The Project and the Socioeconomic Setting
Despite sustained urbanization through the 1980s and 1990s, about 50 percent of Morocco's
population remains rural. Rural inhabitants have eceived less benefits from the country's
economic growth over the last decade than urban dwellers. A result is that over 70 percent of all
poor live in rural areas. The government, through investments in rural roads, combined with
other infrastructure and social programs, is making efforts to improve the lot of the rural
population. A new plan of road investments for the period 1996-2000 aims to improve or pave
10,000 kilometers of rural roads. This report, by examining the medium-term results of a rural
road component included in a larger road project financed by the Bank in the mid-1980s, seeks
to understand the impacts that emanate from improving rural roads, and how they filter beyond
the physical investment to the agricultutal economy and the social sectors. The intention is to
derive lessons that can help Morocco and other countries better assess the value of investing in
rural roads.
1.1    Morocco is situated on the extreme Northwestern corner of Africa, with a land mass
exceeding 700,000 square kilometers, and combined Atlantic-Mediterranean coast lines which
total almost 3,500 km in length. In 1995, the population is estimated to have reached 28 million
inhabitants, of which and over 50% live in urban areas. Per capita income is estimated at
approximately US$1,200.
1.2   Since its independence in 1956, Morocco has, as a response to climatic uncertainty,
placed significant priority on the development of irrigated agriculture, and has invested
substantial resources in an ambitious dam construction program and improving performance in
the industrial crops sector, especially sugar, vegetable oil, cereals, dairy, and livestock. In
addition to its commitment to food self-sufficiency, Morocco devotes substantial resources to the
mineral industry and is the world leader in phosphate exports (13 million tons annually). Despite
these efforts, Morocco's commercial deficit has continued to widen and reached 29 million Dh in
1994.
1.3    Beginning in the 1980's, Morocco undertook impressive steps to implement a World
Bank-IMF coordinated program of structural adjustment. The main objectives of this effort, now
largely implemented, included reducing the gap between the demand and supply of goods and
services, decreasing the budget deficit, and encouraging exports. The central government
committed itself to a greater delegation of activities from the public to the private sector and
decentralization of responsibility to local government. At the same time as it addressed
fundamental macro-economic reforms, Morocco pursued broad programs designed to improve
socioeconomic welfare in rural areas.
1.4   For administrative purposes, Morocco is divided into 7 regions and 43 provinces. The
present study concerns three different regions: the North-West Region, the Center Region, and
the Tensif Region, located in the central-southern part of the country.
Fourth Highway Project: Rural Roads Component
1.5    Concern for improving rural roads dates from the mid-1970's when Morocco's Ministry
of Public Works commissioned a study to identify 8,000 km of rural roads in need of
construction and/or upgrading. These efforts were reflected in the preparation of the 198 1-1985
Development Plan. A key objective of this plan was to "...improve and expand the provincial



10
road network to help alleviate rural poverty". The Government and the World Bank agreed to
include in the Fourth Highway project, besides improvements in the national highway system
and construction of the Rabat-Casablanca freeway, a major investment in secondary and tertiary
rural roads. An important aim of the Fourth Project to be attained through the rural roads it
helped finance was to"...to help reduce income disparities between regions".
1.6    The Fourth Roads Project contained a specific study designed to develop a methodology
to measure the impact on agriculture of provincial (rural) road improvements. It was expected
that such methodology could later help improve the methods used to identify rural roads with the
greatest potential for agricultural and socioeconomic impact. The consultant's report (1989)
recommended the establishment of a system for monitoring the impact of rural roads, and
included some 40 indicators covering different aspects. The system was, however, not
implemented, as government authorities had strong doubts that the cost of setting up and
maintaining such monitoring system would bring commensurate benefits.
1.7    The government recently established a 5-year program (1996-2000) with a target to
improve and pave 10,000 km of rural roads. An on-going World Bank highway project is
expected to help finance 1,000 km under this program. The Direction des Routes has undertaken
to screen, identify and evaluate such routes, and is interested in designing a cost-effective system
for monitoring rural roads. The present study will provide timely inputs to that effort.

2.  Study Methodology
This study assesses the impact ofpaving and other improvements to four rural roads located in
three different regions of Morocco: North, Center and Tensift (Center-South). As a starting
point, the studyformulatedfour sets of hypotheses about the impacts of the road improvements:
(i) direct impact on transport infrastructure and services; (ii) improvements in the agricultural
economy; (iii) impacts on the social sectors such as health and education; and (iv) impact on the
environment.
To test these hypotheses, this study utilized two types of analyses: first, for each of the roads
considered, a comparison of current conditions with those before the investments, and, second, a
comparison of conditions in the project road relative to a control road which did not benefit
from improvements over the period of the study. Extensive surveys conducted at the farm,
regional and village levels allowed the collection of the data requiredfor this analysis, and
focus groups discussions at these levels helped interpret the data
Hypotheses for Testing
2.1    A starting point for the design of the study was the development of hypotheses on the
socioeconomic impact of rural roads. Such approach is a standard procedure in OED's
infrastructure impact studies. The formulation of relevant hypotheses was based on the direct
experience of OED staff and consultants on rural road projects, and on the review of literature
(e.g., World Bank appraisal reports of rural road projects and relevant OED audit reports as well
as studies prepared by the United States Agency for International Development and the Inter-
American Development Bank). The range of impacts of transport investments is best described
by the quotation below, which served as a framework for the formulation of the study
hypotheses.
"Transport plays a key role in getting land into production, in marketing agricultural commodities,
and in making forest and mineral wealth accessible. It is a significantfactor in the development of
industry, in the expansion of trade, in the conduct of health and education programs, and in the
exchange of ideas"'.
2.2    The study team developed four categories of hypotheses:
1. hypotheses dealing with the direct impact on the quality of the roads, and their related
effects on traffic level and composition and on the road services offered;
2. hypotheses dealing with improvements in the agricultural economy in zones benefiting
from project road construction;
3. hypotheses dealing with improvements of socio-economic indicators (as measured at the
farm, village and regional levels); and
4. hypotheses dealing with the impact of project road construction on the environment.
2.3    These hypotheses and the associated socio-economic indicators developed by the study
team to test the validity of each of the hypotheses are further detailed in Annex A, as well as in
the respective chapters of this report.

Selection of Project and Control Roads
2.4   In order to measure changes in socio-economic indicators, the study team selected a
sample comprising four of the ten roads which had received funding under the Fourth Roads
Project. The four roads, one in the North (North-West Region, Larache/Chefchaouen areas), one
in the Center (Central Region, Settat area), and two in the Tensift Region (Marrakech/Chichaoua
areas in Morocco's central-southem area) were chosen to maximize diversity in agro-climatic
zone, economic character of the zone, and function of the road. To simplify the presentation in
this report, these areas are labeled as North, Center and South.
2.5    During the preparation and appraisal of the Fourth Project, Moroccan officials and
consultants had seiected a control road for each of the roads targeted for improvement. In its
review of these potential control roads, the study team, OED and Directorate of Road and Road
Traffic staff reviewed the appropriateness of retaining the corresponding control roads for the
four roads selected for this study. For three of the four control roads, it was determined that the
initial selections could no longer serve effectively as control roads. In these cases, the control
roads themselves had undergone improvement since the beginning of the project or were so
different in character (e.g., transit or local function; type of terrain; agro-climatic conditions) that
before-after comparisons would be meaningless. Table 2.1 summarizes the project and control
roads ultimately used in this study.

Characteristics of the Roads (Map IBRD 27809)
2.6    North: Route RS 603, located approximately 200 km Northwest of Rabat, cuts across
the Larache and Chefchaouen provincial boundary (with the majority of the 95 km road in
Larache province), serving as a link road between two rural towns, Ksar-el-Kebir and Derdara.
Improvement works began in 1987 along kilometers 1-30 and 43-60. The section kilometers 30-
43 was completed in 1991. For most of its length, the road is 4 meters in width, except for the
first 13.5 kilometers, where its width is 5.5 meters. The zone of influence is characterized by
higher than normal rainfall (over 800 mm), steep slopes along the Rif mountain range, high rates
of erosion, with agriculture as the dominant economic activity.
2.7   Instead of maintaining CT 8305 as a control, a road which had experienced improvement
along 10 kilometers did not serve a similar link function, and traversed significantly different
type terrain and agro-climates, the team selected an alternative control road, CT 8203, which

remained an unimproved track but did serve a similar link function and traversed similar terrain
and agro-climates.
2.8    Center: Road CT 1427 in Settat province directly South of Casablanca, also serves a link
function, joining El Bourouj and Oued Zem along a 30 km distance. The 36 km control road CT
1411, which links Dar Chaffai with Guisser, has remained in an unimproved state ("etat de
piste") and traverses similar terrain and agro-climate as CT 1427 and, as a result, was maintained
for the analysis.
2.9    The zone of influence of CT 1427 is dramatically different from that of RS 603 in
Chefchaouen, with poor agricultural resources (land, surface water), and limited rainfall (less
than 300 mm yearly). The major agricultural activity of the resident population revolves around
extensive sheep grazing. The major economic activity in the region is centered in mining,
primarily phosphates. As a result, the economic character of the zone has evolved much more
towards commerce and merchandise exchange rather than agricultural forms of activity.
2.10   South: In the Tensift region South of Casablanca, two roads were selected, CT 6307 in
the Haouz province, linking Amizmiz to Adassil along a length of 42 kilometers of which 13.4
kilometers were improved during the Fourth Roads Project (to a 4 meter width), and CT 6308, in
the Chichaoua province, a 13.4 kilometer road (width of 4 meters) which provides access to the
population of Eborg. As in Settat Province, the agricultural economy does not benefit from
favorable land and water resources. Because there are few alternatives to agricultural economic
activity, there is a greater emphasis than in Settat on dryland cereals, particularly barley and
dairy production.
2.11   The roads selected in 1984 as control roads for CT's 6307 and 6308 experienced
improvement in the intervening year. Instead the team selected CT's 6029, linking Tnine
Oudaya to Moulay Brahim along a length of 43 kms. and CT 6457B, an access road linking Souk
el Had with Mejjat along a length of 15 kms. Both these roads remained in an unimproved state
at the time of this study.
Comparisons Between Project and Control Zones and Over Time
2.12   Several factors call for caution in the comparison of impact results between the control
and the project zones:
a) The concept of control. The study team put special emphasis to select control roads
which had not been the subject of improvements during the project period, and which
were geographically near the project road. The control roads thus selected best
simulated the "without project" situation to assess the net impact of the investment.
b) Baseline data. While an intention existed at the start of the project to collect baseline
data, and most of such data was defined, in practice no data was collected, neither in the
project roads nor in the originaf control zones. Thus, in order to recreate baseline data,
retrospective questions were included in surveys. However, the recall ability, 10 years



15
later, may be highly unreliable for some indicators, for example, those requiring a
quantitative assessment, such as visits to health services by members of a household.
Other indicators, especially those pertaining to benchmark events of an either/or type
(e.g., whether a particular type of service was available or not at the time, or whether a
facility existed or not), may be recalled with a higher level of precision.
c) A study limitation is that since comparison roads were judgmentally selected at the end
of the proje~ct because they had no improvements over the study period, we cannot
definitively attribute changes in the communities studied to road improvements. The
communities near improved roads may have been systematically different from those in
areas where the roads were not improved. For example, communities near improved
roads may have been targeted for other improvements. In addition, the sample is not
generalizable. We believe, however, that viewed as case studies, the four improved
roads and the four unimproved roads offer useful illustrations of some of the impacts of
road improvements.
2.13   Since, as suggested above, the reliability of 1995 data is higher than that for 1985, this
report gives priority in the analysis of impacts to comparisons between project and control in
1995, with references to 1985 generally used in a second order.
2.14   In addition to the comparison of the project with the control zones, information is
provided about national trends in the areas where the impacts were assessed (Annex B). This
information is limited due to the scarcity of time series covering the whole period under study, as
a number of national statistics were either staited or discontinued during this period. In
particular, it was not possible to prepare regional trends in the project's areas relevant to the type
of impacts to be measured; such trends would have provided an additional basis to clarify the
attribution of impacts in relation to the road improvenments.
2.15   A last caveat refers to the weather, and its influence on agricultural and socio-economic
conditions. During the 10-year period under study, Morocco experienced periods of drought,
when traditional agricultural production, notable cereals, fell sharply. The latest agricultural
statistics, which were used in thiz report, were for the year 1993/1994, a year when rainfall was
above normal. Thus, comparison of agricultural output with earlier years is somewhat distorted.
However, for other aspects of the agricultural economy, as well as for other socio-economic
impacts, rainfall conditions are immaterial to the analysis.
Other Methodological Aspects
2.16   The design of the questionnaire, the selection of the survey sample (at village, household
and farm levels), the study launch workshop, and data collection and analysis are described in
Annex C. Aggregated survey results by region are presented in Annex D.
2.17   In preparing the survey, a special effort was made to generate information that would
allow to isolate the impact on gender. Also, the household data was stratified by farm size, as it
was anticipated that this variable could be a significant determinant of some impacts.
2.18   One study limitation is that, while it was a stated objective of the project to reduce local
income disparities, the causal links between traffic changes and incomes could not be firmed up



16
because the roads sample is small and there are many factors exogenous to road improvements
which must be controlled for.
I.19   Finally, another important limitation is acknowledged: in selecting unimproved roads as
controls, the methodology focuses on the impact of road improvement but not on the question of
whether and to what extent achieving this improvement with Bank's help, rather than without it,
makes a difference. Thus, the sutdy answers important questions about the nature, magnitude
and sustainability of impacts from one project in the Bank portfolio; but, it cannot answer
questions abcut the effectiveness of the Bank's intervention relative to other ones.

3.  Impact on Transport Infrastructure and Services
Alifour roads studied were improved from an originally deteriorated gravel or unengineered
track condition to an asphalt surface. The most direct impact was year-round operation of the
roads, eliminating frequent road closures during rainy periods. The road users benefited in
other ways: as a result of the better road surface, cost of operating vehicles dropped, leading to
lower prices for freight and passengers than those on roads that were not improved. Traffic on
project roads increased at rates higher than before the imnprovement, and comprised a bigger
proportion of larger, more efficient trucks. The supply of road passenger services increased
substantially, especially share-ride taxis offering frequent service, whereas in the past the only
service was a rural bus offering as little as one service run a day. Ownership of motorized
vehicles increased, both of cars and trucks. The access time by the rural population to markets
and social services was drastically cut; in some cases, such as access to county and village
administrative offices, to agricultural extension personnel, to health centers and to rural
markets, the time to reach these services was reduced by at least 50 percent. This improvement
was the result of both better roads and new facilites, whose construction was made possible in
part by the roads.
Rationale for the Impact
3.1    The project was intended to have a direct impact on the quality of road conditions. This
was expected to reduce the operating costs of vehicles, to allow motorized and larger vehicles to
operate at all times, and to make road maintenance easier. In turn, such effects could be
expected to stimulate the provision of more commercial transport services to the project's areas,
and in some cases, the improved roads could become alternative routes for use by long-distance
traffic. A complementary effect expected was improved access by the population to markets and
social services reducing time and costs, and ensuring access under all weather conditions.
Key Features of Morocco's Road Transport System'
3.2    Morocco's road system comprises about 58,000 km of classified roads, of which about
28,000 are paved. The quality of the network is uneven, notably regarding pavement width: in
only 1,500 km do pavement widths exceed seven meters, or the equivalent of two conventional
lanes; in 16,000 km, the width is 6 meters or less, and in 20 percent of the network, the paved
width is 4 meters (barely more than one conventional 3.5 meter lane) or less. In addition, there
are some 30,000 km of unpaved, mostly rural roads.
3.3   Inter-urban bus and truck services are operated mainly by private companies and
cooperatives. About one third of road freight is carried in small trucks (less than 8 ton net
weight), which operate mostly in the rural areas, although these trucks also do substantial long-
distance hauls. Inter-urban road passenger services is mainly by large buses, but collective, large
taxis (mostly diesel-powered Mercedes) have become increasingly popular in the last year;
nationally, taxis account for some 15 percent of the passengers carried. However, in many rural
areas, such taxis are the prevailing mode of transport.

3.4    Overall, road conditions at the time of project appraisal in 1982 were characterized by
low levels of traffic, poor road surface and periods of road closure, as described in Table 3.1.

Main Findings
3.5    All four roads were improved to an asphalt surface. The improvements were completed
in the following dates: route 603 in 1987, route 1427 in 1988 and routes 6307 and 6308 in 1991.
Traffic on all roads increased substantially after construction, although there were significant
differences in the growth rates among the roads (Table 3.2). The better road surface, and
improvements in road alignments, substantially reduced the cost of operating vehicles; at the
same time, road closures were practically eliminated.
3.6   In 1995, road conditions were as follows:

Traffic: National Trends
3.7    Road transport in Morocco measured in vehicle-kilometers over the network has grown
at an average 4.4 percent per year since 1982 through today. Growth accelerated to over eight
percent since the later years of the 1980s. This growth was mostly due to an increase in the
vehicle fleet and to more intensive utilization of vehicles. The road network itself grew little:
during the 10-year period 1984-1994, the length of the overall road network increased by only 10
percent (or less than one percent per year on average). The highest expansion in the length of the
network, percentage-wise, at 13 percent, occurred in the tertiary network, which comprises most
rural roads and which carry low traffic (Annex B).

Traffic: Project Roads
3.8    North: Chefchaouen - Route 603. As noted above, the roads studied in this report
experienced different rates of traffic growth. The most striking case is Route 603, where traffic
grew at an average annual rate almost five times as big as that of the national network as a whole
over the same period. This high growth is explained by the location and role of this route. It
connects two major population centers, Ksar-el-Kebir and Chefchaouen; in addition, the
improved road became an attractive route to two other major centers in the area of Ksar-el-Kebir,
I arache to the North and Souk-el-Arba-du-Rharb to the South. Prior to the improvement of
route 603, its poor condition required drivers to use an alternative route (Provincial Road 28),
south of route 603. In some cases, this practically doubled the distance: for example, Ksar-el-
Kebir to Cliefchaouen is 86 km via route 603, 150 km via PR 28. Thus, after the improvement,
Route 603 ceased to be purely a rural road, and became an important road for long-distance
travel (see map in next page).
3.9    Centcr: Settat - Route 1427. Traffic grew at about the average for the national network.
This .oute is located in an area with a higher road density network than route 603, and this is
partly the reason why this road generated a lower traffic increase than the Northern project road.
However, since 1982 to 1987, year when the improvements were completed, traffic growth on
the unpaved road is likely to have been in the order of two percent per year. This indicates that
since completion of the improvements, traffic growth accelerated.
3.10   South: Marrakech - Routes 6307/6308. Traffic increased at a high rate on this road,
mainly because of its poor condition prior to the improvement, and because after the
improvement the road took a transit function for long-distance traffic which was not originally
foreseen.
3.11   Traffic composition. In addition to increases in traffic levels, the composition of traffic
changed, as expected, as the improved roads allowed heavier freight vehicles to circulate. The
percentage of large trucks on these roads in 1995 ranged between 10 and 13 (compared to
between 0 and 2 percent in 1985); for rural roads, this is a high percentage (Table 3.3). It is also
high for rural roads when compared to the average percentage of trucks (13%) for 41 national
and secondary routes surveyed by the MPW in 1994.

Transport Costs and Services
3.12   The improvement in the roads resulted in a significant reduction in the cost of operating
vehicles (see Chapter 7). In some cases, such drop in operating costs was reflected in lower
transport rates offered by commercial trucking services. For example, data from a focus group



20
for routes 6307/6308 indicates that the rate for a truckload of merchandise between two
population centers some 10 km apart (between Amizmis and one of the "douars" 5of the Assif Al
Mal county) went down from 300 Dh before the project to less than 150 Dh once the road was
improved. 1n some cases, the reduction in the price of transport services paid by the local
population was purely due to the better surface condition, which resulted on lower operating
costs of the vehicle circulating on them. In other cases, such as the case of Chefchaouen
mentioned above, transport prices decreased for many road users because a new road alternative
became attractive that was substantially shorter in distance than the altemative existing road.
3.13   Another benefit was an increase in the quality and frequency of commercial transport
services. For example, focus groups reported that on routes 6307/6308, prior to the improvement
of the road the only passenger service was a daily run of a rural bus. Today, a fleet of some 40
collective taxis serve these roads, with a frequency of several taxis per hour.
3.14   Survey data also revealed that annual transport costs per unit of cultivated area
(expressed in current Dh) of farming inputs (fertilizers, herbicides, seeds) decreased drastically
in the project area of Chefchaouen province (no information is available for the other two
provinces) compared to the control areas. The annual transport cost of agricultural products to
markets decreased in both the project and the control areas between 1985 and 1995, but the gains
are substantially greater in the project than in the control areas (Figure 3.1).
Motorization
3.15   Overall, ownership of motor vehicles in the project zones increased. Ownership of cars
increased about 3 times, reaching in 1995 one car per every 10 farms, compared to one car per
every 30 farms in the control zone. Regionally, the largest increase happened in Settat, where
many Moroccans residing in Europe bring cars on their visits home. Ownership of trucks
followed a similar pattern, increasing in the project areas by about three fold, to reach in 1995
one truck for every 11 farms, compared to no change in the control zones, where truck ownership
remained close to zero.
5In Morocco's regional administrative system, the "douar" is the lowest level unit in the rural areas. A douar generally comprises
anywhere upwards of some 50 agricultural units.

Improved Access to Markrets and Services
3 .16   Surveys and focus groups reported a substantial reduction in the time required to access
markets and services resulting from a combination of effects of the improved roads: higher
frequency of road transport services, improvements in the quality of transport mean (from
wvalking or animal-drawn cart to motorized vehicle), and establishment of new facilities
(markets, school, health centers) triggered by the improved roads. Data for the control zone was
not as complete; available information showed that gains were also achieved in these zones,
mainly by the establishment of new facilities, but gains were generally smaller than in the project
zones.

Household Transport Expenditures
3.18   Household transport expenditures over the I 0-year period to 1995 increased (in current
Dh) both in the project and in the control zones, but substantially more in control (188%) than in
the project zones, despite the fact that annual household expenditures overall increased more in
project (148 percent) than in the control (87 percent) zones. At the same time, as noted later in
this report, improvements in the agricultural economy and in social indicators were also better in
the project zones. Generally, higher household expenditures and better overall social welfare
lead to higher transport expenditures, but this did not happen. A likely reason is that
improvement of the roads did cause transport prices, in current terms, to increase less in the
project zones than in the control zones, even as the quality and frequency of road transport
services improved more in the project zones.

4.  Impact on Agriculture
The studyfound that overall levels of agricultural activity increased in volume ofproduction,
productivity of the land, and monetary values of the output. The agricultural production mix was
transformed, as farmers shifted land use from low value cereals to high value fruit orchards,
which yield higher profits, thanks to the reduction in perishability risks brought about by the
better quality and year-round operability of the improved roads. In two of the three study
regions, land usedfor vegetables andfruits increased over 40 percent. Livestock production
shifted towards pure breed cows, following the trend toward more profitable investments. The
use of modern agriculural inputs, especiallyfertilizers, increased as improved transport made
distribution channels better. Use of agricultural extension services by smallfarms increased by
more than four times over the study period. The shift to higher value products, combined with
improved yields for traditional crops, raised the value added per unit of cultivated land.
Improvements in the agricultural economy led to related economic changes in workloads,
employment in farms and establishment of new shops; these changes followed different patterns
depending on the region. Off-farm employment grew overall by more than six times in the
project zones (compared to about three times in the control zones) and happened across all three
regions. The study found that agricultural practices in the control zones, which did not benefit
from improved roads, remain essentially the same as a decade ago.
Rationale for the Impact
4.1    The road improvements, especially their projected year-round use operability and
substantially lower costs of operating freight and passenger vehicles, were expected to benefit
the agriculture economy in the projects' area through higher farm-gate prices; lower costs of
delivering productive inputs (fertilizers, insecticides, seeds, etc.); cheaper and more reliable
availability of trucking services and, better accessibility to agriculture extension services. In
turn, these effects were expected to lead to transformation of the agricultural output mix towards
higher-value but perishable produce and to increases in the amount of planted area.
Key Features of the Sector6
4.2    Despite a high growth rate of urbanizaton during the 80s of about 4.8 percent per year
the rural population in Morocco remains high, close to 50%,. Over 70% of all poor live in rural
areas. Currently, agriculture contributes close to one quarter of the GDP, 40 percent of the
employment, and 30 percent of the exports. Thus, agriculture is a vital sector, both from the
social and the economic viewpoints.
4.3    Most agricultural lands are rainfed. Irrigated areas are only some 12 percent of total
cultivable land. It is estimated that the potential for further expanding irrigation is limited,
probably no more than by 20 percent of the existing irrigated areas. The potential for extensive
agriculture is practically nil, as already lands of marginal value for agriculture are being
cultivated. Thus, increasing the efficiency in the use of land is essential for the development of
Moroccan agriculture.

Main Findings
4.4     The roads opened between 1987 and 1991. The latest agricultural data available is from
surveys done in 1995. Data prior to road opening was obtained for 1985. Information collected
for these two years' reveals significant changes over the 10-year period, in the areas where the
roads were improved. The latest completed agricultural year at the time of the survey was 1993-
1994, when there was above-normal rainfall, and thus higher than average agricultural output,
especially for grains.
4.5     The overall level of agricultural activity increased (Figure 4.1). Yields for the main
crops increased in all three project zones. The most notable increase happened in fruit orchards,
which, on average for the three zones, passed from 13.3 qx per hectare in 1985 to 17.4 qx per
hectare in 1995, or a 31 percent increase during the period. These increases can be traced to
improved seeds that require irrigation, and which the roads, that became passable practically
year-round once the works were completed, made possible; the improved roads encouraged
farmers to invest in on-farm irrigation, such as wells and pumps. Cereals yields also increased
significantly, but such improvements are more difficult to attribute to changed economic
conditions in the project zones, since cereal yields were influenced by the above average rainfall
in 1993-1994.

7Based on agricultural statistics and survey data.
' It was not possible to obtain agricultural data at the ioad project level for earlier years, which would have permitted
to calculate more normal values (e.g, three year averages) of productior levels. However, the comparisons with the
control zones allow to take this factor into account.



25
4.6    The agriculture production mix was substantially transformed (Figure 4.2). This was
due mainly to an overall decrease in the land made available for low value agriculture, especially
cereals and livestock production, combined with increased land available for the cultivation of
high-value irrigated vegetables and fruits. The amount of land used for fruit plantation increased
in all three zones: eight percent in Marrakech, and 42 percent in Chefchaouen and in Settat.
Land used for high-value vegetables increased in Settat and Marrakech; however, it decreased in
Chefchaouen mainly due to a shift to industrial sugar beet production, which also generated
higher incomes for the farmers (Box 4. 1).

Box 4.1. Introduction of New Crops
Cult.vation of sugar beets in Chefchaouen is an example of the influence of improved roads on
the introduction of new crops. Planting of sugar beets was introduced in the region during
construction of a dam and putting in place an irrigation system in the Loukos area. However,
collecting and distributing the crops was expensive and risky in view of the poor condition of the
roads. Near the village of Tatouft, only 4 farmers produced sugar beets in 1985. As route 603
was improved, 90 percent of the farmers located close to the road (about 150 farmers) were
producing sugar beet in 1995. Cultivation of sugar beet and other industrial crops, while
yielding higher profits for the farmers, are intensive in labor use, and generated substantial on-
fzrm employment.
4.7    The transformation of the agricultural economy followed the well known Von Thunen
model (Figure 4.3). In this model, the "economic" distance to market is reduced as roads are
improved, encouraging farmers to substitute grains by vegetables, which yield higher profits but
due to their perishability require reliable and speedy transport.

4.8     Use of modern inputs increased. This was a key factor in the improvements in the
agriculture economy in the project areas. In particular, the use of fertilizers doubled in
Chefchaouen and increased by 60 percent in Settat. Overall, Chefchaouen experienced large
increases in the use of other inputs such as improved seeds and herbicides, whereas Settat had
the largest gains in equipment (tractors, covercrops, trucks).
4.9     Use of agricultural extension services increased  This happened especially in the small
farms, where yearly contacts with extension centers went up from less than one before the road
improvements to more than four after such improvements, while the corresponding increase in
the control zones was from 0.5 to 1.5. Such gains in the use of extension services happened
across all three project zones considered in this study. The gains in the larger farms, which had
more in-house know-how, were substantially smaller than gains in small farms (about 150
percent). In fact, gains were lower in large farms in the project areas than those registered by
large farms in the control zones (450 percent). This finding is consistent with that related to the
gains made by the small and medium farms, but not the large farms, in the use of modern inputs.
4.10    Transformation in livestock production. Investments decreased in every class of
livestock except improved breeds (imported pure breeds or hybrids). Across all regions, farmers
reported that they reduced the numbers of all types of local beef/dairy, sheep and goat herds
(with the exception of a small increase in goat herding in Marrakech). Local beef production
decreased steeply, ranging from a 22% drop in Chefchaouen to a 42% drop in Marrakech. On
the other hand, investment in pure breed cows increased by about 150% in the project areas,
reflecting the shift to investments that could generate higher profits. By comparison, the
number of pure breed cows in the control zones also increased, but by only 50% over the period.

4.11   The value added per hectare increased (Figure 4.4). As a result of increases in yields,
and transformation of the agricultural and livestock output mix, farmers derived a substantial
gain in value added per hectare. The net agricultural value added per unit area of production,
increased in each one of three project zones: 46 percent in Chefchaouen, 36 percent in Settat and
261 percent in Marrakech. Details of value added analysis are in Annex E.

4.12   The surveys and the time-series data neither corroborated nor negated the hypothesis that
the total planted area would increase as a result of the better roads and the concomitant reduction
in transport costs. Overall in Morocco, the harvested land increased by close to 25 percent
between 1985 and 1994 (Annex B).
4.13   Comparison with the Control Zones. Focus groups discussions and visits by study
members familiar with the control zones reported that agricultural practices remain generally
similar to those employed a decade earlier. The lack of modernization is widely explained by the
lack of transport access to markets where improved inputs can be purchased and where
agricultural surplus can be marketed. The differences (crop development, land under cultivation,
on-farm water management) between the project zones served by paved roads and the control
zones served by tracks are dramatically visible. For example, in both Marrakech and Settat
control zones, there has been little or no introduction of improved livestock varieties, high-value
vegetables, or tree cropping. Even in the cases where there has been limited introduction of
livestock, the dairy productivity (1,200 liters/animal per year) is significantly lower than the
rates achieved in the project zone (2,500 liters/animal per year). In the control zones, more than
90 percent of the available agricultural land is taken up with relatively low value cereal
cultivation.
Other Related Economic Impacts
4.14   Workload and Employment. The main finding is that the number of days worked outside
the farm by members of the farm household increased between 1985 and 1995 in both the project
and the control zones. The number of days increased 6 times in the project zones, compared to
about 3 times in the control zones. Most of the increase occurred for men, although more
women go to work today outside the farm in the project zone (average of three) than in 1985
(average of 0.15). Large farms, that invested heavily in equipment following the road
improvements and reduced labor requirements, showed the largest gains in outside employment



28
when compared to the control zones. While the increase of off-farm employment in all zones
reflects the increasing integration of the rural with the urban economies, the substantially higher
gains in the project zones can be attributed to two effects of the road improvements: i) a direct
effect, resulting from a drastic drop in access costs from farms to outside employment, as the
improved roads reduced transport costs, and ii) an indirect effect, stemming from the higher
modernization in the management of the farms on the projects' zones, which released household
labor for outside employment.
4.15   On-farm employment, that is, people hired from outside the farm households to work on
the farms, followed a different pattern. It showed a decrease in the project zones (by 7% on the
aggregate for all three regions), while remaining practically constant in the control zones.
Overall, the findings on household workload, on-farm and off-farm employment appear
internally consistent and coherent with other findings related to the modernization of agricultural
work in the project zones. Chapter 5 discusses the impact of the changing demand on women.
4.16   Establishment of New Shops. The study showed no clear overall impact when all three
regions are considered. However, there was a marked rise in Settat, where the number of shops
in the project area increased from one in 1985 to 10 in 1995, while the corresponding increase in
the control zone was from 2 to 6. The most striking gain in commercial activity in this zone is
the rise in the number of kiosks ('tentes') in the weekly market (souk), that went up from 10 in
1985 to more than 500 now. Another indicator is the increase in the number of basic food stores
('epiceries') in villages, as 20 such shops were established in Larbaa, and five in Lamazia. The
increase in shop activity in this region, compared to the other two in the study, can be attributed
to the lesser agricultural possibilities in Settat, which led to relatively higher shop activity. The
finding on the increase in number of shops and kiosks in the market is corroborated by data
provided by focus groups discussions, which reported that tax revenues from commercial activity
went up from 1,500 Dh in 1985 to 10,000 Dh in 1995 (equivalent to about 7,000 Dh in constant
1985 prices).
Lox 4 Interview with a New Shop Owner on Road 603, Province of Chefchaouen
A small cafe and grocery store was recently built along the road. The owner, third son of a
nearby farmer, had seized the opportunity to build this cafe and derived his income from it. He
is 27 years old and still a bachelor. When we visited him, it was about 4 p.m.; the little cafe was
full of young men. The grocery store was filled with items such as sugar, flour, coffee, tea and
some fruit and vegetables. A television in the cafe was broadcasting the local news to which
some clients listened while others played cards or discussed village events. The owner told us
that he had built this facility alonig the road once the road was rehabilitated, and that he was
better off working in the cafe/grocery store than working in his father's farm. The cafe was a
kind of gathering place for these young men who before had nowhere to go as their farm was too
isolated. (Reported by study team members, Voyadzis and Benaziz).

5.    Impact on Social Services
The surveys conducted by the study showed that while enrollment in primary education increased
throughout all areas covered by the study, the gains in the areas served by the project roads
where enrollment more than doubled between 1985 and 1995, was much higher than in the
control roads. In parallel, the quality of education improved, as it became possible to recruit
teachers to staff the schools, and absenteeism of both teachers and students dropped. The rural
population also nearly doubled their use of health care services (hospital andprimare care),
and, similarly to education, the quality of health services was enhanced as the supply of
medicine improved, health officials launched a campaign to staff rural health care centers with
a doctor, and immunizaton and other health prevention programs became easier to implement.
Women benefitted greatlyfrom the project roads: girls' enrollment in primary education trebled
over the period; expanded or new maternal ai,d child care programs were made available and
accessible, and the introduction of butane at affordable prices, thanks to the existence ofpaved
roads, dramatically reduced women's chores of daily collection offuelwoodfor cooking and
heating. Rural-urban interaction increased Feveral-fold in the two directions, urban dwellers
visiting their rural relatives, andfarm household members visiting cities.
Rationale for the Impact
5.1    The improvement of the roads was expected to facilitate access by the population to
existing services, notably education and health, and to encourage the government and local
authorities to establish new facilities in those areas. A direct effect was expected to be the
increased enrollment in primarv schools and visits to health facilities, with consequent
improvements in education and health indicators.
Accessibility to Social Services
5.2    Access to social services is inadequate in rural Morocco. Accessibility is worse in the
more isolated areas, due both to scarce social services facilities and to deficient transport
infrastructure and services to reach them. Comprehensive, long-term plans for the social welfare
of the country were inexistent since social concerns were not a top priority in Morocco".
Spending to promote human capital was not considered an investment that would ultimately lead
to greater and more sustainable economic growth. It was only in 1993 that the Government
issued the Social Development Strategy to extend basic social services to the poor and increase
their participation in economically productive activities.
Education
Key Features of the Sector
5.3   In recent years, Morocco has made a great effort to improve education. Its budget for
the sector is about one fifth of the central government's budget and over five percent of the GDP.
Substantial progress has been made in improving enrollment in secondary and higher education,
which has grown at annual rates of 4.3 and 9.1 percent, respectively. However, it has been more

difficult to achieve results in primary education; enrollment rates following an economic
recession actually declined between 1983 and 1988, and did not recover its previous level until
1991.
5.4    The current situation is defined by the following indicators. Illiteracy is 58 percent, and
it is substantially worse in the rural areas, where it reaches 77 percent (37 percent in the urban
areas). In the countryside, schools are in short supply and those that exist are poorly equipped,
making it difficult to attract teachers. About 56 percent of the communities have a primary
school, and only 3 percent have access to a paved road." School attendance rates in the rural
areas are low: 48 percent overall, 64 percent for boys and 32 percent for girls. Important causes
for this are on the demand side: parental attitudes (particularly illiteracy of mothers), and the
opportunity costs of sending children to school, as many of the rural poor cannot afford to forego
children's labor or earnings. On the supply side, causes range from reasonable and accessible
school facilities to provision of meals.
Main Findings
5.5    Improvement in Primary School Enrollment Rates. This was the main impact of the road
improvements on education. In all three areas combined, primary school enrollment rates in
1995 reached a high level, for rural areas, of 68 percent. This compares to 51 percent in the
control zones. Relative to 1985, enrollment rates in the project zones more than doubled from
the initial level of 28 percent. While enrollment in the control zones also improved over the
period, the rate of improvement was lower.
5.6    There are substantial regional differences in the absolute enrollment levels reached, and
in the gains in the period (Table 5.1). The highest enrollment rate was for boys in Settat,
reaching 85 percent in 1995. The highest enrollment rate for girls was also attained in Settat,
with a high 67 percent in 1995. The highest gain was for girls in Chefchaouen, where enrollment
rates increased from 10 percent in 1985 to 38 percent in 1995.
5.7    Girls' gains. As shown in Table 5.1, girls achieved the biggest gains in enrollment in
primary school, which reached 54 percent in 1995, more than three times the level in 1985; there
is insufficient information about the control zones. More details on the impact on girls'
education are given later in this chapter.

5.8    Impact on the Quality of Education. In addition to gains in enrollment, the improved
roads had other effects, some directly related to the increased enrollment, some related to
improvements in the quality of the schools and of education. Focus groups discussions revealed
that:
a)  absenteeism of both teachers and students dropped as road closures were eliminated,
with beneficial effects on education quality and outcomes;
b) the number of primary schools and satellite classes"2 increased (Table 5.2), as existence
of a paved road is, according to community officials, a key planning criterion for the
construction of primary schools in rural areas (construction of these facilities is decided
and financed by the local governments but funding for their operation is provided by the
central government, seepara. 5.9);
c)  recruitment of teachers became easier, as better roads made them willing to settle in
villages nearby or at the school (especially in the isolated satellite classes);
d)  supply of materials improved, both teaching materials and materials for the maintenance
and day-to-day operations of the school (such as potable water, often transported by the
teacher by hand-cart).
12 Under Morocco's rural, primary education system, a 'mother school' (ecole mere) is first built in a rural area. Then, to improve
coverage and accessibility, an initial satellite classroom is built for the first primary grade, located separately but under the
administrative responsibility of the mother school. Thereafter, new classrooms are added yearly to the satellite facility as the
students move to the next grade level.

5.9    The findings on the impact of improved, paved roads on education in this report
corroborate the findings of a study3 based on a comprehensive survey carried out in 1990-1991
of standard of living throughout Morocco (the Morocco Living Standards Survey, MLSS),
notably that: "The presence of a paved road increases school participation for both boys and
girls. When there is no paved road in a community, the school attendance rate is 21 percent for
rural girls and 58 percent for rural boys. In contrast, the rate increases to 48 percent for rural
girls and 76 percent for rural boys if there is a paved road in the community".
5.10   Education Infrastructure. Focus groups and key informant interviews provided
information on changes in education infrastructure before-and after-project in the various
regions (see also Table 5.2). In Chefchaouen, the number of schools and satellite classrooms
increased considerably. Schools increased fourfold in the three villages surveyed and in one of
these villages, Tatouft, a coed school was created enabling girls to attend middle school.
5.11   In Settat, before the road improvement there was only one satellite school with five
classrooms in Larbaa (which became the chef-lieu of the commune and the biggest market in the
area). Since the construction of the road, Larbaa has now three such schools with five classes.
In another village where there were no schools before, one school with two classes was created
enabling young children to go to school. Most teachers commute from the small town (El
Borouj) to the schools. The enrollment of girls still lags behind because of the traditional
reluctance to send girls to school, and the lack of a school is another constraint to girls'
education in the area.
5.12   Less information was available in Marrakech where the number of schools increased
from 4 before 1983 to 10 in 1995. For example, in the province of Chichaoua, three
municipalities along project roads did not have a primary school before road improvement; they
all have one school now.

Health
Key Features of the Sector
5.13    The limited health infrastructure and health services in the Moroccan countryside are
reflected in poor health indicators. Only 6.5 percent of rural inhabitants have medical services in
their douars, and only 27 percent have access to fixed primary care facilities. There are 100
hospitals in Morocco and all are located in urban settings. There are about 260 health centers in
urban areas versus 230 in rural areas, and some 150 dispensaries in urban areas versus 1,040 in
rural areas.'4 A rural health center serves, on average, 52,000 inhabitants and in some places up
to 180,000.
5.14    The gap in health conditions between rural and urban settings is substantial.  For
example, life expectancy for rural inhabitants is 66, where as that for urban inhabitants is 72. A
rural inhabitant is almost 25 km from facilities where a health-related consultation can be sought,
compared with less than one third that distance for an urban inhabitant. Probably as a result,
fewer than 40 percent of rural inhabitants seek treatment for illness (compared with over 60
percent of urban inhabitants), and lose some two days (about 25 percent) more of potential
income-generating activity each year due to illness.
5.15    The fertility rate in rural areas is twice that of urban areas (5.7 and 2.8, respectively), and
family planning services are beyond the reach of most women in the countryside. The maternal
mortality rate is very high: 362 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in rural areas against 284
in urban areas; the average in developed countries is less than 10 per 100,000 live births. The
infant mortality rate is estimated at 66 deaths per 1,000 live births," which compares to less than
20 in developed countries.
5.16    The public sector is the larger supplier of health care, and the Central Government
funding amounts to about one percent of GDP each year.
Main Findings
5.17    Visits to Health Facilities. As shown in Table 5.3, visits to health facilities in all three
regions combined increased. The largest gains were for visits to hospitals and health centers,
which doubled from 1985 to 1995 once the roads were improved. Improvements also happened
in the control zones, but reached lower levels than in the project zones. Nationally, admissions
to hospitals increased by about 25 percent during the period (Annex B).
5.18    Health Facilities' Staffing and Supplies. Focus groups revealed improvements in health
facilities and services before and after the project:
a) In the Chefchaouen area, the health centers existing at the three main population centers
(Tatoufet, Souk El Kolla and Tanakoub) had neither permanent professional personnel
nor equipment and supplies. Today, each center is staffed by a medical doctor and two
14 Health centers (centre' de sante) are defined as health establishments with at least one physician. Health centers offer mainly out-
patient services. Dispensaries (dispensaires) are defined as establishments offering out-patient health services and staffed by nurses
and other para-medical staff (but not physician). In practice, many health centers have not succeeded in recruit a doctor, and there is
prtctically no difference with a dispensaire.

34
or three nurses. In addition, each of the centers now has an ambulance to transport
patients to the hospitals in Chefchaouen or Ksar El Kebir. One of the main benefits has
been that pregnant women ready for delivery are now transported to the hospital by an
ambulance, rather than by mule as the past. An additional effect has been the
establishment of two pharmacies along the improved road.
b) In the Settat area, similar impacts have been registered. At the health center in Larbaa,
services are now provided by 2 nurses and 3 weekly visits by a doctor, whereas no such
personnel existed before the road was improved.
c) In the Marrakech area, the health services along the road areas have improved little. It
appears that the improved access to existing facilities (at Amizmiz and at Assif Al Mal)
provided by the improved roads and new, or more frequent share-ride taxis and bus
services resulted in an improvement in the population's access to health services, and
that health authorities have not deemed the construction of more facilities to be a
priority.

Note: In the 1980s, health centers were conceived as primary care facilities serviced by a full-time doctor,
while infirmaries were supposed to be staffed by nurses only. In practice, the intended level of staffing
was often not reached.
5.19    Health Service Strategy and Plans. Information supplied by focus groups and health
authorities also revealed that:
a) as the road access was improved and, sometimes, combined with the construction of new
facilities, health service authorities were able to change the health service strategy for
the areas serviced from the road, by, for example, moving from occasional visits to the
areas by medical personnel to permanent availability of a facility near the users.'6 The
existence of permanent health professionals, as opposed to occasional visits by doctors
16 Morocco's rural health service strategy comprises three main altematives: (i) a permanent fixed, primary care facility, which is
easily accessible to the local population, called 'strategie fixe"; (ii) or, occasional visits to the areas by a nurse, normally on a
motorized bicycle ('velomoteur'), called "strategic itinerante"; (iii) or, occasional visits to the area by a mobile vehicle, called
"strategic mobile".



35
and nurses, allowed to implement health programs like pre-natal care and immunization
of children;
b) implementation of family planning national programs, mainly the distribution of
contraceptives and provision of medical advice, are no longer hampered by transport
bottlenecks thanks to the roads' improved condition;
c) in the areas enjoying improved roads, it has been possible to implement a
"medicalization" program whose aim is that every health center is serviced by at least
one medical doctor. Local authorities reported that it was , and still is, practically
impossible to recruit doctors in areas which do not have good road access;
d) due to the better access, it has been made easier to recruit as well as to retain health
service personnel; and
e) the supply of medicines has increased considerably.
5.20   Comparison of Impacts between the Project and the Control Zones. As noted, there has
been improvement in access to health infrastructure and services in the villages around the
project zones. However, the fact that the control zones also benefited from such improvements
makes it difficult to establish causal links between project investment and reported impacts.
Three possible reasons may explain these findings:
a) improvements, percentage-wise, were about the same in the project and the control
zones, but starting from and reaching lower levels in the control zones, possibly
reflecting that it is easier to achieve gains at the lower end of the spectrum;
b) the "recall" factor of the retrospective survey (asking respondents to remember events
ten years earlier) has led respondents to recall events/activities in a more favorable light
than they actually were, especially as they improved over time. Thus, respondents from
the project zones might have had the same health facilities as those from the control
zones in 1985, but the memory of hardship experienced earlier had faded over time; and
c) the rehabilitation of the roads had no impact on the number of trips to and from health
facilities, and the improvements noted are all due to exogenous factors such as the
implementation of health programs in the areas. Unfortunately, data at the village, douar
or neighborhood levels was not available to verify this.



36
Impact on Women
Box 5.1 Living Conditions of Rural Women
"The rural sector's limited transportation infrastructure limits women's opportunities. Many rural
villages in Morocco are isolated from market centers by long distances. The lack of roads makes
travel too difficult, dangerous, or time-consuming for women to profitably engage in economic
activity involving travel. Consequently, women often lack access to markets and are unable to
participate in wage labor or trade. Transportation constraints stemming from the limitations of
the road system inhibit women's access to health care. Travel time to the nearest health center is
greater than 60 minutes for nearly half the population in rural areas. This particularly affects
women who with their reproductive role are more likely to be in need of health services and have
less mobility than men."'7
Rationale for the Impact
5.21   The improvement of roads and the resulting better access to services and facilities was
expected to benefit women more than men, for a number of reasons. First, women in rural
Morocco enjoy substantially less mobility than men. On the education front, the effects of
improved access to schools would be expected to be higher for girls in view of their very low
enrollment rates compared to those of boys. Similarly, better access to health services could be
expected to enable women to get gender-specific health services, such as maternal and infant
care. Women would also be expected to derive benefits concerning personal mobility and rural-
urban contacts because of their daily time-consuming activities. Female workload is heavy in the
absence of easy access to clean water and fuelwood or other heating and cooking sources; thus,
improvements in local roads facilitating access to water supply and to sources of energy (both
existing sources and those created following the road improvements) could be expected to
significantly reduce women's workload.
Gender Indicators: A National Perspective'
5.22   Education Nationally, about 40 percent of all children aged 7-13 are enrolled in primary
education. Of those enrolled, 41 percent are girls. In rural areas, the percentage of girls goes
down to 32 percent; by 6th grade, the percentage further drops to 25.
5.23   The probability of an average rural girl having access to basic education and surviving
through the fifth grade was estimated in 1991 at less than 20 percent, while the corresponding
probability for an urban boy was close to 90 percent. These disparities are explained by parental
attitudes to schooling and opportunity costs of sending children to school as well as by
unavailability of schooling facilities, along with factors such as the lack of provision of meals.
Among the poorest expenditure group surveyed in the 1990-91 MILSS, poverty (that is, liability
to forgo children's labor or earnings) was cited in about two-thirds of the cases as the reason for
not having children attend school.

5.24    Health  Several indicators illustrate women's lower health conditions in rural settings.
While women in urban areas may expect to live 74 years, such number drops to 67 in rural areas.
At the same time, the fertility rate in rural areas is twice that in urban areas (5.7 and 2.8,
respectively). Family planning services are beyond the reach of most women in the countryside,
and cultural factors further discourage their use. Maternal mortality rates are high in rural areas:
they reach 362 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, which compares with 284 in Morocco's
urban areas (and less than 10 per 100,000 live births in developed countries). Infant
malnutrition is about twice as prevalent in rural as in urban areas.
5.25    Women consistently emphasize the need to have basic health facilities in the village or
to have ambulances for easy transport, especially in maternity related emergencies.'9 In rural
settings, most deliveries take place at home (72 percent) with the assistance of traditional birth
attendants (kabla) in 48 percent of cases and with relatives or friends in 20 percent of cases.
Only about thirty percent of the births are attended by a health professional; of these, two thirds
of the time by a doctor and one third by a midwife or nurse. Women's lack of information about
the health centers further reduces their access to such services.
Main Findings
5.26    Education. There was a dramatic improvement in the project zones in the enrollment of
girls in primary school: it went up from 17 percent in 1985 to 54 percent in 1995 (see Table 5.1).
This happened consistently across the three zones under study, and all three zones registered
enrollment levels higher than the national average for rural areas, especially Settat, where girls'
enrollment reached 67 percent. One reason cited for the substantial improvement in girls'
enrollment is that several new primary schools and satellite classrooms opened during the period.
By comparison, enrollment of girls in primary education in rural areas throughtout Morocco
iemained practically constant during the study period (Annex B).
5.27    Despite the large gains in the enrollment of girls in primary education in 1995, in the
three zones combined, girls' enrollment levels were still substantially below boys', 54 percent
versus 81 percent. It appears that the traditional reluctance of parents to send girls to school-
because they contribute more than boys to household chores such as getting water and caring for
siblings, and because of perceived dangers of rape when there are long distances and difficult
trails to school-is still the primary cause for their lagging behind boys. These findings on girls'
education are consistent with those in the study completed by Khandher, Lavy and Filmer
(1994).2`
5.28    Health. In the project zones, there was a clear gain in the frequency of visits by women
to health services: their visits to a hospital more than doubled (2.4 per year in 1995, compared to
1.10 in 1985) and their visits to the primary care centers also increased (3.1 in 1995 compared to
2.3 in 1985). Men made relatively similar gains percentage-wise, but the frequency of their
19 Ibid, footnote 17.
20 This report found, through regression analysis based on LMS data, that: (a) the presence of a paved road increases the girls'
probability of ever attending a school by 40 percent, compared with less than 10 percent for boys; (b) school attendance for rural
children increases from 58 percent for boys and 21 percent for girls when there is no paved road in the community, to 76 percent for
boys and 48 percent for girls when there is a paved road. Thus, girls' attendance more than doubles, while boys' attendance, which
is higher initially, increase by about 15 percent as a result of the existence of a paved road; (c) if a road is blocked during the year
(an average of I month per year in the study), there is a 30 percent drop in girls attendance, but only 20 percent in boys attendance.



38
visits to hospitals was much lower than women (0.8 per year in 1995); however, it was about the
same for visits to primary care centers.
5.29   Focus groups reported that women gained substantially from health programs in
maternal and infant care and family planning, but no statistics specific to the project zones were
availab!e.
5.30   Another health impact is the diversification of the diet. Focus groups in Chefchaouen
reported that while in the past they rarely ate fish, they do so now at least once a month; they
credit this change to the paving of the project road, which has enabled refrigerated trucks to have
access to the souks serving their areas. Similarly, it was reported that consumption of fresh
vegetables and fruits increased.
5.31 Cooking and Heating. A major gain in women' welfare stemming from the better
quality roads was the introduction of butane for cooking and heating. For example, focus groups
in Chef-haouen reported that before the improvement of the road, women had to spend an
average of 2 hours daily in order to get and carry fuelwood. Butane gas, used extensively in
urban areas, did not reach the rural areas due to the high transport and distribution costs. A
bottle of butane used to cost 20 Dh; following improvement of the road, the price dropped
considerably, to as low as II Dh. which is affordable. A similar phenomenon was reported in
the other regions.
Box 5.2 Fuelwood Collection by Women
"Fuelwood coliection for cooking and heating is sometimes 5 km away and most women must
go twice a day, collecting up to ten kilos of wood per basket. In some larger households, women
have to repeat the voyage four times a day. Quite naturally, the women linked backache, pain in
the joints and arthritis to the heavy loads of wood they have on their shoulder." 21
5.32   Work Opportunities. There were area-specific impacts on women which, in some cases,
resulted in opposite consequences. For example, focus groups in Settat reported that in the past
women were required to work on the fields helping with the wheat crop. Today, as a result of
mechanization and the creation of agricultural cooperatives made possible by the improved road,
most women can stay home. Since, coincidentally, taxi services have greatly expanded, women
now use time for more visits to their relatives and to nearby villages and cities. A rather
different case happened in some localities in the Tensift area. The increase in milk cooperatives
that resulted from the improved road required more labor to take care of the cows. Thus,
municipal programs were instituted encouraging women to work on this activity and a specific
incentive was created where women got a share of the revenues stemming from milk sales; the
result has been an increase in earning-generating work for women. In view of the low
participation of women in Morocco's formal (monetized) economy, this is an important impact.
Other Impacts
5.33   Access to Water Supply. As shown in Table 3.2, in all three areas served by the
improved project roads, the average time to access water supply facilities showed a small
21 Ibid, footnote 17.

decrease, from an average for all regions of 16 minutes in 1985 to 13 minutes in 1995, while no
gains were achieved in the control zones. 22
5.34    Mobility and Rural-Urban Links. The expanded rural taxi23 and bus services over the
study period, led to a major increas_, in moHlity and rural-urban links. For example, across all
three regions served by the project roads, the number of visits by relatives in the urban areas to
their families on the farms increased, on average, from 2 visits per year in 1985, to some 15 per
year ten years later; this compares to less than two in the control zones in 1985, and to just 3 in
1995. At the same time, visits by members of the farm households to the nearby cities increased
substantially in Settat and in Marrakech, from, on average, 12 in 1985 to over 60 in 1995, while
the equivalent numbers in the controls zones changed from 8 to 25.
22 Access to water, as well as to other services, is reported by the World Bank's 1996 Participation Sourcebook. To be a high
priority by Moroccan women: "...we learned that whereas men wanted to build bridges and roads, women' top priorities were
clinics, ambulances, electricity, running water and collective ovens"
23 Rural taxis in Morocco are share-ride type, that is, they are not limited to serving one client but can take passengers up to the
capacity of the vehicle.

6.  Impact on the Environment
Changes in transport conditions and in the agricultural economy had both negative and positive
impacts on the environment although, overall, no environmentally sensitive areas were at risk by
the road projects, which did not involve new construction. Negative impacts were those
resultingfrom the increased traffic and economic activity, especially air and noise pollution and
road accidents, and the increased use offertilizers and other chemicals which in all likelyhood
contaminated the water table. Positive impacts resulted inpartfrom the transformation of the
agricultural economy, notably curtailment of extensive goat and sheep that damages the soil
cover and increased tree plantations, andfrom broader use of butane substitutingforfuelwood,
whose demand is larger than the size of Morocco's sustainable forests.
Expected Impacts
6.1    The environmental impact of paving a rural road was expected to have both negative and
positive dimensions. On the negative side, there would be the effects of increased economic
activity in the rural economy and resulting higher levels of motorized traffic, with its known
cor,sequences of increased use of agricultural chemicals (fertilizers, pesticides) and vehicular
pollution. On the positive side, transformation of the agricultural output and the introduction of
better agronomic practices could lead to reduced soil erosion and better care of the forests. The
road works themselves, invoiving no extension of the existing right of way, could be expected to
have only a minor impact on the environment, and limited in time to the period of the execution
of the works.24
Main Findings
6.2    The data made available through the study did not permit to quantify the impacts of the
rural roads improvements on the environment. However, information from the focus groups
interviews, the analysis of the farm level questionnaires and the changes in the regional
agricultural economy provide a basis to identify types of impacts, both negative and positive, on
the environment. Such impacts are divided here between those resulting directly from the road
works and the higher traffic levels they induced or allowed, and those resulting from changes in
the agricultural economy and related economic activity.
Types of Impacts
6.3   Impacts Directly Resulting from Road Improvements and Traffic. The main negative
impacts are the increase in the levels of:
a) air pollution stemming from the increased fuel fumes resulting from the higher traffic;
b) road noise as a result of the higher vehicular activity; and
c) soil erosion caused by higher traffic levels and cars driving on road shoulders, leading to
occasional flooding.
24 The roads works on the four roads analyzed in this report would fall under the Bank's Environmental Category B.



42
6.4    However, at least in the case of the first two impacts, while the overall levels increased,
the levels per unit of traffic decreased as a result of the better road surfaces, which are more fuel
efficient and less noisy.
6.5    While there is no statistical evidence, it is likely that the higher traffic levels and
especially the higher speeds made possible by thc paved roads, led to an increase in the number
of road accidents, and related fatalities, injuries and material damages.
6.6    On the positive side, the asphalt roads substantially reduced, relative to the earth and
gravel roads that they substituted, dust pollution; farm workers traveling to the souks or to social
services in the villages and children attending school were the main beneficiaries of such
reduction in dust.
6.7   Impacts from Changes in the Agricultural Economy and Increased Economic Activity.
The main negative impacts were:
a) increased use of agricultural chemicals (mainly fertilizer and pesticides), resulting from
the intensification of vegetable gardening, higher-yield cattle, tree cropping and sugar
beet production. Measures of such contaminants on the water table, or in locally
marketed foodstuffs, are not available for the zones of influence of the project roads;
b) increased liquid and solid waste resulting from livestock slaughtering in souks.
6.8    The main positive impacts, identified by the surveys and the focus groups, were:
a) the curtailment of extensive goat and sheep herding;
b) an increase in the number of tree plantations; and
c) increased reliance on bottled gas for heating and cooking fuel (as access to these supplies
is made cheaper and easier by the better roads), substituting for fuelwood.
6.9   In some areas (namely, in the Rif) these impacts combined resulted in decreased run-off
from steep slopes, increased preservation of upper watersheds and increased reforestation of the
watershed which had been severely eroded due to the uncontrolled scavenging for fuelwood and
the decrease in soil cover due to goat herding.
6.10   The shift to high-value agriculture, although it increased the use of polluting chemicals,
reduced extensive planting and range practices generally harmful to the environment.
6.11   The positive impacts noted above will benefit the forests. Such benefits are important.
It is estimated that 85% of Morocco's need for fuelwood is supplied by forests and non-
commercial agricultural vegetation. This level of demand for fuetwood in the country as a whole
is estimated at 10 million cubic meters of wood, well above the sustainable forest yield of 3
million cubic meters. Also, some 40 percent of grazing grounds are in forest zones and
overgrazing undermines reforestation.25

43
6.12   Overall, it is not possible to provide a balance of the various environmental impacts
caused by the improvement of the rural roads, since different types of impacts took place whose
effects are not directly comparable and quantification of the individual impacts is not possible.
However, the perception from the focus groups and from the surveys carried out during the study
is that the positive impacts are of similar magnitude as those impacts that are harmful to the
environment.

7.  Economic Analysis
The improvements in the agricultural economy and access to social services that the better roads
brought about translated into increases in the roads'traffic levels at rates substantially higher
than on unpaved rural roads. The study quantified the economic benefits based on savings in
vehicle operating costs compared to the original, unpaved roads, and on the economic gains
resulting from the avoidance of road closures (due to rains) since the paved roads are open to
traffic year-round. Social impacts, although real, could not be isolatedfor attribution to the
road investments and were not quantified. The analysis showed that the economic returns as
well as the timing of the improvements for all project roads were satisfactory (economic rates of
return ranging between 16 and 30 percent), and that even under a worse case scenario the
returns would have remained acceptable. The benefits from the investments are expected to
accrue to farmers in the form of expanded use of commercialfreight services substituting for
non-motorized carriage of loads, including heavier, more efficient trucks. The rural population
in the roads' areas is expected to benefit mainly by the availability at affordable prices of
frequent services of share-ride taxis. The satisfactory returns do not necessarily mean that
paving was the optimal economic decision, comrpared, for example, to rehabilitated gravel roads
maintained at good standards.
Economic Analysis at Project Appraisal
7.1    The feasibility study on which the Bank's appraisal report was based assessed benefits
of rural roads improvements mainly in terms of increased agricultural volumes stemming from:
i) an increase of between 5 and 20 percent in planted areas, and ii) an increase in unit yields of
up to 70 percent relative to those existing at the time the project was prepared. The study also
quantified savings in vehicle operating costs to the existing traffic.
7.2    Based on this analysis, the ex-ante rates of return for the road projects were as follows:

Findings of Importance to Economic Analysis
7.3    Findings in this study point to the difficulty in forecasting changes in agricultural
production levels, value added, and related traffic. The transformation of the agricultural
economy found in the three regions went beyond improvements in yields, or increases in planted
areas (a common assumption in rural road projects).26 As noted in Chapter 4, such
26 A common model is to assume a market for agricultural products located at a fixed distance for which the rural area being
analyzed is a marginal supplier and does not influence the market price. Thus, reduced transport costs stemming from better roads



46
transformation followed the classical Van Thunen model, where improvement in roads will
change the composition of agricultural output from low value cereals to high value but highly
perishable vegetables.
7.4     At the same time, a transformation of the agricultural economy to higher value
vegetables may lead, at least in the short term, to either an increase or a decrease in traffic,
depending on precisely how and by how much the agricultural economy was transformed. In the
medium term, it is likely that the better agricultural economy will raise disposable income, and
will, therefore, lead to an increase in passenger travel.
Project Benefits
7.5.    Economic benefits from the road improvements can be divided into two categories: (i)
those related to the vehicles using the road had the road not been improved, designated as the
road's normal traffic and (ii) those related to the developmental effects of the road improvement.
Benefits to normal traffic are measured by the savings in the vehicle operating costs. Benefits
stemming from the developmental effect of the road can be measured either by the reduction in
transport costs of the generated traffic, or by the value of expanded production. In theory both
methods should yield the same results.2" As this retrospective analysis can take advantage that
actual traffic data exists for one year before the improvements, and one year after the
improvements, this report follows the transport cost savings approach, comparing costs "with"
and "without" project. The alternative approach, quantification of production benefits, although
it allows to better relate road improvements to the developmental changes taking place, requires
making assumptions which, overall, greatly increase the potential for faulty results. Especially
difficult and prone to error is the assessment of a road's area of influence from which production
is to be quantified, and the estimation of the prices of inputs and outputs, notably as they are
subject to large variations due to droughts and domestic and external market conditions.
7.6     The roads' impact on the social sectors, described in earlier chapters, cannot be directly
measured for the purposes of economic analysis, and they are normally considered as intangible
benefits; nor can the analysis quantify benefit distribution among different beneficiaries. Benefit
distribution is discussed later in this chapter. A recommendation regarding consideration of
social impacts in the screening and evaluation of rural roads is in Chapter 9.
Traffi c
7.7     Changes in traffic levels between 1982 and 1995 are discussed in Chapter 3. The
difference between current traffic levels and those in the early 1 980s can be attributed to : i)
normal growth in traffic, that is, the annual growth rate at which traffic grows on unpaved rural
roads; ii) traffic diverted from other roads, due to shorter distance and/or lower vehicle operating
costs; and iii) new traffic induced by the road in its direct zone of influence. The relative
importance of each factor is directly related to the economic role of the road, both in the area it
serves and as a long-distance route. Briefly explained, the roads' economic roles are:
cause farm-gate prices to increase, and allows to extend the distance at which planting for selling in the existing market is profitable.

Road 603:           It crosses an agricultural region that produces beets for a sugar factory
(SUNABEL); is also provides access to an otherwise isolated population.2"
At the same time, this road was considered to have a substantial potential as
a transit route for long-distance traffic.29 As noted in Chapter 3, this actually
happened.
Road 1427:          It connects the provinces of Settat and Khourigba and traverses an area
devoted to cattle raising and agriculture.30 This road was also considered to
have potential as a transit route. Since the traffic growth on this road was
similar to the average traffic growth rates in Morocco, the transit potential
probably did not happen, or it did to a limited extent only.
Roads 6308/6307. These two roads were more purely rural roads in that they provide access to
an isolated population but also are in an area with tourist sites, which attracts
travelers going to Agadir.
7.8     Quantification of Project Benefits. The savings in vehicle operating costs between the
unimproved and the paved roads have been based on indicative figures given in the appraisal
report for the road project approved in 1995.3' The quantification of benefits applies such
vehicle operating cost savings to the normal traffic, and only half this amount to the induced
traffic (a conservative assumption that takes all induced traffic as being developmental,
generated traffic). At the same time, since 1982 traffic data did not contain details of non-
motorized traffic (NMT), e.g. pedestrians, bicycles, carts. The present analysis omits the
benefits that would accrue to the non-motorized resulting from (i) the gains from the better road
quality to NMT traffic remaining on the road after its improvement, and (ii) shifting of NMT to
motorized vehicles. However, the analysis does quantify separately the benefits derived from
avoiding road closures. The analysis also takes into account that in the roads with pavements 4
meters or less, the costs of operating vehicles increases after a traffic threshold, due to vehicles
partially riding on the road's earth shoulders.
7.9     There are no records in Morocco of the growth rate of traffic on the rural roads from
which to asses how much traffic may have been induced by the investments, as opposed to the
"notmal" traffic level that would have been reached in 1995 if historical trends of traffic growth
had continued. The assumption adopted here is that traffic growth on rural roads is lower than
on the main highways; the hypothesis is that, had the rural roads not been improved, traffic
would have grown at a rate of 2.5 percent per year.

7.11   As shown in Table 7.3 below, the economic rate of return for all the investments is
satisfactory, and ranges from 16 percent for road 6308 to 30 percent for road 1427. A sensitivity
analysis considering lower traffic growth rates, lower savings in vehicle operating costs (for
example, if the pavements are not well maintained), and higher costs of routine maintenance, as
well as a worst case scenario combining Icwer traffic with lower vehicle operating costs savings
shows that the economic return for all roads would still be acceptable.
7.12   The table also shows that the first year return (FYR, benefits the year of road opening
relative to investment costs) is satisfactory for all roads. A satisfactory FYR indicates that the
investment was not premature.

(A. 1 and B combined)
7.13   The main reasons for the satisfactory returns appear to be: (a) the very poor condition of
the original roads, which caused a major reduction in vehicle operating costs when the roads
were improved and paved, (b) the fact that the roads (which is partially wider) were built to a
narrow paved width of 4 meters only, with consequent savings in construction costs, and (c) that
substantial traffic was generated, as reflected by the difference at opening year between the



49
normal traffic (without the improvement) and the estimate of the actual traffic that year based on
the 1995 survey.
7.14   While some benefits appear to be dependent on paved roads the satisfactory returns to
the rura! roads investment does not ensure that paving was the optimal economic solution. It is
possible that, especially the roads with lower traffic such as roads 6307/6308, rehabilitating the
roads to a good gravel surface and maintaining them well could have yielded even higher returns.
7.15   Economic Rate of Returns Using HDMModel. MTDS consultants carried out an
estimate of the irvestment returns using the Bank's Highway Design Model (HDM) and adopting
standard assumptions used by the MPW. The HDM/MPW-based evaluation gave ERRs
substantially higher than those presented in Task 7.3, suggesting that some of the assumptions
may be overly optimistic. Details of this analysis is in Annex F.
7.16   Distribution of Benefits. The direct beneficiaries of the road improvements are road
users: motorized passenger and freight vehicles and non-motorized vehicles comprising bicycles,
carts and pedestrians. Since vehicle ownership is still low in Morocco, most motorized vehicles
operating on the roads do so for commercial purposes. Farmers benefit from the improved roads
in two ways: (i) by expanding use of commercial freight services, substituting for the slower,
limited-distance and more expensive non-motorized transport, which on unpaved roads in
Morocco's rural areas carry some 50 percent of all goods, and (ii) by being able to use the
services of truckers operating larger freight vehicles, which offer lower transport rates. An
indirect measure of the transport benefits to farmers is given by the lower increase (than in the
control zones) in transport household expenditures, discussed in Chapter 3. The drastic drop in
the retail price of butane cited in Chapter 5 is another indicator of these benefits. While these
benefits are significant, it is likely that farmers could have derived even greater advantages had
Morocco's road freight transport market been less regulated and more competitive. This
comment applies especially to the large trucks, over eight gross tons, that are required to do
business through the state-owned Office Nationale des Transports (ONT), which operates as a
freight-forwarding monopoly.
7.17   Regarding passenger travel, benefits accrued to the rural population mainly in the way of
substantially increased share-taxi services which have taken an increasing share of the rural
transport market, at the expense of interurban bus services. There are practically no entry
controls to the taxi market, and tariffs are competitive. The non-motorized transport has
benefited from the substantially better surface quality offered by the paved roads.
Design of Rural Roads
7.18   Two out of the three roads in this study were improved to paved surfaces of 4 meters or
less, while the third has a 5.5 meter-wide section. Current thinking in the MPW regarding the
large rural program under construction, appears to be not to consider pavements less than 6-
meter wide. This would be in conflict with the results in the present study, which show that 4-
meter pavements were cost effective for the traffic levels attained on roads where they were
tried.






51
8.    Sustainability of the Impacts
Historic trends showing steady traffic growth over long periods on Morocco's paved roads, even
during drought years when agricultural production fell, is a key indicator suggesting the stream
of benefits is likely to be sustainable. The immediate issue is route 603 which, seven years after
completion of the works and in part because traffic reached an unexpectedly high level, currently
is in poor condition. While resurfacing of this road is included under the MPW's maintenance
program for 1994-1998, inadequate budgetary allocations for road maintenance raise
uncertainty about the level of benefits on this road over the long-term. Agricultural benefits are
based on sound economic decisions and are likely to be sustained, with the possible exception of
the sugar beet planting in the North (a small component of traffic on route 603) which is
uneconomic and may lose market depending on the outcome of the privatization program for the
state-owned sugarfactories. The sustainability of the social service impacts appear as likely in
view of the high value assigned to them by the direct beneficiaries and because of Government
policies aimed to improve social services, and the increasedfunding it is allocating to these
activities.
The Roads
8.1    Sustainability of the benefits and impacts of the investment in rural roads will depend on
the traffic levels and on the country's ability to maintain the roads to the same standard as they
were built. Until now, traffic has grown at high rates both country-wide and on the project's
roads. At the same time, traffic is relatively immune to the cyclical droughts that affect
Morocco. The biggest threat to keeping or increasing traffic levels is the adequacy of road
maintenance.
8.2    The MPW surveys the condition of the main roads every 2-3 years. In the 1994 survey,
that is, seven years after completion of Road 603, six years for Road 1427 and four years for
Roads 6307 and 6308, the condition of the roads was the following:
Table 8.1 Condition of Project Roads, Based on 1994 MPW Survey
Area/Road                   Surfare Quality (% of road length)
Excellent     Good           Poor           Very Poor
North/Rt 603          8             5             23               64
Center/Rt 1427        0            100            0                0
South/Rts 6307/08    100           0              0                0
8.3   In part, the poor condition of route 603 may be explained by the explosive growth of
traffic on this route, which is some two to three times the level of traffic on the other roads
considered in this study; in addition, this traffic includes some 20-25 percent of trucks, which
contribute further to the deterioration of its pavement; also, an asphalt surface seven years old
normally is approaching its economic life.



52
8.4    More generally, there are three main issues related to maintenance and the sustainability
of the roads benefits: the amount of budgetary resources for maintenance, the criteria for
allocation of funding, and the maintenance administration. Inadequate budgetary resources for
road maintenance has been a perennial problem in Morocco. The completion report of the fourth
project, and, more strongly, the audit prepared by OED, noted this situation. More recently, the
appraisal report of the highway project approved in 1995 reported that, as of 1993, there was a
country-wide backlog of hignway maintenance works estimated at Dh 1.74 billion. An increase
in the overall funding for roads appears unlikely due to a tight budget, and the Government is
addressing this issue by shifting, to some extent, more resources for maintenance, relative to new
road construction. Thefunding allocation issue is whether the limited funds are correctly
allocated to the roads and type of maintenance with the highest pay-offs. The allocation of road
funding is done at two levels: first, the DRCR allocated a tentative budget to each province based
on four criteria: (a) length of paved roads in bad and very bad condition; (b) traffic on paved
roads; (c) total length of roads and (d) length of mountainous roads; second, individual roads
maintenance priorities are assessed through a pavement management system. This allocation
system is a considerable improvement over past practices, but the EVAL needs improvement to
ensure correct counting of the benefits and identification of maintenance priorities.
Administration of maintenance, including programming, contracts and supervision of road
works is carried out by 40 provincial offices reporting to seven regional offices. While this
organization appears to have built-in incentives to optimize public expenditures for roads,32 it
could be improved by including road users in the road management process.
8.5     The maintenance of all four roads analyzed in this study fall under the responsibility of
the MPW. The MPW's Maintenance Action Plan for the period 1994-1998 includes the
resurfacing of route 603. The sustainability of the benefits of this road hinges on the
implementation of this plan.
The Socioeconomic Impacts
8.6    Agriculture. The improved project roads, to the extent they are kept well maintained,
will be a key factor in ensuring the sustainability of the transformation and modernization of
agricultural production that they helped bring about. The agricultural impacts, already in place
for some years, are likely to be sustainable as the domestic market for produce is broadening
thanks to improved incomes. Agricultural gains are, however, dependent on government trade
and fiscal policies and on the opportunities for selling Moroccan fruits and vegetables in the
European markets. The development of sugar beet planting in the Chefchaouen area along Route
603 is the agricultural impact most at risk. The sugar processing factories, which are state-
owned, lose money, and are being considered for privatization. It is not clear whether, at a
sufficiently low purchase price, such factories may become attractive for private sector
investment and continued operation.3
8.7    The success achieved by the extension services in helping introduce new agricultural
techniques is important for the sustainability of the agricultural benefits particularly as such

services are likely to be curtailed in view of Government policies to further reduce public
expenditures.34
8.8     Social Services. The sustainability of the improvement in access to and use of health
services, as well as improvements in women's welfare, appears to be high because beneficiaries
realize their direct value. This is the case, notably, of primary health care, whose benefits are
tangible and immediate. Sustainability of the supply of services would be enhanced to the extent
government decentralization policies are implemented and more budgetary decisions are made
by the local governments. The sustainability of education impacts will depend largely on the
level of budgetary allocations to primary education and on sustained economic growth; as noted
elsewhere in this report, enrollment in primary education fell in the 1980s as a result of
economic recession and there is a danger that a similar situation may occur in the future. The
World Bank is assisting the social sectors through ongoing and newly-prepared projects, which
should help in sustaining the benefits of social programs.35
34 Govemment policies on extension services give special emphasis to irrigated areas where, on average, one extension center exists
for every 3,000 hectares, whereas the ratio is only one center for every 100,000 hectares in rainfed areas. Of the three project areas,
only Chefchaouen is an irrigated one, and is likely to continue to benefit from intensive agricultural extension services.

9.  Conclusions and Recommendations
Conclusions
9.1    The study, based on a broad database from surveys and focus groups, gathered unique
socioeconomic information that allowed to assess the impact of road improvements beyond
conventional cost-benefit analysis. Notably, the data permitted to quantify changes in economic
and social indicators in the 10-year period covered by the study. Information from control zones
where roads were not improved provided a proxy scenario for a "without project situation" and,
when combined with feedback from focus groups, helped establish a logical chain of events to
assess the relative role of the road improvements in the impacts reported. The main conclusions
are summarized below.
9.2    Transport Infrastructure and Services. The improved road conditions led to:
*  year-round use of the roads, eliminating frequent road closures during rainy periods;
e  reduced operating costs of vehicles, and lower rates for freight and passengers, resulting
in substantial household transport savings relative to regions that did not benefit from
road improvements;
*  traffic increasing at rates higher than the past trend and comprising a larger proportion of
trucks that offer lower transport rates;
* a major increase in the supply of rural passenger services, especially share-ride taxis;
* a higher degree of ownership of motorized vehicles, cars as well as trucks; and
* a substantial reduction in access time by the rural population to markets and social
services.
9.3    Agriculture. Changes detected in the agricultural economy in the project areas were:
*  the overall level of agricultural activity increased in volume of production, productivity
of the land, and monetary values of the output;
*  the agricultural production mix was transformed, land use shifted from low-value cereals
to high-value fruit orchards, and livestock production shifted to pure breed cows;
*  the use of modern inputs, especially fertilizers, improved as distribution channels
became easier and enjoyed lower costs;
*  as a result of the shift to higher-value products, and the overall increase in yields, the
value added per unit of cultivated land increased;
*  related economic changes in workload, employment on and off-farm, establishment of
new shops followed different patterns depending on the region.
9.4    Social sectors. Changes detected in social indicators in the project areas were:
*  in education, enrollment of children in primary school more than doubled between 1985
and 1995, and quality of education improved; as new facilities were built it became
possible to recruit teachers in the rural areas served by the project, and absenteeism of
both from students and teachers dropped;
*  in health, visits per person to health facilities (hospitals and primary care facilities)
nearly doubled over the period and, similarly to education, the quality of health services
improved, as new health centers were built (except in the Marrakech area), supply of
medicines was facilitated, health authorities launched a program to staff rural health



56
centers with a full-time doctor, and immunization and other health prevention programs
became easier to implement;
*  on women, while the road projects did not originally aim to have specific gender
impacts, they did: girls' enrollment in primary education more than trebled; women
benefited from matermal and child health care programs; and, equally significant, the
introduction of butane at affordable prices (thanks to the existence of paved roads)
dramatically reduced women's chores of daily collection of fuelwood for cooking and
heating; and
*  in rural-urban interaction, the improved rural transport services resulted in several-fold
increases in social exchanges, both by relatives from the urban areas visiting the farns,
and by farm household members visiting nearby cities.
9.5    Regional Distribution of Transport, Agricultural and Social Impacts. Many of the
impacts were felt about equally in all three regions considered in the study. In the transport
sector, this was the case with the elimination of road closures, increase in the amount of large
trucks offering lower rates, and increase in the availability of share-ride taxis, all of which
showed a high degree of impact. The Northern region enjoyed the most impact regarding traffic
growth, reduction in operating costs and lowering rates of transport. In agriculture, the most
consistent gains occurred in the Central region, which scored high in practically all categories of
impacts (such as improved farmers' access to markets, reduced prices for inputs and overall
economic gains) followed closely by the Southern region. In the social sectors, the Central
region also achieved the highest gains, while the other two regions attained somewhat lower
gains. A summary of impacts by region is in Annex G.
9.6    Environment. Changes in transport conditions and in the agricultural economy had both
negative and positive impacts on the environment, although overall, no environmentally sensitive
areas were at risk by the road projects or by their direct and indirect effects:
-  negative impacts were those resulting from the increased traffic and economic activity,
that is, air and noise vehicular pollution, agricultural fertilizers and other chemicals
which in all likelihood contaminated the water table;
*  positive impacts stemmed mainly from transformation in the agricultural economy:
curtailment of extensive goat and sheep herding and increase in tree plantations as well
as from increased use of butane for cooking and heating which substituted for fuelwood,
whose demand is larger than Morocco's sustainable forests.
9.7    Projects' Economic Benefits. Savings in vehicle operating costs and avoidance of road
closures generated by the paving of the roads yielded satisfactory economic rates of return for
the investments. The increases in the level of and value added of agricultural outputs, in part
triggered by the better road conditions, corroborate this finding.
9.8    Sustainability. The transport, agricultural and social impacts are likely to be sustainable.
The only issue is Road 603 in the North which currently, seven years after opening, is in poor
condition. The Ministry of Public Works has included this road for repaving under its 1994-
1998 maintenance program but actual implementation, on which the sustainability of the road's
benefits hinges, is uncertain due to inadequate funding for maintenance country-wide.



57
9.9    Monitoring of Road Impacts. Despite project objectives to develop and implement an
impact monitoring system, this did not happen mainly because government authorities were not
persuaded of the cost-effectiveness of the recommended monitoring program.
9.10 Integrating Road Improvements with Other Sectors. The findings of this study indicate
that in most cases, the improvement of the roads was a necessary condition for the impact to
happen, but other actions were also required, like investments and programs in education and
health. While the project focused on roads alone, widespread impacts suggest that, in parallel,
local authorities in other sectors did take into account the roads improvement plans in their own
plans. It is not clear, however, whether the impact of the roads could have been made greater
had more formal mechanisms for coordination of investments been devised from the beginning.
9.11   Comparison with Control Zones. In some cases, improvements in the control zones were
equal or better than in the project zones. This indicates that the control zones, although they did
not benefit from road improvements, are likely to have benefited from programs in other sectors
which did not occur in the project zones.
Recommendations
9.12   The following recommendations are offered:
(a) Establish a practical rural road monitoring system. In the current program to pave 10,000
km of rural roads, an effective monitoring system could be set up with the following
characteristics:
(i)    select a small number of road, agriculture and social sector indicators;
(ii)   arrange for each type of indicator to be collected by the respective sectoral,
local-level authority, maybe once every two or three years;
(iii)  integrate the collection of agricultural and social sectoral impact indicators in the
annual survey carried out by these sectors (such as the agriculture annual survey
on cereal production) and coordinate the type of data to be collected;
(iv)   arrange for the local authorities (ideally with assistance by a university) to
compile the data collected into a single report for each road, and disseminate the
report to local and central authorities.
(b) increase local community participation in rural roads, through:
(i)    at the planning stage, exchanges such as "village meetings", to ensure that road
plans are properly and timely taken into account within the planning of all local-
level activities;
(ii)   for road maintenance, through direct participation of local stockholders in the



58
funding allocation for this activity, such as, for example, the establishment of
local "road boards".36
(c) Consider, and require if cost-effective, the introduction of mitigation measures, such as
education campaigns and road signs, to reduce and or prevent the likely increase in road
accidents and their consequences, resulting from the increased traffic levels and speeds when
rural roads are paved.
(d) Consider adopting for rural roads, identification and evaluation methodologies based on
multi-criteria indicators: (i) that combine a minimum acceptable economic return with well
defined social sector (mainly education and health) objectives and with social sectors
investments integrated in local government budgets, or, (ii) for very low traffic levels and for
a small part of the budget for rural roads (20 percent is a good practice), apply multi-criteria
based solely on attaining social objectives represented by well defined indicators.
(e? Reassess the cost-effectiveness of 4-meter pavements in rural roads, and further analyze the
alternative to rehabilitate rural roads to good gravel standards. The very latest version of the
Bank's HDM model allows to conduct such kind of analysis.
36 Road Boards empowered to make decisions on allocation of road maintenance funds are a way to involve road users in the
management of roads. See Ian Heggie, 1995. Management and Financing of Roads - An Agendafor Reform. World Bank

Annex C
Study Methodology
Questionnaire Design
1. During the months of March and April, the team designed five questionnaires for data
collection corresponding to different levels of survey: three at the household and village levels,
one at the provincial public works representative level and one at the local representative of the
ministry of agriculture level. The team trained two field data collectors responsible for
administering the village and household level surveys, field tested the questionnaires (last week
of April 1995), and continually refined the questionnaire items to respond to the levels of
analysis required to test study hypotheses.
Primary Data
Household Level Data
2. Originally, sample design called for the collection of data from 200 small, medium and
large-sized rural households in four project zones and four control zones, with households being
selected approximately equally in each of the four study areas (fifty per area). Data collection
began in Chefchaouen on May 29 and was completed two weeks later. Data for Settat was
collected the first two weeks of June, and for Marrakech (two project roads) in the final two
weeks of June. The study team also conducted focus group interviews and collected village level
data and sample farm-level data (Unquete Exploitation) at the same time as the household-level
data. Copies of all questionnaires are included in Annex 2.
3. Because of the shortage of large-size farms in the Chefchaouen province, the study
comprises household level data from 188 sample farms. Table I shows the frequency of farms
sampled by size and region.
Focus Group Data
4. In each of the villages, Rural Sociologist conducted focus group interviews which varied
between 10 and 20 villagers per interview. The focus group interview data provided important
qualitative insights for the analysis of the household level data. See Volume II, Annex A for the
data made available from the focus group interviews.
Village Level Data
5. In addition to household-level data, village level data was collected for 9 project zone
villages and 3 control zone villages. The Village Level Data questionnaire is in Annex 2.
Farm Level Data
6. Whenever household respondents indicated interest in the study, data collectors requested
whether these villages would be willing to answer a series of detailed questions concerning farm
budgets. Fourteen villagers agreed to such requests (3 in Chefchaouen, 4 in Settat, and 7 in
Marrakech) and provided detailed crop production data (sugar beets, chickpeas, olives, barley,

hard and soft wheat) which will be used in assessing the over-all agricultural value added in
project zones.

Study Launch Workshop
7. Before proceeding with the data collection, the team, OEDD, and DRCR agreed to organize
a study launch workshop to encourage input from local level officials from the Ministries of
Agriculture and Public Works, to finalize project and control roads selection on the basis of that
input, to revise questionnaire design as appropriate, and to develop consensus for the local level
data collection effort as well as for the recommendations which would ultimately flow from this
study. On May 4, 1995, team members met with 11 representatives of the DRCR and provincial
level agricultural and public works staff from Larache, Settat and Marrakech. OED staff also
attended the one-half day workshop. In addition to reviewing the methodological approach and
the selection of project and control roads, participants discussed the local level approvals
iequired for the survey, the timing of the data collection, and questionnaire construction.
Provincial participants agreed with the approach, indicated their willingness to undertake the
local level authorizations for the study, and promised to submit any recommendations for
revisions in cluestionnaire design. Five days later, on the basis of the final recommendations
from local level staff, the team finalized the questionnaires and the schedule for data collection.
Data Collection and Analysis
8. The household, village level, and provincial level (agriculture and public works) data used in
this analysis was collected over a six-week period from the end of May until the beginning of
July 1q95.
9. The household and village level questionnaire data was entered into Excel spread sheets;
statistical analysis was performed in STATVIEW in order to identify indicators for which
changes between 1985 and 1995 in project villages exceeded those changes for control roads.



67
Annex C
The data from the focus group interviews was textually analyzed to determine anecdotal support
for the village and household level surveys. In early July 1995, a member of OED traveled to
Rabat to review preliminary findings from Chefchaouen, verify World Bank requirements for
rural sector impact evaluations and to visit one of the project roads (603 in Chefchaouen).

Economic Analysis of Road Improvements
Economic Evaluation Using HDM-III Model
1. The consultants working for MTDS carried out an economic evaluation of the three road
projects, based on the application of the HDM-III model. This model, developed by the World
Bank, is regularly used by the MPW/DRCR to assess road investments.
2. To collect traffic data, during the last two weeks of June and all of July 1996, the DRCR, in
collaboration with local level public works officials, organized both visual and automatic traffic
counts in each of the project zones. Visual counts were conducted over two consecutive days
(one market, one non-market) and included 6 categories of vehicular traffic. In addition, the
team used data from the National Roads Studies and Research Center in order to calculate
vehicle operating costs.
3. For purposes of the HDM analysis, traffic data was compressed into five categories of
vehicles (from the seven categories observed): private passenger vehicles; pick-up, jeeps, mini-
trucks and tractors; buses; freight trucks, less than 8 tons; freight trucks, more than 8 tons.
4. Road design characteristics, for both control and project roads, are shown in Table 1.

7. Additional assumptions used in the application of the HDM model include: benefit stream
covering a 15-year period since opening of the road; minor adjustments for maintenance
condition; traffic in opening year estimated from traffic in 1995, decreased by 4 percent
annually. Unit vehicle operating costs, for each type of vehicle, were those currently used by the
MPW. Annual maintenance are based on standards used by the MPW.
8. Rate of Returns. The economic rate of returns obtained by application of the HDM model
and the data and assumptions noted above are presented in Table 4.

Economic Evaluation Without Using HDM model
9. The economic evaluation presented in the main text of the report did not use the HDM
model. It used essentially the key parameters and coefficients of the economic analysis
presented in the Staff Appraisal Report of the most recent Bank highway project, the Secondary,
Tertiary and Rural Roads Project, approved in June 1994. Information in this annex is limited to
complement the data and assumptions presented in the main report. Tables 5 and 6 and their
footnotes provide this complementary information.
