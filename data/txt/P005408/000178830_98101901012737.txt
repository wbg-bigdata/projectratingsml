I. THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR
A. Introduction
1.01     Morocco has a well-developed transportation system, consisting of
26,300 km of paved roads, a railway system of 1,760 km linking most of the
larger cities, six ports serving international trade, and 14 airports
handling scheduled flights. Roads are the dominant mode of inland
transportation, accounting for about 95 percent of total passenger-km and
about 60 percent of freight ton-km. Transportation services are operated
variously by wholly private, wholly government-owned or mixed capital
enterprises in a framework of government regulation of pricing and service
levels.
1.02     The system provides a satisfactory level of service in many
respects, but there remains considerable potential for reducing transport
costs and improving service levels in particular localities and for
particular segmernts of the transportation market. Furthermore, much of the
basic transportation infrastructure was completed twenty or thirty years
ago, and is now in need of renewal or upgrading to meet the evolving needs
of the 1980's. During the short-lived phosphate boom of the mid-1970's,
large-scale investments in new ports and railway lines were begun, whose
completion has imposed a heavy financing burden on the State in the
conditions of austerity that have prevailed since 1978. At the same time,
most of the public-sector transportation companies are operating in deficit,
adding to the demands on government funds.
1.03     Efforts to remedy particular weaknesses in the system and to
accommodate growth in demand therefore have to rely, in the short term at
least, on a minimum of new infrastructure. This can best be done by: (a)
concentrating available investment funds on the maintenance and
rehabilitation of the existing capital stock; and (b) raising the system's
productivity through changes in the organization, management and regulation
of transportation services.  For the longer term, the Government's
investment priorities in the transportation sector are: (a) to provide
facilities required by development projects in industry and agriculture; (b)
to help raise the productivity of the rural population; and (c) to limit
investments in new major facilities to projects with high and quick returns.
1.04     The proposed project addresses several of the above issues, in that
it aims to:
-    lend support to the priority given to maintenance;
-    help meet the rural needs;
-    strengthen the institutions responsible for the analysis of
transportation investments;
-    provide financing for an important section of new highway that has
satisfied rigorous analysis as to its likely economic return; and
-    focus attention on the productivity of transportation services.

B. Government Involvement in the Sector
1.05     Several branches of Government are involved in the transportation
system, the main ones being the "Ministere de l'Equipement" (Ministry of
Public Works - MPW), which is responsible for road construction and
maintenance and for the ports, and the Ministry of Transportation (MOT),
which regulates private road transportation and supervises the railway,
civil aviation, the state-owned bus company and the state-owned freight
forwarding agency. The Ministry of the Interior is responsible, through the
local communities, for local roads and urban bus companies. Transportation
infrastructure planning is coordinated by the Ministry of Planning. The MOT
was set up in 1977; many of its functions were previously carried out by the
MPW.
1.06     The 1981-85 Development Plan provides for a substantial increase in
transportation investments compared with the two previous plans, even
allowing for inflation (see Table 1.1). It proposes public sector
investments at a level of about DH3.6 billion (US$590 million) per year in
1980 prices. It seems likely that shortage of financing will limit actual
expenditures to between one half and two-thirds of this level.
C. Road Transportation
1.07     Road transportation in Morocco, as in most countries, plays an
important and multipurpose role in the economy. About half of all intercity
passenger travel is by bus, and more than five-sixths of all freight other
than phosphate moves by road. Many industries rely heavily on road
transportation for supplying their markets, and the agricultural sector is
almost entirely dependent on it for distributing production to markets in
the urban areas and to the ports. Details on the sub-sector are given in
Chapter II.
D. Railways
1.08     The Moroccan railway "Office National des Chemins de Fer" plays an
important role in the phosphate industry, in transporting phosphate rock
from the mines to Casablanca and Safi for export. Beyond that the railway's
role is limited, due partly to the structure of freight flows, which are
predominantly over distances too short for a railway to compete successfully
with road transportation. Furthermore, government intervention to hold down
rates and fares and to provide discounts to specific interest groups has
pushed the railway into serious deficit, thereby depriving it of the means
to upgrade services and attract new customers.
1.09     A major investment has been made in double-tracking the
Casablanca - Rabat line without adequate economic analysis. It was not
required to meet a cost of capital criterion and it appears that here, as in
recent proposals for new lines in other parts of the country or
double-tracking the existing line from Rabat to Fes, the economic advantages
of rail vis-a-vis competing road services have been overstated.

1.10     The Bank has brought this matter to the Government's attention in
its review of the Five-Year Plan ("Priorities for Public Sector Investment",
green cover, November 1982). On the commercial side, it is hoped that a
study of railway operating costs to be carried out for the MOT under the
Bank's Third Highway Project will provide a basis for aligning tariffs more
closely with costs. Also, a survey of the freight transportation market
under the proposed fourth project should help identify those segments of the
market for which the railway has the most to offer.
E.  Ports and Shipp2ing
1.11     More than half of all traffic through Morocco's ports is phosphate,
in the form of either rock or phosphoric acid. For example, in 1979 18.1
million tons of phosphate rock were exported from Casablanca and Safi and
another 0.8 million tons of acid from Safi, out of a total traffic (imports
and exports combined) of 33.6 million tons. The second largest commodity
category in Morocco's international trade is oil: 6 million tons were
handled in 1979, most of it crude oil imported through Mohammedia. The use
of containers for general cargo is growing rapidly; in 1979 0.6 million tons
of imports and exports were containerized, about a quarter of all
potentially containerizable cargo. As in many developing countries, the
number of containers arriving far exceeds the demand in the outbound
direction. A ports master plan now nearing completion foresees that the
volume of container traffic will double in about six years, and account for
about 40% of containerizable cargo by 1986. About half a million tons of
citrus are exported each year, mostly through Casablanca and Agadir. The
traffic puts a strain on port facilities because of its highly seasonal and
perishable nature; a fourth of the yearly total is exported in the peak
month.
1.12     Casablanca has traditionally been the country's principal port,
handling about three-fifths of all traffic. The construction from scratch
of new ports at Jorf Lasfar, Tan Tan and Tarfaya, begun in the mid-1970's
and now nearing completion, was motivated by a desire to draw traffic away
from Casablanca and thus reduce congestion there. However, for general
cargo, particularly container traffic, Casablanca will retain a significant
advantage because of its proximity to major hinterland markets and because
of technical and administrative economies of scale.
1.13     The Government is therefore now preparing a project for possible
Bank financing in FY84 that would involve expanding container handling and
roll-on/roll-off facilities at Casablanca, rehabilitating various other
facilities and providing technical assistance aimed at raising port
productivity.
F. Previous Projects
1.14     The Bank has financed the construction or improvement of main roads
under three previous highway projects and of rural feeder roads under ten
agricultural projects (see Table 1.2). While the latter have met specific

needs as part of agricultural development "packages," the former have more
generally encouraged the allocation of resources to high-return projects,
particularly maintenance and rehabilitation, and helped build up the
staffing and organization of the agencies responsible for road construction
and maintenance and for transport coordination. These processes require
continuing support of key institutions if earlier progress is to be
consolidated, an important consideration in determining the composition of
this project.
1.15     The First Highway Project, for which a combined loan and credit
totalling US$14.6 million equivalent was signed in November 1969 (Loan
642-MOR/Credit 167-MOR), included construction of a new highway linking
Marrakech to Agadir, a program of localized improvements on selected primary
roads, and the purchase of maintenance equipment and spare parts. The
project was completed in a timely way in 1975 with only minor cost
overruns. Institutional benefits included the good performance of local
contractors and efficient construction supervision undertaken by Moroccan
engineers of the MPW (see Project Performance Audit Report of April 1977).
1.16     A transportation survey also carried out under the First Highway
Project laid the ground work for the Second Highway Project five years
later, for which a US$29 million loan (955-MOR) was signed in January 1974.
This consisted of; (a) construction of part of the Casablanca-Rabat
expressway; (b) a further program of localized road improvements throughout
the country; (c) renewal and some expansion of maintenance equipment; (d)
traffic studies for Casablanca and Rabat; and (e) technical assistance for
setting up a transportation planning office. The loan was closed in June
1980, three years later than planned at appraisal, due principally to a
problem with the contractor for the Casablanca-Rabat expressway.
Nonetheless, the quality of work was good and the project achieved its
objectives of improving traffic conditions on a number of main roads,
improving highway maintenance, and helping to set up a transportation
planning organization (see Project Performance Audit Report of July 1982).
1.17     To draw more attention to the need for maintenance and
rehabilitation, the Third Highway Project, begun in 1980, is financing a
portion of the RD's program of resurfacing and pavement strengthening over 3
1/2 years, purchase of road maintenance and pavement evaluation equipment
and a study into the organization of road maintenance. For this purpose
loan 1830-MOR of US$62 million equivalent was signed in May 1980. The
project also includes a set of studies into the pricing and organization of
various transportation services under the aegis of the MOT, the purchase of
vehicle weighing scales to aid in the enforcement of weight limits, and a
study on how to improve the road maintenance organisation.
1.18     After a slow start, contracts for almost all the civil works had
been awarded by the end of 1982. The annual maintenance action plan
required by a loan covenant has helped the MPW to limit the reduction in the
real value of its budget allocation for maintenance, despite budget
stringency elsewhere. The MOT components are about 18 months behind
schedule because of delays in hiring consultants for the pricing and



- 7 -
organization studies and in procuring the weighing scales. Disbursements
from the loan have lagged behind appraisal forecasts, partly because
contractors have been slow in starting the works, partly because the RD has
been slow in submitting withdrawal applications. The appreciation of the
dollar has also reduced the dollar value of disbursements. In keeping with
the time-slice concept of the project, the Government and Bank have
therefore agreed to increase the amount of pavement strengthening and road
maintenance equipment, while adding vehicles for transporting maintenance
crews, and studies that have helped prepare the Fourth Highway Project. The
RTD has now taken steps to speed up disbursements, and the project is still
expected to be completed by the originally scheduled closing date of
June 30, 1984.
1.19     These three highway projects have focussed exclusively on primary
and secondary roads, on the grounds that, as a general rule, roads carrying
the most traffic deserved priority. Tertiary roads have been allocated
fewer resources, concentrated in areas selected for integrated rural
development projects or other agricultural projects. The Bank's involvement
in financing such roads has encouraged the Ministry of Agriculture and
Agrarian Reform and the MPW to cooperate more closely and consistently in
determining appropriate design standards and in making arrangements for
maintenance of these lower-level roads.
II. THE ROADS SUBSECTOR
A. Road Transportation Demand
2.01     Morocco has a relatively high level of vehicle ownership compared
to other countries at its income level, in the range 15-20 per thousand
persons (exact data on the number of vehicles in use are not available).
Traffic volumes on the main highways are also high: some 5,000 km out of
the total paved network of over 26,000 km carry more than 1,000 vehicles per
day. Trucks commonly account for 20-30% of all traffic on roads. During
much of the 1970's traffic grew vigorously, at 6-10% per year on many
roads. This growth trend has been interrupted since 1978 by the difficult
economic conditions and the 1980-81 drought. The amounts that road users
spend on vehicle operation are nonetheless considerable, on the order of DH
10-15 billion (US$1.6-2.5 billion) per year, of which taxes (fuel taxes,
customs duties and vehicle licenses, etc.) account for 25-30%.
2.02     The number of road accidents is a cause for serious concern.  In
recent years there have been at least 24,000-28,000 accidents per year, and
2,200-2,700 persons killed. The death rate in relation to the amount of
traffic is at least double that in several countries of southern Europe.
Statistical analysis of the causes is not yet available; the MPW is making
efforts to improve the reporting of accidents, as a first step toward
identifying appropriate preventive measures.
B. Organization of Road Transportation Services
2.03     Most interurban bus and truck services are operated by small
private companies or co-operatives. Buses are licensed as to routes and



-8-
service frequencies and must apply fares set by the Ministry of
Transportation. A nationalized bus company operates first-class services on
main intercity routes; it accounts for about 10% of the market. The
trucking market is divided into three segments: (a) trucks below 3.0 tons
capacity, i.e. 5.5 tons gross vehicle weight (GVW); (b) own-account vehicles
over 5.5 tons GVW; and (c) common-carrier trucks over 5.5 tons GVW. The
purchase and operation of small trucks is unregulated, whereas licenses for
the purchase of large own-account trucks are restricted to companies who can
demonstrate that their sales and transportation requirements exceed certain
thresholds. Applicants for common-carrier licenses similarly have to prove
a community need for their services; applications have to go through a
cumbersome procedure of approval by first provincial then national
governmental license commissions.
2.04     The operators of large common-carrier trucks have to be affiliated
to their local branch of the "Office National des Transports" (ONT), a
public agency which has a monopoly of freight forwarding services. The ONT
acts as a marketing and billing agency, applying standardized ton-km rates
set by the MOT and charging 6% of the freight rate as its commission. It
also makes sure that carriers have appropriate insurance coverage. All
licensed carriers are required to use these services, except in Casablanca,
where they may negotiate business directly with customers up to certain
limits. The ONT dispatchers distribute shipments among their affiliated
truckers in proportion to each carrier's capacity, and reserve a portion for
out-of-city truckers seeking back-hauls. Those for whom no back-haul load
is available receive a compensation payment funded out of an additional 8%
levy on all freight charges. Each ONT terminal has a small warehouse for
consolidating and distributing less-than-truckload shipments. Its 6%
commission allows ONT to make a modest profit.
2.05     The ONT therefore seeks to capture for shippers and truckers the
economies of scale inherent in a unified marketing system. To its customers
it offers the advantages of advertised rates, standardized billing
procedures and guaranteed insurance coverage, and to the trucker it provides
overhead services that most operators could not afford to provide for
themselves (most have fewer than five trucks). But the system also has
disadvantages compared to a market where private freight forwarders compete
for business and where truckers and customers are free to negotiate directly
if they prefer. Firstly, the system of distributing shipments evenly among
carriers gives them little incentive to improve their performance by running
a greater distance each year, raising their payload factor or minimizing
empty backhauls. Secondly, the Government's control over rates and its
reluctance to raise them to keep up with inflation have allowed truckers
insufficient profits to renew their fleet. As a result many ONT trucks are
old models overdue for replacement and costly to keep operating. Thirdly,
many unpaved roads are accessible only to small trucks, but since small
trucks are allowed no access to the ONT terminals, any long-distance haul
whose origin is off the paved network has to be performed entirely by the
small trucks, even though a large-capacity truck might be half as costly for
the line haul.
2.06     Overall, the disadvantages of the system appear to outweigh the



-9-
advantages. The breakdown of truck traffic suggests that much of the market
prefers not to use ONT's services, for reasons which have not been clearly
established. An origin-destination survey in 1977 under the Bank's Second
Highway Project found that the trucks under 5.5 tons were performing as much
as 39% of all ton-km and large own-account vehicles 40%, leaving the ONT
trucks only 21%. In principle, large common-carrier trucks have a
significant cost advantage over small trucks because of their higher ratio
of payload to deadload and their access to ONT's marketing services. They
also have an advantage over own-account trucks because of their
opportunities for more intensive utilization. One would therefore expect
them to have a considerably larger market share. The cost to the economy of
this misallocation of traffic is considerable. A very rough estimate is
that a shift to larger, more intensively used trucks could reduce total
trucking costs by US$40-80 million per year net of taxes (see para. 4.22).
2.07     The Government is eager to improve the distribution of traffic, but
opinions are divided as to whether responsibility lies with the operators of
small trucks, who practise widespread overloading, or with the licensing
system, or with ONT.  To assist it in resolving this issue, the project will
include a survey of the freight market and review of trucking organization,
licensing and regulation (para. 3.19-20).  Outside the project ONT intends
to arrange vocational training for staff of the terminals and affiliated
trucking cooperatives, and to construct three new freight terminals.
C. The Road Network
2.08     The road network is adequate in density in most parts of the
country to satisfy the demand that we have briefly described. The road
classification system is being revised, but the present breakdown is as
follows:
Table 2.1: ROAD NETWORK BY CLASSIFICATION, 1982 (km)
Paved           Unpaved           Total
Primary                   8,739             1,709            10,448
Secondary                 6,077             2,556            8,633
Tertiary                 11,478            27,256           381734
TOTAL                    26,294            31,521           57,815
% of Total                   45                55               100
Source: Ministry of Public Works, June 1982
2.09     Over the past five years, additions to the paved network have
averaged only 325 km per year, or 1% of the existing paved length. The
corresponding figure for unpaved roads is 190 km. Between 80 and 90% of all
traffic runs on the paved primary and secondary roads. The geometric design
standards of the classified roads are generally satisfactory, but the



- it -
pavements, commonly a surface dressing on a crushed stone base, are
increasingly becoming inadequate to carry present traffic.
2.10     The maximum authorized gross vehicle weight limit is 38 tons, with
maximum axle loads set at 13 tons. The National Highway Master Plan prepared
by consultants in 1976 found that trucks exceeding 10 tons in gross weight
account for about 11-13% of total traffic. The spectrum of axle loading is
not well known, as only one survey of axle loads has been carried out. This
survey, made between July 1977 and May 1978, showed that the average heavy
vehicle nas 2.3 axles and a load factor of 0.94 equivalent standard axles
(8.2t). This result indicates that the current traffic has a relatively low
impact on road deterioration, as is demonstrated by the fact that a need for
pavement strengthening has been felt only in recent years.
2.11     Enforcement of axle-load limits or total vehicle weights is almost
nonexistent, because of a lack of weighing equipment. This situation is
expected to improve in the near future since the Third Highway Project is
financing the purchase of portable scales and fixed weighbridges. Overloading
of trucks is widespread but generally confined to trucks with a gross weight
tip to 5.5 tons, as these trucks are unregulated and the truckers often load
all the freight they can find. Larger trucks, in contrast, get their freight
mostly through the ONT, which can exert a degree of control over the
payloads.
D. Administration
2.12     The MPW's Roads and Traffic Department (RTD), whose organization is
shown on the attached chart, is responsible for the design, construction and
maintenance of the classified road network. The headquarters, however, deals
only with matters of general planning, coordination and supervision, since the
district offices have a large degree of autonomy in planning, contract award
and administration, and supervision of works. The field organization has been
expanded recently and now consists of 35 provincial offices, grouped under
seven regional offices, with 70 subdivisions. There is continuous contact
between the headquarters and the engineers in charge of the district offices,
which allows problems to be identified and solved quickly.
2.13     RTD's organization is quite adequate to deal with the road network
under its authority, but it could improve its efficiency by organizing its
services better and introducing new techniques. The RTD has already taken a
first step in this direction with the study into the organization of road
maintenance being financed under the Third Highway Project. The next steps
planned are the strengthening of the economic studies, management systems and
maintenance staff. The RTD has asked the Bank to provide technical assistance
for this purpose under the proposed project (para. 3.22).
E. Planning
2.14     The final proposals for investments to be included in a five-year
plan are based on a process which involves all levels of RTD's offices down to
the subdivision, taking into account both economic analyses and consideration
of the wishes of the population. The proposed investment program approved by



- 11 -
RTD's management is then sent to the Ministry of Finance for review in the
light of financial constraints, then to the Parliament for final approval.
The road-related items in the proposed project are included in the 1981-1985
Development Plan with the possibility of transferring unspent amounts to
subsequent years.
2.15     Road maintenance is planned by the regional offices through the
subdivisions on the basis of maintenance standards prepared by the central
Road Maintenance Division. These standards are adequate to keep the roads in
satisfactory condition, but budget constraints generally reduce the planned
operations. The selection of priority roads to maintain is then made on the
basis of economic evaluation, where the primary consideration is the traffic
level.
2.16     The National Center for Pavement Evaluation ("Centre National
d'Auscultation des Chaussees" - CNAC), which is being equipped under the Third
Highway Project and receives technical assistance from the Belgian aid
program, will shortly start to collect information on road deterioration,
which will help improve the planning of road maintenance, including pavement
strengthening.
F. Financing
2.17     Funds for road investment and maintenance on the classified network
are allocated out of the MPW's budget, which is included in the Government's
yearly general budget. The current five-year plan has set optimistic
objectives for roads, allocating them DH 3.5 billion (US$574 million).
Table 2.2 shows the amounts spent for road investment during 1978-1980, and
the amounts provided in the Plan for 1981-1985. The latter are based on
end-1980 prices and may be revised for price inflation according to the
current financial situation. During 1981, the first year of the Plan, only
65% of the allocated amount was committed. The current budgetary constraints
suggest that this trend will continue during the remaining years of the Plan.
2.18     Based on an early estimate of the proposed project's cost, the Plan
includes DH 678 million for the road-related components during the years
1982-85, and DH 100 million in 1986. These amounts are in line with the
estimated cost of the project as shown in Table 3.2 (DH 802 million). The
amount for the freight market study is not provided for in the Plan, but the
RTD has agreed to make the required amount available from its own budget.
G. Budgetary System and Financial Control
2.19     The main features of the Moroccan budgetary system, as applicable to
the proposed project, are given in Annex I. The capital budget comprises
multi-annual commitment authorizations, which cover award of contracts to be
carried out over more than one year, and corresponding annual payment
authorizations to cover invoices received during the fiscal year. This
technique is well suited for the proposed project. Another favorable feature
is that the capital budget covers the totality of project costs without regard
to the financial sources; thus, even if external financing is not forthcoming,
the budgetary instrument exists to start implementing projects.

2.20     Each investment project (or group of projects) is identified by a
line ("ligne budgetaire") in the capital budget and in the utilization program
("programme d'emploi") agreed upon between the Ministry of Finance and the
technical ministries. In June 1982 it was agreed between the Government and
the Bank that each Bank-financed project component would be identified by a
line for easy reference and monitoring of counterpart funds (para. 3.36).
2.21     The accounting system in the MPW and MOT and the related internal and
external control procedures are also described in Annex I. Although
cumbersome, these procedures are considered suitable for the purposes of the
proposed project.
H. Engineering
2.22     The RTD's Studies Division is responsible for preparing major highway
projects. The division's staff is well qualified, particularly in
engineering, but is insufficient in number to carry out much design work
in-house. The long-term goal of RTD's management is to increase the staff by
employing newly graduated engineers and enhance their experience on the job.
The technical staff in the field is also satisfactorily qualified and is able
to prepare minor engineering designs.



- 13 -
2.23     Several domestic consulting firms are now available for medium-sized
projects. Designs and feasibility studies for major roads and bridges are
generally prepared by foreign consulting firms, some of which have established
local branches.
2.24     Highway design standards were prepared in 1978; explanations and
examples have been added for easy interpretation by the field staff. These
standards, which are satisfactory, cover four different categories of roads
whose design speed ranges from 60 km/h to 120 km/h. In exceptional cases,
however, such as the Casablanca-Rabat expressway, special standards are
adopted.
2.25     The domestic engineering capability is complemented by the
semi-public soil tests and studies laboratory ("Laboratoire Public d'Essais et
d'Etudes" - LPEE) which can carry out all soil and material tests required for
civil works, as well as engineering studies such as road strengthening and
pavement design. The LPEE's staff is well trained and has acquired experience
by preparing all road strengthening studies for the earlier Bank-financed
highway projects and some preparatory studies for this project.
I. Construction
2.26     Construction, improvement and strengthening works are undertaken by
contract. There is a sufficiently equipped domestic road contracting
industry, including about eight major firms capable of carrying out relatively
large works and of implementing the amount of road works planned. For this
reason, foreign contractors have not participated in bidding for road
construction in the past several years. Contracts are awarded after
competitive bidding.
2.27     The supervision of construction is carried out by RTD's regional
staff, assisted by the LPEE for the necessary soils and materials' tests. The
LPEE also undertakes some specialized parts of the supervision if the
technical staff in a given region is unable to fulfill all tasks. For major
road construction, the RTD establishes a special supervision office with
engineers and other specialists permanently assigned to the supervision of the
road. The combined capability of RTD and LPEE in supervising road
construction is adequate to deal with contracts as large as those included in
the project.
J. Road Maintenance and Improvement
2.28     Road maintenance needs are reviewed yearly or every second year, and
comprehensive instructions are issued to the regional offices. The field
staff plans the maintenance works on the basis of these instructions and a
general maintenance program is prepared at the headquarters. Road maintenance
is generally limited to paved roads, the unpaved roads receiving attention
only when urgent repairs are needed. Because of the lack of sufficient
facilities, the district offices undertake only minor repairs of the road
equipment fleet. Private workshops carry out large-scale repairs, but the
major overhauls require specialized workshops which are available only in the
principal cities.



- 14 
2.29     Road maintenance equipment is not used as fully as it might be, the
maior reasons being: (i) the long trips that, in many cases, it must do to
reach the sites of maintenance works; and (ii) the extended idle periods
required for major repairs because of the lack of suitable workshops. The
former obstacle has been partially removed by increasing the number of field
offices (para. 2.12) and is expected to be fully removed with the purchase of
additional equipmernt uinder the proposed project. To reduce the idle time
because of repairs that cannot be done in the field workshops, the RTD
envisages building and equipping a central workshop, two major regional
workshops and minor ones in those districts which still have no facilities.
The project will finance construction and equipment of the central and
regional workshops (para. 3.12).
2.30     Until 1979 funds for road maintenance were sufficient for only a
limited level of maintenance.  In the following years, however, the budgeted
amounts increased noticeably tc satisfy the commitment the Government
undertook at the negotiations for the Third Highway Project (Table 2.3).
Although the amounts budgeted for road maintenance even exceeded the agreed
amounts, the executed maintenance programs could not always reflect the agreed
quantities oecause of inflation, which increased the cost of materials,

particularly bitumen. Despite these shortcomings, however, the RTD was able
to carry out an acceptable maintenance program for the primary and secondary
road networks. The tertiary roads, which have been the least maintained over
the years, in 1982 received double the amount of funds allocated in 1981,
which should make possible a substantial improvement in their condition.
K. Training
2.31     Most engineers recruited by the RTD during the last few years
graduated from the Ecole Hassania des Travaux Publics et des Communications,
which was established in Casablanca in 1974 and is managed by MPW itself,
and the Ecole Mohammedia in Rabat. These schools have reduced the number of
students going abroad for engineering studies and increased the number of
engineers available. This has helped the building up of the highway
organization, which is now totally staffed by Moroccan engineers. Foreign
technical assistance is reduced to only two experts. Several other schools
assisted by the MPW train middle-level technicians in the major cities.
2.32     The RTD's long-term objective is to set up a permanent training
center for all road maintenance technicians. The ongoing study into the
organization of road maintenance (para. 2.13) includes the evaluation of
training needs and all other information required to recommend the
organization of a training center, a training program, and curricula. The
study will also draft a preliminary layout of the training center and a list
of the required teaching equipment. The study is expected to be completed in
the second half of 1983 and the technical assistance to RTD's maintenance
division (para. 3.23) will help implement the study's recommendations.
2.33     Several training activities are being carried out pending
construction of a permanent training center. The RTD organizes seminars for
its engineers, often inviting foreign experts to lecture, and the Hassania
engineering school holds refresher courses. The district engineers gather
together regularly at the headquarters to discuss common problems and exchange
views on new techniques. At a lower level, equipment operators and mechanics
are trained through refresher courses in each district. When new types of
equipment are purchased, the procurement contracts regularly include training
for operators and mechanical personnel. Of particular importance is a
training program connected with a large-scale purchase of equipment (about
US$40 million worth, financed with suppliers' credits) for the construction
and maintenance of provincial and communal roads to be carried out by the
local authorities with technical assistance from the RTD. Under this program
about 400 mechanical personnel will be trained by 28 Moroccan instructors,
previously trained by six foreign experts who will assist the instructors
during the first phase of their activity. This program includes the
construction of a training workshop, and the purchase of equipment and tools,
including audio-visual equipment. These actions will ensure sufficient
training of road maintenance personnel until more specific courses can be
organized on the basis of the recommendations of the road maintenance study.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01     The project is predicated on the objectives for the road subsector
defined in the 1981-85 development plan:
(a)  maintain and rehabilitate the primary and secondary networks
to adapt them to modern traffic demands and improve their safety;
(b)  improve and expand the provincial network (secondary and tertiary
roads) to help alleviate rural poverty; and
(c)  support major industrial and agricultural development projects.
Accordingly, the object of the proposed project is to lower transport costs in
Morocco and help reduce income disparities between different regions. The
program of road works, which includes road strengthening, improvement and
construction, aims at a balance between the needs of the main highways and
those of the provincial roads. The project includes also components aimed at
reinforcing the process of strengthening the institutions for road maintenance
and improvement and raising the productivity of road transport services.
B. Project Description
3.02     The proposed project consists of:
I.   Road Infrastructure
(a)  Road works:
(i)  continuation of the RTD's pavement strengthening and
improvement program;
(ii) reconstruction of bridges;
(iii) pilot program of improvements to provincial roads; and
(iv) completion of the Casablanca-Rabat expressway;
(b)  Continued maintenance of the classified network (paved and
unpaved), including construction of three workshops for road
maintenance equipment, renewal and expansion of the equipment
fleet, and procurement of workshop equipment; and
(c) A further economic and engineering study of provincial roads.
II.   Road Transport Productivity
A study of the freight transport market.
III.   Institution Building
Strengthening; (i) the planning and studies department of the MPW;
and (ii) the studies, management systems and road maintenance
divisions of the RTD.

Pavement Strengtheng and Improvement
3.03     In continuation of the program started under the ongoing Third
Highway Project (para. 1.17), the proposed project provides for a line of
credit for the strengthening and improvement of about 470 km of primary and
secondary roads. The road sections have been selected from a list of 800 km
included in the 1981-85 Development Plan. This list was derived from an
initial study by consultants as part of a government-financed National Highway
Master Plan in 1976-77 and involving 7,300 km of roads, as well as
investigations by the LPEE and CNAC. The technical and economic study which
has led to the final selection from this list was made by consultants in
1981-82 (para. 3.14). The major components of the work will be adding a layer
of either asphaltic concrete, gravel topped by a wearing course of double
surface treatment or gravel topped by asphaltic concrete, the choice depending
on the volume of traffic. In addition, most sections will require ancillary
works such as widening where necessary, restoring shoulders, and repairing and
improving drainage facilities. No realigning work is envisaged.
Reconstruction of Big
3.04     A survey of bridges on the primary and secondary road networks
carried out by the LPEE in 1980 indicated that: (i) some bridges were
structurally unsafe and their permissible live load had to be reduced; (ii)
other bridges were not wide enough for the traffic; and (iii) some others
constituted a black spot because of their layouts and access ramps. The
consultants studied in detail about twenty bridges, selected on the basis of
traffic volumes and the importance of the road they served, and concluded that
the works on fifteen bridges were justified, of which fourteen are included in
the project. Their location is shown on the map. Details of the evaluation
are given in Chapter 4.
3.05     The fourteen bridges present a diversity of spans ranging from about
17 m to one multi-span, 160 m long bridge. Generally, they are old bridges
which were not designed for modern heavy trucks, or whose load-carrying
capacity has been reduced by the settling of foundation soils or, in some
cases, insufficient maintenance. In several cases, the bridge reconstruction
is associated with a road realignment which selects a more suitable crossing
point and, in most cases, a reduction in length of the road. The location,
physical data, and estimated costs of the proposed works are shown in Annex II.
Pilot Program of Provincial Road Improvements
3.06     In 1976 the RTD commissioned and financed a study by Louis Berger
(USA) on the need for provincial roads. The consultant identified about 8,000
km which should be constructed or upgraded to help the economic, social and
administrative development of the various regions. A limited length of these
provincial roads are included in the project as a pilot program to help (i)
define the most suitable economic evaluation methodology; and (ii) study the
organizational problems regarding the construction of minor roads scattered
over the country, in preparation for a possible Fifth Highway Project devoted
mainly to such roads.

of paved roads, which includes surface dressings and, where the traffic
warrants, asphaltic concrete overlays, will be carried out on the basis of
RTD's established frequencies, which are satisfactory.
3.12     As explained in para. 2.29, the proposed project provides financing
for the construction and equipping of a central workshop in Casablanca, where
major overhauls will be done on a carefully planned rotation basis, and two
regional workshops in Fes and Marrakech, which will handle intermediate
repairs. The estimated cost of this project item is shown in Annex III.
3.13     The RTD has made an extensive analysis of the equipment needed to
carry out a reasonable level of routine maintenance on the paved network. The
analysis took into consideration the equipment to be scrapped because it is
too old to be repaired economically, and the equipment recently purchased or
to be purchased with government funds (Annex IV). The Government has made a
big effort in buying about DH 240 million (US$40 million) of equipment for the
construction and maintenance of provincial and communal roads (para. 2.33).
Part of this equipment, however, will replace worn-out maintenance equipment
and will be used to carry out some maintenance operations on the main network
and is included in the RTD's analysis. The additional equipment proposed for
purchase under the project (Annex V) is therefore the minimum amount needed to
meet the maintenance needs during the project years. It will be procured in
two lots, in 1983 and 1984.
3.14     The equipment available after the new purchases under the project
will be sufficient for a satisfactory level of road maintenance, but the
Government does not as yet provide for the renewal of worn-out equipment on a
regular basis. The ongoing road maintenance study (para. 1.17) will
recommend, inter alia, ways to ensure the availability of funds for adequate
equipment renewal. Until the RTD is able to set up such a system, and, in any
case not before 1986, when the next development plan comes into effect,
equipment will be renewed on a limited basis as permitted by the funds
allocated for this purpose under the current development plan.
Detailed Engineering of Project Road Works
3.15     The road works included in  the project have been the subject of
feasibility studies carried out by the French consultants, SETEC, under
financing from the Third Highway Project (para. 1.18). For the
Casablanca-Rabat expressway the study was an update of the feasibility study
made in 1971 by BCEOM (France) under the First Highway Project; the detailed
engineering was financed under the Second Highway Project.
3.16     Preliminary engineering of most pavement strengthening and
improvement works was carried out satisfactorily by the LPEE. SETEC based
their economic evaluation on those designs. The alternative selected after
testing with the Highway Design and Maintenance model (para. 4.03) will be
used as the final design for each road section. With regard to bidding
documents, it will be sufficient to agree with the RTD on a standard type of
contract as used under the Third Highway Project for similar works, where only
the description of works changed from section to section, while the general
specifications remained the same.



20 
3.17     The RTD has prepared detailed designs for the bridges and has
submitted the bidding documents for the bridges to be reconstructed during the
first year of the project. Similar documentation for each following project
year will have to be submitted to the Bank, for review and comment, on or
before October 31 of the preceding year.
3.18     Regarding the provincial roads, the final engineering and bidding
documents for about 100 km of provincial roads are already available. The
documents for the remaining roads, including the economic evaluation for those
justified on the basis of agricultural development (pare. 4.14), should be
ready for Bank review and comments, in lo.s of about 70 km, by October 31 of
each year for construction during the following year.
Provincial Roads Study, 'Seond Phase
3.19     The feasibility study on provincial roads carried out in preparation
for this project broke new ground for the RTD in the attention it paid to
agricultural production as the main justification for low-standard roads in
ruraL areas. The results, discussed in Chapter 4, indicate that the
traditional approach of predicting savings in vehicle operating costs may have
substantially understated the economic impact of such roads. However, there
is as yet little reliable data on such key aspects as the size of the zone of
influence, the extent of yield increases and the interaction of road
investments and agricultural investments. The project will therefore include
a further study of the same type (about 60 man-months), aimed at setting up a
monitoring system for measuring the impact of the roads constructed under the
Pilot Program, improving data collection procedures and refining the methods
for forecasting changes in farming practices. From this study will emerge a
program of provincial road improvements that could be financed by the Bank
under the possible Fifth Highway Project.
Freight Market Survey and Review of Trucking Regulatory System
3.20     To address the freight allocation issue described in paras.
2.03-2.07, the MOT's Planning Department and the RTD intend to hire
consultants to carry out a users' survey. Its purpose would be to identify
the requirements and preferences of different market segments as to cost,
speed, reliability and flexibility; to assess the strengths and weaknesses of
the regulated and unregulated trucking sectors and the railway in meeting
these requirements; and to explore possible changes in the existing
organizational set-up, licensing and operating regulations. The study will
require about 45 man-months of consultant time; the MOT will provide survey
personnel. Draft ter-ms of reference, which were confirmed with the Government
at negotiations, are available on file.
3.21     Since there are no funds in the MOT's plan allocation for this
purpose, the Government will provide funding for the study from the RTD's
budget (para. 2.18). To urge the Government to implement the study without
delay, the invitation to consultants to submit proposals for the study is a
condition of loan effectiveness. This is expected to take place by



- 21 -
June 30, 1983. The loan agreement also provides for implementation by the
Government of those of the study's recommendations upon which it reaches
agreement with the Bank.
Technical Assistance to MPW's Planning and Studies Department
3.22     The Minister of Public Works decided early in 1982 to strengthen his
central advisory staff responsible for providing guidance on economic
methodology and exercising quality control over the planning studies prepared
by the roads, ports and dams departments. This central staff will also carry
out economic studies that cannot conveniently be delegated to one or other of
the technical departments, on such subjects as port/road interface facilities
or, possibly, certain energy issues. To provide the personnel of this
Planning and Studies Department (who are mostly engineers) with on-the-job
training in economic planning methods, the Ministry has asked that the project
finance the services of a transportation economist and a water resources
economist, each for two years. Draft terms of reference are available on file.
Technical Assistance to RTD's Studies,
Management Systems and Maintenance Divisions
3.23     The framework of actions envisaged by the RTD to improve its
efficiency includes the strengthening of: (i) a Planning and Economic Studies
Section attached to the Studies Division; (ii) the Management Systems
Division, which is still in the initial stage; and (iii) the Road Maintenance
Division. The first will help satisfy the need for the economic analysis of
roads, which is presently carried out by consultants. The second is expected
to make administrative procedures more efficient through the adoption of
modern management techniques, while its data service will improve the
collection of statistical information on roads (traffic, accidents, etc.), as
well as the flow of technical and financial data from the field offices to the
headquarters. And the third will improve road maintenance by making its
management more efficient.  The RTD has therefore requested that an expert be
assigned to each division for a two-year period. These services will be
financed under the project. Outline terms of reference have been discussed
and are available in the project file.
C. Cost Estimates
3.24     The total capital cost of the project, including taxes and import
duties, is estimated at US$131 million equivalent, with a foreign cost of
US$72 million (55%). The cost of individual project items is summarized in
Table 3.1. The base cost estimates have been updated to February 1983 prices
from the available June 1982 prices; the price contingencies shown in the
table take into account the following rates of inflation:
Year           1983      1984     1985      1986      1987

connected with bridge foundations; (ii) 7.5% on the completion of the
Casablanca-Rabat expressway; and (iii) 5% on the equipment, to allow for
slight variations in technical specifications at the time of bidding. The
maintenance expenditures during the project period (mid-1983 to end-1987),
comprising routine and periodic maintenance are estimated at US$155 million
equivalent, with a 48% foreign component of US$75 million (Table 3.2). The
aggregate of capital and maintenance expenditures is US$287 million and its
foreign component is US$147 million (51%).
3.25      The cost estimate for the pavement strengthening program is derived
from the average cost per kilometer of such works determined by the
consultants for some 680 km of roads studied. The cost of reconstruction of
bridges is the estimate made by the RTD's district offices for the bridges
within their jurisdiction. The cost of the provincial roads was estimated by
the consultants, who also updated the cost of the completion of the expressway
from the 1972 study. The cost of the road maintenance equipment is based on
the cost of similar equipment procured under the Third Highway Project, while
the cost of the workshop construction and equipment was estimated by the RTD.
These estimates are acceptable.
3.26      Consulting services and technical assistance under the project total
about 225 man-months, for a total cost of US$2.6 million excluding
contingencies. About 105 man-months are expected to be provided by consulting
firms at an average cost of US$11,000 per man-month, while individual
consultants will provide the remaining 120 man-months at an average unit cost
of US$7,500. The difference between the total cost of services and the
man-month cost (US$545,000 or an average of US$2,400 per man-month) consists
of reimbursable items such as local travel, cost and operation of vehicles,
other equipment and consumable materials. These estimates are based on
services rendered by foreign consultants, as the domestic consulting firms do
not appear to have sufficient expertise in the required fields.
D. Financing
3.27      The Government and the Bank will finance the total project cost
according to the following plan:

The Bank, however, will finance its share of periodic maintenance costs
indirectly by increasing the disbursement percentage against the project's
capital expenditures (para. 3.38). During negotiations the Government gave an
assurance that it would provide the amounts shown above to ensure the
financing of its share of the project cost.
E. Implementation
3.28     The RTD will be the executing agency for the road components, which
account for over 99 percent of the total project cost. The RTD will also
assist the MOT in conducting the freight market study, and the MPW will
implement the technical assistance for its planning office. The expected
timing of the different project activities and the estimated disbursement

periods are as shown in Table 3.3. Technically, it is possible to complete
the project in about three and a half years, by December 31, 1986, but a
margin of a further year is considered advisable to allow for unforeseen
delays, taking the completion date to December 31, 1987.
3.29     As explained in para. 2.27, the RTD is competent to supervise all the
civil works. Specifically, the district engineers will be responsible for

3.30     T,o enable the Bank to monitor the project's implementation, the
overnmeSnt will prepare and send to the Bank the following reports for review
and co±,rents. (a) t-he planned program of civil works and road maintenance to
be implemented under the project each year, consistent with an action plan to
be agreed with the Bank; this will be sent by September 30 of the preceding
year; and (by quarterly progress reports to be prepared by the MPW, and sent
to Bank with-in tour months of the end of each quarter.  Details of the
financial information to be provided in the quarterly reports are given in
Annex T.  Upon receipt of the Bank's comments on the arinual program of planned
works, the Government should promptly finalize it and return it to the Bank
for informration.  At negotiations, the Government agreed on these procedures.
^-31     The economic evaluation of road strengthening and provincial roads
has had to rely on data that is incomplete and research whose applicability.
Morocco has not yet been tested. In particular, (i) the actual relationship
between the deterioraticn of newly strengthened roads and traffic and
technical parameters such as the pavement's modified structural number; and
(ii) the impact that the construction of a provincial road will have on the
traffic and agricuitural development should be carefully monitored.  Since
more reliable infornation would help in preparing future projects, at
negotLations the Government agreed to:
(a)  carry out a program, to be agreed upon with the Bank, of continuous
automatic traffic counts, and measurements of pavement roughness!/,
again to be agreed upon with the Bank, on a number of road sections
carrying various traffic levels and strengthened under the project
with different technical solutions at time intervals depending on the
traffic;
(b)  carry out two one-week traffic counts at semi-annual intervals on the
provincial roads constructed or improved under the project; and
c3  monitor, in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture's
provincial offices concerned, the agricultural development that
occurs after the road construction, including the type, amount and
timiTng of complementary agricultural investments.
The consultants hired for the follow-up provincial roads study will help the
RTD Wi th items (b) and (c).  The Government agreed to send the above
tnftormation to the Bank in semi-annual reports in a format to be agreed upon

with the Bank. In addition, the Government agreed to prepare a project
completion report to be sent to the Bank within six months after the Loan
closing date.
G. Procurement
3.32     Contracts expected to exceed the equivalent of the dollar amounts
shown below will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank's guidelines for procurement:
us$
Civil Works                 2,000,000
Maintenance Equipment         100,000
Workshop Equipment             50,000
Based on the experience obtained from previous Bank-financed highway
projects in Morocco, the recommended threshold for civil works is a
conservative one. All contracts for maintenance equipment are expected to
exceed the relevant threshold. In view of the availability of local
representatives of the major equipment manufacturers, and the established
competence and competitiveness of the domestic contractors, all other
contracts will be let under local competitive bidding procedures, which are
acceptable to the Bank; these biddings will be open to foreign firms.
Wherever feasible, pavement strengthening sections will be grouped for bidding
purposes. Bidders for the expressway and bridge construction will have to be
prequalified. Domestically manufactured goods that meet the condition set in
the guidelines for procurement will be allowed a 15 percent preference margin
or the applicable import duty, whichever is lower, in the comparison of bids.
3.33     It is RTD's established practice to procure the bituminous products
needed for civil works from SEBLIMA, the public organization licensed to deal
with such materials in Morocco and the sole company which has the specific
port facilities for handling the unprocessed products and the industrial
equipment to produce the final products. SEBLIMA can obtain lower prices by
competitive tendering for bulk quantities, making this an economic and
efficient way of procurement. In addition, the cost that the contractors
would charge if they were to buy the bitumen under the construction contracts
would be higher than that paid by the RTD, because they would add the overhead
on the buying price. It is estimated that, since the cost the RTD incurs in
dealing with these contracts directly is much lower than it should pay for the
contractor's overhead, the procedure adopted for procuring the bituminous
products results in a saving to the RTD. However, precautions will be taken
to avoid confusion and delays in disbursements from the Loan account deriving
from contracts referring to several civil works, including some which are not
financed by the Bank, as was the case under the Third Highway Project. At
negotiations, the Government agreed to sign individual bitumen contracts with
SEBLIMA for the quantity required for each civil works contract to be financed
by the Bank.



- 28 -
3.34     Consulting services and technical assistance will be provided by
either consulting firms short-listed or individual experts selected by each
executing agency. The qualifications and experience of the consulting firms
or individual experts selected by the Government, as well as the terms and
conditions of contract, should be satisfactory to the Bank.
3.35     Contracts or bidding packages should be submitted for prior review in
accordance with the following thresholds:
Contracts whose cost is expected
Project Item                         to exceed the equivalent of
(a)  All civil works except bridges                 US$2.0 millionl'
(b)  Bridge reconstruction                          US$500,000
(c)  Equipment                                      US$250,000
The above thresholds would lead to prior review of contracts or bidding
packages covering about 80 percent of the total contract amount for the
bridges, 65-80% for the other civil works (depending on the extent to which
they are grouped), and 85% for the equipment.  The lower threshold for bridges
ensures that 7 of the 14 receive prior review, which is advisable because of
their greater technical complexity than the other civil works. Random post
review of awarded contracts below these thresholds will complement the prior
review of procurement documentation. Since the RTD is now well experienced
with the Bank's procurement procedures, the post review of contracts will be
limited to one contract every five submitted. In view of the particular
situation regarding the procurement of bituminous products, the relevant
contracts will be only reviewed to ascertain that each of them refers to a
specific contract for civil works to be financed by the Bank. During
negotiations, the above thresholds for prior review of contracts were agreed
upon with the Government.
H. Accounting and Auditing
3.36     In June 1982, the Government and the Bank agreed that, for easy
reference and monitoring of counterpart funds, each Bank-financed project
component would be identified by a line in the budget accounts. During
negotiations the Government confirmed the application of this procedure to the
proposed project.
3.37     As mentioned in para. 2.21, the accounting systems of the MPW and
MOT and the related internal and external control procedures are
satisfactory. The financial information included in the quarterly reports,
more particularly those covering the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, will
be used as a basis for the audit of project-related financial transactions.
This audit will be carried out by the Ministry of Finance, which has the
appropriate independence and competent staff. Specific requirements of the
l/ Excluding the cost of bitumen which is procured separately by the RTD
(para. 3.33).



- 29 -
audit are set out in Annex 1, para. 16. The auditor's certification and
report should be received in the Bank not later than six months after the
close of each government fiscal year; the first certification and report will
cover 1983. Agreement on this was reached during negotiations.
I. Disbursements
3.38     The proceeds of the proposed loan amount of US$85.0 million will be
disbursed according to the following schedule:
Amount                  % of Expenditures
Item   Description                (US$ 000 equivalent)              to be Financed
(1)    Civil Works
a) Road strengthening              23,700  N
b) Bridge reconstruction             6,700
c) Provincial roads
improvement                    15,300
d) Casablanca-Rabat
expressway completion          17,600
e) Equipment Workshops                 650                64% of total
for all items
(2)    Road Maintenance and
Workshop Equipment                  7,000
(3)    Consultant Services                  1,700
(4)    Unallocated                         11,717
(5)    Front-end Fee                          633
TOTAL                              85,000
As indicated in para. 3.27, the flat disbursement of 64% of total capital
expenditures under the project includes the financing of about 12% of the
total cost (or about 22% of the foreign exchange) of the periodic maintenance
program to be implemented over the four and a half years of the project. The
Bank and the Government agreed on this procedure at negotiations because: (i)
the Bank is satisfied that the procedures for the procurement of these works
(competitive bidding advertised locally) are acceptable; and (ii) the review
by the Bank of the large number of small contracts generally involved in road
maintenance would increase the burden on the project staff without
significantly altering compliance with the Bank's procurement procedures. A
schedule of estimated cumulative disbursements from the loan account, based on
the implementation and disbursement periods shown in Table 3.3, is attached as
Annex VI.



- 30-
3.39     In the past it has taken on average 7 1/2 years to complete
disbursement of loans or credits to Morocco (all sectors), and transport
projects in the EMENA Region have taken equally long. This appraisal sets a
disbursement period of 5 1/2 years on the basis of extensive discussions with
the project authorities regarding the causes of delay on earlier projects.
Specifically, for this project the Ministry of Finance and the MPW have agreed
to arrange for comnitment authorizations covering the 1983 program to be ready
in anticipation of loan signing, rather than beginning the process after
signing; the Bank has impressed upon the Government the economic benefits to
be derived from scheduling the road works as early as possible; the smoothing
of contractors' work loads has been analyzed; and measures have been taken to
speed up the processing of withdrawal applications within the Government.
3.40     The estimated closing date for the loan is December 31, 1988.  This
provides a full year after the estimated project completion (December 31,
1987, para. 3.28) to allow the Government time to submit final withdrawal
applications. It is expected that a constant monitoring by the Bank will keep
the interval between the execution of works or services and related withdrawal
applications to an average of about 6 months.
J. Environmental Impact
3.41     The works to be carried out under the project will not detrimentally
affect the environment. The expressway construction will not require the
demolition of any permanent housing, and will draw traffic away from a road
that passes through several villages. The other works will enhance the
reliability of access to markets, schools and medical services and thus
improve the rural environment.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01     The main benefit of the project will be the reduction of transport
costs for those using the project roads and bridges. About two thirds of the
total benefits from the items concerned with road infrastructure will be in
the form of reduced vehicle operating costs (or costs rising less rapidly than
would otherwise have been the case). The remaining benefits comprise
passenger time savings, increased farm incomes, the avoidance of road
accidents, and reduced road rehabilitation requirements in the future. The
overall economic rate of return (ER) on those of the capital items for which a
rate of return can be calculated (87% of the total), is over 40%. Specifics
on each of these items are given below. It is not feasible to calculate an ER
on the maintenance items, but the frequency of operations is the minimum
consistent with preserving the road network.
4.02     The economic impact of the freight market survey and review of
trucking regulations will be indirect and will depend on the study's success
in convincing the Government to change its policies. However, it has the
potential to reduce the cost of transporting freight by an amount similar to
the total benefits expected from all the other capital items put together.
This is explained in para. 4.23.



- 31 -
B. Pavement Strengthening
4.03       In preparing the economic evaluation of the pavement strengthening
works, the consultants (SETEC) used the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance
(HDM) model. This model involves relating vehicle operating costs (VOC's) to
a road's surface condition and comparing:
(a) the high and worsening VOC's projected on a road if it is not
strengthened and the high maintenance cost required to prevent the
road from completely breaking up; with
(b) the lower VOC's and maintenance costs on the road if it is
strengthened.
4.04     A total of 93 sections of road totalling 684 kms were selected on the
basis of visual inspection for detailed analysis, as described in para. 3.03.
The sections range in length from 1 to 35 km; the average length is about 7
km. For each section three strategies were tested covering a 20-year time
horizon:
(a) a strengthening designed to accommodate the traffic foreseen over the
next 10 years, followed by another for the second 10-year period;
(b) a stronger initial strengthening designed for the traffic over the
whole 20 years; and
(c) a standardized thickness (5 cm of asphalt concrete) that would be
repeated whenever the surface roughness deteriorated beyond a pre-set
threshold level.
The composition and thickness of the 10-and 20-year strengthenings were
determined on engineering grounds on the basis of subsoil conditions,
deflection measurements, core sampling of the existing pavement structure, and
forecasts of traffic expressed as the number of axle-passes of equivalent
damaging impact to a standardized 8.2-ton axle. The roughness thresholds for
the third option were set lower for more heavily trafficked roads than for
more lightly trafficked roads. Traffic growth rates on different roads are
expected to range from 4% to 9% per year.
4.05     The results show consistently high returns compared with the
alternative of no strengthening. The strategy of strengthening whenever
surface roughness reaches an appropriately chosen pre-set level yields higher
returns than the fixed-interval strategies in most cases. The alternative
with the highest benefit-cost ratio has been selected, except in a few cases
where local circumstances cast doubt on its technical appropriateness. The
choice of road sections to be included in the project has been made by ranking
them according to the B/C ratio of the preferred alternative, and taking the
first 470 km. The lowest B/C ratio among the 67 sections chosen is 3.5 and
the lowest ER 35%. The detailed results, which are too voluminous to give in
this report, may be found in the project file.

C. Reconstruction of Bridges
4.06     From an initial list of 50 bridges with problems of weight
limitation, inadequate width, or poor alignment, 21 were studied in detail.
There is considerable variety among the bridges studied, as can be seen from
Annex II and Table 4.1.
4.07     The main concern of the study was therefore to establish a uniform
methodology for determining priorities among the different bridges. The cost
to users of each of the three problems identified was measured in terms of
vehicle operating cost and occupants' time, and each situation was compared to
the alternative of a replacement bridge in the same location or nearby. The
behavior of traffic on the existing bridges was defined as follows:
(a) width restrictions: all vehicles slow down (or even stop, if another
vehicle is approaching on a one-lane bridge), cross the bridge slowly
and accelerate away;
(b) weight limitations: the portion of total potential freight flows
normally carried in semi-trailers or large single-unit trucks is
diverted to an alternative, longer route, or, alternatively, is
carried in smaller capacity trucks at a higher cost per ton;
(c) poor alignments: all traffic slows at the approaches. The improved
alignments also offer minor reductions in distance traveled.
4.08     The speeds used in assessing the cost impact of width and alignment
restrictions were assessed case by case. The percentage of traffic affected
by weight limits was estimated by reference to truck weight surveys carried
out on selected main highways. It was assumed that the limits would become
progressively more restrictive from year to year, as the structures
deteriorated.
4.09     The analysis showed that width restrictions per se do not cause a
sufficient vehicle operating cost penalty to justify the cost of replacing the
bridge, unless the traffic is high (several thousand vehicles per day). The
weight restrictions, on the other hand, were found to be costly in terms of
transport expenditures; the ER on all such cases is over 40%, except one,
where the traffic is only about 200 vehicles per day. The alignment problems,
which in all but one case studied occur together with one or both of the other
restrictions, are not severe enough to justify replacing the bridge except
where the traffic is high or a significant distance saving is possible.
Thirteen of the 14 bridges accepted for inclusion in the project have an ER of
over 40%, and the other has an ER of 23%. Three other bridges have lifetime
returns over 12%, but their problems are not expected to become severe for
another few years. Because of budget limitations, their reconstruction will
therefore be deferred.

preparing this project to develop a methodology for evaluating requests from

provincial and local authorities for paved roads in rural areas. It feels in
particular that the methodology should look beyond the presence or absence of
existing traffic and address the wide'ly-held perception in Morocco that the
vehicle operating savings approach does not give due recognition to the impact
of improved mobility on the rural population. The approach developed here
focusses on the impact of improved roads on agricultural production, the most
readily quantified of the non-traffic benefits.
4.11     In preparation for this project provincial roads totaling 890 km were
studied in detail. They are spread throughout the country, are at present
unpaved, and vary in length from 5 km to 94 km (average 32 km). Traffic
counts in March 1982, the agricultural off-season in most regions, showed that
four-fifths of the roads carry little motorized traffic (under 100 vehicles
per day), but are used by numerous bicycles, motorcycles and draft animals.
The Ministry of Agriculture's provincial offices were consulted for data on
the present cultivated area in the zone of influence of each road, as well as
on cropping patterns and yields.
4.12     The main impact of improving and paving these roads will be on crop
yields, as extension agents will be encouraged to visit the area more
frequently and farmers will have easier access to sources of credit,
fertilizers and pesticides. Included in the evaluation is the cost of
complementary investments, such as wells and pumps or milk-collecting
stations; these costs average 25% of the road cost. The farmers are expected
to finance about three quarters of these investments and to start responding
to the stimulus of the new roads after two or three years, undertaking the
investments over the following five years. The full potential for increased
production will be reached gradually after a total of about ten years.
4.13     Shortage of reliable data and methodological difficulties leave
uncertainty as to: (i) the amount of traffic that will be generated by an
improved road, particularly where the existing track is barely passable; and
(ii) the farmers' response to the improvement in access. The best estimates
of the ERs range from 6% to over 40%, with 25 of the 29 roads having an ER
better than 12%. If the benefits to non-agricultural generated traffic are
omitted and more pessimistic assumptions are made as to the farmers' response,
the ERs on 14 of these roads become unacceptably low.
4.14     The economic justification of four of the roads studied is fully
satisfactory, and they will be constructed first. Their total length is 172
km (Table 4.2). For the remainder of the pilot program, up to 5 other roads
will be selected from eight which, according to the consultant's best
estimates, have ERs over 20%, but whose evaluation would benefit from further
consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture as to agricultural development
potential and priorities. In keeping with the spirit of a pilot program, the
selection will aim to provide a varied sample as regards topography and
farming patterns. When proposing its choices for the second tranche to the
Bank, the RTD will therefore be required, in cases where a rate of return of
12% or more can only be achieved by the inclusion of agricultural benefits, to
show evidence of agricultural development potential in the road's zone of

influence, such as would be implied by the Ministry of Agriculture's
allocating funds to projects in the zone of influence under the present
Five-Year Plan.
E. Completion of the Casablanca-Rabat Expressway (29 km)
4.15     Casablanca, with a population of 2.6 million, and Rabat, with just
under 1 million inhabitants, are about 90 km apart. The expressway linking
them has been built in sections starting from Casablanca. The section as far
as the Oued Cherrat, 29 km short of Rabat, was completed in 1979. The
existing two-lane road from Oued Cherrat to Rabat (RP36) is congested during
several hours each day, as it carries 10,000-11,000 vehicles per day, about a
quarter of them trucks and buses. The accident rate on RP36 is high: 14
people were killed in 1979, 17 in 1980 and 23 in 1981, while about 170 persons
were injured each year. The accident rate relative to the volume of traffic
is double that on the adjoining expressway, and yet the only significant
difference in road geometry is the number of lanes. From 1973 to 1980 the
traffic grew at an average rate of 7% per year; it is expected to continue to
grow at 5-7% p.a., aggravating the congestion and accident toll.
4.16     The main reasons for completing the expressway are therefore to save
travelers' time and to reduce the number of accidents. To document the
economic value of such savings, the consultants surveyed road and rail traffic
between Casablanca and Rabat in March 1982. It was found that 31% of
passenger trips by road were for work purposes and a further 13% for
home-to-work travel. The average income level declared by those surveyed was
DH 2,650 per month, equivalent to US$5,200 per year. The cost to their
employers of working time spent in travel may conservatively be estimated at
100% of the average wage, while Bank studies have concluded that the economic
value of time spent in home-to-work travel is about 25% of the average wage
and that of all other trips is zero.
4.17     The cost of fatal accidents is estimated, by the gross lifetime
output approach, at DH 140,000 (US$23,000). The total cost of accidents on
RP36 is estimated at DH 4-5 million per year. The doubling to four lanes is
expected to save some 20 lives and about 200 injury accidents per year
initially.
4.18     By 1986, the earliest year the expressway could be completed all the
way to Rabat, traffic on RP36 is expected to reach 15,400 vehicles per day.
The opening of improved railway services between Casablanca and Rabat (Agdal)
scheduled for 1985 will not significantly alleviate the congestion. A modal
split model developed by the consultants indicates that as much as one-third
of all passengers will divert to the railway, but since nine out ten of the
potential train travelers now use the very overcrowded buses, the number of
road vehicles will go down by only 600 per day, or 4% of the RP36 total. This
is less than one year's normal traffic growth. It is noteworthy that this
level of traffic diversion to the railway (5 million passengers per year) is
far above that put forward by the Ministry of Transport (2 million).
4.19     On the basis of the above estimates, which are reasonable, the ER on
the expressway section will be 32%. The first-year rate of return will be



- 37 -
14%. Five-sixths of the benefits in the opening year will come from savings
in passenger working time and one-sixth from the avoidance of accidents. In
the do-nothing case the worsening congestion on RP36 in later years would
raise vehicle operating costs significantly, so that by 1996 the benefits
breakdown would be 72% time savings, 23% VOC's and 5% accident savings.
4.20     The economic justification of this operation is not sensitive to a
reasonable margin of error in the estimates of construction cost or traffic
volumes. As to the valuation of time saved, if home-to-work travel time is
valued at zero, the ER drops only one percentage point, to 31%. If working
time is valued at 50% of income, the ER is still satisfactory at 26%.
Offsetting this is a substantial margin of upside uncertainty deriving from
the assumption that the passengers who were surveyed did not understate their
income.
F. Freight Market Study
4.21     The economic impact of the freight market survey and review of
trucking regulations would be difficult to isolate from other contributing
factors, but the potential savings from transferring freight to lower-cost
trucks, such as could be expected from a liberalization of licensing and
operating regulations, could be in the range US$40-80 million per year.
4.22     This is based on the following rough estimates.  The total
expenditures on trucking are about US$l billion per year (approximately 40,000
trucks running 40,000 km per year at an average economic cost of US$0.65 per
vehicle km). Large common carriers are in principle the lowest-cost option
for long-distance full-truckload freight movements: their cost per ton-km for
such hauls is 10-20% lower than large own-account trucks and as much as 50%
lower than small trucks (para. 2.06). If access to the large common-carriers
were facilitated and their level of service improved, about one-fifth of all
ton-kms performed would transfer to them from the other two categories. Thus
the overall reduction would be in the range 4-8%, or US$40-80 million per
year. This is at least as large as the total annual benefits expected from
the approximately US$130 million to be invested in the other capital items of
the project.
G. Project Risks
4.23     The current liquidity shortage in Morocco (para. 1.06) may prevent
the Government from allocating the total amount of local funds required to
fully implement the project. However, all project components can be reduced
without major harm other than the postponement of the expected benefits. The
Government, however, has indicated that projects with foreign financing will
have priority in budget allocations in the event of financial constraints.
4.24     There is also a risk that the start-up of the freight market study
might be delayed, causing action to reduce the cost of trucking services to be
deferred. This risk has been minimized by early finalization of the terms of
reference for the study and by making the issue of the request for proposals
for the consultants a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 3.20).

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government on the
various issues referred to in the report.
5.02     The invitation of consultants to submit proposals for the freight
market study will be a condition for loan effectiveness (para. 3.21).
5.03     Subject to the above agreements and conditions, the proposed project
is suitable for a Bank loan of US$85 million (including about US$0.63 million
for the capitalized front-end fee) to the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco
for a 17-year term including a 4-year grace period.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
BUDGETING, ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING PROCEDURES _
I. BUDGETARY SYSTEM
A. General
1.       The budget of the State is annual; it runs from January 1 to December
31. It covers both recurrent and capital expenditure. The capital portion of
the budget comprises multi-annual commitment authorizations (credits
d'engagement) and corresponding annual payment authorizations (credits de
paiement). The commitment authorizations allow award of large contracts to be
carried out over more than one year; this budgetary technique is well suited
for highway projects. The annual payment authorizations are based on
estimated progress of work and ensuing payments due during the fiscal year.
2.       Projects to be incorporated in the annual capital budget are proposed
by the technical ministries to the Ministry of Finance; it is a prerequisite
that provision for the proposed projects has been made in the Five-Year Plan.
Investment projects approved by the Ministries of Finance and Planning are
vetted in the "loi de finances" which needs legislative approval. It should
be noted here that - contrary to what is done in some other countries -
projects are incorporated in the "loi de finances" without regard to the
uncertainty of financing, particularly external financing. Thus possible
delays in the processing for approval of the proposed Bank project should not
affect the preparation of the budget. The parliamentary vote is based on
budgetary chapters, with one chapter for each ministry; details within each
chapter are ultimately worked out between the Ministry of Finance and the
technical ministries; this is done within the framework of a utilization
program (programme d'emploi).
3.       Unused budgetary allocations pertaining to the previous fiscal year
are compiled by each technical ministry on an "etat de report". These
allocations are incorporated anew in the capital budget of the current fiscal
year. The procedure for carrying over ("reconduction") is quasi
automatic for works covered by allocations which have been committed but not
spent; the procedure is much slower for allocations which have not been
committed, with some risks of delay in project implementation.
1/ Laws and regulations related to public finance use French words which
are given a special meaning, sometimes at variance with common language.
Wherever possible French terminology and English translation are
simultaneously used in the text.

ANNEX I

4.       Laws and regulations allow for some flexibility during the execution
of the capital budget; transfers are possible although strictly regulated;
hence:
(a)  Transfers from chapter to chapter, which entail a change in the "loi
de finances", require legislative action;
(b) Transfers between articles and between paragraphs are authorized by
decree from the Prime Minisstar; and
(c)  Transfers between lines (C'lignes budg4taires") are subject to
approval by the Department of the Budget in the Ministry of Finance.
In addition, transfers are limited in amount: no line can benefit
from transfers which would result in increasing its original amount
by more than 10%.
5.       Each individual investment project (or group of investment projects)
is identified in the "prograime d'emploi" by a line ("ligne budgetaire").  It
is imperative that the components of the proposed Bank project be given - in
each annual capital budget - a line or lines to facilitate identification of
the budgetary allocations earmarked for the proposed project. This was agreed
with the Government.
B. Ministry of Public Works (`Ministere de 1'Esuipement")
6.       Annually the Ministry of Finance informs the Ministry of Public Works
(MPW) of the budgetary allocations earmarked to it; this is done by
"delegation de crddits"; by this act the Minister of Public Works becomes
responsible for the execution of the budget, of which he is the
"ordonnateur". Except for studies, the totality of the budgetary allocations
related to the proposed Bank project will be passed on ("cr4dits
sub-d4l4gu6s") to MPW districts ("arrondissements") which will carry out that
part of the Bank project located within their respective jurisdiction.
Through this the heads of the "arrordissements" become "sous-ordonnateurs",
each for a part of the budget. By administrative means the "arrondissements"
can further pass on part of their budget to the "subdivisions". However, the
approval mechanism is kept at "arrondissement" level because the
"sous-ordonnateurs" cannot de'legate their budgetary responsibility further
down the line.
II, ACCOUNTING
7.       The MPW's accounts are single-entry, and kept on a cash basis.  For
budget allocations handled at ministry level, a commitment sheet ("fiche
d'engagement") is kept for each item; it registers budgeted funds made
available, commitments and payments; for each item contract adjustments in
quantities or prices are dealt with as additional couraitments. Funds passed



- 41 -
ANNEX I
Page 3
on to "arrondissements" are listed in a ledger. At the "arrondissement" level
the following books are kept:
(a) book of commitments;
(b) book of payments;
(c) book of funds passed on to "subdivisions"; and
(d) book of payment orders sent to the "receveur" (see para. 15).
Information from the above bookkeeping is centralized monthly, and controlled
in the RTD's "Division de Programmation".
8.       In summary the budgetary accounting system is primitive and
fragmented; it is heavily controlled as explained later. It nevertheless
serves its purpose and it can be readily used for the preparation of financial
reports which in turn will serve for Bank monitoring and, ultimately, for
audit.
III. INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS
9.       There is a cumbersome and repetitive "a priori" control system; it is
being strictly applied to such an extent that, in some instances, it has
become a constraint to day-to-day operations. Control procedures apply
equally to all expenditures, regardless of the amount involved; as a result
controllers cannot keep pace with the flow of dossiers to be checked and
substantial delays occur frequently. The control is carried out by
"contr8leurs d'engagement de depenses" (CED), who are responsible to the
Ministry of Finance. They have to stamp their approval on the relevant
documents, more particularly when:
(a) budget allocations are received and corresponding commitment sheets
are opened;
(b) commitments are made;
(c) adjustments to prior commitments are made; and
(d) budget allocations are passed on to a lower echelon.
Budgetary action at ministry level is controlled by "contr8leurs centraux"; at
"arrondissement" level, by "contr8leurs provinciaux". In addition, for
expenses exceeding DH 30,000 a call for bids is required; in such instance
both the stamp of the CED and that of the "contr8leur general" are required.
In case of disagreement between CED and "ordonnateur" a request for review can
be addressed to the Ministry of Finance. The CEDs - at the central or
provincial level - keep budgetary accounts on commitments made identical to
those kept by the "ordonnateurs" and "sous-ordonnateurs", so as to double
check the position at any moment.
10.      Payment orders ("mandats") are prepared and signed by the
"ordonnateurs" or "sous-ordonnateurs", and sent to the "receveurs" who are the
local representatives of the "Tresorier General". The "receveur" keeps



- 42 -
ANNEX I
Page 4
budgetary accounts on payments made identical to those kept by the
'ordonnateurs" and "sous-ordonnateurs", thereby replicating at payment level
the control carried out at commitment level by the CED. Thus, there are three
sets of budgetary accounts kept by three different offices for purposes of
permanent control.
11.      The "Inspection des Finances", a body in the Ministry of Finance,
carries out ad hoc checks on all public-sector agencies. These are "a
posteriori" controls covering a particular activity and in general are
triggered by a suspicion of irregularities.
12.      A "Cour des Comptes" was established in 1979; essentially it is to
carry out a judicial control over the "agents comptables" and their handling
of public funds. Its control will also be carried out on an ad hoc basis.
Various constraints have so far prevented the "Cour des Comptes" from carrying
out its duties as provided by the law.
13.      In summary, each budgetary action by "ordonnateurs" and
"sous-ordonnateurs" is controlled by representatives of the Ministry of
Finance, The latter keep parallel budgetary accounts to ensure constant
checking. Operating and accounting functions are totally separated from
disbursement of funds, a safe precaution. The system is cumbersome and it
entails risks of delay in project implementation which cannot be ignored.
Intervention by supervising Bank staff may be required at times. In this
respect, the financial reports discussed below could, to a certain extent,
help in tracking down undue delays.
IV. FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
14.      The project staff have prepared a standardized format for quarterly
financial reports, which has been discussed with representatives of the MPW
and the Ministry of Finance. The reports will consist of:
(a) one sheet for each project component, as per Appendix I, listing
funds provided, commitments, invoices, payments, Bank contribution,
and actual Bank disbursements; the sheet provides for calculation of
some ratios which would help track and highlight delays at different
stages of implementation; and
(b) a sheet consolidating - along the same outline - all data in sheets
under (a).
The outline has been prepared bearing in mind the present reporting
arrangements under the Bank-financed Third Highway Project. Except for actual
Bank disbursements the infonration required is presently centralized, on a



- 43 -
ANNEX I
Page 5
monthly basis, by the Programming Division of the RTD. This division checks
on an ad hoc basis with the Ministry of Finance actual Bank disbursements for
reconciliation with the MPW's expenses. In addition to the compilation work
presently done, the preparation of the financial reports will require only
limited extra work from the Programming Division, namely:
(a) to meet the requirements of the Bank regarding the monitoring of:
(i) expenditure of project components;
(ii) counterpart funds provided; and
(iii) Bank disbursements;
(b) to be used as the basis for the external audit discussed below.
V. AUDIT
15.      The concept of internal audit is unknown because control is
systematically carried out "a priori", at the commitment stage. In June 1982,
a Bank mission reviewed with the Government the arrangements to be made for
the audit of future Bank projects, and the following agreement was reached:
(a) Bank projects to be implemented by public agencies and companies
would be audited by private auditors; and
(b) Bank projects to be implemented by ministries would be audited by the
Ministry of Finance.
16.      Discussions were held with representatives of the MPW, MOT, and the
Ministry of Finance, and the following arrangements were agreed upon:
(a) The cumulative financial report for the fourth quarter of each fiscal
year, prepared by the MPW will be audited by the "Inspection des
Finances") of the Ministry of Finance;
(b) The audit will ascertain whether the financial report;
(i) includes all project-related financial transactions, without any
omission; and
(ii) reflects the true position of all project-related financial
transactions.
(c) The audit certification and report will be issued and received in the
Bank not later than six months after the close of each fiscal year.
(d) The first audit will cover FY83.

FUEL PRICING
The table below shows the prices of transportation fuels as of June 1982 and the
relationship between Mbroccan internal prices and comparators constructed by taking the c.i.f. price
of imports and adding an allowance for internal transportation and distribution costs. Oil product
prices appear to be at or above their conparators, with the lowest margins applying to the popular
household fuels, LPG and kerosene, and the highest to gasoline. This is done as an incan
redistribution measure.
