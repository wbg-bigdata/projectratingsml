REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPIJBLIC OF ZIMBABWE
FOR A PROPOSED MANUFACTURING EXPORT PROMOTION PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Manufacturing Export Promotion Loan for the equivalent of US$70.6 million
which would have a term of 20 years including five years of grace, with
variable interest rates to the Republic of Zimbabwe.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The first Bank economic mission to independent Zimbabwe visited
the country in September 1980. A Country Economic Memorandum (Report Num-
ber 3234-ZIM) was distributed to the Executive Directors in April 1981.
This description is based on that memorandum and on information obtained on
subsequent missions.
3.        Zimbabwe is a landlocked country of about 390,000 sq km, bordered
by Mozambique on the east, Botswana on the southwest, Zambia on the
northwest and South Africa on the south. The population as of December
1981, was estimated to be 7.7 million, 97 percent of whom are Africans. I
The remainder consists of about 170,000 Europeans, 10,000 Asians and 23,000
people of mixed origin. The growth rate of the African population is esti-
mated to be about 3.4 percent per year. The number of Europeans has been
declining due to emigration, which has recently been occurring at an aver-
age rate of about 1,700 persons per month. According to estimates based on
pre-war data, 20 percent of the population is urban; but this is almost
certain to understate the present extent of urbanization.
4.        In 1980, per capita income was Z$470 (US$630, using the World
Bank Atlas methodology). Estimates for 1981 suggest that real per capita
income grew at about 4.6 percent, giving a 1981 figure of slightly under
Z$500 per person. In spite of this good growth performance, distribution

used throughout. The first census since 1969 was carried out in August
1982; the results are not yet available.



- 2 -
of income and assets between Africans and non-Africans remains highly skew-
ed. The Land Tenure Act of 1969 updated legislation of the 1930s and con-
firmed division of the country's total land area into roughly two equal
parts for European and African settlement, the Europeans possessing most of
the best land. Given the difference between the size of the two groups,
the division resulted in an allocation at independence of approximately
2.5 ha per African and 65.2 ha per non-African. The degree of disparity
will begin to change now that majority rule has been achieved, but similar
disparities exist in the distribution of other productive assets and in-
come. Rough estimates made in 1979 of the differences in per capita income
suggest that the average per capita income for Africans was about Z$110
(US$175) compared with roughly Z$5,500 (US$9,000) for non-Africans.
5.       Following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in
1965, the international community imposed economic sanctions, and in 1973,
a costly guerrilla war started. The sanctions were only partly effective.
Between 1965, when they began, and 1974, real GDP grew at about 7 percent
per year and per capita income at about 3.5 percent. Exports expanded, en-
hancing the countryTs ability to import. Notably, the sanctions stimulated
development of local import substitution capacity, so that by 1979 consumer
goods were only about 10 percent of total imports, compared with 22 percent
in 1964. Sanctions also encouraged the diversification of commercial agri-
culture and the rapid growth of investment in and exports from the mining
sector.
6.        However, the economic situation changed for the worse between
1975 and 1979. The added effect of the guerrilla war, increases in the oil
price and two droughts caused economic activity to decline, so that per
capita income in real terms fell by 35 percent to its 1965 level. While
the value of exports rose slightly even during this period, the dramatic
increase in the cost of imports, in particular oil, caused the volume of
imports to fall precipitously. Real investment and formal employment also
declined significantly.
7.        Despite these setbacks, the new Government inherited a well-
diversified economy with good potential for growth. Agriculture, manufact-
uring and mining are all important, contributing 18 percent, 26 percent,
and 5 percent, respectively, of GDP in 1981, and together providing
52 percent of total formal employment. Agriculture and forestry account
for more than 290,000 jobs or 28 percent of the total; manufacturing for
173,000 jobs and mining for 69,000. Most of the remaining formal employ-
ment is provided by service sectors such as public administration, educa-
tion and, in particular, domestic service. Mining and agriculture earn
significant amounts of foreign exchange and supply most inputs for manufac-
turing, which in turn accounts for between 30 and 35 percent of Zimbabwe's
merchandize exports, mainly processed agricultural and mineral items.
8.        Since independence, the economy has rebounded strongly as resump-
tion of normal economic activity has been accompanied by an improvement in
the terms of trade and expansion of external borrowing. Imports increased



- 3 -
by 47 percent in 1980 and by 26 percent in 1981, facilitating increases in
capacity utilization. Growth has been extremely strong in agriculture,
which benefitted from good weather in 1980 and 1981. Consequently, overall
real growth of the economy was about 11 percent in 1980, and over 8 percent
in 1981.
9.       The substantial increase in imports in 1980-81 was financed with
reserve drawdowns and short-term borrowings. This increase in imports and
short-term borrowing, coupled with a slower than required rate of growth of
exports, have resulted in a very serious balance of payments situation
(paras. 31, 32, 33 and 34).
10.      Some short- and long-run problems must be addressed if the country
is to experience more equitably distributed growth. The major short-run
problem is controlling domestic demand so as to reduce inflation (currently
about 17 percent per year). Some needed policies are already being imple-
mented. Sales and import taxes and interest rates have all been raised.
The rate of expansion of the money supply was reduced from 22 percent in
1980 to 15 percent in 1981. The overall budget deficit as a percent of GDP
has declined from its high of 14 percent in 1979/80. However, further re-
ductions must be accomplished during the current (1982/83) budgetary exer-
cise if stabilization efforts are to fully succeed. Significant longer-
term problems concern the need to increase the level and quality of invest-
ment, to expand domestic savings, and to adopt a wage policy consistent
with the need to increase employment. Although these issues are inter-
related, the Government recognizes that increasing employment and labor
productivity are key to achieving its aim of growth with equity.
11.      The Government is taking measures to address some of these prob-
lems. It has published a three-year Transitional National Development Plan
which sets course for the economy for the next three years (paras. 37 and
38). The Government is discussing with the IMF a stabilization program
which stipulates a number of measures including: an exchange rate adjust-
ment (as a result of the dialogue, the Government devalued the Zimbabwean
dollar by 20 percent on December 9, 1982 in order to restore export com-
petitiveness that had been eroded by large increases in labor costs and
high domestic inflation); an adjustment in the basket of currencies on
which the value of the Zimbabwean dollar is determined; a reduction in the
budgetary deficit; limitations to wage and salary increases; and ceilings
to short-term external debt and domestic credit. The negotiations are at
an advanced stage and are expected to be successfully concluded shortly.
In addition, the proposed export promotion program (paras. 39-50) is also
designed to deal with some of the problems.
12.      Should the measures Government is taking effectively deal with the
above-mentioned problems, prospects for respectable growth and more equit-
able distribution of income are quite good. Real increases in GDP could
well average 5.5 percent per year in 1980-85. Thereafter growth could



- 4 -
slow, perhaps, to an average of four percent per year, as investments are
made in longer-gestating programs with a more even distribution of assets.
Much of the burden of achieving these growth and equity goals must fall on
the agricultural sector. In the past, the commercial farms accounted for
most agricultural production. However, the development of smallholder
agriculture has been assigned the highest priority.
13.       Zimbabwe emerged from 15 years of sanctions and the war with
relatively low external indebtedness. In December 1981, foreign debt
totalled Z$948 million (US$1,318 million equivalent) and the country's
gross international reserves equalled about Z$150 million, or an estimated
two months of imports.  The external debt figure was equivalent to about
24 percent of estimated GDP. The debt service ratio, which was about four
percent in 1980, is estimated to have risen to 8 and 15 percent in 1981 and
1982, respectively. This rapid rise reflects the fact that nearly all
Zimbabwe's present debt must be repaid in the next six years which will
exert pressures on the short-term balance of paynents situation (para.
31). However, so long as the country avoids recourse to large amounts of
short-term commercial borrowing, the debt service ratios should begin to
decline after 1984 even with large amounts of additional external borrow-
ing. In light of this and the country's potential for growth and expan-
sion, Zimbabwe is creditworthy for Bank lending. However, given the coun-
try's massive external resource requirements for the next few years and the
expected high level of international interest rates and relatively hard
repayment terms of non-concessionary borrowing, it is clear that Zimbabwe
needs to receive part of its external assistance on concessionary terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       Before 1965, the Bank made five loans totalling US$140.3 million
benefiting Rhodesia -- two directly to the Government for agriculture
(US$5.6 million) and power (US$28.0 million), two loans totalling
US$87.7 million to the Central African Power Corporation (CAPCO), and a
US$9.0 million loan to the Rhodesia Railways. As a guarantor of each of
the loans, the United Kingdom serviced them after 1964. The loans for
agriculture and railways have been repaid, and CAPCO resumed servicing its
two loans after the lifting of sanctions on December 21, 1979. During
FY81, the Bank and the Association approved a loan of US$50 million and a
credit of US$15 million for the Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Pro-
gram. The loan (1959-ZIM) and the credit (1120-ZIM) financed priority
import requirements of raw materials, spare parts, and components and bal-
ancing equipment needed to utilize idle capacity in the manufacturing sec-
tor. The Bank also approved a loan (1944-ZIM) of US$42 million to finance
import requirements of spare parts, track maintenance equipment and tools
for the railways, equipment for the Central Mechanical Equipment Department
and technical assistance. A summary statement of Bank Group operations and



notes on the execution of ongoing projects are provided in Annex II. Proj-
ect implementation thus far is satisfactory and disbursements have kept to
schedule.
15.       IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe, approved by its Board in
March 1981, was in the Wankie Colliery Company Limited, to help finance a
project for producing coal for a thermal power station, now being con-
structed, and other uses. The investment was in the form of a US$38 mil-
lion loan (552-ZIM), of which US$20 million was for IFC's own account, and
US$18 million comprised commercial bank participation in the loan. IFC was
also responsible for arranging a further US$10.3 million of commercial bank
financing related to a proposed loan by the Export-Import Bank of the
United States (Eximbank).
16.       The Bank is identifying and preparing projects for power, rail-
ways, manpower development and training, agriculture, rural development,
forestry, and industrial development through a development finance com-
pany. A Small Farm Credit project, approved by the Board in September
1982, will provide the Agricultural Finance Corporation with funds for
seasonal loans and for medium- and long-term loans for equipment and farm
improvements, as well as technical assistance. A Petroleum Fuels Supply
Technical Assistance project was also approved in September 1982. A Power
project, approved by the Board in December 1982, will enhance electric
generating capacity through extension of the Hwange Thermal Power Station.
It also includes construction of a transmission line, technical assistance
and training. Projects to improve Zimbabwe's road transport system and
support rural afforestation are expected to be presented to the Board in
February 1982.
17.      The Bank has reviewed the agriculture, energy, urban, education
and manpower, population, health and nutrition, and telecommunications sec-
tors, for which reports either have been completed or are being written.
18.      Since Bank lending to Zimbabwe is very recent, Bank Group exposure
is still very low. At the end of 1981, the Bank accounted for six percent
and IDA and the Bank combined, for about eight percent.
PART III - MANUFACTURING SECTOR
19.      Manufacturing contributes over 25 percent of Zimbabwe's gross
domestic product, a share which has progressively increased over the past
15 years. The sector is relatively well diversified and sophisticated,
producing almost 90 percent of the manufactured goods consumed in
Zimbabwe. The most important are processed food, metals and metal prod-
ucts, drinks, tobacco, and transport equipment. Almost 75 percent of manu-
facturing capacity is concentrated in the metropolitan areas of Harare and
Bulawayo.

Performance
20.       Zimbabwe-s manufacturing output grew rapidly -- more than four
percent yearly in real terms -- between 1965 and 1974. However, with the
intensification of the war, manufacturing output fell 13 percent between
1974 and 1978. With the general economic recovery, the performance of the
started improving after the war. The sector increased its output by
11 percent in 1979 and 15 percent in 1980. However, due to foreign
exchange shortages, there was a slow down in 1981 -- output in that year
increased by 10 percent.
21.       Manufactured Exports.  Within the sector, priority is given to
manufacturing exports which have generally been about 30-35 percent of
total exports since the mid-60s. The former grew, in current terms, at

about 7.6 percent per year for 1965-79, and by about 9.5 percent per annum
for the 1980-81 years. During the seventies, ferro-alloys, iron and steel
constituted 51 percent of total manufactured exports. Other important
manufactured exports include machinery, transport, radio/TV and electrical
equipment and cloth and clothing articles. Growth in the sector's exports
is expected to come from sources like textiles and clothing, chemicals,
domestic hardware, machinery, transport and electrical equipment subsec-
tors.
Constraints
22.       There is in the neighboring countries and overseas demand for a
number of Zimbabwe's manufactured items like textiles, clothing, footwear,
furniture, pharmaceuticals, toilet preparations, transport equipment, iron
and steel, non-ferrous metals and metal products.  The demand is not being
met, although Zimbabwe has substantial idle capacity already in place in
respect of all the items demanded. The constraint to expanding manufac-
tured exports in the short run mainly is lack of continued and timely ac-
cess to foreign exchange to import needed inputs, spare parts, components

and balancing equipment. The proposed loan would assist in overcoming the
very high degree of uncertainty concerning foreign exchange availability,
which often deters exporters from committing themselves to significant
export contracts.
23.       Initially, because of sanctions against the Rhodesian Government
and later, because of foreign exchange shortages, much of the equipment in
use today is obsolete and urgently needs to be replaced.  In some indus-
tries, capacity is inadequate. In the medium term, therefore, substantial
investments are needed for expanding existing industries capacity. This
problem will be addressed by the proposed DFC project.
24.       Because of the country's continuing unfavorable  balance-of-
payments situation, the Government has not yet dismantled the restrictions
on imports (largely through foreign exchange controls), which were insti-
tuted during the pre-independence period. As Zimbabwe's external position

improves however, the Government intends to increasingly substitute tariffs
and other fiscal measures for the quantitative controls. Despite current
constraints however, a number of industries such as textiles and clothing,
iron and steel are, from all indications, operating efficiently. Zimbab-
wean prices are competitive with those of similar manufactured goods in
other countries at about the same level of development and significant ex-
port orders have been placed with Zimbabwean firms. Efficiency overall
should improve with the increased capacity utilization and greater exposure
to foreign markets the proposed project will afford.
Incentives
25.      In addition to protection through tariffs, the Government provides
other investment and export incentives; namely (i) exemption from double
taxation of income; (ii) a 100 percent initial income tax allowance for
fixed investment in manufacturing; and (iii) special depreciation allow-
ances on fixed assets. Although prices are controlled, the Government
endeavors to set them at levels which give adequate returns to producers.
Manufacturing industries receive a rebate of import duty (equal to the dif-
ference between the actual duty paid and the lower rate prescribed) on im-
ported raw materials used for local processing. A total drawback of import
duties paid on raw materials, for export production is granted on the ex-
port of the finished product.
Supporting Institutions
26.      The Ministry of Industry and Energy Development is responsible for
overall coordination of the Government's policies and programs concerning
the manufacturing sector. In addition, the Ministry of Manpower and Social
Affairs, through government-sponsored workers committees and labor legis-
lation, has an important role, particularly in ensuring an equitable share
of income for workers while fostering harmonious relations between labor
and management. It also enforces occupational safety standards.
27.      Zimbabwe has many financial, promotional and other institutions
supporting manufacturing activities. A full range of commercial banking
facilities are available at most of the branches of the commercial banks.
These facilities are supplemented by four merchant banks which specialize
in providing long-term capital to large business organizations. In addi-
tion, six financial institutions specialize in medium-term finance and
leasing facilities. An Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), estab-
lished by special act of Parliament in 1963, assists the development of in-
dustries by providing finance, and advice on technical, marketing, financi-
al, accounting and administative matters and project preparation. In order
to support emerging African businessmen in small-scale enterprises and to
expand existing labor-intensive industries, two other financial institu-
tions have recently been set up: the Development Finance Company (DFC), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of IDC, and the Funds for Emergent Business Com-
panies (FEBCO) Ltd., owned by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and the four
commercial banks in the country. Two other institutions -- Small



- 10 -
Industries Advisory Service (SIAS) and the Institute of Business Develop-
ment (IBD) -- have also been operating in this field for several years.
Finally, there is IPCRON Ltd., an independent and privately-owned develop-
ment finance corporation, which assists industry and plantation agricul-
ture.
Previous Bank Participation
28.      In March 1981, the Bank and the Association approved a loan of
US$50 million and a credit of US$15 million to Zimbabwe, and the OPEC
Special Fund gave a loan of US$10 million administered by the Bank, in
order to assist the Government in rehabilitating the manufacturing sector.
The funds enabled Zimbabwe to import raw materials, spare parts components
and balancing equipment, needed to utilize idle capacity in the sector
overall.  The loan and credit were fully disbursed by March 31, 1982, three
months ahead of schedule (Annex IV shows the list of industries which bene-
fitted).
29.      According to an initial assessment, the loan and credit assisted
importantly in increasing manufacturing production levels in some indus-
tries and minimized deterioration in others. Overall, there was an in-
crease of 10 percent in the volume of manufactured goods during the loan/
credit period (calendar year 1981 compared with 1980). However, the
foreign exchange allocated was insufficient to meet the total requirements
of the sector, and consequently, the overall sectoral problem of capacity
underutilization still persists.
PART IV - THE MANUFACTURING EXPORT PROMOTION LOAN
30.      Although the Government originally requested a follow up to the
previous loan and credit, it subsequently was agreed that the proposed
operation should focus on promoting manufacturing sector exports. Prepara-
tion and appraisal missions visited Zimbabwe in November 1981, and March
1982, respectively. During this time, a program for policy and administra-
tive improvements was developed as part of the dialogue between the Govern-
ment and the Bank. Negotiations were held in Washington December 20-22,
1982; the Zimbabwean delegation was led by Mr. Bryan Walters, Secretary to
the Treasury, Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Development.
Background
31.      Zimbabwe faces a serious balance of payments situation, mainly
because of (a) a substantial increase in imports; (b) slower than anticipa-
ted growth rate of exports; and (c) heavy debt service payments. Projec-
tions for 1983 indicate an overall balance of payments deficit of over
Z$300 million -- an increase of about 140 percent between 1981 and 1983.
Following the aftermath of the war of independence, the country faced large
pressing needs for rehabilitation and reconstruction, in addition to

pent-up demand from domestic consumers. Consequently, imports went up by
47 percent and 26 percent in 1980 and 1981, respectively. Due to the
foreign exchange shortage, the Government has been forced to severely cut
back on imports such that they are expected to increase by only eight
percent in 1982. While exports grew at about ten percent per annum over
the same period, nevertheless, the rate is far below what is required to
maintain a reasonable external balance.
32.      Exports are limited by three factors:   (i) the international re-
cession, which has depressed demand for minerals, causing a decline in vol-
ume and value of Zimbabwe's mineral exports (projected export earnings in
Table 4 above do not take into account the expected recovery in 1983); (ii)
a severe drought, which affected almost the entire country, and will cut
agricultural production drastically and reduce exports of such items as
beef and cotton for which domestically held stocks are depleted; and (iii)
manufactured exports, which are constrained because of a lack of foreign
exchange.
33.      Regarding external borrowing, expectations were that nearly all
government borrowing would be long term (i.e., over 12 years). However,
the Government's efforts to attract sufficient long-term external financing
have not been very successful. Nearly all government and other borrowing
has been short term (under five years) and expensive. Large repayments
will be inevitable in 1983, giving rise to outflows on the capital account



- 12 -
which will cause a serious deterioration in the overall balance of payments
situation. It appears that the debt service ratio could rise from the
estimated 15 percent to 30 percent for the 1982-85 period.
34.      Current account deficits can no longer be financed by reserve
drawdowns and short-term borrowings, because gross reserves are expected to
fall to a very low level of one month's imports by the end of 1982; and
ability to borrow additional short-term funds is constrained because of the
serious debt service implications. It is clear that the Government will
not be able to meet the substantial debt service and other transfers, and
at the same time maintain 1982 import levels. The Government has, there-
fore, projected a very severe (about 21 percent) cutback in imports in
1983. We, however, expect a cut back of a lower magnitude. This, however,
may be counterbalanced by the expected recovery in export performance in
1982, thus resulting in a net balance of payments position as projected in
Table 4. Since foreign exchange allocation for industries manufacturing
for the domestic market is already very low, more cutbacks in imports will
further hurt the export capability of the country. Unless the Government
can attract large amounts of longer-term loans and expand manufactured out-
put, exports will be severely constrained for several years to come. The
proposed Export Promotion Project, therefore, is designed to address this
problem.
Objectives of the Export Promotion Loan
35.      The immediate objective of the proposed project is to expand
Zimbabwe-s manufactured exports by introducing a number of policy and
administrative improvements and providing foreign exchange for imported
inputs needed by manufacturers. Zimbabwe has the capacity, already in
place, for expanding its manufactured exports -- an effective administra-
tive framework, a well-developed manufacturing industry, unutilized capa-
city, entrepreneural skills and a relatively large skilled labor force.
Thus, the project would be expected to meet with a favorable reponse in
terms of production and exports.
36.      Equally important, the project would set the stage for initiating,
at an appropriate time a broad-based adjustment program required to address
important macro-economic issues (some of which are referred to in para.
10). Such a program, however, would necessitate substantial groundwork and
extensive preparation. The project would reinforce the process of adjust-
ment in the underlying policy framework set in motion with the Manufactur-
ing Rehabilitation Imports Program Loan and Credit. Of course, such a
shift presupposes careful consideration of available policy options. The
Bank expects to have an input in this process primarily through economic
and sector work whicn would include relevant studies focusing on resource
allocation, investment incentives, issues relating to wage and employment
policies, as well as issues relating to the Government's land settlement
program.



- 13 -
37.      At present, Zimbabwe's economy is in transition -- from a closely
controlled war-oriented system to one relying largely on market forces. In
this context, the Government in November 1982 published a three-year Tran-
sitional National Development Plan (1982/83-1984/85), which sets a course
for shifting the economy away from direct controls and quantitative
restrictions. The Plan, for example, notes that the quantitative restric-
tions on imports and the country's rapid industrialization, which took
place behind protective barriers, brought benefits -- but was costly in
terms of a decline in manufactured exports, as a proportion of total ex-
ports; uncertainty about foreign exchange for imported industrial inputs
which inhibited producing for export to highly competitive external
markets; and decisions biased in favor of capital and import-intensive
investments and production and against labor, a surplus production factor.
38.      The Plan's targets for overall growth, employment, labor produc-
tivity and domestic savings appear to be overly optimistic in the light of
current economic conditions. Notwithstanding, in it the Government has set
out important policy directions -- including an outward-looking, export-
oriented industrial strategy -- which the proposed project would support.
In addition, the Government recently announced an "investment code" de-
signed to reassure and facilitate private, foreign as well as domestic,
investment. It spells out (i) investment priorities which include, inter
alia, investment in "activities in which generation of exports within a
reasonable period is possible"; (ii) legal provisions; (iii) exchange con-
trol regulations; (iv) taxation rules; and (v) arbitration procedures.
39.      The proposed Export Promotion Project would support this export-
oriented strategy by reducing constraints which now impede manufactured
exports. Specifically, the project includes measures for:
(i) streamlining import licensing and foreign exchange
allocation procedures;
(ii) providing export incentives;
(iii) instituting export credit facilities; and
(iv) appropriate management of exchange rate and trade
regime.
Policy and Administrative Measures
40.      Foreign Exchange and Trade Regime.  Until recently, the value of
the Zimbabwean dollar was determined by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe with
reference to the movement of a basket of other currencies. In 1981, the
Zimbabwean dollar depreciated by about 12 percent against the US dollar
(which is the currency with the largest weight in the basket), but appreci-
ated by 13 percent against the South African Rand, and by a smaller margin
against some western European currencies. In light of this development and
the deteriorating balance-of-payments situation, and since South Africa and



- 14 -
western Europe are major competitors of Zimbabwe in the important neighbor-
ing export markets, the Government, on December 9, 1982, devalued the
Zimbabwean dollar by 20 percent. In addition, the Government has agreed
that it will remain vigilant and continue to manage the exchange rate and
other incentives in a manner which ensures the competitiveness of Zimbab-
wean exports (Annex IX, para. 13).
41.      In connection with the Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Pro-
gram Loan and Credit, the Government undertook to carry out an effective
protection study, in accordance with the terms of reference agreed between
the Bank and the Government, in order to determine the effects of the trade
regime and other incentives on the industrial efficiency and external com-
petitiveness, and develop recommendations to improve both. The study is
proceeding well and is expected to be completed as scheduled by March 31,
1983.  The Government agreed to furnish to the Bank a report on the con-
clusions and recommendations arrived at and to allow reasonable opportunity
to exchange views with the Government prior to adoption and implementation
of recommendations in the report. The Government will establish a mechan-
ism for implementing the agreed recommendations of the study (Annex IX,
para. 14).
42.      Foreign Exchange Allocation.  Following economic sanctions, the
Zimbabwe authorities instituted an elaborate and tightly-managed foreign
exchange allocation system to ensure effective use of a scarce resource.
The Reserve Bank indicates to the Government the expected foreign exchange
availability, on which basis the Treasury allocates a global sum of foreign
exchange to the Ministry of Industry and Energy Development on a quarterly
basis. The Ministry is then responsible for allocating specific amounts
for various end uses and issues import licenses in accordance with the Gov-
ernment's economic priorities. Within the manufacturing sector, priority
has been assigned to exports.
43.      The Government has taken initiative to review the system of
foreign exchange allocation to ensure that it appropriately serves the
needs of the post-independence period. For that purpose, the Government
hired the consulting firm of Coopers and Lybrand to study the present sys-
tem and make recommendations for change. The Government at present is re-
viewing the consultants draft report. Meanwhile, the Government will take
interim measures to minimize delays and uncertainty which now affect ex-
porters. Firstly, to ensure an even and continuous flow of manufactured
exports, foreign exchange allocations to registered manufacturing exporters
will be automatic and on a replenishment basis, whereby exporters would be
entitled to a replenishment license equal to the value of the import con-
tent of their exports (Annex IX, para. 6). Secondly, to ensure quality and
competitiveness, where relevant, importation will be permitted of the
materials that are domestically produced, but of insufficiently high qual-
ity to be used in manufacture of exports (Annex IX, para. 6).   Thirdly, to
reduce costs and ensure competitiveness, all registered exporters would be
permitted to import their requirements directly. (At present, only those
manufacturers registered by 1965 are permitted to import directly, the



- 15 -
others purchase their imports locally from commercial importers, Annex IX,
para. 6.)
44.      Export Incentive Scheme.  Until mid-1980, an export incentive
scheme was in operation under which exporters of manufactured goods (having
at least 25 percent domestic value added) received a bonus payment equal to
five percent of the FOB value of exports. The scheme was suspended in 1980
pending a review of its effectiveness. The Government recently introduced
a revised export incentive scheme based on actual export performance as
follows: (a) a basic flat rate of seven percent of the FOB value of con-
signments of qualifying exports; and (b) an incremental performance rate of
five percent of the value of export performance achieved for a period over
and above the performance registered for a similar period during the pre-
vious year (Annex IX, para. 8). The incentive is designed to cover
exporters non-tradable costs associated with establishing external
markets.  This is particularly important for Zimbabwe, in view of its
isolation for several years from normal international trade. (For fiscal
reasons, this is much less than the 16 percent export allowance which South
Africa gives to its exporters.) The incentive is designed to reorient
manufacturing production towards exports. In that sense, it is necessary,
regardless of the measures the Government already has taken to improve the
competitiveness of the country's exports. Because of the small amount
involved (estimated to be less than one percent of the current budget), the
incentive is not expected to adversely affect resource allocation to other
sectors, and initially will have only a marginal impact on the budget.
Eventually, the net effect is expected to be substantially positive,
because increased exports would increase government revenues which would
more than offset the export allowance effect on the budget.
45.      Export Credit.  In order to expedite receipt of export earnings,
the Government requires that all export proceeds be repatriated within 90
days of shipment. This requirement limits any expansion of exports, espe-
cially to neighboring countries, some of which are able to obtain credit of
up to 180 days or more from exporters in other countries.
46.      There are no institutional arrangements which would allow Zimbab-
wean exporters to provide credit to their customers on terms comparable to
those offered by their competitors. Currently, exporters of machinery and
transport equipment rely on arranging credits through commercial banks with
the approval of the Reserve Bank. Establishing institutions to provide ex-
port credit should await creation of the proposed Development Bank. Mean-
while, the Reserve Bank will relax the present restriction on such credit,
viz that the initial down payment must not be less than the value of the
import content of the export order. Down payments will be agreed between
Zimbabwean exporters and foreign purchasers on a case-by-case basis (Annex
IX, para. 10).
47.      Confirmed Letters of Credit.  Letters of Credit opened by impor-
ters from some neighboring countries have to be confirmed by overseas banks
acceptable to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. Since this results in loss of



- 16 -
export orders, it is not advisable to suggest relaxation of the procedure.
However, the Reserve Bank will review the justification of continuing the
requirement in each of the countries concerned, with a view to limiting its
coverage and thereby increasing export potential (Annex IX, para. 11).
48.      Import Duty Drawbacks.  The Government permits manufacturers to
draw back import duties on materials used in production of exports. The
system is working well, and although import duties on raw materials are
low, it is a significant demonstration of the importance attached to ex-
ports. This incentive will be continued.
49.      Export Revolving Fund.  The Ministry of Trade and Commerce main-
tains a small export revolving fund (ERF) at the Reserve Bank to meet ad
hoc allocations of foreign exchange for imports of raw materials, etc.,
needed for meeting unforeseen export orders over and above normal basic al-
locations (Annex VIII). In order to streamline the procedures for allocat-
ing foreign exchange, all foreign exchange allocations for manufacturing
exports including the proceeds of the proposed loan (para. 54), will be
channelled through the Export Revolving Fund and be subject to the Fund's
procedures. However, the condition that export proceeds must be repatri-
ated within a maximum period of 180 days from the date of allocation -- the
period varies inversely with the import content of the export -- is too re-
strictive, and as a result, the ERF is of limited usefulness for the pur-
pose of facilitating additional exports. The restriction will be removed
forthwith so that each case will be determined on its own merits. Foreign
exchange allocations for manufacturing exports from the country's own ex-
port earnings shall not be less than the average of the quarterly alloca-
tions for the previous year.
50.      Interest Rates.  Following a comprehensive review by the Govern-
ment, interest rates, which in Zimbabwe historically had been low, were
doubled last year. The commercial prime rate now is 13 percent, and the
cost to the Government of long-term borrowing is up from about eight per-
cent a year ago to 12.75 percent. Although these rates still are not posi-
tive in real terms (inflation is currently estimated at about 17 percent
per year), the recent increases are substantial and reflect the interaction
of market forces.   Moreover, they are sufficiently high to discourage ex-
porters from unnecessarily holding stocks and will not be reduced for the
duration of the project (Annex IX, para. 12).
Allocation of the Manufacturing Export Promotion Loan
51.      Almost all of the US$70.6 million of the loan would finance prior-
ity imports of raw materials, components, spare parts, and balancing equip-
ment needed by registered manufacturing exporters. Consumer goods would be
excluded. For this reason, an amount of not more than US$1 million would
be set aside for financing the foreign exchange costs of export promotion
services, including market evaluation, advisory and consulting services and
technical and research publications. The Government will submit for Bank
approval, a list of specific items to be financed as a condition for



- 17 -
disbursemnent under this category of expenditure. The Bank loan would
finance about 15 percent of the US$450 million in foreign exchange required
by the manufacturing sector for current imports during the proposed loan
period of one and a half years, and about 40 percent of the estimated
US$183 million foreign exchange required by the manufacturing export
subsector, for the same period. To ensure adequate funding, the Government
will make a quarterly allocation of foreign exchange equal to at least the
average of the quarterly allocations during the previous year (Annex IX,
para. 7). Proceeds of the Bank loan would be available only to exporting
industries. To permit maximum flexibility, no industry-by-industry
allocation is proposed.
52.      Counterpart Funds.  The Zimbabwean dollar equivalent generated by
the loan would be credited to a special account in the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe to finance development projects in the Central Government budget.
Transfers from the project account would be made by the Government periodi-
cally and reported to the Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.03 (a) and
(b)).
Procurement
53.      Procurement by private firms in Zimbabwe would follow their normal
procurement procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank. The commercial
sector in Zimbabwe is sufficiently diversified and competitive to ensure
efficient procurement. However, all purchases in excess of US$4 million
would be through international competitive bidding. Contracts for such
purchases would be subject to ex-post review, in which a brief report con-
taining evidence that each contract was let in a manner satisfactory to the
Bank would be submitted prior to or with withdrawal requests. Over 75 per-
cent of the transactions are expected to be through normal commercial chan-
nels. Few individual transactions would likely exceed US$4 million or
attract international interest.
Disbursements
54.      The proposed loan would reimburse the Export Revolving Fund at the
Reserve Bank for the foreign expenditure cost of eligible imports against
full documentation, including copies of invoices, and evidence of shipping
and payment. The commercial banks would submit documents to a special unit
to be set up in the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, provided: (i) such goods were
procured in member countries, Switzerland and Taiwan; (ii) such goods were
used to manufacture exports; (iii) each eligible invoice was of a minimum
value US$5,000 equivalent; and (iv) invoices in respect of contracts in ex-
cess of US$4.0 million equivalent have been accompanied by an evaluation
report of bids or quotations received certified by the Ministry of Industry
and Energy Development. The exclusion of items costing less than US$5,000
equivalent would not create any hardship, as these items can be covered by
the country s own resources. Disbursements would be completed within 18
months from effectiveness. In order to facilitate the initial activities,
US$15 million out of the proceeds of the proposed loan will be deposited in



- 18 -
the Export Revolving Fund upon effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. The
account of the revolving fund will be replenished by the payment of subse-
quent claims for reimbursement of expenditures, which will be fully docu-
mented by the Borrower. The initial deposit will be documented at the end
of the disbursment period.
Accounts Audit and Evaluation
55.      The project account would be audited by auditors acceptable to the
Bank and certified copies of the relevant financial statements submitted to
the Bank by June 30, 1984 (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.03(c)). The
Borrower would maintain records adequate to monitor project implementa-
tion.  Furthermore, not later than six months after completion of the proj-
ect, the Government would prepare and furnish to the Bank, a completion
report on the costs and benefits resulting from the operation (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 3.03(c)).                                                                  4
Benefits and Risks
56.      The proposed project supports Zimbabwe's export promotion drive
and tackles a serious constraint to expanding exports -- scarcity of
foreign exchange. It would provide manufacturers with foreign exchange
needed to expand their exports and help make them more competitive in
international markets. The export promotion services would help them
learn, adjust and develop the skills needed in international trade to which
they have limited exposure because of the country's protracted isolation
from the international community. The principal benefits of the project
would be: increased manufactured exports, estimated at US$135 million
annually; and additional employment of about 3,000 jobs utilizing capacity
which otherwise would be idle. The assistance would facilitate important
administrative and policy improvements affecting exports. It would also
set the stage for broader policy improvements.
57.      Given the Government s ability to administer the project and
Zimbabwean manufacturers ability to use it to expand exports and employ-
ment, there are no appreciable risks in the project per se.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.      The Draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Zimbabwe and the

C. STATUS OF BANK AND IDA PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
(As of September 30, 1982)
Loan No. 1959-ZIM    Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Program:  US$50
Credit No. 1120-ZIM million and US$15 million, respectively, of April 9,
1981; Effectiveness Date: April 9, 1981; Closing
Date: March 31, 1982
The loan and credit have financed priority import requirements of
raw materials, spare parts, components and balancing equipment needed to
utilize idle capacity in the manufacturing sector. The program is being
implemented by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The loan and credit are
already fully disbursed. It is too early to assess the full impact of the
loan and credit, nevertheless, during the loan-and credit period,
manufactured output increased by almost 10 percent. However, because of a
shortfall in the availability of foreign exchange, full reconstruction of
the sector is unlikely to be achieved.
Loan No. 1994-ZIM    Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program:  US$42 mil-
lion, of June 22, 1981; Effectiveness Date: June 26,
1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The Transport Rehabilitation Imports Program Loan is providing
for locomotive and wagon spare parts, electrical spare parts, general spare
parts, machines and tools, signalling equipment, service vehicles, track
tools and equipment, and technical assistance for the National Railways of
Zimbabwe and the Central Mechanical Equipment Department. The departure
rate of skilled staff has increased far beyond the level expected at loan
appraisal, resulting in additional need for technical assistance. Conse-
quently, in addition to the US$6.8 million for technical assistance estim-
ated at loan appraisal, another US$7.1 million has been reallocated to that
category. Since NRZ anticipates a considerable long-term technical assist-
ance requirement from 1984 onward, a special railway technical assistance
and training project, for which Bank assistance has been requested, is
under preparation.

Credit No. 1291-ZIM Small Farm Credit Project: US$30.4 Million, of
November 17, 1982; Effectiveness Date: Not Yet
Effective; Closing Date: June 30, 1986
The project is providing through AFC seasonal credit for seeds,
fertilizer and chemicals, medium-term credit for farm improvement and
equipment; plus facilities and technical assistance to AFC in support of
its expansion of small farm credit.
Credit No. 1296-ZIM Petroleum Fuels Supply Technical Assistance Project:
US$1.2 Million, of November 17, 1982; Effectiveness
Date: Not Yet Effective; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The project provides for economic and engineering studies of
petroleum fuels supply options available to Zimbabwe, recommending the
preferred system, taking into account cost, suitability and reliability of
supply. The study also would recommend improvements in the procurement,
pricing and internal distribution of petroleum fuels, plus financing
training.

D. STATUS OF IFC PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
(As of September 30, 1982)
Wankie Colliery Company Limited (HCCL)            552-ZIM
IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe, a loan of US$38 million
(gross) together with US$10 million arranged by IFC to cover the medium-
term maturities on an EximBank package, helped finance a US$191 million ex-
pansion of HCCL's coal mining operations, principally to supply a thermal
power plant. The financial plan included US$51 million of cash generation
and US$14 million to be raised by a rights offering. In view of the diffi-
culty a rights offering would face in the current stock market environment
in Zimbabwe, the Government has agreed to make an equity investment in the
Company to replace the rights issue. Under the terms negotiated, the Gov-
ernment will subscribe to 40 percent of the Company s equity and will nomi-
nate five out of the ten directors, including the chairman.

The Foreign Exchange Allocation System
1.        Zimbabwe maintains control on all foreign exchange transac-
tions. All imports require a license, which is granted on the basis of a
foreign exchange allocation. Every quarter, the Treasury decides on the
global allocation for imports based on estimates of the prospective bal-
ance of payments position. The figure of global allocations is conveyed
to the Ministry of Trade and Commerce and is then divided through the
Joint Allocation Committee among various uses, namely petroleum and elec-
tricity, public sector maintenance, development projects, commercial
imports, industrial imports, fertilizer and pesticides, etc. The Ministry
of Trade and Commerce has the primary responsibility for commercial allo-
cations, while the Ministry of Industry and Energy deals, among others,
with industrial imports.
2.        Commercial import allocations are made to traders on the basis
of past performance. Quotas are fixed in relation to the import of a
trader in the year 1965. New traders or firms may apply for a commercial
allocation but the criteria for justifying allocation to them are strict.
Allocations are divided among permissible imports by applying essentiality
tests. About 30 percent of commercial allocations are for raw materials;
40 percent for spare parts and 15 percent for capital goods. Only 10 per-
cent of commercial allocations are for consumer goods including essential
items such as medicines, books etc.
3.        "Industrial Import Allocations" are made directly to firms in
the mining and manufacturing sectors. Separate allocations are made to
each firm in respect of inputs needed for the local market and those for
the export market; for spares; and for replacement machinery. Allocations
are made on the basis of six-monthly bids received from manufacturers and
generally go by past performance. Allocations for the export market re-
ceive high priority. A mining continuation reserve is maintained to meet
the small requirements of the mining industry; these are granted on the
recommendation of the Ministry of Mines, without having to go through the
Joint Allocation Committee.

4.        Allocations for capital goods needed for expansion of capacity
are approved by the Industrial Projects Committee, the essential criteria
being that the firm be able to re-coup the foreign exchange within 12
months.
5.        No import is normally allowed if there is adequate availability
from domestic production.

Export Revolving Fund
1.        The Export Revolving Fund (ERF) was set up to encourage
manufactured exports. It gives exporters additional foreign exchange over
and above the basic allocation.
2.        The Fund is administered by the Ministry of Trade and Commerce,
and makes ad hoc allocations of foreign exchange on condition that the
export proceeds will be received in Zimbabwe within a certain time period
(maximum 6 months).
3.        The period of grace is on a sliding scale and varies with import
content of the goods exported.
4.        If the export earnings are received within 6 months, then the
ERF is credited with:
(a)  the amount of the foreign exchange
allocated; and
(b)  half the net export earnings -- the other
half is put into the common foreign exchange
pool.
5.        If the export earnings are not received within 6 months, then
the ERF is debited with the value of the foreign exchange allocation.
NOTE
Net export earnings are the difference between the total export
earnings and the foreign exchange allocation.

Mr. A.W. Clausen, President
International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development
1818 "H" Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20433
Dear Mr. Clausen:
LETTER OF EXPORT PROMOTION POLICIES
1.        A sharp decline in Zimbabwe's terms of trade and volume of ex-
ports, resulting from the international recession, coupled with rapidly
accelerating import prices have caused a serious deterioration in our bal-
ance of payments situation. In addition, the severe drought which affected
almost the whole country has considerably reduced agricultural exports; and
manufactured exports are curtailed because of shortages of foreign exchange
needed to finance imported inputs. In an effort to sustain production
levels and maintain services, the Government has taken recourse to short-
term and expensive borrowing. However, such borrowing has had to be limit-
ed, otherwise it would have serious debt service implications. The immedi-
ate net effect of all these factors, has been a severe cut back on imports
with dire repercussions for the economy generally, but more so, for those
sectors which depend upon imported inputs.
2.        While we may not be able to alter the basic factors -- interna-
tional recession and drought -- underlying our situation, we, however, be-
lieve that with appropriate adjustments on our part and adequate assist-
ance, we have a potential and the capacity of substantially improving our
export performance by expanding our manufactured exports, for which we have
an administrative framework, entrepreneurial skills, adequate skilled labor
force and unutilized capacity already in place, which would provide a basis
for expanded output.
3.        We see the proposed Export Promotion Program as an interim meas-
ure. A number of policy initiatives designed to increase manufactured ex-
ports would be put in place and foreign exchange would be made available
for a priority objective in this context. The program would create the
momentum for a broad-based adjustment process further down the road, which
would address macro-economic issues and identified sectoral constraints at
an appropriate time.
4.        However, such a broad-based operation would require a substantial
*           groundwork and extensive preparation to be undertaken, including, detailed
economic and sectoral analyses and studies in order to evolve an appropri-
ate adjustment program. To maintain the momentum, however, we would hope



- 38 -                        ANNEX IX
Page 2 of 4
that the preparatory work can be done reasonably quickly so as to minimize
the time lag between this and the more broad-based operation.
GOVERNMENT ACTION PROGRAM
5.        In order to facilitate the objective of increasing manufactured
exports, the Government has formulated a short-term manufacturing export
promotion program. The essence of the program is removal of identified
constraints which now impede manufactured exports and provision of adequate
foreign exchange to finance imported inputs. Specifically, the program in-
cludes policy and administrative measures for:
(i) streamlining import licensing and foreign exchange
allocation procedures;
(ii) providing export incentives;
(iii) instituting appropriate export credit facilities;
and
(iv) appropriate management of exchange rate and trade
regime.
6.        Import Licensing and Foreign Exchange Allocation Procedures.  The
foreign exchange allocation system has, in the past, worked well in alloca-
ting the limited resource according to the country's priorities. Neverthe-
less, the Government has decided to review the system to ensure that it
effectively serves our current needs. As the Bank is aware, towards that
objective, the Government hired a consulting firm to undertake a comprehen-
sive review of the system and to make recommendations for improvement and/
or changes. The study has been completed and a draft report has been sub-
mitted to the Government and is under review. Meanwhile, to ensure expedi-
tious and continuous flow of exports, the Government intends to streamline
the system so that (a) registered exporters will automatically be entitled
to replenishment license equal to the value of the import content of their
exports; (b) to ensure quality and competitiveness, importation of mater-
ials that are domestically produced but of insufficiently high quality to
be used in manufacture of exports will be permitted; and (c) all registered
exporters will be permitted to import their inputs directly.
7.        Export Revolving Fund.  Presently, the export revolving fund
(ERF), administered by the Ministry of Trade and Commerce, provides foreign
exchange to meet ad hoc allocations of foreign exchange for imports needed
to meet unforeseen export orders over and above normal basic allocations.
In order to streamline foreign exchange allocation procedures and minimize
fluctuations in foreign exchange availability for manufactured exports, all
quarterly foreign exchange allocations for manufactured exports from our



- 39 -                        ANNEX IX
Page 3 of 4
own export earnings, which will not be less than the average of the quar-
terly allocations for the previous year, will be channelled through the re-
volving fund and be subject to the fund's procedures; except the condition
that export proceeds must be repatriated within a maximum period of 180
days from the date of allocation -- the period varying with the import con-
tent of the export which is too restrictive. The condition will be re-
moved so that each case will be determined on its own merit.
8.        Export Incentives.  The Government has introduced an export in-
centive scheme to help defray some of the exporters nontradable costs
which are associated with the establishment of external markets, particu-
larly for a country like Zimbabwe which has been isolated from normal
international trade. The scheme provides for a tax free cash payment based
on actual export performance as follows:
(a) a basic flat rate of seven percent of the f.o.b.
value of consignments of qualifying exports; and
(b) an incremental performance rate of five percent of
the value of export performance achieved within a
period over and above the performance registered
for a similar period during the previous year.
9.        Export Credit.  Because of the tight balance of payments situa-
tion, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has been very strict regarding export
credit and repatriation of export proceeds. Adherence to the restrictions
in the past, has ensured expeditious receipt of export earnings, however,
it has also adversely affected the country's volume of exports, particular-
ly, to the neighboring countries which are experiencing foreign exchange
problems, and are seeking extended credit facilities, which Zimbabwe's com-
petitors are able and willing to offer. We are convinced that we could ap-
preciably increase the volume of our exports through liberalization of
credit facilities. The Government, therefore, will review the export cred-
it facilities with the view to extending the credit period from 90 up to
180 days.
10.       In addition, the requirement that initial payment must not be
less than the value of the import content of the export will be relaxed.
Henceforth, initial payments will be agreed upon between Zimbabwe exporters
and foreign purchasers on a case-by-case basis.
11.       Because of a high degree of uncertainty and the cumbersome pay-
ment procedures, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe requests that Letters of
Credit opened by importers from some neighboring countries be confirmed by
overseas banks acceptable to the Reserve Bank. This results in loss of
some export orders. The Reserve Bank will review the justification of

continuing with this requirement on a country-by-country basis with the
view to limiting its application and thereby increase export orders.
12.       Interest Rates.  As you may be aware, the Government has appreci-
ably increased interest rates in the past year such that the prime rate is
now 13 percent (two percentage point below estimated current inflation rate
of 15 percent). The rates are reflective of the present interaction of
supply and demand forces in the country. We consider them sufficiently
high to discourage exporters from unnecessarily holding stocks and the
Government does not intend to lower the rates for the duration of the pro-
gram.
13.       Exchange Rate and Trade Regime.  The value of the Zimbabwean dol-
lar is determined by the Reserve Bank (Central Bank) of Zimbabwe with ref-
erence to the movement of a basket of other currencies (the US dollar is
the currency with the largest weight in the basket). In 1981, the Zimbab-
wean dollar depreciated about 12 percent against the US dollar, but appre-
ciated about 13 percent against the South African Rand and by a smaller
margin against some west European currencies. In light of this develop-
ment, and the deteriorating balance of payments situation, the Government,
on December 9, 1982, took a bold corrective measure and devalued the
Zimbabwe dollar by 20 percent. We will remain vigilant and ensure that the
exchange rate and other incentives are managed in a manner which reflects
developments in countries competing with Zimbabwe inthe export markets and
ensure the competitivenss of Zimbabwean exports.
14.       As part of the Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Program, we
undertook to carry out an effective protection study in order to determine
the effects of the trade regime and other incentives and develop recommend-
ations to improve both. The study is proceeding well and is expected to be
completed on schedule by March 31, 1983. Upon completion, we will consult
with the Bank on the results of the study and establish a mechanism for im-
plementing the accepted recommendations of the study.
15.       The Government intends to pursue the policies outlined above, and
we hope that we can count on the international community for support with
the resources needed to back up the policies by financing the urgently
needed imports for expanding production of exports. To help the country
achieve its goal, the Government now specifically requests an export promo-
tion loan from the World Bank.
Yours sincerely,
B.T. Chidzero
Minister of Finance, Economic
Planning and Development
