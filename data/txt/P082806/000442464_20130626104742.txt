1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Inappropriate sector policies have led to a serious deterioration of Madagascar's transport
infrastructure. It is estimated that the country lost on average about 1,000 kilometers (km) of
roads per year during the period 1980-1999. In April 2000, the Government of Madagascar
(GoM) adopted a comprehensive transport sector policy and strategy, which aims at: (i) focusing
the Ministry's role on strategic planning, sector oversight and coordination; (ii) creating jointly
public-private controlled and user-financed agencies for sub-sector management and regulatory
functions; (iii) divesting operational activities to the private sector, through privatization and
concession arrangements; (iv) developing the local private sector for works design and
execution; and (v) rehabilitating transport infrastructure to appropriate levels.

2.       An Adaptable Program Loan (APL) series was prepared to assist the GoM to implement
its transport sector policy and strategy. The objectives of the APL were to reduce transport costs
and to improve accessibility especially in rural areas. The Transport Infrastructure Investment
Project (TIIP, Credit 3836-MG) is the third of three parallel phases of the APL. The first phase,
the Transport Sector Reform and Rehabilitation Project (TSRRP), in the amount of Special
Drawing Rights (SDR) 48.4 million (about US$66.0 million), was approved on June 1, 2000, and
closed on July 31, 2005. Its objectives were to: (i) strengthen transport sector policy and
management; (ii) strengthen road management; (iii) support the implementation of an
environmental and social mitigation strategy; and (iv) restore transport infrastructure facilities.
The Rural Transport Project (RTP) was the second phase of the APL which was approved on
November 14, 2002, in the amount of SDR 60.7 million (about US$80 million), became effective
on March 13, 2003 and closed on December 31, 2012. Its initial objectives were to: (i)
sustainably improve the access of rural communities to markets, schools, health centers and other
economic and social infrastructure; (ii) enhance the mobility of the rural population, in order to
improve their quality of life; and (iii) promote economic development. In July 2007, the RTP
was restructured and its objective was revised to the following: “increased use of rural roads by
residents of beneficiary rural communes?.

3.      The TIIP was in line with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of November
2002 and the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of October 2003. The strategy, based
on the principle of public private partnership, had three main axes: (i) restoring a rule of law and
a well governed society; (ii) promoting economic growth with a large social base; and (iii)
promoting systems for establishing human security and enlarging social protection. The second
axis sought to foster macroeconomic stability and pro-poor growth, revitalizing the private
sector, and promoting the development of growth sectors. The main focus was on improving the
transport network.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

4.      The objective of the TIIP was to rehabilitate the country’s major transport infrastructure
in order to reduce transport cost and to facilitate trade.



                                                 1
5.      The PDO indicators are: (i) Increased traffic through improved transport infrastructure
(both passengers and freight): average annual traffic increase of 10 percent after rehabilitation;
(ii) decreased user cost: between 20 and 60 percent depending on road link; and (iii) decreased
time delays on the nation’s main transport infrastructure: between 30 percent and 300 percent
depending on link.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

6.      The PDO and the PDO indicators were not revised during the course of the project.
However, during the early 2006 restructuring which added the railway component, the
intermediate outcome indicator concerning the road rehabilitation was adjusted to reflect the
reduction in the length of works. In addition, four new intermediate outcome indicators were
added to monitor the railway component. The other three remaining intermediate outcome
indicators on port, airport, and institutional support were kept unchanged.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7.      By rehabilitating the transport infrastructure, the TIIP benefited all transport users
directly and the entire population indirectly. For the road sub-sector, the primary beneficiaries
were the primary users of the roads: travelling public, car owners, transport companies and
industries. For the railway sub-sector, the primary beneficiaries were the oil companies,
factories, mining industries, etc., the Northern Railway concessionaire, and the consumers of
goods transported by rail. For the port and airport sub-sectors, the primary beneficiaries were the
primary users of the improved infrastructure such as the private sector, the transport companies,
the passengers, the freights owners.

8.       There were also other beneficiaries: (i) the agricultural sector which benefited from the
improved accessibility to the agricultural production areas due to the road rehabilitation works;
(ii) the construction industry due to the induced creation of jobs caused by the road rehabilitation
works; (iii) the Ministries and the parastatal entities dealing with the transport sector through the
institutional support component; and (iv) the trade industry, as trade was facilitated by easier
circulation of persons and goods.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

9.     The original components at the time of the approval are as follows:

10.    Component A: National Road Upgrading, Rehabilitation and Maintenance (US$110.75
million)
        249 km of periodic maintenance on the National Road (Route Nationale) RN2 which
         link the capital Antananarivo with the main port of Toamasina;
        112 km of upgrading to paved standard on the RN44 from Marovoay to Vohidiala
         (RN44 South). This road connects the Alaotra lake region, the main rice growing area
         of Madagascar, to the RN2;



                                                 2
          69 km of rehabilitation of the gravel road from Ambatondrazaka to Vohitraivo (RN44
           North);
          295 km of periodic maintenance on various sections of the RN7 between
           Antananarivo and Fianarantsoa. This road can be considered “the spine? of the road
           network of Madagascar;
          186 km of rehabilitation and periodic maintenance on the bituminous RN32 from
           Antsohihy to Mandritsara, a departmental capital and a major agricultural production
           zone;
          159 km of rehabilitation and paving on the RN5a from Ambilobe to Vohemar. This
           road is the missing surface link to access to the North East coastal region of
           Madagascar;
          The rehabilitation of about 30 ferries. Because of the lack of bridges, these ferries
           located mainly along the East Coast are the only existing means for cars and trucks to
           cross some large rivers. They constitute an integral part of the roads assets.

11.    The estimated cost of these interventions including contingencies was about US$141
million. The financing gap of US$30 million was supposed to be financed either by an IDA
supplemental/follow-on credit, or by other development partners.

12.    Component B: Ports Upgrading, Rehabilitation and Maintenance (US$22.85 million)
        Provision of technical advisory services and training, and establishment of a
         management information system, for the benefit of Port, Maritime and River Agency
         (Agence Portuaire, Maritime et Fluviale – APMF), and acquisition of equipment for
         the benefit of APMF, National Maritime Training School(Ecole Nationale
         d'Enseignement Maritime - ENEM) and Maritime Training Center (Centre
         d'Apprentissage Maritime - CAM);
        Rehabilitation of existing operational areas at the port of Mahajanga as well as the
         construction of a limited extension;
        Limited rehabilitation of existing infrastructure serving ferry traffic between Grande
         Terre/Manompana and Sainte Marie;
        The rehabilitation of 4 main lighthouses;
        Provision of coastal navigation aids, supplies and technical advisory services to assist
         in ensuring compliance with the International Maritime Organization-International
         Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (IMO-MARPOL). Madagascar
         joined the convention in May 2003; and
        Carrying out of littoral protection works in Toamasina, and acquisition of equipment
         to deal with oil spill contingencies.

13.    Component C: Airports Modernization and Institutional Reinforcement (US$7.77
million)
        Safety, security, and operational enhancements on the Malagasy airport network
         through the provision of respective up-to-date equipment to comply with the
         International Civil Aviation Organization standards; and
        The financing of technical assistance to the Vice Prime Minister’s office (VPM) for
         the establishment of public-private partnership arrangements on secondary airports.


                                               3
14.     Component D: Support to the VPM (US$8.62 million)
         Support for the social plan for the redeployment of staff;
         Provision of technical support including technical assistance, training and equipment;
          and
         Feasibility studies, preliminary and detailed designs, and preparation of bidding
          documents to meet future needs in the sector.

1.6 Revised Components

15.     The project components were formally revised twice at Board level. The first
restructuring was made on January 10, 2006 and became effective on February 16, 2006 in order
to change the project’s institutional arrangements and to add the Northern Railway component in
the amount of US$31.7 million. The scope of activities in the other components (roads, ports,
and airports) had to be adjusted downwards to remain within the overall project envelope of SDR
104.4 million. A second revision to the project scope was made during the approval of an
additional financing to the Northern Railway component in the amount of SDR 10.4 million
(about US$15.6 million) in April 2007.

1.7 Other significant changes

17.     Implementation arrangements. At approval, the governmental entity in charge of the
Project was the Vice Prime Ministry, Office of Economic Programs, Ministry of Transport,
Public Works and Regional Planning (VPM). On March 17, 2005, the VPM was disbanded and
the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) was created and became the governmental
entity in charge of the Project. In January 2007, the MPWT was split into two ministries: (i) the


                                                  6
Ministry of Public Works and Meteorology (MPWM, in charge of the roads); and (ii) the
Ministry of Transport (MT, in charge of railways, ports and airports).

18.     Procurement, financial management, social and environmental safeguards
implementations of the Project were the responsibility of the Program Executive Secretariat
(PES) at approval. The PES worked in collaboration with the entities responsible for the
execution of the various sub-components of the project. Due to decline in its performance, the
PES was closed on June 13, 2005. A joint-venture comprising international and local auditing
firms was recruited to ensure the fiduciary functions (financial management and procurement).
Technical and coordination responsibilities for project implementation were assigned to the
newly created autonomous agencies working under the aegis of the ministries in charge of
transport. This change was introduced in the first project restructuring of January 2006 and
reflected in the corresponding Credit Agreement. As for the new railway component which was
introduced at that time, the Northern railway concessionaire, Madarail, was in charge of both the
fiduciary and technical responsibility. Since Madarail is a private company managing public
funds, a project agreement was signed between IDA and Madarail.

19.    Financing parameters. A new country financing parameters allowing for 100 percent
financing of all project expenditure including taxes and recurrent expenditures was adopted for
the project as a result of the January 10, 2006 restructuring. At approval, the percentage of
expenditures to be financed by the Project varied from 75 to 100 percent, taxes included,
depending on the categories.

20.    Freeze on disbursements. Due to the political crisis starting in early 2009, Madagascar
was put under the OP/BP7.30 “dealing with de facto government?. As a consequence, project
disbursements under the TIIP were totally frozen for about 14 months (from March 2009 to May
2010). No payment was made even for completed activities.

21.    Closing date. At appraisal, the TIIP was expected to close on June 30, 2008. However,
the TIIP closing date was extended four times. The first extension was requested and approved
during the restructuring of 2006 to extend the closing date until June 30, 2009. The second
extension was requested and approved to extend the closing date until February 28, 2010. The
third extension was decided internally by the Bank during the application of OP 7.30 to the
Madagascar portfolio and in application of the exception memo signed by the Managing Director
on May 6, 2010, to extend the closing date until June 30, 2011. The fourth and last extension was
requested and approved to extend the closing date until June 30, 2012.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22.     Government strategy supported by the project was appropriate. To revive the
declining transport sector, and make it a key driver of economic growth, GoM and the
development partners, agreed that interventions in the transport sector had to focus on two areas:
(i) physical infrastructure, and (ii) institutional policy reform. This approach was adequate given
that the conditions of the transport infrastructure in general were poor and the direct involvement


                                                7
of GoM in all activities related to the transport sector was proven to be unproductive and
unsustainable. However, the Government intervention strategy was not focused on some specific
transport area but concerned all transport subsectors and all transport infrastructure in the
country. While this may be justified by the huge needs, priority choices could have been made
more clearly to avoid spending efforts and money on activities that would have less impact.

23.     Project design was coherent with the context at appraisal. The TIIP was prepared
within a coherent and holistic APL series which supported the aforementioned Government
intervention strategy. The components and the institutional arrangements of the TIIP was
designed to follow-up on the first APL which had started rehabilitating transport infrastructure
and had laid the foundations for the institutional policy reforms (reform of the Road Maintenance
Fund, concession agreements for the Northern Railway and the container terminal at the Port of
Toamasina, creation of the autonomous regulatory agencies for civil aviation and for the port,
maritime and river subsector, management contract for the national airline, restructuring of the
ministries in charge of transport, etc.).

24.     Project design focused more on transport infrastructure rehabilitation. Unlike the
first APL which focused both on institutional reform and transport infrastructure rehabilitation,
the TIIP put more emphasize on the latter. In addition, some key transport infrastructures were
destroyed during the political crisis following the 2002 presidential election and needed
emergency rehabilitation which was taken up in the TIIP. The emphasis taken by TIIP on
infrastructure development rather than institutional development was coherent with the overall
programmatic approach of the Madagascar transport sector APL series.

25.    The PDO was relatively straightforward but ambitious. The PDO defined two levels
of objectives of which the first one was to rehabilitate the most important transport infrastructure
in Madagascar. The rehabilitation of the major transport infrastructure was expected to reduce
transport cost and travel time due to the improvement of the infrastructure conditions.
Consequently, the second level of objectives in the PDO which was the reduction of transport
costs and the facilitation of trade would be attained. The expected completion of the sector
reform implemented by the Government would have ensured the sustainability of the objectives
and the adequate operations of the transport services in the road, railway, port and airport
subsectors.

26.     Not all risks were adequately identified. The following two main risks were discussed
in the PAD: (i) insufficient implementation capacity of the implementing agencies, ministries,
and the private sector; (ii) insufficient progress in implementing the transport sector reforms
agenda. These risks did materialize during implementation. However, the following risks could
have been also identified and partly mitigated: (i) cost increase provided that accurate cost
estimates were not available at appraisal as the detailed engineering studies of the complex
rehabilitation works were not ready; (ii) lack of counterpart funding provided the budget
constraints faced by the Government; and (iii) political risk affecting institutional and
sustainability outcomes of TIIP and transport sector APL series.

27.     The quality at entry was not totally adequate. Normally, the design and technical
studies of the activities implemented under a middle or end stage APL should have been done
during the previous stage APL but it was not the case for the TIIP since most of the road works

                                                 8
studies were not completed at approval. Thus, the project was not at a good level of
implementation readiness. The change in the sequencing of the APLs could explain this. Initially,
while the first APL focused on institutional reforms, the second one was planned to focus on
aviation and railways, the third one on rural transport, and the fourth and last one on roads and
ports. But with the emerging needs for transport infrastructure rehabilitation after the 2002 crisis
and change of government, the initially second and forth APL were merged to form the TIIP–
APL3 and the initially third APL became the RTP–APL2. The institutional reform was on a
momentum even after the 2002 crisis so decision was made to start preparing both the RTP–
APL2 and the TIIP–APL3 in order to accelerate the pace of transport infrastructure
improvement. The rural focused RTP–APL2 and the infrastructure investment focused TIIP–
APL3 were implemented almost in parallel.

2.2 Implementation

(a) Factors outside the control of government or implementing agencies

28.     Poor performance of contractors. The contractor doing the works on the RN44South,
RN44 North, and RN2 performed poorly and the contracts were terminated later on. The amount
of the terminated contracts was about 36 percent of the total TIIP amount. One of the reasons
which could explain the poor performance was the lack of previous experience in the country.
Another reason could have been that the contractor that was procured did not have the requisite
capacity and wherewithal to execute the works.

29.     Cyclonic activity. In 2007, the East part of Madagascar was severely hit by cyclones
which provoked substantial damages on the RN2 and the Northern Railway. Consequently, the
quantity of works to be fulfilled increased. However, it is known that this part of the country is
often hit by cyclones. Therefore, the design and the maintenance of transport infrastructure in
that area should always take this situation into account.

30.    Currency fluctuations and inflation. During the peak of works in late 2007/early 2008,
1 euro was around 0.95 SDR while it was about 0.83 SDR during contracts signature in 2006.
Since most road contracts of the TIIP were paid in euros, this exchange rate fluctuation caused
additional costs to the road component. Moreover, the steady increase of oil prices from 2003 to
2008 affected the general price of rehabilitation works. The OPEC basket price was about
US$28.10 in 2003 whereas it was about US$94.45 in 2008.1

31.    Protracted political crisis starting from 2009. Violent civil unrest started in late 2008,
and a mutiny ousted the President of Madagascar in March 2009. A transitional government has
been in place since then and the country is still currently in political turmoil. This situation
caused the application of the Bank OP7.30 dealing with de facto government which is not lifted
yet. The protracted political crisis affected the TIIP and the transport sector in the following
manner:

                                                         9
      Further to the application of the OP7.30, disbursement was frozen in March 2009 for
       about 14 months. All payments were suspended regardless of the status of the activities
       (completed, partially achieved or on-going). The amount of outstanding invoices for the
       RN2 and RN7 was about US$16 million. As a result: (i) contractors claimed default
       interests of about US$1 million; (ii) ongoing activities such as the works on the RN2, the
       International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) works and equipment, and the works
       on the railway component were suspended for about 12 months due to lack of funding
       and arrears. Since there was no clear guidance from the Bank on the possible time of
       disbursements’ resumption, implementing agencies had difficulties to make decision
       whether to demobilize the contractors or not.
      For about one year, high level discussion with the Borrower was not authorized and no
       supervision mission was undertaken.
      For safety reason, field visit was restricted.
      Project closing date had to be extended for a total duration of 28 months to complete the
       remaining activities which constituted only about 20 percent of the project amount.
      No tangible progress has been made since then on the reform process.
      Fuel levy allocated to the Road Maintenance Fund (Fond d’Entretien Routier, FER)
       substantially decreased and so undermined the sustainability of the road network. Of
       about MGA 100 billion (about US$50 million) in 2009, it was only about MGA16.7
       billion (about US$8.35 million) in 2012.
      No new transport operation was financed by external donors. For example, the EU
       suspended its grant for Madagascar in the amount of Euros 300 million, of which Euros
       180 million was allocated to the transport sector. However, the other development
       partners continued to pay for completed or on-going activities of their transport projects
       under implementation. The new World Bank transport project of about US$80 million
       ready for board presentation in 2009, to follow-up on the TIIP, was dropped.
      The economic slowdown effect of the crisis decreased the level of transport traffic.
       Annual traffic in the main Port of Tomasina dropped from 3,250,024 Tons in 2008 to
       2,374,457 Tons in 2009 and 2,257,372 Tons in 2010.

(b) Factors generally subject to government control

32.    Lack of counterpart funding. Because of financial constraints and inadequate budget
planning, the Government was not able to meet its counterpart funding obligations of the project.
As a result of this, the scope of the road rehabilitation works was reduced as the IDA portion of
the project financing arrangements had to finance 100 percent of all project costs starting from
the January 2006 restructuring.

33.     Uneven commitment to transport sector reforms. The implementation of the social
plan linked to the restructuring of the ministries in charge of transport and the creation of the
different autonomous agencies such as the Road Authority and the Land Transport Agency were
the only significant sector reforms achieved during the implementation of the TIIP. That’s
because the Government changed course and did not concession the airports and the reform in
the port sector (establishment of the port with autonomous management) did not progress.
Furthermore, the strict application the axle load control was not effective and the “concession
monitoring committee? for the Northern Railway was not put in place. The limited achievement

                                               10
in the sector reform agenda supported by the TIIP could be explained by: (i) the overambitious
scope of the reform; (ii) strong vested interests; (iii) the lack of continuous ownership of the
reforms with frequent changes of government high-level staff; and (iv) most importantly the
political crisis. Thus, the sustainability of the project objectives which should have been
reinforced by the completion of the sector reform is not totally ensured.

34.     The scope of the project was modified several times during implementation. This
allowed the project to quickly respond to emergencies and to address changes in investment
priorities and the emerging needs during works execution.

(c) Factors generally subject to implementing agencies control

35.     Implementation delays. The speed and quality of implementation had improved with the
new implementation arrangements following the closure of the PES and the restructuring of
2006. Nevertheless, collaboration between the Road Authority and the firm in charge of the
fiduciary function was difficult as they often disagreed on procurement rules and procedures.

                    - Goods



37.     The M&E framework did not adequately define the outcomes directly supported by
the TIIP. Whereas transport infrastructure rehabilitation was the main activities of the TIIP, the
M&E framework captured the outputs and the outcomes of the entire Government rehabilitation
program and the overall sector reforms. The M&E framework was designed to focus on a
program but not on a project. It should be noted that this was a common feature of M&E
frameworks for legacy projects of that era which had a much wider interpretation on what
outcomes could be attributed to the project versus an overall program partly supported by the
project.


                                                        11
38.     The PDO indicators were too broad. The PDO indicators only provided a broad
overview of the outcomes to be measured (traffic increase, user cost and time delays decrease)
and its value change (between 20 and 60 percent between 30 and 300 percent). An underlying
assumption was that the PDO indicators, the baseline and the target values would be refined for
each concerned transport infrastructure.

39.     The intermediate outcome indicators were the outputs of the entire road rehabilitation
program in the country and the transport sector reforms. When the Northern Railway component
was added to the project, the operational and the financial performance of the concession were
put as intermediate outcome indicators.

(b) Implementation

40.     Data collection during implementation was poor. Regular annual data on road vehicle
traffic was not available since traffic counting was not done periodically for lack of resources.
The third PDO indicator (time delays) was never measured. Nevertheless, the intermediate
outcomes indicators data was regularly collected because they were either easily measurable or
available.

(c) Utilization

41.     The M&E framework could not be utilized as a decision making tool at a project
level because of its design. It could have been useful to refine the indicators and adjust the M&E
framework during implementation in order to monitor and evaluate the project activities, outputs
and outcomes.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

(a) Safeguard

42.    The TIIP was a Category A project. Two safeguards policies were triggered: (i)
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP4.01), and (ii) Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP4.12). There
was no significant deviation or waiver from the Bank safeguards policies and procedures during
preparation and implementation. More details are provided in Annex 11.

(b) Fiduciary

43.     The fiduciary situation of the TIIP can be divided into two periods: before the closure of
the PES (Program Executive Secretariat) in 2005 and after its closure. Before the closure of the
PES, procurement related issues occurred: (i) poor archiving; (ii) unclear share of responsibilities
among the procurement staff; (iii) non-compliance with the procurement rules for certain
activities. On the financial management side, there were some weaknesses on the internal
control: (i) purchase order established after the invoice; (ii) absence of the Bank no-objection for
some expenses; (iii) inefficient use of gasoline ticket; (iv) assets not regularly registered; and (v)
non-use of the asset management software.



                                                 12
44.    However, after the PES’s closure in 2005, the situation improved radically. The
consortium provided qualified and experienced personnel in charge of the financial management
and procurement tasks. For the railway component, the concessionaire managed the financial
management and procurement matters as well as the technical implementation.

45.     The consortium complied with the Bank procurement rules and guidelines. They put in
place adequate financial management arrangements over the course of the implementation
period. The quarterly financial reports and annual audit reports were submitted to the Bank on a
timely basis and recommendations made, subsequent to implementation support missions, were
appropriately implemented. The internal controls were spelt out in a Procedures Manual and
amendments to the Manual were made on a periodic basis in order to take into account changes
in the project’s operations. Despite the absence of the internal audit function, an internal check
mechanism was in place to ensure the appropriate use of project resources. However, the external
auditors identified the critical need by the GoM to settle VAT arrears which were still
outstanding at the time of project closure.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

46.     The policy discussion undertaken during the TIIP has been followed up by the
preparation and dissemination of policy notes to GoM. The objectives are to inform the
transitional government on the context and issues faced by the sector, to propose some
recommendations in order to preserve the progress to date in infrastructure rehabilitation and
reforms. The policy notes are in line with the transport sector policy and strategy supported by
the APL series in general and the TIIP in particular.

47.      The construction of nine river jetties for the ferries and the RN44 works under the TIIP
have been followed up by the RTP–APL2 which has financed the construction of eighteen river
jetties for ferries and the reparation of ten bridges on the RN44. The RTP – APL2 also financed
the reparation of some cyclone related damages on the Northern Railway.

48.     The Emergency Infrastructure Preservation and Vulnerability Reduction Project was
approved in end-November 2012. This multisectoral project in the amount of about US$102
million can be considered as a follow-up to the TIIP in terms of major infrastructure
rehabilitation. The TIIP has financed the design study for the rehabilitation of two major bridges
in this project (Manakarabe and Maroantsetra). The Road Authority which was in charge of the
road component of the TIIP, will implement the road activities of this project such as: (i) the
rehabilitation and asset preservation of existing major bridges on key National Roads; (ii) the
rehabilitation works on key National Roads; (iii) the reconstruction of bridges that have
exceeded their design life; and (iv) the road asset preservation.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

49.    The objective of the TIIP which was to rehabilitate major transport infrastructure in order
to reduce transport cost and to facilitate trade remains relevant. The Madagascar Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) approved by the Board on February 21, 2012 quotes “transport infrastructure
investment is still needed given the fact that connectivity plays an important role for a big island
like Madagascar? and “Madagascar must improve its internal transportation systems and its
connections with the rest of the world.? Moreover, “connected infrastructure? was one of the
commitments of the 2006 Madagascar Action Plan.

50.     The TIIP was designed using a Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) approach. It is still
relevant as the donors’ community has aligned their position under one transport policy and
strategy defined by the GoM. Moreover, the use of the APLs was relevant because this
instrument was designed to support a medium to long term reforms like those implemented in the
transport sector.

51.     The implementation arrangement of the TIIP responded to the context prevailing in the
sector. While a stand-alone Project Implementing Unit was already in place at the beginning of
the Project, implementation responsibilities were gradually shifted to the newly created
autonomous agencies [Roads Authority of Madagascar (Autorité Routière de Madagascar -
ARM), APMF, Madagascar Civil Aviation Agency (Aviation Civile de Madagascar - ACM)]
during implementation depending on their readiness and capacities.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

(a) Objectives attributable to the TIIP activities

52.     The first level objective which was the rehabilitation of key transport infrastructure has
been achieved since most of the planned rehabilitation works were substantially completed to a
reasonable quality standard (cf. annex 2). However, the rehabilitation of RN44 South had to be
downgraded from a paved riding surface to a gravel one and the rehabilitation works at the port
of Mahajanga had to be dropped. This was because of the lack of funding as a result of the higher
costs than estimates for the road works and inadequate mobilization of counterpart funding.

53.       The second level objectives which were the reduction of transport cost and the
facilitation of trade have been substantially achieved after the rehabilitation of key transport
infrastructure. That is because without the TIIP funded transport infrastructure works, the state of
the key transport infrastructure would have deteriorated further resulting in an increased
transport costs and additional barriers to the movement of goods and people in large parts of
Madagascar.

54.    Traffic levels. Vehicle traffic increased up to 48 percent on the RN2 and up to 24 percent
on the RN7, between 2006 and 2010. The ferries financed by the TIIP provided a safe, reliable
and affordable (free) river crossing whereas the before project ferries were often out of service


                                                14
for engine or equipment problem. The 27 new ferries 2 operated about 4000 to 8000 river
crossings per month between mid-2010 and end-2012. The freight traffic on the Northern
Railway increased by at least 35 percent between 2007 and 2012.

55.    Transport costs. Vehicle Operating Cost on the RN44 South decreased by about 15
percent due to the improvement of the road conditions from bad to good after the project
intervention. In the Antananarivo–Toamasina corridor, the transport price of moving fuel
products by the Northern Railway is about 35 percent lower than those of the road. The targeted
railway infrastructure works financed by the TIIP has greatly contributed to this cheaper
transport alternative.

56.     Trade facilitation. As a result of the project activities: (i) the main rice growing area of
Madagascar is easily accessible during the rainy season; (ii) the cyclonic damage to transport
infrastructure resulting in the disruption of traffic on the road linking to the main port of
Madagascar has been removed; (iii) transit speed on the Northern Railway from Antananarivo to
the Port of Tomoasina has doubled; (iv) international vessels continue to serve the ports of
Toliary and Mahajanga which handle respectively about 2 and 6 percent of Madagascar’s
international port traffic; (v) NosyBe airport continues to be served by modern aircraft and is
now capable to receive direct flights from Europe.

57.     Sector reform. The objective of the social plan linked to the restructuring of the
ministries in charge of transport has been achieved. About 1400 out of 2400 total staff in
transport sector departments has been retrenched thanks to the funding provided by the project
which supported both the retrenchment payments and social safety measures. As a result, the
ministries have made an annual savings of about MGA 2.4 billion (about US$1.2 million) since
2007.

(b) Objectives of the sector strategy supported by the TIIP

58.     The objective supported by the TIIP to rehabilitate as part of a GoM/development
partners funded transport sector program, 4045 km of National Roads so that the majority of
National Roads would be in good and fair condition was achieved. More specifically, 4751 km
of National Roads have been rehabilitated and about 53 percent of National Roads are in good or
fair conditions as of end 2012.

59.     The financial performance objectives of the Northern Railway have been achieved
whereas the operational performance objectives have not been reached. The efficacy and
efficiency of the railway operations still have to be improved by the concessionaire.

60.    Limited progress has been made in concessionning and to the introduction of the land
lord concept in the port sub-sector. While the establishment of the ports with autonomous


2
  Out of the 29 delivered ferries, one ferry cannot be used because it is inadequate for the river for which it was delivered (the
river is either too shallow or its current is too strong for the ferry), one ferry is used as a deviation for an old bridge which should
have been rehabilitated (the works did not take place because of the 2009 political crisis).



                                                                   15
management with 49 percent private participation was underway in 2006–2007, the approach
was revised by GoM and since then the process has been put on hold. The only concessioned
port so far is the container terminal of the Port of Toamasina which handles about 80 percent of
the container traffic in Madagascar.

61.    No progress has been made in the airport concessionning. Since 2006, GoM has shown
no willingness to concession the airports. It was one of the reasons why the airport component
was stopped during the restructuring of 2006.

3.3 Efficiency

62.       The efficiency of the TIIP is rated modest for the following two main reasons:
         The unit costs per kilometer for the RN2 and RN7 at works completion are much higher
          than at contracts signature. These two road works constituted about 39 percent of the total
          project amount.
         The ex-post economic analysis estimated the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of the
          Northern Railway at 11.2 percent whereas the ERR was estimated at 17.5 percent during
          the introduction of this component at the restructuring of 2006 and at 13.1 percent when
          an additional financing was awarded in 2007. The Northern Railway component
          constituted about 29 percent of the total project amount. This decreased value of the ERR
          was the consequence of the lower than estimated traffic in Tons-Km during the period
          2008-2012. Several reasons could explain this lower traffic: (i) domestic political crisis
          juxtaposed with the international economic crisis which leads to a drop in economic
          activity and international trade; (ii) absence of axle load control which contributes to a
          lower than expected freight traffic shift from roads to railways; (iii) lower than expected
          freight transport capacity of the Northern Railway (weak operational performance,
          expansion of the passenger transport services); (iv) overoptimistic traffic forecast.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63.     The lack of substantial progress in the sector reform partly undermines the sustainability
of the TIIP’s achievements. However, the overall rating has to be assessed against the outcomes
that are directly attributable to the project activities and the primary objective which was the
rehabilitation of transport infrastructure. Furthermore, the TIIP was able to handle in a very
flexible and proactive manner the different issues that arose during implementation to complete
the rehabilitation activities and the social plan of the ministries. Consequently, on the basis of the
high relevance, moderate efficacy, and modest efficiency, the overall project outcome rating is
Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

64.    Creation of work for isolated rural populations living along the Northern Railway.
The Northern Railway concessionaire uses the services of villagers associations to do light
maintenance works along the railway line. Performance-based conventions are signed each year

                                                  16
between the concessionaire and these associations. These maintenance works are a
complementary livelihood for about 600 villagers. About half of them are women.

65.    Improved rural accessibility. Population of about 48,000 in the rural remote area along
about 120 km of the Northern Railway rail lines 3 has benefitted from the re-launching of a
limited passenger train services. The railway is the only existing land access to this area. This
subsidized passenger services have improved the accessibility of this isolated population.

66.      Reduction in the price of basic goods along the East Coast. Thanks to the provision of
ferries, freight and passenger traffic by road is now more frequent, easier and more reliable along
the 1,000 km East Coast from Maroantsetra to Fort-dauphin which is crossed by several large
rivers. Ferries between Maroantsetra and Toamasina were designed to carry a 25 Tons load and
those between Toamasina and Fort-dauphin were designed to carry a 15 Tons load. Ferries are
available from morning till dusk, 7 days a week. Thus, the price of staple goods in the remote
villages along the East Coast has decreased according to the local population since they have
become less isolated and more served by transport services.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

67.      The TIIP supported the reforms in the transport sector in Madagascar and has built
institutional capacity by:
          Creating and/or reinforcing the: (i) Road Authority, (ii) APMF; (iii) Northern
            Railway concessionaire; and (iv) ACM;
          Providing training and equipment to the ministries in charge of transport and to
            agencies under their aegis;
          Providing equipment to school of engineers and maritime institute; and
          Undertaking several studies for future operations in the transport sector.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

68.    The increased freight traffic on the Northern Railway has had positive impacts on the
environment, the road safety, and the road conditions on RN2, the most important road in the
country connecting Antananarivo with the Port of Toamasina. More specifically, the re-
launching of the Northern Railway supported under the TIIP has:
        Reduced the carbon footprint of the transport activities: carbon dioxide emitted per
           Ton-kilometer is lower on the rail compared to the road;
        Improved road safety on RN2 through the shift of some freight traffic (gasoline,
           cement, container, and other heavy bulk freight) to the railways which is safer than
           the road; and
        Decreased road maintenance costs on RN2 since there is less deterioration on it due to
           the shift of some freight traffic from road to railway

69.     The tourism sector benefited from the project. NosyBe is a world famous tourist area in
Madagascar and most of the tourists travelling to it use air transport. Thanks to the air navigation
equipment financed by the TIIP, modern aircrafts transporting tourists from Europe can land and
take-off in NosyBe airport. In addition, tourists and inhabitants in the remote area along the East
Coast benefited from the improvement in accessibility as a result of the provision of ferries.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating4: High

70.    The overall risk to development outcome has been evaluated on the basis of the table
below:

       Political instability and uncertainty
       Since March 2009, Madagascar has undergone a deep political crisis.
       The latest development is that elections will be organized but there is
                                                                                                         S        H
       still a significant risk that the country will not stabilize politically. If
       that is the case, improvement in the economic and transport situation
       will not take place
       Lack of ownership and set-back in the transport reform
       Since the political crisis in March 2009, there has not been any tangible
       progress in transport sector reform. Moreover, there are vested interests                         H        S
       that continue to lobby the GoM to go back to the old institutional
       framework and not to implement the reform any more.
       Inability to effectively apply the axle load control
       The application of the axle load control has been discussed for several
       years now but it is not yet effective so far. Although a new decree has
                                                                                                         M        H
       been recently approved, there is a risk it will not be effectively
       enforced. Without effective axle load control, the impact is that road
       infrastructure will deteriorate prematurely.
       Worsening operational and financial situation of the Road
       Maintenance Fund
       Since the beginning of the 2009 political crisis, the fuel levy dedicated
       to road maintenance is not fully collected. Even before the crisis,                               H        H
       maintenance funding was inadequate. Moreover, the use of the road
       maintenance funds is not always done in a transparent and efficient
       manner. The impact is that the rehabilitated infrastructure and the road

       network will not be maintained correctly and could deteriorate
       prematurely.
       Unsustainability of the ferry operations
       At approval, it was agreed that a Public Private Partnership (PPP)
       scheme would be implemented for the ferry operations. Several PPP
       schemes were studied by the Road Authority for the management of the
       ferries but the political will to implement them is lacking. So far, the
                                                                                                          S           H
       ferries are entirely managed by the Road Authority and its operating
       costs are paid by the Road Maintenance Fund. Given the current
       financial problem of the Road Maintenance Fund, there is a risk that
       insufficient operating and maintenance costs will be allocated to the
       ferries, undermining its long-term sustainability.
       Worsening operational capacity of the Road Authority
       There is so far no sustainable mechanism to ensure the long-term
       financing of the operating costs of the Road Authority. Moreover, the
       operational responsibilities over the National Roads network are not                              H            S
       given entirely to the Road Authority but shared with other ministerial
       entities. The impact is that road infrastructure will not be appropriately
       managed.
       Worsening operational capacity of the Northern Railway
       concession
       Following the main shareholder change of the Northern Railway
       concession in 2010, there is a risk that operational capacity of the
       concession would deteriorate. The transaction was not done in a
                                                                                                         M            S
       transparent manner. It is required in the concession agreement and
       credit agreement that any change of the main shareholder should
       receive the no-objection of the financiers of Madarail. But the
       financiers were informed of this change only when the transaction was
       completed.
       Deterioration in railway infrastructure
       The TIIP has mainly financed sleepers and ballasts on the railway
       track. During field visits, it has been noticed that the rail has started to
                                                                                                          S           S
       deteriorate especially on curvatures5. The rail head width has become
       thinner and it increases the risk of derailment. These used rails need
       urgent replacement.
       Increased passenger services on the Northern Railway leading to
       an increase financial losses
       Passenger services on the Northern Railway are loss making. Though
       the provision of a subsidized limited passenger service to serve the
                                                                                                         H            H
       isolated area along the Northern Railway is legitimate from a socio
       economic point of view, there are substantial risks that: (i) the subsidies
       are paid neither fully nor timely; and (ii) Madarail is requested to
       further extend the provision of passenger services. These risks have

   already materialized.
   Vulnerability to inclement weather
   The road and railway between Antananarivo and Toamasina are
   vulnerable to inclement weather for the following reasons: (i) cyclones
                                                                                     H     H
   often hit the area; (ii) the rainfall level in the area is high; and (iii) both
   the road and railway line go through a mountainous area with steep
   slopes prone to landslides.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71.     The Bank team was able to prepare the project in a short period of time. The project was
fully in line with both the GoM priorities and the CAS and was prepared in full consultation with
the other development partners. The project design was coherent by responding to priority
investment needs in transport infrastructure rehabilitation, while at the same continuing to
support some of the institutional reforms from APL1. The Bank project preparation team had the
necessary relevant experience in both the works and institutional reform aspects of the transport
sector that the project was supporting.

72.     However, the M&E framework was not appropriate to monitor and evaluate the project
achievements. For example, baseline values were not defined at approval, which was fairly
typical of projects of that era where less emphasis was put on the M&E dimension. Furthermore,
the detailed engineering studies for the construction works were not available. The assumptions
made at appraisal to estimate the nature, the scope and the costs of the rehabilitation were not
valid since the road works were more complex than expected.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.     The project was supervised in a proactive manner. Design was modified to respond to
circumstance changes. The impacts of the political crisis in project implementation were handled
appropriately. The following actions taken or supported by the Bank team confirmed this: (i)
restructuring the project to introduce the railway component when a new relevant priority was
noticed; (ii) ensuring the passability of major road corridors through spot improvements rather
than focusing on the reconstruction/rehabilitation of more limited sections; (iii) shifting to ISPS
ports compliance activities to respond to new international norms on the movement of freight by
ship; (iv) building river jetties to ensure a smooth operations of the ferries; (v) convincing the
Bank senior management to lift the freeze of disbursement through factual analysis; (vi)
undertaking with other development partners a continuous transport policy dialogue with the
Borrower, especially on axle load control.




                                                   20
74.    In addition, the different Task Team Leaders (TTLs) had been based in the field since the
early stage of implementation and were able to: (i) interact closely with the Borrower, the
implementing agencies and the partners; and (ii) visit all the project sites scattered all over the
country. The team members were constituted of staff having strong experiences in the different
subsectors dealt by the TIIP (roads, railways, ports, and airports).

75.     However, the shortcomings of the M&E framework could have been corrected. The PDO
indicators and targets values were kept unchanged throughout the course of implementation
although revision could have been done during the introduction of the railway component. The
sector reform indicators and targets values could also have been adjusted when the airport
component was stopped and the 2009 political crisis had occurred. In addition, the Bank team
could have brought more attention on the operational performance of the Northern Railway as
the corresponding indicators did not show any substantial improvement during implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76.   Based on the Moderately Satisfactory rating at entry and during supervision, the Overall
Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

77.     During preparation, GoM adopted a comprehensive transport policy and strategy and was
able to involve development partners around one major multi-year holistic road transport
rehabilitation program. At the early stage of implementation, GoM was also commended for
taking difficult but necessary actions: (i) the proactive termination of the road works contract on
the RN2/RN44; (ii) the procurement of new contractors to complete the works on RN2/RN44
less than six months after the termination; and (iii) the closure of the PES after its poor
performance and the restructuring of the implementation arrangements. As part of the sector
reforms, GoM also created the different autonomous agencies such as the Road Authority, the
Land Transport Agency (Agence des transports Terrestres, ATT), and the APMF.

78.    Nevertheless, GoM’s ownership of the transport sector institutional reform was
inconsistent during the life of the project. Thus, the reform of the transport sector is only partially
completed. As a result of this, the sustainability of the transport infrastructure and the
performance of the transport services are at risk. For example, GoM failed to gradually increase
the operational responsibilities of the Road Authority over the National Roads network, and to
make the ATT autonomous from the Ministry and in charge of the vehicle technical control.

79.     Furthermore, GoM was not able to (i) establish MADARAIL’s rights to fully use its
allocated area inside the port of Toamasina as indicated in the concession agreement; (ii) request
the no-objection of the financiers of the Northern Railway prior to the main shareholder
replacement as required in the concession agreement and the credit agreement.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.    Except during the early stage of implementation where the PES had a poor performance
and was closed afterwards, there is no significant shortcoming on the implementation quality of
the implementing agencies. The private firm in charge of the fiduciary aspects was able to ensure
appropriately its role. The technical and fiduciary activities of the railway component were
ensured adequately by the concessionaire. The Road Authority had the capacity to implement the
technical aspects of the road component. The technical assistant financed by the EU provided
useful technical expertise to the Road Authority and effectively assisted in reinforcing the
capacity of the Road Authority staff. The APMF as well as the ACM had the capacity to
implement the technical aspects of their respective activities.

81.     Apart the issue discussed in section 2.2(c), MADARAIL was also not able to
significantly improve its operational performance as agreed in the Project Agreement.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

82.     Given the Moderately Unsatisfactory rating of the Borrower performance, the Moderately
Satisfactory rating of the implementing agencies, and the Moderately Satisfactory outcome of the
project, the overall Borrower performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

83.     Selectivity and realism are essential in sector reforms. Two of the reasons why the
transport sector reforms in general and the ports and airports concession in particular were not
entirely successful were: (i) the high-level political interference in the sector, and (ii) the
overambitious target to concession all the ports and airports in the country.

84.     Adequacy of APL instrument to respond to exogenous political factors. The planned
transport sector reforms have come to a standstill since the beginning of the political crisis in
2009. Moreover, project closing date had to be extended for almost 2 years and a half in order to
complete the remaining activities which constituted about 20 percent of the project amount. This
instability risk raises the question about the adequacy of the APL instruments which were
designed to support a long-term transport sector transformational agenda.

85.    Adequacy of the M&E system is key to proper monitoring of results. The choice of
the PDO indicators should take into account the type of data which can be collected during
implementation. Annual traffic on roads was one of the PDO indicators of the TIIP.
Nevertheless, this data was not annually available during implementation. In addition, the M&E
system of the TIIP did not make clear distinction between the achievements under (i) the stand-
alone project, (ii) the APL series, and (iii) the Government long-term program. As a result, it was
not easy to assess the achievements, the outcomes and the impacts of the project.

86.    Implementation readiness is critical. Decision was made at appraisal to do a simple
periodic maintenance on the RN2 and RN7 taking into account the normal life cycle of the roads.

                                                22
However, the periodic maintenance was not entirely appropriate when the works started because
the deteriorations were more important than expected. Some sections had to be rehabilitated or
reconstructed contributing to a higher cost than anticipated. In addition, the RN2 and RN44 did
not have a thorough engineering study and this situation contributed to the different unexpected
changes during works implementation.

87.     Proactivity and innovation during project implementation are necessary to adapting
to an ever changing environment. The design of the TIIP was substantially adjusted during
implementation to take into account the evolving situation (priority changes, lack of counterpart
funding, weaker implementing unit). One example was the use of a renowned international audit
firm in a consortium with a local audit firm to ensure the fiduciary function. The experience
proved to be successful. The local firm got the capacity to manage alone the project’s fiduciary
issues in the last two years. All of this contributed to reaching about 80 percent disbursement rate
before the 2009 crisis.

88.     While supporting railway concession, ensure enabling environment and fair
intermodal competition. A level playing field will contribute to improving the modal share of
the traffic moving by railroad and protect the road from overloading. If the Government
obligations under the concession agreement, particularly the axle load control, were effective, the
traffic of the Northern Railway would have probably been higher leading to a better ex-post
ERR, and the road deterioration would have probably been less important leading to a less
expensive works on the RN2 and RN7.

Observations on the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework of the Transport
Infrastructure Investment Project (TIIP)

1.       The M&E framework of the TIIP had several weaknesses:
        The Project Development Outcome (PDO) indicators were not fully Specific,
         Measurable, Attributable, Realistic and Targeted (SMART);
        The results chain was not clearly reflected. The outputs and outcomes of the TIIP, the
         APL series, and the government transport program were not clearly distinguished;
        Some activities of the TIIP did not have any indicator to monitor their progress and
         impacts;
        Baseline data was not available at approval for the PDO indicators.

2.    At approval, the M&E framework had three PDO indicators and four intermediate
outcome indicators. The three PDO indicators were maintained during the course of the project.

3.       The three PDO indicators were:
          Increased traffic through improved transport infrastructure (both passengers and
            freight): average annual traffic increase of 10 percent after rehabilitation;
          Decreased user cost: between 20 and 60 percent depending on road link; and
          Decreased time delays on the nation’s main transport infrastructure: between 30
            percent and 300 percent depending on link.

4.     The PDO “to rehabilitate the country’s major transport infrastructure in order to reduce
transport cost and to facilitate trade? had three dimensions. The three PDO indicators were
designed to reflect them. The first PDO indicator on traffic captured the rehabilitation dimension
though the achievement of rehabilitation itself could have been used. The second PDO indicator
on user cost captured the reduction in transport cost dimension. The third PDO indicator on time
delays captures the trade facilitation dimension.

5.       However, there were some limitations in these three PDO indicators:
          The first PDO indicator contained two sub-indicators: passenger traffic and freight
           traffic. Moreover, it should have been better to name the “improved transport
           infrastructure?.
          The user cost in the second PDO indicator was not specific. It might be a transport
           cost such as the vehicle operating cost or a transport price such as the passenger fare
           and the freight fare. In addition, it is stipulated that this indicator was for road link.
          The “time delays? in the third PDO indicator was not specific. It might be the travel
           time between point A and point B or the delay induced by the poor conditions of the
           link between point A and point B. Moreover, a 300 percent decrease is not plausible.

6.       The four intermediate outcome indicators were:
          4,400 kilometer (km) of national roads rehabilitated by average annual tranches of
            about 750 km, of which 1,274 km by IDA so that by end of 2008, all national roads
            (RNP & RNS) are in good and fair condition;
          Main ports concessioned and smaller ports under global concession arrangements;


                                                  32
          Ivato airport concessioned, seven secondary airports franchised, and tertiary airports
           are under management contracts; and
          Social plan is executed and remaining staff adequate for the functions of the Vice-
           Prime Minister (Vice Primature, VPM).

7.      The 4,400 km of national roads in the first intermediate outcome indicator was the
objective of the entire GoM roads rehabilitation program. Moreover, this indicator contained four
sub-indicators: (i) the total length of National Roads rehabilitated; (ii) the total length of National
Roads rehabilitated per year; (iii) the length of National Roads rehabilitated by the Bank
Adaptable Program Loan (APL) series; and (iv) the percentage of National Roads in good and
fair condition. It could have been useful to monitor the length of National Roads rehabilitated
under the TIIP only since the rehabilitation is the first level objective of the project.

8.     During the restructuring of 2006, this first intermediate outcome indicator was revised to
“4,045 km of national roads rehabilitated by average annual tranches of about 630 km, of which
613 km by IDA so that by end of 2008, the majority of national roads are in good and fair
condition?.

9.      The second intermediate outcome “Main ports concessioned and smaller ports under
global concession arrangements?, was the expected result of the entire reform (started under
APL1) in the port sub-sector in Madagascar. Activities financed by the TIIP were limited to
small repair works and technical assistance related to port compliance with international norms.
It could have been useful to use some indicators reflecting the direct results of these activities.
Moreover, this intermediate outcome indicator could have been more detailed to assess the
progress to date of the reform. The location and number of the main and smaller ports are not
specified either.

10.     The third intermediate outcome “Ivato airport concessioned, seven secondary airports
franchised, and tertiary airports are under management contracts?, is the expected result of the
entire reform (started under APL1) in the airport sub-sector in Madagascar. Activities financed
by the TIIP were limited to safety equipment and technical assistance. It could have been useful
to use some indicators reflecting the safety improvement. Furthermore, this intermediate
outcome indicator should have been more detailed to assess the progress to date of the reform.
The location and number of some airports are not specified either.

11.    The fourth intermediate outcome “Social plan is executed and remaining staff adequate
for the functions of the VPM? captures one of the main expected results of the institutional
support component and the Government reforms in the transport sector.

12.     Intermediate outcomes for the railway component. The following intermediate
outcome indicators were used for the railway component which was added later on: (i) wagon
turnaround time; (ii) personal productivity which reflect the level of freight and passengers
transported versus the number of permanent staff; (iii) liquidity ratio; and (iv) debt coverage
ratio. These indicators capture both the operational and the financial performance of the
railways. Baseline data were available. These indicators can be used beyond the project life to
monitor the situation of the railway concession.


                                                  33
13.  Given the complexity of the PDO indicators, proxy indicators have been used instead.
However, data on traffic, transport cost and price were not always available in the road sector.

14.     For the railway component, data collection and monitoring were regularly implemented
and railway data was available from the concessionaire. For the port and airport component, no
regular data collection was implemented since no particular indicator related to the TIIP
activities was defined for them.

15.     First PDO indicator. “Increased traffic through improved transport infrastructure (both
passengers and freight): Neither the number of passengers nor the volume of freight was
measured on the roads infrastructure since it was almost impossible to do so. The number of
vehicles per day was used instead to assess the road traffic. Nevertheless, regular annual data on
road vehicle traffic is not available. Traffic counting is not done systematically or periodically in
the road sector. It is done only on a case by case basis and most of the time under donor funding.
On the other hand, passengers and freight traffic data are available on the railway component and
the ferries.

16.    Second PDO indicator. “Decreased user cost: between 20 and 60 percent depending on
road link?: The VOC (Vehicle Operating Cost) related to the IRI (International Roughness
Index) of the road was one of the subsidiary indicators used to assess the decrease in user cost in
the road component. Figures were also provided by the Ministry of Transport on the evolution of
the passenger fare per kilometer but the accuracy of the data was not sure since the calculation
methodology was not provided. On the other hand, the fuel transport prices on the railways and
some roads were available.

17.     Third PDO indicator. “Decreased time delays on the nation’s main transport
infrastructure: between 30 percent and 300 percent depending on link?: This indicator was never
monitored during the course of implementation for lack of reliable data. Travel time which was
easier to get could have been used as a subsidiary indicator.

18.     Intermediate outcome indicators. The length of rehabilitated National Roads, the
progress (or the lack of progress) in the port and airport reforms, the completion of the social
plan for the ministries in charge of transport as well as the intermediate outcome indicators for
the railway component were monitored regularly since the necessary information was easier to
get or the data (railways) was periodically provided.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

(a) Roads:

1.     Among the activities having an ex-ante economic analysis in the original Project
Appraisal Document, only the National Road (Route Nationale, RN) 2, the RN7 and the RN44
were realized during implementation. These activities constituted 67 percent of the Project
amount. The table below summarizes the results of economic analysis ex-ante and ex-post.

               Table 3-1: Results of Economic Analysis Ex-ante and Ex-post

2.      For the RN2 and RN7, the ex-post Economic Rate of Return (ERR) is lower than
anticipated since the cost of the realized works was higher than at approval. For the RN44 South,
the ex-post ERR is higher than anticipated since the realized works were an improved gravel
road instead of a pavement whereas the reduction in travel time and vehicle operating costs are
significant and the forecasted traffic increase was reached.

3.      The analysis is based on the comparison between the situation without project and the
situation with project. The following were considered as direct advantages of the situation with
project: (i) the Vehicle Operating Cost is reduced; (ii) the travel time is reduced; (iii) the
maintenance cost is reduced; and (iv) the road has a higher asset value.

4.      To be relevant, the method and model used for the ex-ante economic analysis were also
used for the ex-post economic analysis. This method and model were developed internally within
the Ministry in charge of road infrastructure and benefited technical assistance from external
donors. In the ex-post calculation, forecasted data used in the ex-ante calculation were replaced
by the real data observed after project.

5.      The input data used in the model are: (i) the length of the road; (ii) the works cost; (iii)
the conditions of the road; (iii) the level of traffic; (iv) the average traffic increase rate; and (v)
the travel time. The calculation was made over a period of 20 years. The discount rate was 12
percent.

6.     However, as the type and the length of the road works had substantially changed on the
RN2, RN7 and RN44, it is more valuable to compare the unit cost per km at approval, at contract
signature, and at completion in order to appreciate the efficiency of the works.

7.     RN2. The unit cost per kilometer was estimated at about US$ 26,868 at approval in 2003.
The unit cost per kilometer for the first contract, which was terminated later on, was 2.5 times
higher (about US$66,961). The unit cost per kilometer for the second contract was about

                                                36
US$102,178. At completion, the unit cost per kilometer was about 32.8 percent higher (about
US$135,707) than at contract signature.

8.     RN44. The unit cost per kilometer for the upgrading from earth road to paved road was
estimated at about US$327,778 at approval in 2003. The unit cost per kilometer for the
upgrading from earth road to paved road in the first contract was about US$294,673 which is 10
percent lower than the estimation at approval. The unit cost per kilometer for the second contract
was about US$28,690. The cost per kilometer of this spot-improvement of gravel road in July
2006 was 6.8 percent higher than the estimated cost per kilometer in 2003 of the RN2/RN7
paved road periodic maintenance. At completion, the unit cost per kilometer was about 11.6
percent higher (about US$32,031) than at contract signature,

9.      RN7. The unit cost per kilometer was about US$68,095 at contract signature in May
2007. This cost is 2.5 times higher than the cost per kilometer estimation at approval in 2003. At
completion, the cost per kilometer was about US$104,706 which is about 53.8 percent higher
than the cost per kilometer at contract signature.

(b) Railways:

10.     The Northern Railway network extends over a length of 732 km and serves (i) the most
important transport corridor between the capital Antananarivo, and the main port of Toamasina;
(ii) the rice granary region of Alaotra Lake; and (iii) the industrial city of Antsirabe. Starting
from the 1990s, rail services on the Northern Railway network had come to a virtual halt because
of poorly maintained railway tracks and rolling stock. In line with the transport policy and
strategy, an international competitive bidding was launched to concession the Northern Railway.
The concession agreement was signed in October 2002, and Madarail, the concession company,
was given the task to manage, maintain, renew, and operate the Northern Railway network for 25

                                                    37
years. As part of this agreement, Madarail agreed to implement an investment program including
track rehabilitation, rolling stock acquisition and refurbishment. Financing of the investment
program was to be provided for the most part by the GoM. The European Investment Bank (EIB)
awarded an 11 million Euros loan to Madarail mainly to acquire locomotives and to rehabilitate
rolling-stock.

11.     The model used to undertake the ex-post economic analysis was the one used during the
preparation of the railway component. This model is based on a costs-benefits method. Most
benefits are related to the expected freight modal shift from trucks to rails mainly on the
Antananarivo-Toamasina corridor. The economic benefits resulted of the following:
     Reduction of the road maintenance costs;
     Additional tax revenues generated by the additional benefits of the railways;
     Reduction of oil consumption as well as reduction of the associated pollutant gas;
     Reduction of transport costs;
     Improvement of the railway transport services through the increase of the transit speed;
        and
     Reduction in the number of road accident.

12.      The input data used when undertaking the comparison are: (i) the volume of traffic; and,
(ii) the gasoline price Malagasy Ariary (MGA) 2,000 per liter during the ex-ante analysis and
MGA 2,800 per liter during the ex-post analysis). The following parameters were supposedly
unchanged during the comparison: (i) the calculation period of 25 years; (ii) the fuel
consumption rate of trucks and locomotives; (iii) the 24 tons average capacity of trucks on the
Antananarivo Toamasina road; (iv) the composition of the variable costs of the railway
operations; (iv) the number of working days per year; and, (v) the cost of carbon emission
(US$10 per ton).

            Madagascar Transport Infrastructure and Investment Project (TIIP) – APL3
                       SUMMARY OF THE COMPLETION REPORT

Preface

1.      The preparation of the TIIP was initiated during the implementation of the Adaptable
Program Loan (APL) series. The APL series preparation started in 1994. Between 1998 and
2000, the discussion between the World Bank and the Government of Madagascar (GoM)
established the following:

        A National Transport Policy which contains the government policies and strategies in the
         transport sector
        The approval of the first APL (the Transport Sector Reform and Rehabilitation Project)

2.    The APL series in the total amount of US$253 million were supposed to be undertaken
between 2000 and 2008 and have 4 phases.

1.       Description and start of the project

1.1. Context

3.      The start of the project occurred after the 2002 post-election crisis. The economic impacts
of that crisis were deep. The new government in place elaborated the Poverty Reduction Strategy
Document which was adopted in July 2003. At the beginning of the project, the transport
infrastructure network of Madagascar was the following:
     38,000 km of road network of which 12,000 km of National Road and 5,700 Kilometer
        (km) of paved road
     895 km of railroad of which 732 km (including the 371 km linking the capital
        Antananarivo and the main port of Toamasina) belongs to the Northern Railway and 163
        km to the Southern railway
     17 ports of which 5 with autonomous management, 4 on a global concession, and 8 at
        regional level
     55 airports of which 12 were receiving regular traffic (2 of them can handle wide-body
        aircraft) and 43 were small ones
     400 km of unexploited waterways between Toamasina and Mananjary

4.     These infrastructures were globally in poor conditions mainly due to lack of appropriate
maintenance. The main issues in the transport sector were:
    Road: lack of funding for infrastructure investment and maintenance;
    Road transport services: overloaded trucks, old vehicle fleet, unreliable transport services
    Railways: poor conditions of the infrastructure and the rolling-stock
    Port: poor performance of the port, low traffic volume


                                                42
         River transport: lack of equipment and infrastructure
         Air transport: insufficient capacity of the airport infrastructure; subsidies to isolated local
          destination

5.     In 2003, one Vice Prime Minister was in charge of the entire transport sector. Transport
reforms committed few years earlier implemented:
     Transferring the operational activities from the Government to the private sector
     Focusing the Government responsibilities to the strategy and planning
     Setting-up autonomous agencies to ensure the management of operational activities and
       eventually to regulate

6.     The World Bank has supported these reforms through the APL series. Three agencies
were already operational in 2003:
    The Civil Aviation Authority created in 1989 and restructured in 2004
    The Road Maintenance Funds, created in 1997 and restructured in 2003
    The Port, Maritime and River Agency created in 2003

7.        Other agencies were being created:
         The Road Authority
         The Land Transport Agency

1.2. Project objectives, components and arrangements

8.    Long term objective: to reduce poverty through the reduction of transport cost and the
improvement of rural accessibility

9.     Short to medium term objective: to rehabilitate transport infrastructure in order to reduce
transport cost and to facilitate trade

10.       Components: Roads, Ports, Airport, Institutional support, and Railways

11.       Institutional arrangements: The project had two institutional periods:
         From 2003 to 2005: The Vice Prime Minister and the Program Executive Secretariat
          (PES) were in charge of the project
         From 2005 to 2012: The PES was closed and an international audit firm was hired to
          ensure the fiduciary function. The Vice Prime Minister was divided into two ministries.
          MADARAIL was in charge of the railway component
          It was agreed that the international audit firm train some staff from the ministries on the
          fiduciary function. However, the civil servants nominated to be trained failed to
          participate correctly in this capacity building activity.

2. Design, implementation, achievement and impacts

2.1. Appraisal and design

12.     The design of the TIIP was done within the context of the APL series and the on-going
reforms in the transport sector. The PES was primarily in charge of the implementation given the
lack of capacity within the ministries. The main risk identified was the lack of capacity from the
private sector to undertake the important infrastructure rehabilitation program defined by the
Government. Moreover, not all the financing of this vast rehabilitation program was secured. The
TIIP was initially scheduled to close in 2008 but extended until 2012 to realize all the planned
activities.

2.2. Main achievements

13.       Roads:
         The targeted length of road rehabilitation for the entire government program was
          achieved

14.       Ports:
         The main port of Toamasina has acquired the status of port with autonomous
          management
         The container terminal of the port of Toamasina has been put under private concession
         The reconstruction of the 4 main lighthouses has been completed

15.       Airports:
         The promotion of PPP in airports management has been partially realized. The
          management framework of certain airports has changed.

16.       Institutional support:
         The Road Authority and the Land Transport Agency have been put in place
         The autonomy of the Road Maintenance Funds has been reinforced
         The retrenchment plan of the ministries in charge of transport has been achieved

17.       Northern Railway:
         The freight traffic has increased by 130 percent
         The wagon turnaround time has decreased by 12 percent
         The personal productivity has increased by 94 percent

2.3. Coordination and management of the project

18.     The coordination of the project suffered from the transport ministries structure. The
entities in charge of the transport infrastructures are different and independent from the entities
in charge of the transport services.




                                                  44
19.     The project also suffered from the difficult coordination between the entities in charge of
the technical implementation and the entity in charge of the procurement, contract management
and financial management.

20.       Lessons learned:
         The capacity of the ministries should be reinforced
         The negative impacts of the reforms in the ministries should be mitigated.
         A project coordination unit is necessary
         The type of support should be adapted to the role and capacity of each entity

2.4. Other project impacts

21.     The required compliance with the safeguards policies and procedures for all Bank
projects has built capacity in terms of environmental and social management. Though that
capacity was initially weak, the implementation of the project has reinforced it in a sustainability
manner. Tools and skills to manage the safeguards aspects are now available

3. Assessment of the Bank and the Borrower

3.1. World Bank

         The decision to change the financing parameters to 100 percent is a very good decision.
         The type of interaction with the World Bank staff varies depending on the person.
         Initially, the supervision mission took place twice a year but later on it was more frequent
          and lighter.

22.     Lesson learned: Though the project had encountered different issues leading to restrictive
measures from the World Bank (freeze of disbursement, ineligible expenses), it should be better
to put in place a working relation based on a mutual trust and a shared responsibility in problem
solving.

3.2. Borrower

         The Government was able to mobilize other resources to complement the financing from
          the World Bank.
         High-level staff change impacted negatively on the coordination and the decision-making
          process.
         The Government was not able to finance the counterpart funding.
         Continuity was not ensured after the change of government after the 2009 political crisis.

23.     Lesson learned: Continued ownership is not ensured after a high-level change within the
ministries or the government. Reinforcing the structure and the role of a steering committee is
recommended.




                                                   45
4. Economic and financial evaluation

24.     The disbursement rate for the IDA financing is about 98.86 percent. There is still about
2.2 billion MGA outstanding counterpart funding as of October 2012 although the financing
parameter had been modified to 100 percent in 2006.

25.    It is difficult to assess the project based on the Project Appraisal Document initial data
because of the substantial change in the project scope during implementation. Moreover, baseline
data was not always available and some assumptions made at approval did not materialize (quick
mobilization of external resources, private sector contribution)

5. Sustainability

26.    Though there are still some steps to be undertaken in the institutional reforms, the
progress made so far can be considered as immovable.

27.   The realized works are generally of a good quality though the duration of the works often
encountered slippage.

28.     Madagascar does not have enough resources to finance investment in transport and has to
rely much of the time on donors and external funding which affects the investment planning of
the transport sector.

29.    For the road sector, it is imperative to balance the existing resources between investment,
maintenance, core network, and rural road.

6. Conclusion

30.     The TIIP design is relevant. Intervention was undertaken in all transport sub-sectors and
focused on infrastructure investment and institutional support. The important fact and issue
affecting the project were:
     The ownership from the government side was lacking at the beginning but improved later
        on
     Rehabilitation targets were ambitious. Cost overrun was significant. Unfortunately, the
        available funding was not enough to cover both of them. The project was then
        restructured to focus on rail and road investment since a Public Private Partnership (PPP)
        approach can be done to finance investment in ports and airports.
     The institutional reform of the ministries has shaken the staffing structure. The ministries
        currently do not have enough skilled staff to ensure the strategic planning, oversight and
        coordination function.
     Working relation between the Bank and the Borrower was not always smooth. The
        Borrower had the impression that some decisions were not made in a consensual manner.

Annex 10. Additional information on key factors that affected the implementation of the
physical components of the project

1.      Lack of counterpart funding. The timely and adequate release of counterpart funds by
the Government of Madagascar (GoM) was often delayed. Although the Bank country financing
parameters were changed during the restructuring of January 2006, allowing a 100 percent IDA
payment for all activities, about Malagasy Ariary (MGA) 1.98 billion (about US$990,000)
unpaid counterpart funding remained as of end 2012. Only MGA 787 million (about
US$393,000) counterparts funds were paid between 2005 and 2012. Because of this, the
Transport Infrastructure Investment Project (TIIP) started financing all expenses related to the
project activities in 2006. As a result, the scope of rehabilitation was reduced to cope with the
unchanged project amount.

2.     Project restructuring. The TIIP was restructured in 2006 for the following reasons: (i)
change of priorities leading to the introduction of the Northern Railway component; (ii) change
of the country’s financing parameter to 100 percent IDA; and (iii) modification of the
implementation arrangements following the closure of the Program Executive Secretariat (PES).
Since the total project amount remained unchanged, some activities under the road and port
components were modified and the non-realized activities under the airport component were
dropped.

3.      Axle load control. Despite the discussions, meetings, and workshops taking place for
several years now and the strong push from development partners, the enforcement of axle load
control is still not effective. This situation contributed to the higher deterioration than expected
on the roads because of the overweighed truck traffic. It was planned at appraisal to carry out a
periodic maintenance on the National Road (Route Nationale, RN) 2 and RN7 given the normal
life cycle of these roads. However, during works execution, some sections of these roads needed
more than a periodic maintenance because they were more deteriorated. Thus, the costs of the
road works were higher than expected.

4.      Termination of the first road works contracts on the RN2, RN44 North and South
due to significant delays. Three road rehabilitation works contracts were awarded in September
2004 to one contractor. The contracts for the RN2, RN44 South, and RN44 North had
respectively 24, 36, and 15 month duration. The three contracts were terminated 17 months later
(in February 2006) due to significant delays, with progress of 8 percent for the RN2, 3 percent
for the RN44 South and 46.5 percent for the RN44 North. The contracts were then awarded to
the second lowest responsive bidders. If the contractor was able to complete the works correctly,
the important RN44South would have been paved as planned at appraisal.

5.     Scope of works change on the RN44 South. At approval, it was planned that the RN44
South would be upgraded from gravel road to paved road. The level of traffic especially trucks
on the RN44 South justified paving it. The object of the first road works contract on the RN44
South was to undertake this upgrading. Nevertheless, when negotiating the second road works
contract, the available budget on the road component was found to be insufficient to pave the




                                                49
RN44 South6. As a result, it was decided to carry out a spot improvement instead of paving on
the RN44 South to ensure that the road would be trafficable all year around.

6.      Additional costs on the RN2. The following factors led to additional costs: (i) two
cyclones and an unusual heavy rain created heavy damages on the RN2 in 2007. Repairs had to
be undertaken and financed by the contract; (ii) the decision to finance the construction of one
weighing station in order to make available the required tool for axle load control; (iii) upward
contract price revision due mainly to the substantial gasoline price increase; (iv) the loss in
currency exchange due to the depreciation of the United States Dollar (US$) and Special
Drawing Rights (SDR) vis-à-vis the Euro. The contract was paid in Euros while the credit is
denominated in SDR/US$; (v) additional rehabilitation works were required on certain stretches
where periodic maintenance was not appropriate anymore; (vi) additional works were required
when works resumed after the lifting of disbursement freeze of 2009. The works were stopped
after the World Bank froze disbursements in 2009, and some partially achieved works had to be
redone when disbursements resumed.

7.     Additional costs on the RN7. The works on the RN7 encountered almost the same
issues as the RN2 resulting in additional costs: (i) roads degradation higher than anticipated
leading to an unexpected additional works; (ii) upwards contract price revision due mainly to the
substantial gasoline price increase; (iii) the loss in currency exchange due to the depreciation of
the United States Dollar (US$) and SDR vis-à-vis the Euro. The contract was paid in Euros while
the credit is denominated in SDR/US$. As a result, the length of works was reduced from 200
km at contract signature to 144.6 km at contract completion.

8.     Provision of river jetties for the new ferries. It was decided during implementation to
construct river jetties to ensure a smooth operation of the ferries and to protect them from
avoidable damages when docking. 27 jetties were constructed, of which nine are financed by the
TIIP and 18 by the Rural Transport Project (RTP), the second phase of the Adaptable Program
Loan series.

9.       Reallocation of the funds from the port of Mahajanga to the road component. With
all the additional costs in the road works described above, decision was taken to cancel the works
scheduled for the port of Mahajanga and to reallocate the corresponding fund to the road
component.

10.     Change of priority in the port compliance. It was planned at approval to do some
activities in order to make the ports compliant with the International Maritime Organization –
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ship (IMO-MARPOL). However,
after September 11, 2001 attack, compliance with the International Ship and Port Facility
Security (ISPS) code became a higher priority. Therefore, it was decided to drop the MARPOL
related activities and replace them with the ISPS compliance related activities.

  The decision to increase the length of periodic maintenance on the RN2 from 245.8 KM to 314.5 KM during the
restructuring of 2006 contributed to this.

11.     Additional financing to the railway component. An additional financing of about
US$15.6 million was processed for the railway component in 2007 to increase the scope of
rehabilitation works.

12.     Reallocation from works to operating costs in the railway component. When the
disbursement freeze of 2009 was lifted, remaining funds from the works category in the railway
component were reallocated to operating costs. This decision was made in consultation with all
the financiers of the Northern Railway to strengthen the financial situation of the concession. As
a result of the reallocation of funds from investments to operating costs, some works already
started before the crisis could not be entirely completed as planned. This was the case for three
metallic bridges and the Andasibe station.

Annex 11. Additional information on safeguards

1.      The TIIP initially financed the rehabilitation of existing transport infrastructure including
national roads, ports and airports with the environmental category of the project rated as “A?.
The road components were clearly defined before appraisal and considered as “first year
projects?. For the ports and airports components, investments were planned as residuals to
private sector investments and considered as “second year investments?. Before appraisal, full
Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIA) were carried-out for all planned road
works, disclosed in the Country and at the Infoshop. The remaining subprojects under port and
airport components were considered as second year subprojects and the environmental and social
studies were to be carried out during project implementation, subject to Environment and Social
Safeguards approval. Following the project restructuring, the port and airport components were
either reduced or dropped. Only security and safety equipment were financed and implemented
for these two components.

2.     The environmental and social impacts of road works were mitigated in a satisfactory
manner as a result of the guidelines developed and the right implementation of environmental
and social management plans. The road components retained within the restructured project were
the National Road (Route Nationale, RN) 2, RN7 and RN44. The quarry site on the Point
Kilometer (PK) 53 of the RN44 was correctly rehabilitated (stabilized slopes and reforestation)
once the proposed mitigation measures by the Road Authority were approved by the Bank.

3.     When the railway component was added, a separate full Environmental Assessment (EA)
was prepared and was cleared by the Bank and the Malagasy National Environmental Agency.
The EA was disclosed in the country and at the Infoshop. The Environmental and Social
Management Plan (ESMP) were implemented in a satisfactory manner:
        61 local communities groups operational to contribute to the stabilization of slopes
          with Jatropha (134 hectare covered with Jatropha), vetivers (22 km of rail line with
          slopes stabilized), and railway line cleaning;
        Unit treating used oil from engines in place in the main rail station;
        Sufficient mitigation measures were considered and implemented in a satisfactory
          manner during railway rehabilitation works.

4.      The Involuntary Resettlement Policy (OP 4.12) was triggered for the railway component.
A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was prepared, approved by the Bank, and disclosed in project
areas and at Infoshop. The resettlement concerned 110 households living on the railways right of
way in Antananarivo. Its cost was about US$892,000. Fences were also built to secure the rail
lines crossing habitation zone. All action plans proposed within the approved RAP were settled
accordingly based on the monitoring and evaluation plan.

5.     The TIIP had contributed to put in place three environmental and social units operational
in road sector (Road Authority), railway sector (Madarail) and at the central level within the
Ministry of Public Works. These units have an operational environmental and social manual to
ensure consideration of safeguard dimensions within the project cycle (design, implementation
and monitoring). Their respective technical staff obtained trainings on the safeguard aspects
through an international technical assistant financed by the project.

                                                 52
6.      In addition to the environmental and social aspects, an HIV-AIDS program was carried
out by GoM, with the support of an international firm, to sensitize the contractor’s employees,
and the local population living along the roads and railways. This program was conducted on all
the civil work sites financed by the TIIP, and reached more than 2,000 persons in rural area.
