                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Before the crisis in early 2009, most of the major infrastructure works scheduled to be financed by the project were completed (periodic maintenance of National Road #RN- 7; works
                         to make the port of Mahajanga compliant with minimum international safety requirements; railways infrastructure rehabilitation on the Northern Railway Network), and the project was

                         rehabilitation) was suspended, and arrears incurred after the crisis were blocked. Since the project#s disbursement resumption in May, 2011, all pending arrears were cleared. The
                         project#s funds are almost used up, with a disbursement rate of 97%. However, the Borrower wishes to continue to use the remaining funds by the Project#s closing date, on June
                         30, 2011. Therefore, at the end of September 2011, they submitted a request to restructure the project. However, since clarifications are necessary regarding the resumption of

                         suspended contracts, the Bank requested further details. Likewise, pending issues (the settlement of disagreement on RN2 through a mutually satisfactory agreement, and the
                         restructuring of the Northern railways concession) need to be fixed. The project#s restructuring request which should be finalized by the end of November, 2011.
