                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The World Bank has maintained the current project closing date, i.e. June 30, 2012, as the scheduled remaining funds represent less than 1% of the total Credits amounts.
                         However, in accordance with the Government's request, the Bank has approved the project's funds reallocation and granted a four month grace period to allow for the payment of
                         expenses incurred after the project's closing date.
