   MADAGASCAR — TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT PROJECT
                             P082806
                 CREDITS 38360-MAG and 38361-MAG

                                   Restructuring Paper



1.     The closing date for Madagascar Transport Infrastructure Investment Project,
Credit 3836-MAG, P082806 will be extended from June 30, 2011 until June 30, 2012.

2.      The credit is for the third phase of an Adaptable Program Loan. The initial credit
in the amount of Standard Drawing Rights (SDR) 104,400,000 (equivalent to US$157.12
million, as per the rate applicable on April 21, 2011) was approved on December 8, 2003
and became effective on March 10, 2004. The project’s Additional Financing, in the
amount of SDR 10,400,000 (equivalent to US$16.24 million) was approved on May 22,
2007 and became effective on August 31, 2007.

3.      The project’s overall objective is to assist the Recipient in the rehabilitation of its
major transport infrastructure in order to reduce transport costs and to facilitate trade. The
project has been allowing the Recipient to finance key transport infrastructure, including
the periodic maintenance of the two routes with the most traffic (RN2 and RN7), the
rehabilitation and extension of the port of Mahajanga, the rehabilitation of four main
lighthouses and coastal navigation aids to help make the country compliant with the
IMO-MARPOL convention, the rehabilitation of the country’s main international airport,
Ivato, and Nosy Be international airport, as well as the rehabilitation of the Northern
railway network. In addition, from an institutional point of view, the Recipient was able
to finance the social plan for the redeployment of more than 60 percent of the staff of the
Ministries in charge of public works and transport, put in place key regulatory entities in
each sub-sector, and contributed to keep the railway concessionaire of the Northern
Network afloat, re-creating a competition between rail and road.

4.      Overall, the key project’s indicators are achieved, especially regarding the
increased traffic through improved transport infrastructure, with an average of more than
the expected 10% on the roads rehabilitated by the project. Likewise, the objective to
rehabilitate 4,045km of National Roads (RN) with the support of all the Donors has been
exceeded as 5,079km of RN was rehabilitated by the end of 2010. However, some
missing indicators are being collected and assessed by the Government. The multi-year
                                              3
disbursement suspension is expected to affect the overall APL program results as the
Government’s financial resources are scarce: some Donors, especially the European
Union, have simply cancelled scheduled aids. Therefore, necessary investments are not
being funded, jeopardizing the sustainability of recent investment and postponing urgent
ones.

5.     As of April 19, 2011, the initial credit has disbursed SDR103.26 million
(US$155.30 million equivalent), and the additional financing has disbursed SDR10.12
million (US$15.79 million equivalent).

6.      Due to the political crisis and the application of Operational Policy (OP) 7.30
(Dealing with de facto Government) in March 2009, disbursements under the project
froze and project implementation halted. As a consequence, project implementation
performance and progress towards the project objectives are currently Moderately
Satisfactory, as some works (port of Toliary, RN2, Andasibe railway station
rehabilitation) were interrupted before their completion because of the OP 7.30
application, and not because of contractors’ outperformance.

7.     However, the Project Development Objective is still fully relevant and attainable
and the outcomes already achieved can be consolidated, especially now that Senior
Management has authorized the resumption of disbursement of the entire portfolio in
Madagascar since May 11, 2011. As a matter of fact, before the coup, this project has
been performing satisfactorily, with “Highly Satisfactory? rating for the railway
component.

8.      The proposed additional activities are unlikely to require any change in the project
objective. The proposed extension of the closing date is being processed as a level two
restructuring, requiring the Vice President’s approval since it involves a cumulative
extension of the closing date of more than two years from the original closing date.

9.     The proposed extension of one year was requested by the Recipient, before the
above-mentioned Senior Management authorization, to ensure the completion of the
remaining activities when the suspension of disbursement under OP 7.30 is lifted. Now,
with the resumption of disbursement, there would be no obstacle to a rapid resumption of
project implementation as the Project Implementation Units, especially the Road
Authority of Madagascar (ARM), for roads, the Port Authority (APMF) for ports, and
Madarail for railways, are still operating, and the Fiduciary Agency is still in place.
Arrears for works, goods, and services delivered under contracts signed prior to March
17, 2009 for which the project has been granted for an exception as indicated in the
Exception Memo signed by the MD in May 6, 2010, have been fully paid.
Implementation arrangements and capacity were reviewed during the last supervision
mission of Transport Projects in December, 2010 and were found to be satisfactory, as
the key staffs in charge of the project implementation units are still in place, and ready to
resume the project’s implementation at any time.

10.     This extension will allow for: (i) the completion of the suspended works contracts
as a result of our disbursement freeze due to the crisis, in order to reinforce the outcome
of our investments in railways infrastructure (including the railway station of Andasibe
                                             4
and three metallic bridges) and ports (especially, the port of Toliary, for which security
goods and equipment were already purchased and delivered, and which can be installed
on-site with minor works). Those contracts were suspended because of the OP 7.30
application and not because of the contractors’ outperformance, (ii) the payment of
arrears for works, goods, and services for contracts committed after March 17, 2009, and
whose corresponding services have been duly completed, and (iii) the use of the
remaining funds of SDR2.87 millions, after the payment of the two above-mentioned
items, to finance transport equipment and infrastructure, for unfinished road surface
layer, slope stabilizations, some consultancy services (such as a study on the Road
Authority financing), and the continuation of training for Transport staff, all of which
would consolidate the Project’s outcomes.

11.     The Recipient will submit a forthcoming restructuring to revisit the activities to be
financed by the remaining funds of the project, and possibly, a reallocation of the
project’s funds before September 2011. The completion of suspended works as well as
the new ones to be submitted by the Recipient would help to achieve the project’s
development objective and upgrade the project’s implementation performance and
progress towards the project objectives rating from Moderately Satisfactory to
Satisfactory.

12.    There are no outstanding audits or financial management issues.

13.     This will be the fourth extension of the project. The first project extension (by one
year, from June 6, 2008 to June 30, 2009) was requested by the Borrower in 2005, within
the framework of a project restructuring. The second extension was requested by the
Government in 2008, to extend the project’s closing date until February 28, 2010 and to
reallocate the project’s funds. The third extension, until June 2011, was decided
internally by the Bank under the application of OP 7.30 to the Madagascar portfolio, in
application of exception memo signed by the Managing Director on May 6, 2010.
Therefore, even if the project has been theoretically effective for seven years, one should
not consider the 2.5 years due to the crisis. The current request for extension for one
additional year seems reasonable to ensure due completion of the remaining and
additional works to be financed, taking into consideration possible delays due to extreme
weather events (cyclones season starting around November).

14.    There will be a forthcoming restructuring to revisit the activities to be financed by
the remaining funds of the project, and possibly, to reallocate the project’s funds. The
Recipient will submit their request before September 2011.
