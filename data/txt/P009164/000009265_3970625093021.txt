PROJECT COKPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA
FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1026-YU)
Preface
Presented here is a Project Completion Report for the Fourth
Yugoslav Railway Project for which a loan of US$93.0 million was approved in
July 1974.   The  loan  was  closed  in  June 1981  after  cancellation  of
US$335,793.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Europe,
Middle East and North Africa region from information contained in a Project
Completion Report prepared for the Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR) by
the Transport Institute of Sarajevo and from data in project files.
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments. Their reply is shown as an
attachment to the report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA
FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1026-YU)
Highlights
The project covered the three year slice, 1974-76, of the railways'
1973-77 Investment Plan. Within this project the loan was to be disbursed
against expenditures for the completion of the 1964-70 Modernization
Program, certain closely related investments and technical assistance and
staff training (PCR, paras. 3.01 - 3.03 and Table 2).
The project was originally conceived as covering the years 1973-75
but delay by Yugoslav authorities in taking decisions for project financing
lengthened the time of project preparation with the result that the project
was reformulated for 1974-76.  It was intended that the loan would include
retroactive financing of expenditure on Bank approved contracts under the
Second Railway Project but a decision to this effect, which had been comu-
nicated to Yugoslav Railways, was later reversed and exacerbated the problem
of mobilizing sufficient resources for development (PCR, paras. 2.02 - 2.06).
Physical progress with the project was much slower than antici-
pated, primarily for the following reasons:  some investments proved to be
more difficult to implement than anticipated; lack of interim finance seri-
ously interrupted the works on the modernization program through 1974 and
part of 1975; and government funds were not made available on time and as
agreed due to the country's economic difficulties and inflation following
the oil price increases in 1973. However, the major part of the investments
were completed by 1977/78 with the result that railway freight traffic was
able to increase by nearly 25% from 1976 to 1979 (PCR, paras. 3.05 - 3.09
and Table 1).
The principal financial objective of the project was to reduce the
reliance of the railways on subsidies by increasing tariff revenues.  This
objective was not achieved as, in the face of inflationary pressures and
economic difficulties, Government approved tariff increases were inade-
quate.   However,  the project was successful in achieving its other major
objectives by enabling the railways to improve its operational efficiency,
it quality of service, and to carry higher traffic volumes from 1977
onwards. Through the consultancy assistance during project preparation and
implementation,  the  project  had  a  considerable  effect  in  institution
building (PCR, paras. 4.02, 5.01 - 5.03 and 6.01, and Table 3 and 4).
The re-evaluated economic returns for the project range from a min-
imum of 10X for electrification, signalling and telecommunication equipment,
13% for track overhaul, to 30% for traction and rolling stock replacement;
and an overall figure of 19% compared to 162 at appraisal (PCR, para. 7.03).



v
The following points are of particular interest:
- Decisions regarding retroactive financing (2.04 and 2.06)
- Physical progress with the project (3.05, 3.06, 3.07)
-  CYR role in procurement (3.10)
- Cost overrun (3.11)
- Improvements in operational indicators (4.02)
- Compensation payments (5.03)
- Institution building (6.01)
- Economic rate of return (7.03)
Major lessons learned from the project are:
1.   To make future projects simpler and less ambitious; and
II. The benefits of thorough project preparation, particularly of
detailed and comprehensive inveatment implementation schedules.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA
FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1026-YU)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Railways form an essential part of Yugoslavia's transport system
with the main trunk line running from Italy and Austria in the northwest to
Greece and Bulgaria in the southeast and main lines linking the trunk line
to the Adriatic coast. Although road transport now carries a bigger volume
of freignt, the railways play a vital role in the economy as the principal
carrier of bulk materials over long and medium distances.   In the early
1960s the railways had experienced an extended period, going back to before
the Second World War, with only minimum investment. At that time, 2000 of
the system's 2,300 locomotives were steam driven and 70X were over 35 years
old, and two-thirds of the rolling stock was over-age.  Stations, marshal-
ling yards and signalling systems were in urgent need of modernization.
1.02     A first railway loan from the Bank in 1963 finianced the conversion
of the Sarajevo-Ploce line to standard gauge with electric traction and sig-
nalling. In 1964, a Bank loan was concluded for the Second Railway Project
to support the railways' 1964-70 Modernization Program. This was a compre-
hensive program designed to modernize operations and equipment, in particu-
lar the modernization of some 1500 km of main lines with track renewal, sig-
nalling, and electrification, the acquisition of motive power and other
equipment as well as the construction or extension of six major marshalling
yards. The project turned out to be over ambitious, and was beset by major
problems.   The  railways'  financial  performance  deteriorated.   Investment
cost escalated due to inflation - whose effects were compounded by delays of
execution - and design changes. Funds ran out, and the Bank loan was fully
disbursed well before the Modernization Program was completed.
1.03     Yugoslav railways envisaged the Fourth Railway Project as a vehiclv
for completing that program. 1/ While the Bank agreed that this would be
one of the objectives, it decided to continue its involvement with Yugoslav
railways only if it could assist them in overcoming some of their more fun-
damental problems.
11. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     In the early 1960s, after many years of a near monopolistic posi-
tion in freight traffic, the Yugoslav Railways began to face increasing com-
petition from road transport. Until that time the railways had been able to
operate with generally low levels of investment expenditure and technical

efficiency, which would not have been possible in a more competitive envi-
ronment. To face this new challenge the railways undertook a cajor program
of modernization of its infrastructure by means of the 1964-70 Railway
Investmenc Plan, which was assisted by a Bank loan for the Second Yugoulav
Railway Project. About 70X of the finance for the Investment Plan was to te
met from the railway's internAlly generated funds. In the event, increasing
competition from road transport caused a deterioration in traffic and in the
railways' financial position.  This situation was exacerbated by inflation-
ary pressures and several devaluations of the dinar; funds which were sup-
posed  to be  available  for  investment  did not  materialize.   Principally
because of financial problems, ouly about half of the works under the
Investment Plan had been carried out by 1970 and, in 1971, the Bank proposed
a comprehensive study of the railways' problems by a British consulting firm
to obtain basic data for a Fourth Railway Project. I/
2.02     The   consultant's   report   dated   January   1972   made   many
recommendations for improvements in planning, marketing, financial control
ano management practices.   The consultants made also a recommendation for
the unification of the five separate and autonomous RTEs into one railway
organization.   However,  recognizing  that  this  might  not  be  politically
poE-,ible, they made alternative recommendations for strengthening the role
of CYR and for im- proving coordination amongst the enterprises.  The report
also highlighted the railways' serious financial difficulties and stressed
the need for addi- tional funding to complete the 1964-70 Investment Plan,
which was considered vital tor the efficient operation and viability of the
railways.   The prin- cipal recommendations of the report were accepted in
the Bank and, in April 1972, a mission visited Yugoslavia to discuss the
basic framework within which a loan for the Fourth Railway Project could be
made.   The main points were  that:   (i) a new Investment Plan should be
prepared, focusing on the remaining items from the 1964-70 program and only
those other items of highest priurity which would contribute to the
financial recovery of the railways; (ii) realistic Financing Plans should be
prepared to support the Investment Plans and the Financing Plans would have
to be underwritten  by  the  respective  Republican Governments;  and  (iii)
detailed Action Plans should be drawn up to strengthen all aspects of
railway operations and management.
2.03     Consultants were engaged by the Bank to assist the railways in pre-
paring their investment and financing plans.  After two missions to review
progress made by the railways and the consultants in preparing the project,
an appraisal mission visited Yugoslavia in November/December 1972.  In many
ways the task was the equivalent of appraising five railway projects since
each of the five railways, as separate and autonomous organizations, had its

own traffic torecast, its own investment plan and financing plan, and its
own financial records and projections.  Furthermore, the individual circum-
stances of each railway organization had to be taken into account in prepar-
ing the very detailed Action Plans which dealt with all aspects of railway
operations and management.  Even though investment planning at each of the
M'1Es was coordinated by CYR according to a comuon methodology formulated by
CYR, the task of appraising the projects of five railways was large.  The
items proposed for Bank financing were essentially the completion of the
19b4 Modernization Program which had been part of the Second Railway Project
and other closely related investments, all within the context of the five-
year Investment Plan 1973-77, for which a loan of US$48 million was at this
time planned. However, the appraisal mission found that necessary decisions
had not yet been taken by the Yugoslav authorities regarding measures for
the improvement of the railways finances so that no proper financing plan
for the project could be prepared. Following the return of the mission, at
a decision meeting in January 1973, it was decided that the appraisal team
should start with preparation of the SAR and that a further mission should
go to Yugoslavia to agree the content of the investment programs and to ob-
tain firm financing plans for a 1973-75 project.  The Yugoslav Government
should meanwhile be requested to take the necessary financial measures for
support of the railways without delay.   The SAR would subsequently be up-
dated and completed.  At this stage, a FY73 project was still the aim.  From
the beginning of project preparations, a major point, of which the Yugoslav
Governument was informed, was the intention to recommend retroactive financ-
ing of expenditures on the modernization program from November 1, 1972. The
rationale was  to avoid  interruption in this high prioricy program.   The
railways had been strongly urged to continue the investments with interim
tinancing.
2.04     After a March 1973 mission reviewed progress with the revision of
investment  and  financing  plans,  the  project  was  slipped  to FY74.   The
Yugoslavs were informed at this time of the intention to increase the loan
amount to US$b5 million to help with their financing difficulties.  A mis-
sion visited Yugoslavia in July 1973, again for the appraisal of the
project. At the Decision Meeting in August 1973, it was decided to increase
the loan amount to US$73 million which would finance 40% of the investments
eligible for Bank financing and would be equal to their foreign exchange
content.  The meeting also confirmed the decision taken in Jars -y to pro-
vide retroactive financing from November 1, 1972 and agreed on specific as-
surances on financing which would have to be given by the Republics and
Provinces.
2.05     ln September 1973, Bank management decided that there would be no
retroactive tinancing under the loan, mainly because of the long period of
retroactivity.  This major change meant that both investment plans and fi-
nancing  plans  again  required  revision.   A  mission  was  dispatched  to
Yugoslavia in October 1973 for this purpose and, at this stage, the project
period was changed from 1973-75 to 1974-7b.  Bringing in the later year in-
creased the number of items suitable for Bank financing and the loan amount
was maintained at US$73 million, without retroactive financing.  The report
ot this mission speaks of the considerable amount of time and effort which
the Yugoslav railways had already spent in preparing the appraisal of the
Fourtli Railway Project and records also that they were disappointed with the



-4-
decision against retroactive financing. This decision created serious prob-
lems for them in finding sources of interim financing and led in fact to
serious delays in carrying out the modernimation program (Para. 3.04).
2.Ob     A mission visited Yugoslavia in April 1974 for a final updating of
the appraisal report in the light of 1973 investments and financial results,
and for technical discussions prior to negotiations.  Copies were received
of decisions of the Republican and Provincial Government conearning financ-
ing for the project.  Negotiations were scheduled for April and because of
the number of people necessary from the Yugoslav side (comprising represen-
tative' of five railway enterprises, Republican and Provincial Governments,
CYR and the Federal Government) it was agreed that these should be held in
Yugoslavia. A firm financing plan for the project was still a problem, but
the situation improved on the eve of negotiations by news of a 21.8S in-
crease in both freight and passenger tariffs.
2.07     At negotiations, the loan amount was raised from US$73m to USM93m,
almost entirely due to revisions in financial contingencies and to changes
in the exchange rate. A major issue arose concerning the guarantees for the
financing plan with the federal authorities refusing to give assurances in
the (iuarantce Agreement for thoae undertakings, including funding for in-
vestments and reimbursement of losses on uneconomic lines.  Because of the
decentralization of the economic system, the federal authorities took the
position that the funding of investments and losses were now the responsi-
bility of the Republics and Provinces.  Eventually,  these assurances were
transterred to the Loan Agreement as conditions of effectiveness.  At the
same time, the Federal Government undertook in the Guarantee Agreement to
enable the railways to obtain any necessary governmental authorizations or
approvals to establish freight and passenger tariffs to provide the neces-
sary revenues. Another issue which was also overcome, was the reluctance of
the borrowers to agree to the definition of the project as a three-year time
slice of the investment plans and not merely as the Bank financed invest-
ments. This definition was requested by the Bank in order to integrate the
investment plans with the financing plans.   Difficulties also arose with
regard to CYR, which the Bank had wished to play a supervisory role in car-
rying OLL the project.  Eventually, it was agreed that CYRs role would be
one ot assistance, monitoring, coordination and reporting rather than one of
direct supervision.
Z.Ub     NegoLiations lasted eighteen days and were successfully concluded
on May 2, 1974. The loan was approved by the Board of Directors on July 2,
L974 and the Loan Agreement, which was supported by five subsidiary agree-
ments, one each between CYR and each of the RTEs, was signed on July 10,
1974.   Due  to  delay  in  obtaining  the  necessary  legal  decisions  from
Republican and Federal Governments, the loan became effective only on
February 12, 1975.
111. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
3.Ul    'The project consisted of the 1974-76 slice of the Investment Plan
1973-77 and comprised the following principal components:



-5-
Components to be financed by the Bank
- the completion of the 1964 Modernization Program, including re-
maining program sections of electrification (214 Ian) signalling
and telecommunications (90 stations), and marshalling yards;
- related investments, which were investments necessary to realize
the full benefits of the 1964 Modernization Program, consisting
mainly of track rehabilitation (406 km) with some further sig-
nalling and modernization of the Sarajevo Junction;
Components to be financed from other sources
- Other investments in fixed instalLations, including electrifica-
tion (406 km), signalling and telecommunications (57 stations),
track overhaul (907 km) and reconstruction of lines, stations
and junctions;
- the purchase of 221 locomotives, 73 multiple unit trains, 198
passengers and 6,289 freight cars;
- other investments for integrated transport and miscellaneous
civil works; and
- new constructions, including new lines, the Belgrade passenger
station and additional works on the Belgrade-Bar line.
The bank loan would also finance staff training and technical assistance by
foreign consultants to assist CYR and the RTEs, notably in preparing succes-
sive five-year plans and, as necessary, the feasibility and technical/
economic studies on modernization of several lines.

3.04     The delay in making the loan effective slowed down project imple-
mentationi since it delayed the effectiveness of annexes to existing con-
tracts and new contracts.    However, there were also other problems which
seriously affected implementation of the project, as explained below as well
as a shortage of local funds as indicated in paras. 2.05.  In fact, the de-
lay in loan effectiveness and the lack of interim financing kept actual
investments well below their planned level until late 1975.  Planned and
actual physical implementation of the project is shown at Table 1, while
planned and actual project costs are shown at Table 2.
3.05     Of the Bank financed investments about 65% of work on investments
for the completion of the 1964 Modernization Program was carried out during
the three-year period to the end of 1977. Electrification, which was mainly
the completion of electrification works at the southern end of the main line
between Nis and Skopje, where contractors were already available with their
equipment,  was about  90% completed during  this period.   Of the related
investments, line reconstruction and track overhaul went ahead fairly well.
These were ielatively straightforward investments. The big delays occurred
in signalling and telecommunications, particularly signalling in marshalling
yards, which were the main signalling items for Bank financing. These had
to be integrated with other extensive works - on tracks, electrification and
buildings - requiring the cooperation and coordination of contractors and of
several different railway departments.   It was for this reason that the
Bank, as part of the project, had arranged for the introduction of the
"Project  Manager  System"  where  one  officer  was  appointed  to take  sole
responsibility for managing such investments in one location.  The project
manager was to be responsible fhr overall progress on the job and would be
responsible for coordinating works as necessary by the Permanent Way
Department, the Mechanical Department, the Signalling Department and the
Electrical Department and for ensuring track access and occupation from the
Traffic Department. He would also be the link between executing departments
and the Planning Department. This system worked well and it is fair to say
that the delays in signalling investments occurred in spite of the system
and would have been worse without it.
3.06     Causes of delay were manifold.  The initial delay of project imple-
mentation aggravated funding problems - e.g. additional local funding neces-
sary because of increasing inflation and difficulties to provide foreign
exchange to pay imported components - especially in signalling.   Planning
for project implementation was still too ambitious, though to a lesser
extent, despite negative experience under the Second Railway Project, in
particular for telecommunications and signalling works mentioned above.



-7-
Scopes of these earlier planned works were too large for the level Of rail-
way staff experience at that time and many different Dasic Organisitions of
Associated Labor (BOALs) were involved, competing for scarce working time on
lines with heavy traffic.  Work mostly had to be carried out in a very
confined and limited space an well an under traffic. The difficulties In
obtaining access to these work sites under traffic conditions and of
coordinating the works were clearly underestimated.
3.07     The reconatruction of Sarajevo Junction,  which was pert of the
related investment, involved rerouting of tracks within the junction and the
construction of new tracks and platforms, all with accompanying works on
electrical catenaries and signalling installations. Additional to the men-
tioned difticulties in para. 3.06, the projtct faced urban planning prob-
lems, which resulted in expropriation difficultiel, because the city of
Sarajevo  had meanwhile  changed  its development  plan.   Therefore,  works
essentially began in 1977 and were completed in 1981. The worst delays in
bank financed signalling and telecommunication were in investments at RTE
Skopje. These investments were the completion of signalling on the Presevo-
Tito Veles line and signalling in the marshalling yard.  The works were
delayed principally due to a long contractual dispute between RTZ Skopje and
tne signalling contractor. Because of the dispute work proceeded at a mini-
mum pace with the contractor at times maintaining only a token work force on
the job. Work teams from the RTE were formed in an effort to replace the
contractor.  Bank missions several times urged Government intervention to
resolve the dispute, which continued for some years, and works were only
tinally completed in late 1980.
3.08     Of  the Bank financed  investments  it can be said therefore that
works on track overhaul and reconstruction and electrification went general-
ly well, but that the extent of the financial, contractual and organiza-
tional difficulties of investments in signalling and telecommunications and
in junctions and marshalling yards was not foreseen.  Difficulties due to
expropriation and contractual disputes were matters which the Bank could not
foresee and about which it could do very little.
3.09     Progress with the remaining investments in the project, which were
not financed by the Bank, was also slow.  The investments in fixed instal-
lations were about 55% completed by the end of the planned project period
and rolling stock purchases were about 70% of plinned.   Certain of the
investments categorized under 'Other Items' and 'New Construction' which
were of lesser priority, including new lines planned in Macedonia Y , were
not  carried  out.   The  great  difficulty  was  lack  of  local  funding.
Yugoslavia of course suffered from the economic slow-down which affected the
whole of Europe during  the years  from 1974 onwards.   Inflation  soared,
imports were restricted, railways' traffic reduced, and the Republican
Governments found themselves unable to supply funds as agreed for railway
investments. With reduced traffic, the need for some of the lower priority
investment was in any case reduced and some were eventually carried over to
the next medium term plan. At RTE Belgrade, electrification of the line
Indija-Subotica was carried over to the next plan period, because of slower
11/      These lines were subsequently determined to be uneconomic, and were
not constructed.



traffic  growth  and  lack  of  funds.   Most  other  investments  in  fixed
installations were completed by 1978 or 1979.  The railways did what they
could to aubstitute Government funds from their own resources, but with
reduced traffic and inadequate tariff increases this was not a great deal.
3.10     About b60  of loan funds were allocated to completion of works under
the 1964 Modernization Program and provision was made under the Loan Agree-
ment for special contracting in those cases where ICB would be inappropri-
ate, because of the need to standardize with existing equipment, or where
works had to be carried out under traffic.  It was agreed that contracts up
to a total value of US$20 million could be let by direct negotiation, or by
limited bidding, provided that the specific works to be contracted or equip-
ment to be purchased was first agreed between the RTE, CYR and the Bank.
The total amount of any one contract was limited to US$500,000 equivalent
and each contract, together with bid evaluation where appropriate, was sub-
mitted by the KTE to CYR for review before the contract was placed.  CYR
periodically submitted to the Bank a list of contracts placed in this way.
l[his SyStem worked very well.  The criteria applied by the CYR panel ap-
pointed for contract review were similar to those of the Bank and foreign
suppliers, or contractors, were not excluded from bidding.  Although there
were many contracts to be awarded, these procedures were very effective in
speeding procurement and also played a part in institution-building by
strengthening the procurement process.  Although there were delays in the
preparatiun of some bidding documents, no serious problems arose with any of
the new contracts under the loan, either in contracting or in ilmplementa-
Lion.  With annexes to the older contracts, some of which had been made
eight or line years earlier, some problems arose with price adjustments and
caused delays in implementation, especially in the case of the Skopje sig-
nalling works (para. 3.07).
3.11     The total cost overrun on the project  in Dinar  terms was  39Z.
Price contingencies roughly equated with the increase in the Producer Price
Index in Yugoslavia during the project period.  However, since the Dinar/
Dollar exchange rate was changing at a considerably slower rate than the
Producer 'riLce Index, the cost overrun measured in dollar terms was only
7x.  TLhe cost overrun came almost entirely from rolling stock purchases,
where prices had been considerably underestimated.
3.12     Due to the difficulties in project implementation discussed above
and also because the loan did not become effective until the beginning of
1975, disbursements lagged well behind the forecast and less than half of
the loan was disbursed during the first three year period.  Planned and
actual disbursements by years are shown below.

3.13     Reporting on the project was good.  Quarterly progress reports were
received from CYR containing separate physical and financial progress sched-
ules for investments at each of the RTEs. These were the subject of dis-
cussion and examination by regular Bank missions, which visited each of the
RTEs accompanied by representatives of CYR. The role of CYR as a coordinat-
ing agency for Bank railway projects in Yugoslavia was very useful and was
strengthened. This development helped greatly to expedite the Fifth Railway
Project which followed.
3.14     After comprehensive offers from consultants from several countries,
French railway consultants were selected to carry out the feasibility
studies under the project, which were to form the basis for the railways'
investment plans in the next medium term period. Feasibility studies were
prepared for major investment items in all six Republics and revised on
agreement between the RTEs, CYR and the Bank, mainly to adjust overly
optimistic   assumptions   regarding   traffic   forecasts   and   operational
performance and to clarify and amplify technical assumptions and calcula-
tions. The performance of the consultants was satisfactory.
IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
Traffic
4.01     At  appraisal,  railway  freight  traffic  was  forecast  to  reach
25.6 billion ton-km and 12.0 billion passenger-km by 1977, including traffic
generated by the opening of the Belgrade-Bar line in 1976.  The correspond-
ing forecast annual increases during 1973-77 were 5.8% for freight and 3.2%
for passengers. However, during 1975 and 1976, both freight and passenger
traffic actually declined and average traffic growth during the 1973-77
period fell short of the forecasts, freight traffic reaching only 22.2 bil-
lion ton-km, an increase of 2.1% per year, while passenger traffic remained
at about 10.5 billion passenger-km  (Tables 3 and 4).  The main reason for
this shortfall were the economic difficulties facing Yugoslavia, which led
to import restrictions and to a slowdown in economic growth. Furthermore,
increasing competition from road transport attracted most of the new
traffic. While total freight and passenger traffic during most of the 1970s
was increasing at between 5 and 6% per year, road transport was capturing
most of the additional traffic with annual increases of about 12% for
freight and 7 to 8% for passenger traffic. The rapid growth of road trans-
port through the 1970s was in direct response to the growth and diversifica-



- 10 -
tion of the economy and the inability of the railways to accommodate addi-
tional traffic, partly because of delays in the 1964-70 modernization
program.  In effect, it was not until the completion of the bulk of the
railway modernization program in 1977 that the position of the railways
began to improve. Then, between 1976 and 1980, rail freight traffic growth
increased to 4.5% per year and passenger traffic showed a slight, but steady
increase of about 1.2% per year.
Operations
4.02     Although  certain  operational  efficiency  indicators  showed  an
adverse movement between 1973 and 1975/76, by 1977 the effects of the imple-
mentation of the modernization program in infrastructure and of the pur-
chases of rolling stock were beginning to be felt. With the improved traf-
fic figures of 1978, all operational indicators showed very healthy improve-
ments (Table 3). Notable improvements in operational efficiency indicators
between 1973 and 1978 were:  freight traffic density measured in net ton-km
per route km increased by 20%, from 1966 to 2359; net ton-km per loaded
car-km increased 28% (reflecting in part the modernization of the freight
car fleet with larger and more efficient cars); average freight car turn-
round time declined from 5.6 days to 5.3 days; and the availability of die-
sel and electric locomotives increased 8% and 13% respectively. Productiv-
ity, measured as traffic units per employee2/, also increased 14%.
4.03     Under a covenant of the Loan Agreement, CYR and the RTEs were re-
quired to establish a methodology for the definition of uneconomic lines. A
satisfactory methodology was formulated by CYR and was accepted by the RTEs
and by all republican and provincial governments Y. As a result of the
use of this methodology, 538 km of uneconomic lines dt RTE Sarajevo and
120 km at RTE Belgrade were closed during the project period. Also during
this period (1973-78) and partially as a result of the closure of the uneco-
nomic lines, staff numbers were reduced from 115,700 to 111,000.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Tariffs and Compensation Payments
5.01     A principal reason for the slow progress under the Second Railway
Project was the failure of the RTEs, due to inadequate tariff increases, to
generate sufficient internal funds for the investment program. As a conse-
quence, a main objective of the Fourth Railway Project was to iaprove the
financial situation of the railways by ensuring that tariff revenues kept
pace with rising costs by means of timely increases in freight rates and
passenger fares. To this end, as a condition of effectiveness of the loan,
the Republican and Provincial Governments gave assurances by means of a
NTkm + Pkm
Staff numbers
i/ The Government of Macedonia accepted the methodology in principle, but
dia not agree to the criteria for traffic density.



- 11 -
Social Agreement for freight pricing, concluded in November 1974, that they
would take all actions within their powers to maintain tariffs at levels
sufficient to enable the railways to cover their costs and to provide
adequate internal funds for investments. The Federal Government, which was
a signatory to the Social Agreement, gave assurance which was embodied in
the Guarantee Agreement (para. 2.08).
5.02     The Social Agreement established a mechanism for considering ad-
justments to railway freight rates twice a year.  However, while the rail-
ways, regularly requested increases in tariffs to cover rising costs through-
out the project period, the Government just as regularly gave lhem less than
requested.  Following the oil price rises of 1973 onwards,  11 the Yugoslav
economy was beset with severe inflationary pressures and the government's
commitment to raise railway tariffs soon foundered in the face of the per-
ceived need to combat inflation by holding down prices.  As a result, the
increase of 22% for both freight and passengers tariffs approved in January
1975, when reviewed by a special committee was found to be 6% less than
required by the terms of the Social Agreement. The railways then requested
an increase of 14X from October 1, 1975 to make up for this shortfall and to
allow for inflation in the first half of 1975, but no further increase was
approved for 1975, instead, a tariff increase of 8% for boch freight and
passengers was approved to be effective from January 1976.  The result of
the inadequate tariff increases was that tariff revenues in 1975 were
insufficient for the railways' needs, especially since subsidies were mainly
paid in arrear, and the railways had to resort to short-term borrowing to
meet  their  most  pressing  liquidity  needs.   Internal  funds  for working
capital and investments were well short of requirements.   This situation
continued through 1976 and 1977.
5.03     Realizing that no railway can function efficiently with deficits
financed in arrears, but convinced that under prevailing circumstances the
answer was not to be found by tariff increases, the Federal Government, in
197b, established a commission comprising representatives of Federal,
Republican and Provincial Governments, the Chamber of Economy and CYR to
look for alternative solutions.   The result was the Social Agreement on
Economic and Other Measures to provide Normal Economic Conditions for the
Railways (SAE), which was signed by the Federal, Republican and Provincial
Governments  in June 1977.  This provided inter alia for revenues of the
railways, in 1978 and subsequent years, to be supplemented by regular
compensation payments, the amount of which would be determined one year in
advance and which would vary with traffic volume and quality of service.
The SAE provided also that the Governments' obligations regarding the com
pensation payments should be taken over by Communities of Interest (COI),
comprising representatives of the railways and its users. These communities
also assumed much of Governments' responsibilities for oversight of the
railways. The provisions of the SAE were successful in improving the finan-
cial position of the railways, but its effects were felt only after the com-
mencement of the Fifth Railway Project in 1978.
1/       From 1972 through 1978 the dollar cost of oil imports to Yugoslavia
rose ten-fold.

Agreement.
5.05     Ibe forecasts shown in the table above reflect the expectation at
appraisal that tariffs, as required by the legal documents, would be regu-
larly increased to match inflation and to enable the railways to attain the
financial targets of their Action Plans.  It reflects also the buoyant tar-
iff revenues anticipated for the period 1974-77 from a traffic forecast
showing average annual increases between 1973 and 1977 of 5.8Z for freight
and 3.2% for passengers, for an overall annual increase of 4.9Z.  In fact,
for reasons discussed in Section IV, freight traffic increased during this
period by an average of only 2.1% a year, while passenger traffic declined,
so that the overall annual increase was only 1.3%. The result, shown by the
increasing operating ratios in column (2) of the table, was a gradually
worsening financial performance, which left the railways in deficit at the
end of each year until the new compensation payment policy took effect in
1978 following the enactment of SAE. The comparatively low operating ratios
shown for later years in Column (2) above can, however, be contrasted with

Financial Covenants
5.06     The principal  financial covenants in the Loan Agreement required
CYR and the RTEs to do all in their powers to establish tariffs such as
would provide the revenues specified in the Subsidiary Agreements and to use
their best efforts to achieve financial targets, for the railhays as a
whole, as set out in a schedule to the Loan Agreement and, for each individ-
ual RTE, as set out in a schedule to each Subsidiary Agreement.  The rele-
vant sections of each Subsidiary Agreement specified that revenues should be
sufficient each year to cover operating expenses, debt service, increases in
working capital and to finance a specified proportion of each RTE's invest-
ments. The schedules gave targets for the years 1975 and 1977 for operating
ratios, rates of return on net fixed assets, and for levels of working capi-
tal.  The targets contained  in the Loan Agreement  for the railways as a
whole, together with actual achievements, are shown below.

For reasons already discussed above, the target operating ratios were not
achieved in either year.  Since net revenues were negative, no return was
earned  on net  fixed  assets.   The  high  cash  percentage  shown  for  1977
reflects high end of year cash balances at RTEs Zagreb and Ljubljana where
the system of compensation payments by Co=munities of Interest had already
been established.
Financing Investments
5.07     A statement showing the railway's cash flow by years from 1974 up
to 1980 is shown at Table 6.  The project wao  defined as the three year,
1974-76 time slice of the 1973-77 Investment Plan.  However, since the loan
only became effective in February 1975, there was considerable delay in co-
mencing most of the works under the project and for, reasons explained in
Section III of this report, works were substantially completed only in 1980
with final loan disbursements in the first half of 1981.  Since the project
comprised the whole of the three year slice of the Investment Plan, and part
of the investments slipped into 1977-80, when work was also proceeding on
current investment programs, it has been possible only to show how total
investmeuts per year have been financed. Financing for the years 1974-76 is
shown below.

5.U8     During this period, in which it was intended that the project would
be carried out, internal funds financed only 16% of investments instead of
33k as forecast. After allowing for the difference in forecast and actual
inflation rates, total expenditure on investments was only 70% of that fore-
cast. Of the external finance, grants from Republics and Provinces made up
24% of the total, the Bank loan, which was only 37% drawn down during this
period contributed 5% and the balance was made up of 30% suppliers credits
and 41Z loans, principally from domestic sources. A somewhat similar pic-
ture with a slight improvement in internal resources is shown below for fi-
nances of investments during years 1974-80 which covers the years during
which the project was in fact carried out.  Since the appraisal  forecast
only covered the years to 1977, no comparative figures can be given along-
side the actual figures.

5.09     That the railways were able to make the above contribution to in-
vestment expenditures from internal resources was due to a sound depreci-
ation policy, with annual revaluations of assets based on price indices
issued by the Federal Institute of Statistics.   The inadequacy of tariff
increases throuighout the period of the Fourth Railway Project is illustrated
by the fact that despite the ample provision for depreciation of fixed as-
sets, withott subsidies or compensation payments, no contribution to invest-
ments from ia'ternal resources would have been possible after 1974.  There-
fore, the principal financial objective of the project of putting the
railways back on the path towards viability through tariff revenues was not
achieved.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
b.U1     Management of the railways in Yugoslavia was always  technically
competent in traditional railway skills and disciplines and, besides the
difficulties in carrying out some works under traffic in confined space,
most problems which arose in carrying out the project were mainly due to
external circumstances and to a lack of funds.  However, detailed and inte-
grated planning, including investment, operational, action and financial
planning and coordination required strengthening.  This issue was addressed
both during project preparation and by technical assistance under the
project.  In this respect the close association of planning staff of the
railways with British consultants during the long period of project
preparation was of particular benefit.  Feasibility studies for major proj-
ect items were prepared jointly by the consultants and the planning staff of
CYR and new techniques in investment planning and investment plan evaluation
were introduced. The preparation of the feasibility studies for individual
investments lay the groundwork for future development. Some of these stud-
ies were updated by CYR staff at a later stage and many of the feasibility
studies for the Sixth Railway Project were prepared by CYR's own staff who
had worked with Bank staff and consultants in previous years.  Similarly,
the preparation of Operational, Financial and Action Plans, and their inte-
gration, greatly supported the development effort and the performance of the
railways.
b.02     Under the Loan Agreement, CYR was to set up a panel of qualified
experts to assist in the preparation of bidding documents, bid evaluation
and in coordinating procurement. This panel functioned well and ensured an
orderly  and  efficient  procurement  process:   it  took  responsibility  for
reviewing and approving contracts exempted from the requirement for ICB
(para. 3.10) and also acted as coordinating agency between the RTEs and the
bank for all procurement under ICB. All bid evaluations for Bank financed
items were made by RTEs with the assistance of a member of the CYR panel.
This panel has continued its work under the Fifth Railway Project.
6.03     The concept of the Project Officer responsible for all aspects of a
related group of investments, which was introduced under this project, is
also acknowledged to have been of considerable benefit and Project Officers
have continued to function through subsequent projects.



- 16 -
6.04     Although many targets of the Action Plans were not achieved during
the project period, the introduction of these plans by the RTEs as a manage-
ment tool was equally beneficial, especially for reaching a common under-
standing by all concerned on objectivea and responsibilities as well as on
the measures to be taken to improve performance and the time required for
their achievement. The plans addressed themselves to improvements in orga-
nization, planning, marketing, productivity and training as well as measures
for operational efficiency; targets and times were formulated by the RTEs
themselves.   Associated with the Action  Plan were  the Operational  Plans
which provided a methodology for a continuous assessment of future require-
ments of traction and rolling stock.   Both Action Plans and Operational
Plans continue to be used by the RTEs.
VII. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
7.01     The main benefits of the project were felt in the improved opera-
tional efficiency of the railway and its ability to compete in an increas-
ingly competitive transport market.  Following completion of the investment
program under the project, freight traffic growth jumped from about 2X per
year to over 4% per year while passenger traffic showed modest increases of
1 to 2X per year in contrast to the earlier stagnation or even decline in
total traffic.  As a major component of the project, accounting for about
20% of the investment program, track overhaul of about 1240 km of main lines
enabled the railways to avoid stepped-up track maintenance costs, which
would otherwise have beeui necessary, reduced derailments and attendant
losses, and to reduce equipment and rolling stock requirements through
higher operating speeds.  Investments in traction and rolling stock repre-
sented the single largest item in the program with over 40% of the total,
with the bulk of this component covering equipment renewal.   If equipment
had not been replaced in time under the project, the ensuing bottlenecks in
the railway system would have disrupted economic activity and much of the
traffic would have to have been moved at higher cost by road.  This trend
was already in evidence during the early 1970s and the project helped start
the railways to attract more traffic during the latter part of the decade.
Modernization in the form of electrification (about 620 km) and improved
signalling and telecommunications represented only about 15% of the invest-
ment program.  These investments on high density lines provide direct oper-
ating cost savings through higher operating speeds as well as savings in
system operating costs.
7.02     At appraisal, the railways made a comprehensive cost/benefit analy-
sis of the Investment Plan as a whole.  This analysis resulted in an ER of
about 16%, which was considered to be low as it was estimated prior to the
energy crisis.  Completion of overdue items related to the 1964-70 Moderni-
zation Program were estimated to yield an ERs of about 28%, mainly because
through system effects the larger investments made previously would begin to
yield full benefits.
7.03     An economic re-evaluation was conducted  for three representative
track overhaul components of the plan as well as for the traction and roll-
ing stock items. Actual project costs and estimated benefits were adjusted
to 1983 prices and the updated benefit streams have been estimated based on
trends in actual traffic.  Traffic is assumed to increase at about 3Z per



- 17 -
year overall, except on the Doboj-Bosanski Novi line in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
where a 10X annual growth rate is assumed between 1980 and 1985 to reflect
substantial additional traffic from a new iron ore mine at Omaruka
(Table 8). The ERs for the three track overhaul items range from 11% to
17X, with an overall average of 132 (Tables 9 to 11). Although these items
represent completion of the earlier modernization program, the lower returns
reflect lower traffic levels and substantially higher cost levels than
expected at appraisal.  The renewal of traction and rolling stock assumes
that without replacement, the additional traffic would have to be handled by
road transport.  The estimated ER is about 30X (Table 12).  Electrification
of the Zidani Most-Sentilj (Austrian Border) line in Slovenia and signalling
and telecommunications investments on several lines were not re-evaluated,
but are estimated to have ERs of at least 10% in view of the traffic volumes
these lines carry. The overall ER of the investment program can therefore
be estimated at about 19%, which is somewhat above the appraisal estimate.
VIII.  THE ROLE OF THE BANK
8.01     A  decision  of  the  Bank,  taken  during  project  preparation  in
September 1973 that no retroactive financing would be included in the loan
caused serious difficulties for the railways (para. 2.05.).  The September
ruling reversed a decision, taken at a Decision Meeting in January 1983 and
communicated to the Borrower, that
"In order to facilitate the provision of further inter-
im financing and the uninterrupted execution of the
modernization program, expenditures after October 31,
1972 (when Loan 395-YU was fully disbursed) for con-
tracts approved by the Bank will be eligible for reim-
bursement under the new loan.   This decision will be
communicated to the Yugoslav authorities with a request
to provide immediately adequate interim financing."
The decision not to provide retroactive financing meant that the railways
had to look for other sources of long-term financing of about US$20.0 mil-
lion to cover interim finance, which had been arranged on the assumption
that it would be covered by the Bank's loan.  Moreover, in the absence of
retroactive financing the railways found it difficult to mobilize further
interim financing and the works on the modernization program had to be cur-
*         tailed until the loan became effective; thereafter, further delays occurred
due to time required to restart the works.   The reversal on retroactive
financing made also more difficult the task of the Bank mission which
visited Yugoslavia in October 1973 to require railway staff to prepare yet
more investment and financing plans.
8.02     The Bank's decision to provide financial support for completing the
lagging 1964 Modernization Program and for the continued rehabilitation of
the railways appears to have been sound.  The completion of electrification
and installation of modern signalling on the main line and the modernization
of marshalling yards were necessary investments to enable the railways to
efficiently fulfill their role of principal carrier of bulk materials over
long and medium hauls.   Though the completion of these  invcstments took
longer than expected,  without  the Bank's  loan and associated  Governh.ent



- 18 -
funds as well as without the very considerable assistance provided in proj-
ect planning and preparation, many more years wouLd probably have passed
before the Modernization Program would have been completed and the full ben-
efits of the investments gained. When most of the program was completed in
1977 it enabled the railways to play a part in facilitating the expansion of
the economy by carrying freight traffic which increased in volume by nearly
25X between 1976 and 1979.
b.03     In retrospect the overall content of the project seems to have been
appropriate. Those investments in new lines which were not carried out were
not items which were accorded priority within the program. The implementa-
tion schedule however was plainly too ambitious. The main factor which de-
layed most project items was the lack of local funding, although this was
not a major factor for the investments financed from the Bank loan. In this
case, the factors which arose from the substantial slowdown of investments
in signalling in junctions and marshalling yards before this loan became
effective and the difficulties of working with limited track occupation and
in confined areas was seriously underestimated and not taken into considert-
tion early enough.  The implementation of these difficult investments would
have benefitted from more realistic and coordinated planning.
8.04     The frequency of Bank supervision was adequate and the quality of
its work appears to have been good. Regarding the contractual dispute with
respect to Bank financed signalling investments, the costly effects of delay
in resolving the dispute were pointed out both verbally and in writing to
the railways and the Government and it is difficult to see what further
action could have been taken.  The dispute was eventually resolved and the
investments completed.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.U1     Much was  lLarned,  both  by the Bank  and  the  railways  from  the
projecL.  Institution building was effective and planning capabilities were
improved. The CYR Investment and Procurement Panel became a permanent fea-
ture for succeeding projects as did the Action and Operational Plans.
Preparation of the Fifth Railway Project was made easier by the improved
plannir- capability and by the feasibility studies prepared with technical
assistance under the project.   Taking advantage  of lessons  learned,  the
Fifth Railway Project, which was also a rehabilitation project, was simpler
and less ambitious and both preparation and implementation were accomplished
with much less difficulty.
9.02     The financial covenants, which were designed to reduce railway sub-
sidies and to restore gradually the railways' financial viability through
tariff revenues, were quite appropriate and the principle had been agreed
with the Yugoslav authorities. However, the authorities, commitment to high
tariff increases weakened in the face of an economic slowdown and high
inflation rates following the oil crisis of 1973.  The impact of this course
of action on the railways' development and performance is now better under-
stood and financial covenants for the Sixth Railway Project have been made
more specific, while adequate tariff increases were made a condition of loan
effectiveness.



- 19 -
9.03     A major lesson to be learned from the project is not new.  It is
that project preparation cannot be too thorough and in particular that
detailud implementation schedules should be prepared for all major invest-
ment items.  The role which the consultants played in project preparation
was most valuable in investment planning, but the administrative complexity
and the difficulties in implementing major component. of the project were
underestimated.
9.U4     Although with some delay,  the basic objectives of the loan were
largely achieved, except the objectives of restoring the railways' financial
viability through tariffs, although, after 1977, the internal resource posi-
tion of the railways improved as compensation payments replaced the short-
fall in tariff increases. The re-evaluated rate of return on the project of
19X exceeds the appraisal estimate of 16X. The railways were enabled by the
project to improve their operational efficiency and the quality of services,
and to carry the increased traffic volumes from 1977 onwards.  Institution
building was good. Overall, therefore, this oust be considered as a auc-
cessful project.
