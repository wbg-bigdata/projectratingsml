APPRAISAL OF
A FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        In December 1964, the Bank loaned US$70 million (Loan 395-YU) to-
ward a Modernization Program for main railway lines in Yugoslavia. Although
this Program was scheduled for completion in 1968, a significant part of the
works remains to be carried out and the total cost has increased from US$185
to about US$400 million. Upon final loan disbursement in October 1972,
Yugoslavia requested further Bank financing to complete the Program and -
financing for certain related investments. However, to avoid recurrence
of delays in project execution, the Bank requested a comprehensive development
and financing program, backed by appropriate Government support.
ii.       Such a program has now been prepared and has been accepted by the
Socialist Federal Government of Yugoslavia (SFRY), Socialist Republics (SRs),
Socialist Autonomous Provinces (SAPs), and other interested parties. The
program comprises Investment and Financing Plans for 1973-77, Action Plans
for rationalizing the railways' organization and operations, and comprehen-
sive support measures, including arrangements for appropriate tariff increases,
compensation payments, and other financial assistance. As a result, the rail-
ways are expected to achieve financial viability during the plan period.
iii.      This report appraises a new railway project within this comprehen-
sive program. Total investments in the Plan for 1973-77 are estimated at
US$1,763 million, including contingencies adequate to. cover the effects of
the energy crisis. Within this Plan, the loan would finance a project
covering total investments during 1974-76, estimated at US$1,139 million,
including contingencies. The proposed loan of US$93 million, representing
about 8% of the project cost, would be allocated to expenditures after June
30, 1974 as follows: US$39.6 million to completion of the 1964 Modernization
Program; US$24.7 million to investments closely related to that Program:
US$0.7 to technical assistance and-staff training and US$28.0 to physical
and price contingencies. The total cost of the investments under these
allocations is estimated at US$231.8 million, with a foreign exchange compo-
nent of US$100.0 million.
iv.       The loan would be the fourth for railways and the eleventh for
transport. The ten previous loans total US$394.4 million, including US$155
million for three railway projects; US$180 million for six highway projects
and US$59.4 million for the Naftagas pipeline project, which became effective
on March 22, 1974. Execution of the highway projects has been satisfactory,
but the railway projects have suffered delays and cost increases.
v.        Execution of the 1964 Modernization Program of main railway lines
has encounteted the greatest difficulties due mainly to failure of the Fi-
nancing Plan. Railway revenues were depressed by SFRY control over tariffs
in a period of rapid inflation and by sharply increased road competition.
Following institutional reforms, the SRs and SAPs could not provide promptly



- ii -
the necessary resources. All these factors were compounded by general il-
liquidity of the Yugoslav economy and adverse exchange rate adjustments.
The railways were also ill-equipped to adjust to new market conditions and
lacked experience in managing such a large project.
vi.       The Yugoslav authorities, aware of these deficiencies, are now
undertaking to provide appropriate support for the railways, including a
major financial recovery program and agreed tariff policies which should
enable the railways to cover from their internal resources adequate operating
cash and working capital as well as 33% of their investments under the proj-
ect. As a result of measures already taken, the railways realized a small
net surplus of ND 4 million in 1973, compared to a deficit of ND 750 million
in 1972. Also the prospects for 1974 are that they will be able to realize
another small surplus despite a substantial increase in depreciation provi-
sions -- which will generate more cash for investment- because the authori-
ties have approved an increase of 21.8% in tariffs, effective as of May 24 for
freight and June 1 for passengers. Increasing surpluses are forecast for
1975 to 1977. Furthermore, the authorities have agreed to participate with
agreed percentages in the investments financed by the proposed loan and to
guarantee the timely provision of all funds for these investments in case
of an unexpected shortfall in their financing. In addition, should the
railways have insufficient funds to carry out the project as a whole on time,
the authorities have agreed to use their best efforts to arrange the necessary
financing.
vii.      The Yugoslav Railways consist of five independent Railway Transport
Enterprises (RTEs), with joint activities coordinated by the Community of
Yugoslav Railways (CYR). Productivity compares satisfactorily with that of
other European railways. Managements are technically competent, but have
only recently given adequate attention to planning and marketing. Through
their Action Plans, the railways intend to make extensive improvements in
their organization and operations. These improvements are specified in
appropriate cases as quantified operational and financial targets, including
studies of 2,700 km of possible uneconomic lines and a reduction in the labor
force of at least 10,000 between 1972 and 1977.
viii.     Major components of the project are:  completion of the 1964
Modernization Program; investments closely related to this Program; other
investments in fixed installations; traction and rolling stock; development
of integral transport; and construction of three short lines and resiting of
Belgrade station.
ix.       The US$93 million loan would be disbursed as follows against ex-
penditures after June 30, 1974: 40% of the expenditure for completing the
1964 Modernization Program, 100% of the cost (c.i.f. landed for imports or
ex-factory price for domestic goods) of specified materials and equipment
for related investments; and 100% of the foreign exchange cost of staff
training and technical assistance. The loan would be made to the CYR and
the loan proceeds transferred to RTEs by subsidiary agreements. Each.RTE
will be responsible for its part of the project, with CYR responsible for



- iii -
loan administration, coordination of technical assistance and staff training
and reporting to the Bank on progress in project execution and other matters.
x.        The completion of existing contracts for the 1964 Modernization
Program, placed in accordance with procedures agreed under loan 395-YU, would
be eligible for Bank financing and would account for about US$28 million 1/
of the loan. Certain contracts remaining to be placed for that Program,
amounting to about US$6 million 1/ of the loan, would not be suitable for
international competitive bidding (ICB) because of standardization with
existing equipment and the need for integration with existing operations.
New contracts, amounting to about US$30 million 1/ of the loan would be
awarded following ICB, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procure-
ment. Minor contracts, amounting to about $1.2 million 1/ of the loan, would
be placed in accordance with the railways' normal procedures, which are
satisfactory to the Bank.
xi.       The Financing Plans for 1973-77, including those for the project,
are satisfactory. All resources necessary for the financing of the project
have been identified and only 5% of those required for the entire plan
period remain unidentified, mainly for those investments to be started late
in the plan period and which depend on the satisfactory outcome of technical/
economic studies. To fill this gap, the railways expect additional assis-
tance from the Bank in 1977 and are actively seeking other sources. Finan-
cing of the project requires that the railways cover 33% of the investments
from their net internal funds. The Bank has obtained assurances from the
Yugoslav authorities that, by tariff increases or other means, these funds
will be available to the railways. Even if a shortfall should occur, about
90% of these internal resources would be assured as a result of new deprecia-
tion arrangements and other Government support measures.
xii.      Investments in the Plan should yield relatively high benefits as
they involve expenditure for completing ongoing works yielding full bene-
fits on completion. Benefits will result mainly from reduced maintenance
and operating costs, improved utilization of traction and rolling stock,
and increased revenue from higher quality services. Beneficiaries will
be the railway passengers and users of railway freight services, SRs, SAPs,
and railways themselves. The Rate of Return is 16% on the 1973-77 Invest-
ment Plan and 28% on the balance of investments for completing the 1964
Modernization Program. Since these returns are based on conservative esti-
mates of benefits, the Plan is well justified.
xiii.     With the assurances obtained and fulfillment of certain conditions
for loan effectiveness as indicated in paras. 7.01-7.03, and based on the
Investment, Financing, and Action Plans for 1973-77, the project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$93 million to the CYR for a 25-year term, including
3 years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF
A FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In December 1964, the Bank loaned US$70 million (Loan 395-YU) to-
ward a Modernization Program for main railway lines. Completion, scheduled
for 1968, has been seriously delayed (para 1.02), and total costs have in-
creased from US$185 million to about US$400 million. Upon final loan disburse-
ment in October 1972, the Yugoslav authorities requested further Bank financ-
ing to complete the Program as well as financing for certain other closely
related investments, technical assistance, and staff training. These elements
are covered by a proposed loan of US$93 million, which is the subject of this
report. The railways are spending about US$44 million on the Modernization
Program between October 1972 and end of FY 1974, when the loan is expected to
be signed.
1.02      Delays and cost increases in the 1964 Modernization Program were
mainly due to failure of the Financing Plan. Revenues were depressed by
Federal control over railway tariffs in a period of rapid inflation and by
sharply increased road competition. Institutional reforms transferred
responsibility for funding railway deficits and investments from the Socialist
Federal Government of Yugoslavia (SFRY) to the Socialist Republics (SRs) 1/
and Socialist Autonomous Provinces (SAPs) 2/, which could not quickly provide
the necessary resources. The railways were also ill-equipped to adjust to new
market conditions. All these factors were compounded by illiquidity of the
Yugoslav economy and adverse exchange rate adjustments. Construction schedules
proved to be over-optimistic and deficiencies occurred in project management,
while new operational requirements and technological developments led to changes
in designs and specifications. Annex 1 provides a more detailed review.
1.03      In 1971, the Bank concluded that fundamental reforms were necessary
to avoid further delays and improve the railways' situation. In agreement
with all Governments, the Bank carried out a survey of the whole transport
sector and commissioned Transmark, a British consulting firm, to review the
railways' situation in depth. The main findings and conclusions of the sec-
tor review are incorporated in IBRD/IDA Report 194a-YU "The Economic Develop-
ment of Yugoslavia", November 26, 1973 (Volume III, Chapter VII A).

Slovenia.

- 2 -
1.04      The Yugoslav authorities, including the SFRY, SRs, and SAPs, have
now agreed to resolve major policy issues and to provide appropriate support
to the railways, including direct participation in financing specific invest-
ments. The railways have prepared a comprehensive program, including real-
istic Five-Year Investment Plans for 1973-77, corresponding Financing Plans,
and detailed Action Plans for improving their organization and operations.
All Governments, the railways, and other interested parties have reached
agreement on this comprehensive program, and are committed to enter into
formal agreements on certain matters as conditions of loan effectiveness.
Consequently, a firm basis has been established for consideration of further
assistance to the railways.
1.05      The proposed US$93 million loan to the Community of Yugoslav Rail-
ways would help finance a three-year slice, 1974-76, of the railways' Five-
Year Investment Plan for 1973-77 and would be disbursed against expenditures
after June 30, 1974 on selected investments. The loan represents about 8%
of the total project cost and would be allocated as follows: US$39.6 million
to completion of the 1964 Modernization Program; US$24.7 million to investments
closely related to that Program; US$0.7 million to technical assistance and
staff training; and US$28.0 million to physical and price contingencies.
1.06      This report was prepared on information provided by the Yugoslav
authorities, the railways, and Transmark, and on the findings of several Bank
missions since 1971, including the appraisal mission which visited Yugoslavia
in December 1973, composed of Messrs. V. Wouters (Economist), L.L. Alston
(Engineer), and R.W. MacDonald (Financial Analyst).
II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.  The System
2.01      Yugoslavia's transportation system is extensive and diversified,
comprising 10,400 km of standard and narrow gauge railways; 96,000 km of
roads; a sizeable network of inland and coastal waterways; 5 major ports
on the Adriatic 1/; and 15 airports, 10 of which handle international flights.
The country's topography influenced the shape of this system in that the main
inland routes follow the easy paths and avoid the coastal and southern moun-
tains. Hence, the main routes and major traffic flows run northwest to south-
east, mainly from Ljubljana via Zagreb and Belgrade to Skopje. For historical
reasons, the system is more developed in the northern part of the country.
2.02      Major objectives of post-war transport policy were to provide better
access to the lesser developed regions in the south and to the Adriatic, and
to improve the roads to Western Europe. Other objectives were to increase
1/ Koper, Rijeka, Split, Ploce, and Bar.



-3-
the capacity of the existing system and to improve the quality of services.
These objectives have not yet been fully realized. Major projects to fill
gaps in the system are still in preparation or under construction, and much
remains to be done: in general, the railways offer slow service and lack
sufficient capacity; many roads are below standard for the traffic they carry;
and additional port capacity and new facilities are required to handle the
expected increase in traffic and containers.
2.03      Transport demand expanded rapidly during the past decade (para.
2.04), while the authorities gave relatively low priority and insufficient
funds to transport investments: their share 1/ declined from 3.5% of Gross
Material Product 2/ and 21.9% of total economic investments 3/ during 1955-59,
to 2.7% and 17.6%o respectively during 1965-69. The authorities are aware
that insufficient investment in the transport sector may impede economic
growth and are prepared to give transport investments higher priority, as
evidenced by their current support for the railways' investment plans.
B.   The Market
2.04      From 1960 to 1970, passenger traffic increased at an annual rate of
over 10% and freight traffic at 7%, while GNP grew at about 6% and per capita
income at about 5%. For details see Annex 2. These relationships are compa-
rable to those in other countries with similar growth. During this period,
the transport market underwent drastic changes requiring the railways to make
adjustments in a relatively short period. Passenger and freight transport
by road increased at annual rates of 21% and 20%, respectively, while railway
passenger traffic stagnated and freight traffic increased only 2.5% annually.
As a result, road transport replaced rail transport as the dominant mode and
the railways' share in the passenger market declined from 67% to 25% and in
the freight market from 74% to 47%.
C.   Policy and Coordination
2.05      Yugoslavia's transport policies and their implementation have
changed frequently and significantly since World War II, primarily as a
result of wider economic and institutional reforms. The main tenets of
these policies are: freedom of choice by users; free entry into the sector;
competition in the market; and equal pricing treatment by Government requiring
all modes to cover their infrastructure costs. At present, the Yugoslav
system is characterized by decentralized authority and autonomous transport
enterprises under workers' management, operating in a market economy. SFRY
control over the railways is now limited principally to freight tariffs and
1/   Excluding purchases of road motor vehicles.
2/   A Yugoslav economic index, similar to GNP, which excludes certain pro-
fessional and public services such as administration, defense and
education.
3/   Excluding investment in housing, public buildings, and other projects

- 4 -
international relations. Decisions by the SFRY are taken in agreement with
the SRs and SLPs which now have principal governmental responsibility,
including financing of railway deficits and part of their investments and
providing other support.
2.06      Economic reforms have promoted transport growth (para 2.04), but
also have caused initial difficulties. Following decentralization, SFRY
stiff responsible for the transport sector was substantially reduced, with-
out corresponding increases in staff of the SRs and SAPs, and transport issues
did not always receive sufficient attention. This aggravated the railways'
problems, especially since tariffs remained under SFRY control while the SRs
and SAPs had difficulty in mobilizing funds to reimburse losses and to finance
investments and working capital. Also, changes in transport policy made it
difficult for the railways to prepare realistic investment, financing, and
operational plans. A particular difficulty was the absence of firm institu-
tional arrangements for financing transport infrastructure. Finally, the
reforms favored road transport, notably diesel trucks.
2.07      The reforms were intended gradually to transform the railways from
"public" into "economic" enterprises. But while all Governments expected the
railways to operate with minimum support, they continued to restrict tariffs
and to require them to render some social services below cost. The railways'
financial situation suffered and substantial assistance from SRs and SAPs be-
came necessary. The railways now wish to move toward a situation of finan-
cial viability. For their part, all Governments realize that the railways
must solve a number of critical-problems before they can achieve such via-
bility and that, in the interim, the railways will continue to need consid-
erable support.
2.08      Following discussions with the Bank, the Yugoslav authorities have
made significant progress in tackling these problems. A SFRY Secretariat for
Transport and Communications was established in December 1971, and its staff
has been strengthened. Most SRs and SAPs have established similar secretariats
and/or have appointed additional staff to deal with transport matters. Since
1971, all Governments have given considerable attention to the transport sec-
tor and important measures have already been taken, or are being considered,
for improving the general transport situation, including in 1973 a major
financial support program for the railways (para 5.03). A transport coor-
dination study to determine appropriate user charges for road transport and
to establish fair competitive conditions with rail transport is now being
revised to take into account the recent increase in crude oil prices. Finally,
the SRs and SAPs are considering arrangements for providing more ample funds
for transport investments. Despite this progress, the problems are far from
solved and further improvements being discussed with the Yugoslav authorities
concern the strengthening of staff and measures for improving the preparation,
planning, coordination and financing of transport investments.
D.   Previous Projects
2.09      The proposed project would be the fourth for railways and the
eleventh in the transport sector. The Bank has lent US$394.4 million to



-5-
the transport sector, including US$155 million for three railways projects,
US$180 million for six highway projects, and US$59.4 million for the
Naftagas project. Annex 1 gives details of these projects.
III. THE RAILWAYS
A.   General
3.01      Railway organization in Yugoslavia is unique.  Five separate and
independent Railway Transport Enterprises (RTEs) form the Community of
Yugoslav Railways (CYR), each serving a Republic and named after its capi-
tal city, except for Belgrade RTE which serves SR Montenegro, SAP Vojvodina
and SAP Kosovo as well as SR Serbia.
3.02      RTEs operate commercially, with CYR coordinating joint decisions
(paras 3.03 and 3.04). They vary considerably in size as shown in Annex 3.
Belgrade is the largest RTE, with six times the length of line and about ten
times the traffic and staff of Skopje, the smallest. Belgrade and Zagreb
together account for over 60% of total activity. Traffic densities are highest
for Zagreb and Ljubljana, serving the more developed regions. The RTEs' sub-
sidiary interests include road transport, tourist offices, hotels, restau-
rants, and research and design institutes. Sarajevo operates the port of
Ploce.
B.   Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR)
3.03      Three-quarters of traffic is inter-enterprise, so that operations
are highly interdependent. RTEs have, by law, established the CYR, which
serves as a forum for common decisions and as an executing agency for joint
operations (for example: timetables, wagon utilization, and revenue distri-
bution). It also represents RTEs at SFRY and international levels and sets
safety and technical standards.
3.04      Following decentralization (para 2.05) the CYR's role diminished.
But recently, with Bank support, it has been made more active, particularly
in planning and in Federal discussions of government assistance. The RTEs
have concluded a self-management agreement enabling CYR to increase its
planning, research, and marketing activities, and to define common objectives.
The RTEs have also agreed to entrust CYR with the administration of the pro-
posed loan, reporting on the project and coordination of technical assistance
and staff training, and that for these purposes CYR should establish a panel
of technical specialists drawn from its own staff, or seconded from other
RTEs, or recruited locally. Establishment of this panel is a condition of
loan effectiveness.

C.   Organization, Management, and Staff
(a)  Or. anization
3.05      Each RTE is organized under the Yugoslav system of workers' self-
management, responsibility being delegated as far as possible to its con-
stituent units. Internal organization is complex and differs between RTEs.
Reorganizations have been frequent and one is currently in progress to
strengthen the autonomy of constituent units. Broadly, each RTE has a di-
rector-general and three to five assistants responsible for central service
departments and operational units. Each RTE and constituent unit has a
workers' council to which management is responsible. The Sarajevo organi-
zation for 1973 is shown in the Chart. Central service departments include
marketing, finance, planning, major investments, and personnel. Operational
units, called "pogons", cover traffic, maintenance, and subsidiary activities.
Some pogons, responsible for subsidiary activities or undertaking a substan-
tial amount of work for other non-railway organizations, are virtually inde-
pendent and account for about 10% of staff.
(b) Management
3.06      Management and decision-making are complex processes, with exten-
sive interaction and consultations between managements and workers' councils.
Mainagement is technically competent and planning and marketing are being
strengthened considerably. Management support staff is reasonably qualified,
but insufficient, mainly because of recruitment difficulties; this is being
partly remedied by integrating the railways' computer centers into the planning
process and efforts are being made to make job offers more attractive.
3.07      Responsibility for executing investments has been dispersed among
specialized pogons, whose activities have been coordinated by the central
service departments. To increase the effectiveness of project management,
the RTEs have agreed that in appropriate cases interdependent works, such as
electrification and track overhaul on a section of line, shall be grouped
into projects with an officer appointed for each project, responsible for
satisfactory execution in accordance with specifications, within budget and
time schedules. Agreement has been reached on a list of works (Annex 4) which
will be managed in this way.
(c) Staff
3.08      Between 1965 and 1972 railway staff decreased by 16,000 to about
120,000 (Annex 5) due partly to transfer of certain work and staff to
independent pogons. From 1972 to 1977, the RTEs have estimated that invest-
ments and organizational changes, after allowing for traffic growth, should
result in a net reduction of nearly 13,000 posts (Annex 6). Closure of
uneconomic lines could, in addition, result in up to 11,000 surplus posts
with a small surplus also resulting from closure of uneconomic services
(para 3.26). To resolve the resulting staff surplus, the RTEs are preparing
retraining and support programs. Implementation of these programs has already
started and resulted in staff reductions of nearly 3,000 in 1973.



-7-
3.09      Many of the staff holding potentially surplus posts can be re-
trained to fill other vacancies in the RTEs. Normal wastage, as a result
of staff retiring and leaving for other jobs, should create about 15,000
vacancies from 1972 to 1977. Time will be needed to retrain personnel to
fill vacancies so that the reduction in staff will be somewhat slower than
the reduction in posts, but' the RTEs believe that, with the assistance of SRs
and SAPs, they will be able to retrain staff and discharge any remaining
surplus with a delay of one to two years.
3.10      During loan negotiations, the RTEs agreed to use their best efforts
to achieve staff reductions from the 1972 level, of at least 6,000 by 1975
and a further 4,000 by 1977 (Annex 6), excluding those from closures of lines
and services. They also agreed to achieve further reductions according to
closures of uneconomic lines within two years of decisions to close. The SRs
and SAPs have also given assurances that they will assist the railways in
resolving any staff surpluses in excess of the railways' absorptive capacity.
3.11      Based on preliminary forecasts of staff requirements, the RTEs have
agreed to use their best efforts to attain the staff productivity targets
shown in Annex 7. Overall productivity increased 17% between 1967 and 1972,
and should increase 20% between 1972 and 1975, and 40% between 1972 and 1977.
D.   Railway Property
(a) The Network
3.12      In 1973, the RTEs had 10,400 route km of railway (Annex 5), 90%
standard gauge (7% double track) and 10% narrow gauge. The track has dete-
riorated for some years because less than half the necessary 700 km annual
rehabilitation has been achieved. Speed restrictions of 60 km/hr or less
have been imposed over a third of the network, and only about 10% is suitable
for 100 km/hr. To improve the situation, the RTEs have agreed to prepare a
comprehensive plan for track rehabilitation, as part of their Action Plans
(para. 4.19).
3.13      About a fifth of the network is electrified, including most of the
international line traversing Yugoslavia; electrification is in progress on
a gap of about 250 km. Modern signalling equipment has been installed on
electrified lines, or is being installed under the 1964 Modernization Program.
Most of the remainder of the railway still has mechanical signalling, substan-
tially the same as 40 years ago. As part of their Action Plans (para. 4.19)
the RTEs have agreed to prepare comprehensive signalling plans.
(b) Traction and Rolling Stock
3.14      In 1973, the RTEs had 758 diesel and 301 electric locomotives,
procured mostly since 1965 (Annex 5). However, 757 steam locomotives (42%
of which were over 40 years old) still formed over 40% of the fleet of 1,816
but hauled only 16% of gross m ton-km. Steam traction is being phased out,
but some is expected to remain in service after 1977.



- 8 -
3.15      The railways purchased about 13,000 freight cars between 1965 and
1973 to replace some 26,000 older, smaller-capacity cars. This reduced the
fleet to alntt 59,000, but increased capacity from 1.48 to 1.75 million m
tons. During the same period, some 800 new passenger cars were procured and
1,600 withdrawn, reducing the fleet to about 3,700. Nevertheless, 36% of
freight cars and 6% of passenger cars were over 40 years old. The Investment
Plan contains extensive provision for new traction and rolling stock, summa-
rized in Annex 8. As part of their Action Plans, the RTEs will prepare Trac-
tion Plans and Rolling Stock Plans for optimizing the utilization and procure-
ment of equipment (para. 4.20).
E.   Operations
3.16      Although most traffic passes through more than one RTE, locomotive
scheduling and wagon distribution is carried out mainly to suit the owning
RTE rather than to reduce overall costs. CYR coordinates inter-enterprise
use and should evaluate the substantial overall economies which appear possi-
ble. Annex 5 contains selected operating statistics for CYR. During loan
negotiations, the RTEs agreed to use their best efforts to achieve agreed
operating targets (para 4.20).
3.17      The availability of diesel and electric locomotives is rather low,
having declined from 84% 1/ and 83% respectivelin 1970 to 78% and 75% in
1973. Low availability is due to technical factors and to a shortage of
spares resulting from a lack of working capital. The RTEs have agreed to
prepare a Workshop Plan, including a study of workshop facilities and main-
tenance procedures, and this will be used to set availability targets for
1977 (para. 4.19). Utilization of electric locomotives (km per day) has
increased continuously with the extension of electrification, and has
increased also for diesel locomotives in 1973 after some decline in earlier
years. While overall utilization is satisfactory (Annex 5), there is consi-
derable variation among RTEs and a review of locomotive scheduling will be
included in the Traction Plan.
3.18      Between 1965 and 1973, new and larger freight cars increased the
average load per freight car loaded by 29% and net m ton-km per freight car
by 36% but the net m ton-km per m ton of fleet capacity declined by 6%. Turn-
around time of wagons, though reasonable at 5.6 days in 1973, has deteriorated
from 4.3 days in 1965 due to customer retention and line delays but should
be improved significantly by completion of track and marshalling yard works
included in the project. The average speed of passenger trains increased by
17% between 1965 and 1973, mainly as a result of improvements in locomotives
and rolling stock and modernization of certain sections of main lines. Pro-
ductivity compares satisfactorily, with other European railways, as shown in
Annex 9.
1/   Standard gauge diesels.



-9-
F.   Tariffs
3.19      Freight rates are controlled by SFRY, which establishes their
average level in agreement with SRs and SAPs and passenger fares are con-
trolled by the SRs and SAPs. Freight rates are broadly related to average
cost of service but passenger fares are priced below cost. Uniform basic
freight rates and passenger fares are adjusted for each RTE, according to
a mutually agreed system of coefficients, to take into account variations
in costs and traffic densities. The system was established on 1968 data,
which may not fully reflect current cost and market trends. Coefficients
for freight vary between 0.97 and 1.15 and for passengers between 1.00 and
1.27. Further coefficients within each RTE take into account traffic densities
on specific lines and vary between 0.90 and 1.40. The CYR is reviewing current
data with a view to updating the system, but: any changes are not expected to
affect total revenues significantly during the project period.
3.20      Standard freight rates are sharply increased for less than full
wagon-loads and varying discounts are granted for specific large contracts.
For passenger fares, first class is double standard class and various discounts
are granted for students, workers, invalids, and other groups, with 20% re-
ductions for round trips.
3.21      Government controls have tended to keep average railway revenues
depressed. Since 1964 average revenue per traffic unit 1/, in real terms,
has fallen 10%, compared to about 5% for corresponding expenditures. Although
the railways made a small profit in 1964, depreciation was inadequate and
tariffs were insufficient to provide a reasonable surplus towards development.
The subsequent fall in average revenue per traffic unit added significantly
to the financial difficulties of the railways in recent years. To ensure
success of the new Five-Year Development Plan the Bank has obtained assu-
rances on appropriate tariff increases which should provide the required in-
ternal resources for financing the project (para 4.01).
G.   Traffic Forecasts
3.22      Railway freight is expected to reach 25.6 billion ton-km and pas-
senger traffic 12.0 billion pass-km by 1977 (Annex 10), including traffic to
be generated by the opening of the new Belgrade-Bar line in 1976. Forecast
average annual increases during 1974-77 of 5.8% for freight and 3.2% for pas-
sengers (5.2% and 2.2% excluding Belgrade-Bar) compare with 4.6% and 0.5% for
the past six years.
3.23      A 5.8% increase in rail freight is considered reasonable.  The
railways' intensive marketing efforts are beginning to show results. The
increase in freight tariffs was 6.7% in 1973, and was even higher during the
first three months of 1974. Furthermore, 60% of the traffic increases fore-
cast for major commodities on the existing system have already been contracted.
1/   Total traffic units are the sum of net m ton-kms and pass-kms.



- 10 -
Also, railway costs will be less affected than road transport costs by the
energy crisis, which should enable them to strengthen somewhat their compe-
titive pos tion.  Finally, the forecasts exclude any traffic which the rail-
ways may recover when the Suez Canal is re-opened.
3.24      A 3.2% annual increase in passenger traffic during 1974-77, although
high compared with the increases in past years, is considered attainable. Over
one-third of the increase is attributable to the opening of the Belgrade-Bar
line and the remainder to improvements in the quality of services as moderni-
zation proceeds, including the introduction of faster long-distance trains.
The railways expect that with better marketing they will be able to attract
part of the expected expansion in the passenger market, including foreign
tourists and migrant workers. Whether they will succeed is somewhat uncertain,
because it is not yet possible to ascertain firmly what effects the energy
crisis will have on foreign tourism and the movement of migrant workers.
3.25      Although CYR has issued a common methodology, RTEs' forecasts vary
in analytical quality and data bases. Action Plans require further improve-
ment of forecasting, including market research and planning, and a greater
role for CYR, especially in collecting more comprehensive and reliable data
and in coordinating forecasts for inter-enterprise and international traffic.
H.  Uneconomic Lines and Services
3.26      The railways have closed about 1,500 km of uneconomic lines since
1965 and have identified a further 2,700 km to be reviewed for closure before
the end of 1977 (Annex 11). There are also some uneconomic passenger services
operated over otherwise economic lines; these services are being studied by
the RTEs, which eliminated over 70 unprofitable trains from the timetable
in 1973. The Social Agreement now being considered (para 4.01) provides that
CYR will complete the methodology for review of these lines and that the RTEs,
SRs, and SAPs should reach agreement on the closure of such lines, or their
retention with compensation. The CYR has agreed to send the completed methodo-
logy for review to the Bank.
IV. THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.   General
4.01      The 1973-77 Development Plans of the five RTEs comprise Investment
and corresponding Financing Plans as well as Action Plans for improving
their organization and operations. They have been coordinated by the CYR
and approved by the SRs and SAPs concerned; they were adjusted early in
1974 for the effects of the energy crisis and their approval by the workers'
councils and authorities, as necessary, is a condition of loan effectiveness.
A key element for their success is appropriate government support. Part of
this support has already been enacted (para 5.03), and the SFRY and/or the
SRS and SAPs have agreed to approve appropriate tariffs and other measures
to ensure that the railways would be able to finance about 33% of their
investments under the project from their own funds in accordance with the



- 11 -
Financing Plan. In this latter respect, the Federal Office for the Market
and Prices (representing SFRY), the Federal Chamber of Economy (representing
the most important users of railway services), and the railways are preparing
a Social Agreement, which will provide general principles on which to base
future tariff increases as well as arrangements for decisions by the SRs, SAPs,
and municipalities on the closure of uneconomic lines. Signing of the Agree-
ment is a condition of loan effectiveness. Meantime, the authorities have
approved an increase of 21.8% in tariffs, effective from May 24, 1974 for
freight and June 1, 1974 for passengers. As a result, the railways expect to
earn an overall net surplus and to balance their financing plan during the
current year.
4.02      The project to be financed under the proposed loan consists of a
three-year slice, 1974-76, of the 1973-77 Investment Plan. Within this proj-
ect, the proposed loan would be disbursed against expenditures after June 30,
1974 for completing the 1964 Modernization Program, certain closely related
investments, and technical assistance and staff training. To ensure the timely
execution of the Project, the authorities have agreed, in addition to the
tariff increases mentioned in para 4.01, to:
(i)  participate with their own funds in financing agreed
percentages of the cost of completing the 1964 Moderni-
zation Program and the related investments;
(ii)  provide the funds, as necessary for timely completion of
the 1964 Modernization Program and the related investments
in case of any unexpected shortfall in their financing; and
(iii)  use their best efforts to provide the funds, or cause the
funds to be provided, necessary for completing the entire
Project, whenever there is reasonable cause to believe
that the railways will have insufficient funds to do so.
B.   Five-Year Investment Plan, 1973-77
4.03      Total investments for 1973-77 (Annex 12) are estimated at ND 26.8
billion (US$1,763 million), including a foreign exchange component of ND 11.6
billion (US$764 million) and ND 6.9 billion (US$455 million) contingencies
for physical quantities and price escalation (para 4.11). The Plan excludes
about ND 1.9 billion (US$125 million) required to complete the Belgrade-Bar
line, which is being separately financed under Loan 531-YU.
4.04      The main components of the Plan and their costs, excluding contin-
gencies, are as follows. Fixed installations on existing lines will amount
to ND 8.9 billion (US$582 million), or 45% of the Plan. This item covers:
(i) the balance of investments required to complete the 1964 Modernization
Program of main lines, primarily electrification, signalling, telecommunica-
tion and marshalling yard works; (ii) other fixed investments on existing
lines including (a) capital overhaul and reconstruction of lines, (b) electri-
fication signalling and telecommunications outside the Modernization Program,



- 12 -
and (c) reconstruction of stations, notably Skopje station. Item (ii) includes
investments related to the 1964 Modernization Program. Locomotives and rol-
ling stock account for ND 7.7 billion (US$506 million), or 39% of the Plan
(Annex 8). Other investments in existing lines include integral transport
and workshop equipment, and account for ND 1.7 billion (US$113 million), or
9% of the Plan. New construction accounts for ND 1.6 billion (US$106 million),
or 8% of the Plan. This covers three short lines, another two lines in
Macedonia to neighboring countries, from Kicevo to the Albanian border and
from Beljakovec to the Bulgarian border, which are to be started in 1977 (if
justified), and relocation of Belgrade station (para 6.09).
4.05      The Investment Plan for 1973-77 has been prepared within the frame-
work of a "rolling" system of planning, which the RTEs have decided to adopt
at the end of 1974. Within this system, the plans will be adjusted and ex-
tended each year. Within the Plan, investments are reasonably firm except
for some later items dependent on the technical/economic studies, listed in
Table 2 of Annex 17, which the RTEs have agreed to carry out and to submit
for review to the Bank. Although the "rolling" system of planning allows
some flexibility to take into account unforeseen developments, the intention
is to keep changes in the timing of investments to a minimum.  Accordingly,
the RTEs have agreed to make no material reductions in the project without
the approval of the Bank and to make no material additions unless: appropriate
technical/economic studies will have been completed; the additions are not
likely to affect the ability of any RTE to carry out its obligations under
the loan, including the timely completion of the project; and the Bank has had
an opportunity to comment on such additions. The Bank will also be consulted
on the annual revisions of the Plan.
C.   Three-Year Project, 1974-76, and Investments Selected for Bank Financing

4.07      The total cost of the project is estimated at ND 17.3 billion
-(US$1,139 million), including a foreign exchange component of ND 7.6 billion
(US$503 million).
4.08      Within this project, the proposed loan would be allocated and dis-
bursed against expenditures after June 30, 1974 for specific investments:
(i)  completion of the 1964 Modernization Program, including
remaining program sections of electrification, signalling
and telecommunications, and marshalling yards;
(ii)  Related Investments, which are investments necessary to
realize the full benefits of the 1964 Modernization Program,
and consist mainly of track rehabilitation, further signalling,
and modernization of the Sarajevo junction; and
(iii)  staff training and technical assistance by foreign consultants
to assist CYR and RTEs, notably in preparing successive five-year
plans and, as necessary, the feasibility and technical/economic
studies listed in Table 2 of Annex 17.
Agreement has been reached with CYR and RTEs on the total loan allocation.
The major components of technical assistance and staff training were determined,
but CYR has still to review the manpower inputs by consultants for each compo-
nent in order to prepare detailed terms of reference in cooperation with the
Bank.
4.09      The total cost of the investments indicated in para 4.08 is esti-
mated at US$232 million. Assuming the most probable mix of local and
domestic contracts, the foreign exchange component is US$100 million; this
would fall to about US$92 million if local suppliers won all bids for which
they are likely to compete, and would rise to about US$110 million if foreign
suppliers won all bids. The estimates are summarized on page 15 and shown
in detail in Annex 14.

4.10      Cost estimates for the specific investments selected for disbursing
the loan are based either on contracts already let under the 1964 Moderniza-
tion Program, or on unit prices for similar works in Yugoslavia backed where
appropriate by detailed engineering studies. The cost of technical assistance
and staff training is estimated on man-months and current charges for such
services. For other investments in the project the cost of civil works has
been estimated mainly from preliminary engineering data and unit prices, and
locomotives and rolling stock from recent contracts.
4.11      Cost estimates were based on 1972 prices which were revised for
inflation in 1973. Physical contingencies of about 10% were included in the
Project and the Plan for all items, except for those items with a particularly
firm limit on quantities, almost exclusively locomotives and rolling stock.
Price contingencies were included for all items not contracted at fixed price.
These contingencies allow for the effects of the energy crisis and amount to
15%, 12%, 10% and 10% for 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977, respectively, for both
foreign and domestic costs.
E.   Financing Plans
4.12      The railways have made great efforts to prepare realistic Financing
Plans, which are further explained in Chapter V. Briefly, identified resources
cover the project fully and 95% of the investments in the Plan. These resources
include secured loans, the proposed loan and related SR and SAP participations,
suppliers' credits, and the railways' internal funds, based on the assurances
given by the Yugoslav authorities (para 4.01). Internal funds are expected



- 16 -
to finance an increasing proportion of the investments, rising from 25% in
1974 to 42% in 1977, averaging 33% for the Project period.
4.13      Financing of the project is summarized below:

4.14      For 1977, the final year of the Five-Year Plan period, finance still
to be identified amounts to 21% of the planned expenditure for that year but
only 5% of the five-year total. The railways are actively seeking other do-
mestic and foreign loans and credits for this purpose, including further assis-
tance from the Bank in 1977. In any event, some will have to be sought later
especially for certain projects dependent on the satisfactory outcome of the
technical/economic studies.
F.  The Loan
(a) Disbursements
4.15      The proposed loan of US$93 million equivalent would finance about
8% of the project cost and 40% of the cost of investments selected for dis-
bursing the loan. The allocation of the loan to specific investments has been
based on the following considerations. The loan would finance 40% of the
expenditure for completing the 1964 Modernization Program. This is in line
with the procedure under Loan 395-YU, which financed 38% of the expenditure
on that program. Since most of the works have been started and many are
approaching completion, it would be impracticable to change the method of fi-
nancing. The new percentage, although higher than before, is lower than the
foreign exchange component, estimated at 47%. For Related Investments, the



- 17 -
loan would finance in full the procurement cost 1/ of selected equipment and
materials suitable for ICB. The loan would also finance in full the foreign
exchange cost of technical assistance and staff training.
(b) Lending Arrangements
4.16      The proposed loan would be guaranteed by the Federal Government
and would be made to CYR for a 25-year term, including 3 years of grace. Of
the loan, US$92.3 million would be transferred to the five RTEs by Subsidiary
Agreements on terms and conditions similar to those of the loan. The balance
of US$0.7 million would be for technical assistance and staff training, and
would be allocated initially to the CYR and transferred later to the RTEs
if and when necessary. The allocation of the loan, shown in Annex 15 and
summarized below, was discussed and agreed with CYR and RTEs:
Allocation                     US$ million
RTE
Belgrade                                        36.2
Zagreb                                          25.7
Ljubljana                                       11.3
Sarajevo                                        10.2
Skopje                                           8.9
Sub-total                               92.3
Technical assistance and staff training          0.7
Total                                   93.0
4.17      Annex 16 shows the estimated schedule of disbursements.  Surplus
funds remaining in the Loan Account after completion of the Bank-financed
investments would be used for other items in the Investment Plan which are
suitable for international competitive bidding (ICB), subject to review and
approval by the Bank.
4.18      A condition of loan effectiveness is that all Agreements have been
duly executed and authorized or ratified by all necessary Governmental and
Corporate action and shall be in full force and effect. It is estimated that
150 days will elapse between loan signature and effectiveness.
G. Action Plans
4.19      Railway decisions may involve SFRY, SR and SAP authorities, CYR and
each RTE (and its departments), and outside organizations like the Chambers
of Economy. The Action Plans are therefore important instruments for reaching
common understanding by all concerned on objectives and responsibilities, and
1/   c.i.f. landed cost of imports or ex-factory price of domestic purchase.



- 18 -
the measures and time required for their achievement. They are also important
for extending the planning process within RTEs and beyond. The Action Plans
address themselves to improvements in organization, planning, investments,
marketing, productivity, information systems, finance, Government support,
staff training, and technical assistance. Annex 17 describes the subjects to
be covered. Each RTE has detailed plans.
4.20      Action Plans are essential to successful realization of the Invest-
ment and Financing Plans and, in return for their support, the Governments
expect the railways to improve their operations in accordance with these
Plans. CYR and the RTEs have given assurances that they will implement and
update them regularly, institute appropriate monitoring systems, and submit
to the Bank annual reports on progress and revisions. Furthermore, the RTEs
have agreed to use their best efforts to achieve quantified operational targets
and to undertake, in collaboration as appropriate with each other and CYR,
certain technical/economic studies to improve the utilization of assets and
to serve as a basis for investment (Tables 1 and 2, Annex 17).
H.   Implementation
4.21      Responsibility.  Each RTE will be responsible for executing its
part of the project, while technical assistance and staff training will be
made available to or through CYR, which will be responsible for loan admin-
istration. During negotiations, it was agreed that CYR will establish a
panel of experts to assist in loan administration (para 3.04), and an informal
understanding was reached on detailed reporting requirements. An informal
understanding was reached also on the detailed composition of the 1964 Moderni-
zation Program, and this should avoid changes which occurred previously (Annex 1,
paras 11 and 13). CYR and RTEs gave assurances that consultants ffor technical
assistance and staff training will be employed in accordance with "Uses of
Consultants by the World Bank and its Borrowers" and that qualified counter-
parts will be appointed.
4.22      Procurement. - The completion of existing contracts for the 1964
Modernization Program, placed in accordance with procedures agreed for
Loan 395-YU, would be eligible for Bank financing and would account for
about US$28 million 1/ of the proposed loan. Some contracts remaining for
that Program and still to be placed amounting to about US$6 million 1/ of
the loan would not be suitable for ICB, because of standardization with
existing equipment and the need for integration with existing operations.
4.23      New contracts amounting to about US$30 million 1/ of the loan would
be awarded following international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement". Domestic firms would be permitted to
participate in the bidding and would be accorded a preference of 15% or the
1/   Excluding contingencies.

customs duty, whichever i8 lower. Minor contracts, up to US$100,000 for civil
works including the installation of electrification equipment, and up to
$15,000 for equipment, totalling not more than US$1.2 million 1/ of the loan
would be placed according to the railways' normal procedures, which are satis-
factory to the Bank. Foreign suppliers are well represented by local agents
and would participate in biddings.
V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   General
5.01      Railway accounts are well kept by RTEs on a Government-prescribed
basis with routine work increasingly computerized. Financial and cash con-
trols have not been adequate, however, particularly for control of major in-
vestments affected by serious inflation and general illiquidity. Technical
assistance and staff training to overcome this deficiency is included in the
project.
5.02      To help provide adequate internal funds for investment, the Govern-
ments and the railways have recognized that depreciation charges must keep
pace with inflation and be more closely related to the economic lives of the
assets. Hitherto "straight-line" depreciation has been charged on the basis
of rather long lives and on the basis of five-year revaluation of replacement
costs. However, according to the new depreciation law, effective January 1,
1974, interim annual increases will now be obtained by applying appropriate
price factors pending periodic revaluations and the estimated service lives
of assets will be reduced to satisfactory levels. Depreciation for 1974 at
ND 2.8 billion (US$185 million) compares with ND 1.8 billion (US$117 million)
for 1973 and will increase to about ND 4.0 billion (US$263 million) by 1977
(Annex 19).
5.03      When it became clear that the 1964 Modernization Program could
not be completed on time and as the railways' financial position worsened,
culminating in a deficit of ND 750 million (US$49 million) for 1972 (Annex 19),
the Yugoslav authorities agreed, at the Bank's suggestion, to undertake subs-
tantial support measures for the railways. Measures already described include
reimbursement of losses on uneconomic lines (para 3.26), regulated tariff
increases (para 4.01), direct contributions by the Republics to the Invest-
ment Plan (para 4.02), and improved depreciation (para 5.02). Additional
measures authorized or under consideration are as follows:

B.   Past Financial Performance
5.04      Forecasts made for Loans 395-YU and 531-YU have not been achieved,
mainly because railway freight and passenger traffic have been less than ex-
pected and freight rates and passenger fares have not kept pace with inflation
(para 3.21). The forecasts for the 1964 and 1968 loans compare with actual
net surpluses (deficits) 1/ as follows:

5.05      Instead of the forecast surpluses, deficits have been incurred for
three out of the past six years. The appraisal in 1964 forecast for 1968 a
CYR operating ratio 1/ of 85 and a return on average net fixed assets in use
of 5.5%, but actual results were 102 and -0.8Z. The appraisal in 1968 fore-
cast for 1973 80 and 6.7% compared with actuals of 96 and 1.5%. Forecasts
for each RTE were not included in previous appraisal reports but performance
was below expectations for all RITEs. Annex 20 summarizes CYR's income ac-
counts for 1968-73.
C.   Forecast Financial Performance
5.06      The principal criteria used in preparing the financial forecasts for
1974-77 are summarized below; the main assumptions on which they are based
are given in Annex 21. Revenues reflect 1974 tariffs and proposed changes
in 1975 and 1976 (para 4.01) and forecast traffic levels (para 3.23). Work-
ing expenses are adjusted for inflation at rates assumed for price contin-
gencies on capital expenditure (para 4.11) and reflect extensive Government
support measures (para 5.03). After interest, forecast net surpluses (def-
icits) and principal ratios in 1974-77 are summarized below, based on the
detailed financial projections in Annexes 19 and 20.

All RTEs are expected to achieve surpluses from 1974 onward, reflecting sig-
nificant increases in traffic (particularly bulk) and opening in 1976 of the
Belgrade-Bar line. The Bank has obtained assurances from CYR and the RTEs
that they will use their best efforts to achieve the target operating ratios
corresponding to forecast results.

For both the project and the plan periods RTEs' gross internal resources com-
prise more than half of the total cash availability and net internal resources,
after meeting debt service and working capital requirements, should finance
about 30% of capital investment. The validity of the forecasts for internal
resources is of critical importance, particularly because a shortfall in
internal funds was one of the main causes of the difficulties encountered
by the previous project.
5.08      SRs and SAPs have agreed to ensure by tariff increases or other
means that RTEs would be able to generate their necessary internal funds
(para. 4.01). They also agreed to continue the practice of reimbursing
deficits (after interest) which, although not forecast, might still occur
from time to time in some RTEs notwithstanding tariff and other decisions
taken on a national basis. Consequently, for the project, almost 90% of
gross internal resources will be assured in the form of depreciation (72%),
net revenues at least sufficient to cover interest charges (15%), and other
own funds (2%). The remaining 10% is considered to be within the earning
capacity of the RTEs and consistent with the target rates of return on net
fixed assets (para. 5.11).
5.09      External resources for the 1974-76 project have either been secured
or are firmly in prospect and there is no unidentified financing gap. Apart
from suppliers' credits to be obtained as and when bids for equipment are
issued, the remaining unsecured finance amounting to about 7% of expenditure
will come from domestic bank loans for which approvals have been obtained in
principle, but which must await formal approval under the banks' 1975 and
1976 lending programs. Similar considerations apply to the 1973-77 plan
period, but in addition, there is a financing gap of about 5% of total plan
expenditure occurring entirely in 1977. To fill this gap, the railways
expect to receive further assistance from the Bank and are actively pursuing
other possible sources of finance for the successive five-year plans to be
prepared under the rolling system of planning. The average debt service
coverage from internal funds was 1.5 for CYR in 1973, but coverage should
improve to 2.4 in 1977 as a result of the forecast increases in internal
funds. However, since the RTEs have tended to rely increasingly on shorter
term loans and suppliers' credits, agreement was reached with all RTEs to
limit future borrowings to the extent necessary to ensure that their obliga-
tions under the loan would not be materially and adversely affected. In
addition, they undertook to consult the Bank before undertaking any borrowings
in the years 1974 to 1977 which might not conform to the debt limitation ratios
agreed for each RTE (Annex 19).
E.   Balance Sheet
5.10      Actual results for 1972, provisional results for 1973 and forecasts
for 1976 and 1977 (the end of the project and plan periods) are summarized

A debt/equity ratio of 31/69 for CYR in 1977 is satisfactory. The proportion
of debt to equity will increase in all RTEs, but will still be acceptable;
Annex 19 gives details.
5.11      Operating cash and other working capital have been inadequate for
several years due to inflation and general illiquidity in Yugoslavia. They
improved in 1973, when the CYR current ratio 1/ was 2.0 and the liquid ratio 2/
was 1.7, operating cash being 6% and other working capital 23% of cash operat-
ing expenses 3/. The RTEs have agreed that each would use its best efforts
to raise operating cash to not less than 8% and other working capital to not
less than 20% of cash operating expenses by 1977, in order to raise liquidity
to normal operating requirements and to keep pace with inflation.
F.   Financial Rates of Return
5.12      CYR and RTEs, in conjunction with Transmark, estimated the rate of
return on the 1973-77 Investment Plan (excluding new construction) at about
16%. This estimate is dealt with more fully in the Economic Evaluation
(Chapter VI). Rates of return for CYR on net fixed assets are forecast to
increase to about 5.5% in 1977. The Bank obtained assurances that CYR and
the RTEs will use their best efforts to achieve the targets specified in
Annex 19.   Achievement of these targets, together with improved depreciation
arrangements (para 5.02), should enable the RTEs to meet their foreseeable
cash requirements.

G. Audit
5.13      The audit of the RTEs' accounts by the Social Accounting Service
has been limited to verifying that accounts are kept and statements produced
according to the prescribed uniform code. The Bank has received such audited
accounts for 1973. The Bank obtained assurances that both CYR and the RTEs
will have their accounts audited, in accordance with sound auditing principles
consistently applied, by the Social Accounting Service or another competent
and experienced independent auditing organization and that the certified
accounts, together with the auditor's reports, will be submitted to the Bank
within six sionth. of the end of each year.
VI. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
6.01      The railways are a vital part of the transport system (para 2.04)
and continue to render essential services, especially for longer-distance
travellers and bulk freight. The average freight haul exceeds 250 km. In
recent years, the railways have attracted only a modest volume of additional
traffic because of increased competition from other modes, structural changes
in the economy, and insufficient and outdated equipment and infrastructure.
However, prospects are that total transport demand will continue to expand
rapidly and that railways should be able to attract additional passenger
and freight traffic, provided investments are made to reduce their costs
and improve the quality of their services (paras 3.24 and 3.25).
6.02      An important objective of the proposed loan is to help finance es-
sential investments for reducing costs and improving the quality of services.
Another is to support desirable improvements in policy, organization, opera-
tions, investment planning and execution, staffing, and staff training. Fi-
nally, the loan would conform to the Bank's emphasis in lending to Yugoslavia
for infrastructure projects which have less access to domestic capital than
other sectors of the economy.
B.   The Investment Plan, 1973-77
(a) Overall Economic Return
6.03      The railways have made a comprehensive cost/benefit analysis of
the Investment Plan and of its major components for the whole CYR and each
RTE. The overall economic return is about 16% 1/. The rate was calculated
prior to the energy crisis and, therefore, is conservative. The reason is
that railway transport costs are less affected by rising fuel prices than
road transport costs. This should enable the railways to be more competitive
and to attract some additional traffic, which should raise the benefits from
1/   Excluding new construction.



- 26 -
modernization. The methodology and data require further improvement, however.
For example, evaluation of the Plan as a whole has more validity than that of
each major component because railway operations are highly interdependent and
joint costs and benefits had to be allocated on somewhat arbitrary criteria.
Also, the calculations have been made in financial terms, although the results
in economic terms would have been similar because the railways pay relatively
few taxes to be excluded in the economic evaluation. The railways have incor-
porated in their Action Plans measures to improve the evaluation techniques
and methodology. In the absence of meaningful cost benefit studies for each
major component, a qualitative evaluation of the investments in the Plan as
described in para 4.04 follows.
(b) Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
6.04      The main benefits from the investments are:  reduced maintenance
and operating costs, including fuel costs; improved utilization of locomo-
tives and rolling stock; and increased revenue from higher quality services.
The benefits will be widely distributed throughout the country. In the first
instance, railway passengers and users of railway freight services, partic-
ularly producers, shippers, and consumers of bulk freight, will be the prin-
cipal beneficiaries of cost reductions and improved services. The railways
will pass on these benefits to users because of competition from road trans-
port. Where road transport is not a practical alternative, government controls
and other arrangements exist for reaching agreement on equitable tariffs and
thereby on distributing benefits from the investments. The SRs and SAPs will
probably also be important beneficiaries because, without the investments,
rising railway costs would have led to greater deficits and subsidies.
Finally, the railways themselves will benefit from the investments because,
without them, they would have been unable to maintain their position in the
transport market and to achieve a reasonable surplus.
(c) The 1964 Modernization Program
6.05      One of the major objectives of the Investment Plan is to complete
modernization of main lines started in 1964 under Loan 395-YU. These lines
form the backbone of the network, connect the seven largest cities, and
serve about two-thirds of the country's economy and over one-half of its
population. They are of critical importance both for the railways and the
country. In 1964, the Modernization Program was estimated to yield an eco-
nomic return of about 13%, but if it had been possible to foresee delays in
execution, increases in costs, and slower growth of traffic, the economic
return would have been about 9%. These rates were understated, however,
because they did not take into account improved freight services or any
time savings for passengers, and assumed that without the investments the
railways' operating costs would remain constant.
6.06      The main benefits from the balance of investments required to
complete the Modernization Program would accrue from decreased maintenance
and operating costs, better usage of locomotives and rolling stock, fewer
derailments and accidents, and better quality service. They are estimated
to yield an economic return of about 28%, partly because additional benefits



- 27 -
will accrue through system effects as the large investments made previously
are being completed and start yielding their full benefits. For example,
full benefits from electrification will be obtained only after the remaining
sections of main lines have been electrified (para 3.13) and through trains
with lower operating costs have been introduced.
(d) Other Investments in Fixed Installations 1/
6.07      Investments in track overhaul and reconstruction of lines are well
justified because of the lag in track overhaul in past years (para 3.12).
Electrification of some other lines outside the 1964 Modernization Program
may be justified partly through system effects, but the railways have agreed
to prepare appropriate studies before making a final decision on works yet to
be started.  Signalling and telecommunications are justified because existing
equipment is old and inadequate. Construction of the Skopje station is
almost complete and replaces an old station destroyed by an earthquake.
Other investments for the development of container and integral transport
capabilities, which has proceeded slowly, should be accelerated if more funds
can be obtained.
(e) Traction and Rolling Stock
6.08      Much of the traction and rolling stock is old (paras 3.14 and 3.15)
and insufficient at times for the traffic being offered. The Investment
Plan would greatly improve the locomotive and wagon fleet, with benefits
accruing from reduced maintenance and operating costs as well as from higher
train speeds and greater wagon and train loads, and from avoiding shortages
of carrying capacity.
(f) New Lines and Belgrade Station
6.09      Justification of two of the three short lines in the Plan depends
on the mining-industrial ventures which they serve. The third line is as-
sociated with the Belgrade-Bar project; it links this line to another main
line and will save considerable distances for traffic which otherwise would
have to use a circuitous route. Whether the two new lines in Macedonia are
justified remains to be determined; although included in the 1973-77 Invest-
ment Plan, their construction depends on the results of feasibility studies
as well as the availability of finance. The relocation of Belgrade station
outside the downtown area is based on the urban plans and will be financed
by the city.
(g) Technical Assistance and Staff Training
6.10      The technical assistance and training programs are expected to
yield large benefits, principally because the assistance is mainly designed
1/   Including investments related to the 1964 Modernization Program, invest-
ments in other fixed installations, and other miscellaneous investments.



- 28 -
to provide overall guidance to railway staff, who will do most of the de-
tailed work. For example, for feasibility studies the consultants will
provide the methodology and overall guidance, while railway staff will
carry out the detailed work. Consequently, with a minimum input of tech-
nical assistance, considerable improvements will be achieved in determining
optimum investment solutions as well as in overall planning, marketing, fi-
nancial management, and execution of investments. The technical assistance
will provide on-the-job training and the training program will be further
strengthened by appropriate seminars, the appointment of qualified counter-
parts, and better organization of existing training programs. Thus, rail-
way staff will obtain considerable training, at minimum expense, in fields
where the need is greatest.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The Bank has obtained from the SFRY and/or the SRs and SAPs a
number of assurances, the most important of which are that they will:
(a) enable the railways to close uneconomic lines, or pay com-
pensation for any such lines being maintained in operation
(para 3.26);
(b) allow appropriate tariff increases during 1975-76, enabling
the railways to finance from their internal resources agreed
percentages of their investments in accordance with the Fi-
nancing Plans (para 4.01); and
(c) participate in financing the specific investments financed by
the Bank (para 4.02).
7.02      The Yugoslav railways have given assurances that they will:
(a) adopt project management for certain interdependent works,
(para 3.07);
(b) use their best efforts to achieve staff, operational and
financial targets, (paras 3.10, 3.11, 3.16, 5.06, 5.11 and
5.12);
(c) carry out an agreed list of technical/economic studies
(para 4.05);
(d) implement their Investment and Action Plans and revise and
up-date them regularly (paras. 4.05 and 4.20); and
(e) limit the incurrence of new debt to ensure that new borrowings
would not materially and adversely affect the capacity of
any RTE to meet its obligations under the Loan agreements.



- 29 -
If new borrowing would raise the debt service coverage above
the agreed ratios for 1974-76, the RTEs will consult the Bank
prior to such borrowings (para 5.09).
7.03      Conditions of loan effectiveness are that:
(a)  the members of the panel for loan administration (para 3.04)
have taken up their duties;
(b)  the Development Plans have been duly approved by all necessary
governmental authorities, enterprises, or other entities concerned
(para. 4.01);
(c)  the Social Agreement has entered into force and effect for
all RTEs, (para 4.01);
(d)  the Subsidiary Agreements between the Borrower and the RTEs
have been duly executed and duly authorized or ratified by
all necessary governmental and corporate action and are in
force and effect (para. 4.18); and
(e)  the Republics and Provinces have adopted Decisions, or given
appropriate assurances on the matters covered under para 7.01
and the guarantees for the Bank project in para 4.02, in form
and substance satisfactory to the Bank.
7.04      With the assurances indicated above, fulfillment of the conditions
of loan effectiveness, and based on the Railways' Investment, Financing,
and Action Plans for 1973-77, the project is suitable for a Bank Loan of
US$93 million equivalent to the CYR for a 25-year term, including 3 years of
grace.

A FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
YIJGOSLAVIA
Transportation Projects Previously Financed bv the Bank
A.   Previous Prolects
1.        So far the Bank has lent US$39h.4 million in total to the transport
sector, including us$180 million for six highway projects  TJS$59.4 million for
the Naftagas project, and US$155 million for three railway projects.
Highway Projects
2.        The first highway project (Loan 344-YU, US$35 million) was financed
in 1963 and the second (Loan 485-YU, IUS$10 million) in 1967; they were completed
within the original cost estimates and agreed time schedules. The third (Loan
608-YUt, US$30 million) project was financed in 1969 and is open for traffic,
although the closing date had to be postponed until August 1974 to complete
road works. The fourth (Loan 678-YU, US$40 million) was financed in 1970 and
is being implemented satisfactorily, although with some delays and cost in-
creases due to inflation and foreign exchange rate adjustments. The fifth
highway project (Loan 751-YUI, US$35 million) became effective one year late
due to Government administrative delays, but is now being implemented satis-
factorily, although also with some cost increases due to inflation and foreign
exchange rate adjustments. The cost overruns are being covered by additional
domestic financing. The loan for the sixth highway project was signed on
MaY 31, 1974.                            -
Naftagas Project
3.        The loan for the Naftagas project (Loan 916-YU, US$59.4 million)
was made in June 1973, but, due to organizational reforms within the enter-
prise, became effective on March 22, 1974 after almost six months' delay.
Railways
4.        The first railway loan was made in 1963 (Loan 361-YU, US$35 million)
to finance the completion of the Sarajevo-Ploce line to standard gauge, with
electric traction and modern signalling and telecommunications equipment.
The project was substantially completed and put into operation in 1970, i.e.
with a delay of about two years.



ANNEX I
Page 2
5.        The second railway loan was made in ]964 to help finance a Moderniza-
tion Program for the main lines (Loan 395-YU, US$70 million). Since the proposed
loan will help finance the completion of this Program, a brief review of this
project is given in Part B (below).
6.        The third railway loan in 1968 (Loan 531-YU, US$50 million) helped to
finance the completion of 372 km of the Belgrade-Bar line, with electric traction,
signalling and telecommunications equipment. Completion was originally schedu2ed
for 1973, but geo-technical and other construction difficulties in mountainous
terrain are expected to delay operation of the line until 2976. The cost estimate
has increased from US$225 million to about US$300 million but SFRY, SR Serbia,
and SR Montenegro have taken measures to provide financing for all the works to
be carried out in 1974, as well as part of the works in 2975. Further measures
will be necessary to close the remaining financing gap estimated at about
US$21 million.
B.  Details of the Second Railway ProJect
7.        Loan 395-YU financed part of the modernization of the main lines,
and included electrification, signal:ing and telecomuwnications, covering some
1,500 Im of line, and the constructicn or extension and modernization of six
marshalling yards. The project was to be executed between 1964 and 1968, at
an estimated cost of US$185 million; the Bank loan was US$70 million. The
project is now expected to be completed at the end of 1976 at a total cost of
about US$405 million (including contingencies), over twice the original estimate.
This cost increase is due roughly equally to quantity increases and inflatio, thse
latter compounded by the long delay.  The loan was fully disbursed&in November
1972. Other data are given below.

Financial Problems
8.        A major factor in the delays and cost overruns in the 1964 Moderniza-
tion Program was that railwayst internal funds fell substantially below fore-
cast levels. This had several causes. First, the economic reforms of 1965
stimulated road transport significantly and altered the pattern of commodity
flows to the railways' disadvantage. The railways were ill-equipped and slow
to adjust to the new market conditions; their profitability suffered accord-
ingly. Secondly, SFRY controls over freight rates and passenger fares de-
pressed railway revenues. Thirdly, the 1965 reforms transferred responsibility
for financial coverage of railway deficits and investments from the SFRY to
the SRs and SAPs, which could not quickly provide funds to reimburse deficits
and to finance investments. These specific factors were compounded by the



ANNEX 1
Page 4
general illiquidity of the Yugoslav economy, widespread inflation, and adverse
exchange rate movements.
9.        Uncertainty regarding the availability of finance, notably concern-
ing provision by the Republics, greatly complicated project planning and con-
trol. The railway enterprises were frequently unable to pay contractors, who
executed a great deal of work on credit but in some cases ascribed a deter-
ioration of performance to their own illiquidity. The situation grew prog-
ressively worse and certain works had to be suspended temporarily.
Management Difficulties
10.       In addition to these financial problems, the railway management
lacked the experience required for such a large project. There were serious
deficiencies in project definition and preparation, resulting in unrealistic-
ally optimistic estimates.
11.       As project execution proceeded, quatntities had to be increased well
above estimates. In the absence of adequate project definition, change of
plans occurred as execution proceeded, and this contributed to the increase
in quantities. It was to be expected, however, that in view of the long delays
of execution, certain railway operating requirements should change; furthermore,
changes were forced on the railways by land use and urbanistic requirements.
12.       Completion schedules were also generally over-optimistic.  In partic-
ular, there were procurement delays, difficulties with land acquisition and,
in some cases, the contractors had insufficient production and installation
capacity. As early as 1966 it was obvious that the project would be seriouslv
delayed, New cost and completion schedules were prepared repeatedly by the
railways over the years, but were still too optimistic.
Bank Action
13.       Repeated representations by the Bank over the years resulted in some
improvements, but overall the situation continued to deteriorate. In 1971 the
Bank concluded that fundamental reforms were necessary to ensure the efficient
completion of the project, and to improve the situation of the railways in
general. In full agreement with all Governments and railways the Bank therefore
commissioned Transmark, a British consulting firm, to review the situation in
depth. Following Transmark's recommendations and discussions with Bank mis-
sions the Governments at all levels have agreed to take the measures required
to create more stable and favorable conditions for the railways. For their
part, the railways have agreed to a realistic Investment Plan and to an Action
Plan for improving their management and operation, as described in Chapter IV.
Project management is particularly important in this context, and agreement
was reached on this during negotiations (para. 3.07). An infoml understanding was
reached also on the detailed definition of the 1964 Modernization Program
so that major changes are now unlikely.

The Transport Market
1.        The transport market expanded fairly rapidly during the past decade
and also underwent drastic changes. An explained in Chapter II, para. 2.04,
between 1960 and 1970, passenger traffic grew at an annual rate of 10% and
freight traffic at about 7%. By far the larger part of this expansion ben.-
fitted road transport. Paseengor and freight traffic by road increased at
annual rates of 21% and 20% respectively, whereas on the railways, passenger
traffic stagnated and freight traffic increased only 2.5% annually. The de-
velopment of the transport market is summarized in the following table; details
are given in Tables 1-5 of this Anex.

3.        The total freight market expanded at a slower rate during 1965-70
than during 1960-65; 6.4% p.a. versus 8.2%. This reflected the slowdown in
overall economic growth in the latter part of the 1960's, particularly in
industrial output. On the other hand, the total passenger market continued
to expand during the entire period, at about 10.5% annually. This develop-
ment is in line with the expansion of personal consumption during this
period .                      _                                 ______________________
4.        Railway passenger traffic continued to increase at an annual rate
of 4.5Z during 1960-65, but declined thereafter at an annual rate of 3.0%.
In the earlier period the number of passenger cars and buses was too small
to have a major impact on the market. Prior to 1960 car ownership was dis-
couraged, car imports were restricted, and there was no domestic car manu-
facture. As a result, car registrations in 1960 amounted to 50,000 (Table 5)
only, or one per 370 inhabitants. Thereafter, registrations increased annually
by about 30% and by 1970 amounted to about 720,000, or one per 28 people. This
was still slightly below the average for countries with similar per capita

incomes. Also, the total length of paved roads was only 6,700 km in 1960 but
the increase to 24,200 km by 1970 (Table 6), encouraged long-distance car
travel.
5.        During 1965-70, both rail and road freight were adversely affected
by the economic slowdown, particularly in industry. However, railway freight
continued to increase during this period at an annual rate of 1.51 which in-
dicates that the railways retained a firm foothold in the freight market, de-
spite very rapid growth in road competition.
6.        It would appear that road competition has now reached its peak.
During 1960-65, the number of trucks increased by 9% p.a., but road freight
by almost 25% p.a., reflecting a serious imbalance between the demand and
supply of trucks. During 1965-70, however, following the liberalization of
truck imports and certain measures facilitating truck ownership by enterprises
and private individuals, the number of trucks increased at a faster pace (17%
p.a.) than road freight (151 p.a.). Truck utilization has, therefore, declined
and the demand and supply of trucks are moving towards equilibrium.
7.        The increase of 1.5Z p.a. in rail freight during 1965-70 was achieved
despite several adverse factors. First, the railways had to operate with ob-
solete and insufficient equipment and thereby lost traffic to road transport.
For example, large volumes of cereals were transported long distances by truck,
whereas railways would be the more suitable carrier (Table 7). Second, the
railways had to adjust to major shifts in traffic patterns following the econ-
omic reforms of 1965, which called for the relocation of production centers
close to markets and for the processing of raw materials on site. For in-
stance, cement production was decentralized and thermal power plants were es-
tablished near mine sites, thus decreasing haulage for two major commodities.
Third, the slowdown in industrial growth was more pronounce in the production
of raw materials, for which the railways are a prime carrier, than in other
commodities. Fourth, technological changes such as the replacement of coal
by oil reduced the volume of railway freight. Finally, the railwayn closed
a significant number of unprofitable lines, corresponding to about 12% of the
total network.

to closure of uneconomic lines (Table 8) and uneconomic services,
Net decrease, after allowing for investment, traffic
growth and organizational changes.
3/ Minimum decrease.
Ljubljana has a serious staff shortage, and substantial
overtime is being worked. The figures in brackets are
the estimated increases required to reduce overtime; to
eliminate overtime completely total staff would have had
to be 15767 in 1972, 15344 in 1975 and 15330 in 1976.

APPRAISAL OF
A FOURTH RAILWAY PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
Action Plans
I. PURPOSE OF ACTION_PLANS
1.01      The decentralization of decision making in Yugoslavia has an import-
ant influence on railway organization. The SRs and SAPs rather than the SmRY
deal with the majority of railway problems. The Railways themselves are divided
into five independent Enterprisess within the Enterprises there is substantial
devolution of decision making to individual departments (or pogons).
1.02      A common understanding of the actions to be taken and of the precise
time scale can be of particular importance in securing specific objectives.
particularly where more than one organization or Authority is involved.
For this purpose, Action Plans have been prepared for each of the RTEs and CYR
which will materially assist the successful achievement of the Development
Plan in matters affecting:
i)  individual Enterprises;
(ii)  the Railways as a whole, with the CYR acting in a
coordinating role; and
(iii)  the Governments and the Railways.
1 ~03     Within the Railways the overall objectives are to reduce cost,
improve the quality of service and improve the market position. For matters
of common interest to Governments and Railways the general objectives are
to agree policies and ensure that the measures are carried out both at the
correct time and strictly in accordance with the agreements.
1.04      In the latter respect, a Social Agreement is being considered
by the Federal Goverrment, the Chamber of Economy representing the most
important uisers and the railways to provide the basic principles and
criteria for future tariff increases as well as arrangements for the
closure of uneconomic lines, or their retention with oompensation by
interested parties.
1.05      CYR and RTEs have agreed to use their best efforts to achieve
the targets set out in Table 1 of this Annex.  Die hTes agreed also to
prepare, in collaboration as appropriate with each other and CYR, the
technical/economic studies listed in Table 2.



ANNEX 17
Page 2
II. CONTENT OF ACTION PLANS
2.01      The draft Action Plans prepared by the RTEs and the CYR contain a
large number of individual measures and actions designed to accord with specific
local details and circumstances. In essence, it is essential that the Action
Plans should provide effective measures to deal with certain particular manage-
ment activities and policies. These are listed in Section IV.
III. MONITORING OF ACTIONWPLANS
3.01      If the Action Plans are to be successful in achieving the objectives,
it is essential that effective monitoring and control procedures should be
developed to include:
(i) a simple system of reporting on each action at regular
intervals;
(ii) frequent review of progress by a senior official of the
Enterprise;
(iii) discussion at regular intervals by management;
(iv) preparation of progress reports each six months; and
(v) revised editions to be prepared at yearly intervals.
CYR and fTEs have agreed that they will implement their Action Plans,
update them regularly, institute monitoring procedures and submit to
the Bank reports on progress and annual revisions.
IV. LIST OF MEASURES FOR INCLUSIOK IN ACTION PLANS

The adverse ratios for 1972 were mainly caused by traffic shortfalls follow-
ing the economic stabilization measures and by increased depreciation charges
not being matched by tariff increases. The tariff increases authorized for
1973 and a 6% increase in traffic improved the 1973 ratios. Depreciation
increases which applied to Zagreb only in 1973 are being applied to remain-
ing RTEs in 1974. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the follow-
ing target ratios.

I'. Debt Service coverage deteriorated in 1972, a long period of res-
tricted investments (and correspondingly low incurrence of fresh debt) being
then reflected in inadequate generation of internal resources. Prospects
compare with recent results as follows:

1971   T72       1973       1975    1977

Increased reliance on shorter term loans and suppliers' credits is also con-
tributing to the present decline in debt service coverage and agreement to
restrict maximum debt service resulting from new borrowings was reached
daring negotiations. In general terms, each RTE agreed not to incur debt
which was likely to affect materially and adversely its ability to carry out
its obligations under its Subsidiary Agreements, and for the years 1974-77
it agreed to exchange views with the Bank before incurring additional debt
in excess of the following debt limitation ratios.:3l

5.        Debt/equity ratios for RTEs have been influenced by asset reval-
uations during a period of serious inflation, but past trends and future
prospects are as follows:

Debt/equity ratios were low during the past decade reflecting minimal
borrowings for new investment and increased equity as fixed assets were
revalued, particularly in 1972.  In 1973 substantial locomotive and rolling
stock purchases, mainly financed by suppliers credits, oaused the ratios to
increase in all RTEs. Thereafter, significant increases are expected only
for RTE LjublJana due to the extensive work on the main Koper-Sentilj line
and for RTE Skopje, serving the least developed of the Republics where
more extended debt repayment terms apply. The relatively stable ratio for
RTE Belgrade will be caused partly by completion of the Belgrade-Bar line
in 1976, for which grants have been made available through the Republics
of Serbia and Montenegro.
6.        Operating cash and other working capital have for some years been
generally inadequate to maintain efficient operations or to sustain the
planned levels of capital expenditure. The forecasts allow for a steady
build-up of inventories, an increase in credit extended to railways cus-
tomers (both in number and amount) and reduction in the amounts overdue
for payment to contractors and suppliers. Current and liquid ratios are
forecast to improve as follows:
C'=rrent Ratios (Liquid Ratios)

Sarajevo         1.2(1.1)          1.4(1.2)    2.4 (2.2)      2.2(2.0)    3.0(2.6)
Skopje           1.3(1.1)          0.7(0.6)    1.1(1.0)       1.1(0.9)    1.5 1.4)

The ratios improve sharply for Belgrade and Sarajevo because of substantial cash
balances resulting from larger operating surpluses in turn depending on major
traffic increases. To assist in raising the levels of working capital and
improving the critical current and liquid ratios, agreement was reached at nego-
tiations that each RTE would use its best efforts to raise its operating cash to
nat less than 8% and its other working capital to not less than 20% of cash
operating expenses by 1977.

NOTES: .1 Other revenue for 1973 includes ND 237 million compensatisn for tariff increases withheld in 1973. Amounts claimed by RTelm were, freight traffit  ND 354 million;
passenger traffic ND 135 millios.  Total ND 489 million.  If compensation claied had been mat in full the surplus of ND 4 million would have been ND 256 million.
- Other revenue fsr 1974 includes ND 429 million -ompensation for tariff Increases delayed. For subsequent years the amounts for freight and passenger revenues
assume reel increases of 2% p.a. end 31 p.a. respectively in addition to inflation. (see also note 4).
Depreciation charges increased by about 80% in 1972, fellowing revaluation of assets as at December 31, 1971, end by about 60% in 1974 following introduction of
new depreciation 1N.  For RTE Sarajevo depreciation charged is reduced by amounts made available to independent pogons.
- Losses on uneconomic linen reimbursed as follows: 1972 nd 1974 ND 4 million p.a, for RTE Ljubljana; 1973 ND 90 million RE Sarajevo; for 1973 the amounts claimed by
RTSE vas ND 148 million end if met in fall the surplus would have been increased NO 58 million from ND 256 million (see Note 1 above) to ND 314 million, closely com-
par-ble to original forecast of ND 317 el1lion. Subsequent losses on uneconomic lines are estimated at ND 241 million 1975; ND 260 million 1976; and ND 279 million
1977 but are not shown separately because freight end passenger tariffs used to forecast revenues for those years are related to tariffs applicable in the second half
1974 which include an element to compensate for losses on uneconomic lines. The forecast freight end passenger revonuen for 1975-77 may (but not necessarily will)
be reduced as  nd when Republics decide to reimburse losses on uneconomic lines separately.
Rate of return on net fixed assets in use is calculated up to 1970 on basis of former asset values; from 1971 on basis of revaluation undertaken as at December 31,
1971. An adjustment to rates of return will be necessary if ifthat revaluation is undertake  as at December 31, 1976.

APPRAISAL OF
A FOURTH RAIlWAY PROJ3KT
YUGOSLVIA
Main Assumptions Used in Financial Evaluation
The financial forecasts are based on the following principal assump-
tions:
TRAFFIC
1.        Freight and passenger traffic forecasts prepared by each RTE and
summarized for CY in Annex 10.
OPERATING EXPENSES
2.        Wage rate increases to meet estimated inflation of 15% in 1974; 12%
in 1975 and 10% per annum in 1976 and 1977 plus real adjustments, of varying
amounts for each RTE, to enable the RTEs' wage rates to match the expected
levels for comparable sectors in the economy of the Republics concerned.
3.        Fuel and electricity cost; according to experience, to end March
1974, plus 12% in 1975 and 10% p.a. in 1976 and 1977. Material price
increases according to experience to end of 1973 plus 15% in 1974, 12% in
1975 and 10% p.a. in 1976 and 1977. For all other working expenses (except
fixed charges) price increases aimilar to those for materials.
4.        Staff changes from investment and reorganization (less requirements
for additional traffic) are fully incorporated only in the foreeasts for RTEs
IJublJana and Skopje.  arEs Belgrade, Zagreb and Sarajevo retain some su-plus
labor costs through 1977. Fael and maintenance costs and other working
expenses fully adjusted for cost savings from investment less additional
traffic costs.
5.        Depreciation arrangements existing in RTE Zagreb in 1973 extended
by law to all other RTEs in 1974, increasing depreciation by 40% to 50%
according to the circumstances of each RTE. The next full revaluation of
fixed assets, due in 1977, not incorporated, but depreciation charges
regularly increased to match inflation.
6.        Losses on uneconomic lines, nominated by the RTEs for closure, are
not shown as being reimbursed by the authorities requiring their retention
because the forecast revenues (para. 7 below) are calculated on the basis
of tariffs applicable to the second half of 1974 plus inflation and real
increases. The 1974 tariffs were stated by the Governments to be inclusive
of any losses on uneconomic lines, and this inclusion is therefore carried
over into subsequent years. If, in practice, Governments assume reimburse-
ments of these losses they will be shown as reductions in expenditure, as was
the case in 1973.



Annex 21
Page 2
REVENUE
7.        Revenue from traffic carried at domestic rates:
(i)  for 1974, increased by 21.8% for freight from May 24, 1974
and passengers from June 1, 1974 over rates applicable in
first half of year; and
(ii)  for each year 1975 to 1977, 1974 rates as in (i), increased
by 2% per annum for freight and 3% per annum for passengers
with further increases to meet inflation estimated at 12%
for 1975 and 10% per annum for 1976 and 1977.
Any shortfalls resulting from the timing or amount of Government approval
of tariff increases for the years 1975 to 1977 are assumed to be made good
by ccmpensation of corresponding amount, payable by the SRs and SAPs.
8.        Revenue from traffic carried at international transit rates, cal-
culated inclusive of increases approved in 1974. Revenues from all other
operations, according to previous trends.
EXCHANGE RATE
9.        Foreign exchange rate of US$1.00 to Yugoslav ND 15.22.  (The rate
on April 29, 1974.)
DEBT SERVIBE
10.       Terms of existing debts, including suppliers' credits, adjusted
for rescheduling of Federal and Republican (including State-owned Bank)
loans notified to April 1974 as part of the Governmental support measures
for the Railways.
11.       The proposed IRD loan of US$93 million equivalent, with an
interest rate of 7.25% per annum and repayment in 25 years including a
three-year grace period. All other proposed borrowings from domestic and
foreign sources at terms consistent with Yugoslav and RTEs' experience and
according to debt service summaries prepared by each RTE,
NOTE
Comparison of detailed results and forecasts between RTEs is not
always practicable because, although accounts are kept according to the
standard Yugoslav accounting code, there are many differences in the basic
organization of the RTEs and also some differences in interpretation and
in methodology, whether developed locally cr centrally prescribed by CYR
after discussions with the RTEs.
