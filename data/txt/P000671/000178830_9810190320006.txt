HUMERA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ETHIOPIA
APPRAISAL REPORT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report contains the appraisal of a project which would
be the first phase of a program of regional agricultural development
in the northwest lowlands of Ethiopia. A Development Credit of US$3.1
million equivalent is proposed.
ii.       Agriculture produced some 95% of Ethiopia's exports in 1968,
of which arabica coffee accounted for nearly 60%. A large proportion
of Ethiopia's population lives in highland areas where pressure on the
land precludes any large and rapid increase in agricultural production,
and indications are that the country may face serious problems through
inadequate supplies of food products due to rapid population growth.
There is thus a vital need to develop suitable low populated areas for
the production of food, as well as export and import-substitute crops.
iii.      Regional agricultural development has priority in Ethiopia's
development plans. A credit of US$3.5 million equivalent was approved
by IDA in October 1969 for Ethiopia's second regional development pro-
ject (The Wolamo Agricultural Development Project), in the south of the
country. The initial project of this type is being financed by the
Swedish International Development Authority in another region of the
country.
iv.       The northwest lowlands, extends over some 1.6 million ha, of
which about 320,000 ha of Government owned land is believed to be suit-
able for the mechanized production of rainfed sorghum, cotton, and
sesame. Spontaneous development has already brought about 100,000 ha
under cultivation, but the stage has been reached when large scale in-
frastructural improvements are required if the pace of development is
to be sustained. The proposed project includes:
-    construction of a main access road to the region;
-    completion of a demonstration farm;
-    construction of a water supply system for the re-
gion's administrative center;
-    preparation in detail of an investment project for
a second phase of the development program which,
in particular, would be aimed at extending the area
under cultivation and at improving productivity;
and the studies precedent to this.



- ii -
The total cost of the project would be US$4.4 million. Foreign exchange
costs are estimated at US$3.1 million or 70%. United Kingdom Technical
Assistance would provide the aerial photography needed for preparation
of the investment project.
v.        The project would be carried out by the Imperial Ethiopian
Government (IEG) through the Ministries of Agriculture and Interior,
and the Imperial Highways Authority (IHA). Project actions would be
coordinated by the planning unit of the Ministry of Agriculture.
vi.       The project, through its road and water supply elements alone,
would have the immediate impact of significantly increasing agricultural
production in the northwest lowlands, and thus of improving Ethiopia's
agricultural economy. The demonstration farm would bring technical ad-
vances to a farming community presently using outdated methods in its
crop production, and thus would lead to improvements in productivity.
The investment and development project that would be prepared would
have the capacity, when implemented, to bring about major increases in
agricultural production and productivity in the northwest lowlands with-
in the next decade. The estimated economic rate of return from invest-
ment in the road is 16%. While an economic rate of return has not been
calculated for the water supply system it would provide consumers with
water at a cost of about 8% of the charges they now pay, and yield a
financial rate of return of about 11%. While prerequisites for sub-
sequent development, no quantification has been attempted of the eco-
nomic benefits of the demonstration farm and project preparation.
vii.      The project would be suitable for a credit of US$3.1 million
which would cover 70% of project costs. This would finance an amount
equivalent to the estimated foreign exchange costs of the project, but
excluding about US$16,000 financed by bilateral aid. International com-
petitive bidding would be employed to procure goods estimated at $1.6
million (excluding contingencies). In addition, goods with an estimated
foreign exchange cost of $0.5 million would be procured under acceptable
local tender procedures. The remainder of the credit amount is allocated
for supervisory staff, consultants services, and contingencies.



HUMERA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ETHIOPIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Imperial Ethiopian Government (IEG) has applied for a credit
to assist in financing the first phase of Humera Agricultural Development
Project - a project aimed at developing mechanized agriculture in the
northwest lowland region of the country.
1.02      The project which is the subject of this report, would provide
support for existing development started by private commercial farmers.
It would do so by improving communications, water supplies, and provision
of a demonstration farm. The project would include also, the preparation
of a second phase project, and the studies needed for such preparation,
which would be concerned directly with the further development of mecha-
nized farming in the northwest lowland region.
1.03      The project was prepared by Government with assistance from the
FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. FAO/IBRD project identification and pre-
paration missions visited the project area in April 1968 and December 1968.
This report is based on the findings of a Bank appraisal mission, composed
of Messrs. M. van Gent, A. Denness and M. Palein which visited Ethiopia in
April 1969. On the road element of the project the appraisal mission was
assisted in Ethiopia by Mr. F. Reid of the Bank's Permanent Mission to
Eastern Africa. Mr. Seidel, consultant to the Bank, visited Ethiopia to
examine the water supply proposals in September 1969.
1.04      In October 1969, IDA approved a credit of US$3.5 million to
Ethiopia for an agricultural development project in the Wolamo area. Pre-
vious Bank group finance for agriculture in Ethiopia has been restricted
to provisions of small amounts for agricultural credit under two loans,
totalling US$4,000,000 made in 1950 and 1961 to the Development Bank of
Ethiopia.
II. BACKGROUND
2.01      Ethiopia covers about 122 million km 2, and lies between 34  and
480 longitude and 30 and 180 latitude. Climate is determined by the al-
titude of the hills and high plateaux of the Ethiopian massif, which rises
to 4,620 m and is dissected by the Rift Valley. To the west, the massif
falls away to the foothills and clay plains of the northwest lowlands where
the project area is located. Rainfall increases from north to south, from
a minimum of 250-300 mm in the northeast region near the Red Sea, to the
very high rainfalls (above 1,000 m) of the mountainous plateaux of the
southwest.



2.02      Ethiopia is an agricultural country, and about 90% of about
24 million population are engaged in agriculture. At present population
is increasing at a rate of over 2% per annum. Recent studies show that
about 45% of the population is 14 years of age or less; this, coupled
with an anticipated reduction in infant mortality, will lead to even more
rapid population growth in the near future and soon the country may face
serious problems of food supply.
2.03      Population density is irregular.  In the highlands it is over
210 people per km2, and less than 0.2 ha of cultivable land per capita
is available. This situation emphasizes the vital need to develop new
and less densely populated areas for the production of food, export, and
import substitution crops.
2.04      In 1967/68 GDP totaled US$1.4 billion equivalent, and of this
agriculture accounted for about 60%. In 1968 agriculture generated about
95% of total exports which were valued at US$106 million. Coffee accounts
for about 58% of exports; and oilseeds, particularly sesame, and hides
and skins share second place, each with 9%. Although Ethiopia could
easily produce more coffee, its quota, set by the International Coffee
Organization, prevents significant increases of exports. There is thus
an urgent need to diversify agricultural production. The evolution by
Ethiopian private enterprise of large scale mechanized rainfed farming
in the lowlands of the northwest is an encouraging development for the
Ethiopian economy. The further development of this mechanized farming
presents opportunities for increasing foreign exchange earnings, improving
food supplies, and providing raw materials, such as cotton, for Ethiopia's
developing industries.
III. DEVELOPMENT OF MECHANIZED FARMING IN THE NORTHWEST LOWLANDS
3.01      Mechanized farming began in the northwest lowlands in 1954.
It started through the initiative of private entrepreneurs and subse-
quently has been developed by them. Government's role has been confined
to the allocation of land to farmers, and to the general administration
of the area. Early development was slow, but between 1963 and 1968 there
was rapid expansion. By 1968, over 400 tractors were in use and about
100,000 ha of land were under cultivation. Despite poor communications
and a general lack of facilities, tractor dealers have either set up work-
shops, or appointed dealers to hold stocks of fast moving spares at Humera,
and the service and spares situation for farm tractors is satisfactory.
3.02      The farming system is extensive, and based on low input and low
outputs per unit of land. Many of the farmers and their laborers come
from cities and neighboring highland areas and live on the farms only dur-
ing the crop season. Farmers cultivate and plant maximum acreages at min-
imum cost by using modern tractor drawn equipment, but weeding and har-
vesting are not mechanized. Fertilizers and pesticides are not used,



- 3 -
although cotton pests are becoming a greater problem as the area under
cotton cultivation increases. As yields increase through the use of
improved machinery, better weeding, and new varieties, economic responses
to fertilizer would be achievable.
3.03      Sorghum, sesame and cotton are the principal crops.  Cultiva-
tion begins after the early rains have produced a reasonable growth of
weeds. The land is then rapidly cultivated with a wide level disc har-
row usually pulled by a 70 drawbar hp tractor. A second harrowing is
carried out after fourteen days and seed sown by hand. Because speed is
essential, standards of seedbed cultivation are poor and with poor seed
and uneven sowing, yields are of necessity low.
3.04      All crops are harvested by hand, and until suitable machines
and new varieties become available there will continue to be a peak de-
mand for labor during the sesame and cotton harvests in November and De-
cember. Sorghum presents few problems as the harvest can be prolonged
into the dry season.
3.05      No accurate data are available for crop yields, and the follow-
ing estimates were made after considering ecological conditions, crop
stands, farmers' opinions, and the experience of farming under similar
conditions in Sudan:
ESTIMATED YIELDS OF MAJOR CROPS
Sesame                                       300 kg/ha
Sorghum                                      800 kg/ha
Cotton                                       300 kg/ha
Yield increases beyond the above levels are considered possible and could
be obtained by the use of improved seed sown mechanically in rows so that
weeding could be partially mechanized. Additional yield increases could
be achieved through peat control and by the use of fertilizers and im-
proved crop rotations.
3.06      Crops are not processed in the northwest lowlands.  Seed cotton
is ginned at Asmara (480 km from Humera). Sorghum, surplus to the require-
ments of the project areas - about 18,000 ton per annum - is marketed in
Asmara.
3.07      Land in the mechanized farming areas is owned by the Government,
and present occupiers have been allocated land by the Governor of the
Woreda (District) under a system of annual permits. However, no titles
or leases have been issued, and the only condition of occupation is that
the occupier agrees to pay education and health taxes. As a result, farm-
ers' rights to the land are not defined, there is no incentive for them



- 4 -
to invest in permanent improvements, and land cannot be used as a collat-
eral for the credit most farmers need, to carry out improvements. Govern-
ment is aware,of the problem, and was informed during negotiations that
satisfactory arrangements for the granting of long-term leases to farmers
would be a requirement for any lending for a second stage project.
3.08      Farmers have the following three sources of credit:
-    the Development Bank of Ethiopia, which by requiring
200% collateral In the form of real estate is seriously
restricted in its lending activities;
-    farm machinery dealers, whose volume of lending is
limited; and
-    local traders, who make cash advances against standing
crops at times when labor must be hired for weeding
and harvesting. Farmers frequently have no option but
to borrow from such traders whose rates of interest
are usurious.
3.09      A multi-purpose agricultural cooperative has been registered
at Humera. At the time of appraisal, the society comprised about 100
farmers - about 33% of all farmers in the area - who have subscribed
E $36,000 (US$14,400). The society is closely supervised by the Ministry
of National Community Development and Social Affairs, which has stationed
staff in Humera for the purpose.  The cooperative offers its members short-
term credit facilities, and purchases and markets members' crops. The es-
tablishment of a cotton ginnery by the society is being considered. This,
if feasible, would provide an improved channel for providing credit, and
for distributing the seed of improved cotton varieties.
3.10      The region's mechanized farms make a significant contribution
to the economy of Ethiopia. Accurate data are not available but Customs
receipts 1/ indicate that in 1968 mechanized farms in the region produced
the following:

post, and obtain a receipt detailing freight being carried.



- 5 -
3.11      Regional sesame exports in 1968 earned about US$2.8 million
in foreign exchange, equivalent to 2.4% of Ethiopia's total agricultur-
al exports in terms of value. Cotton production, mostly ginned at Asmara,
was equivalent in 1967 to 3.5 thousand tons of fiber, or 50% of all cot-
ton ginned in Ethiopia in that year. The region could supply an increas-
ingly significant amount of the cotton fiber requirements of Ethiopia's
textile mills which are now dependent on imports for supplies. This would
release irrigated land for the production of long staple cotton, for which
a ready export market exists. Sorghum produced in the northwest lowlands
already has lowered food prices both in Asmara, and in the depressed north-
ern areas of Tigre, Eritrea and northern Wallo, where historically, short-
age of food has been a constant source of poverty and civil strife.
IV. THE PROJECT AREA
4.01      The project: is located in the middle reaches of the northwest
lowlands, lying at elevations of between 450 and 700 m. Humera, the gov-
ernment's administrative center is situated roughly in the center of the
project area (see Map).
Population
4.02      A population census of the project area has not been carried
out. Population density is believed to be below the national average of
19 per km2 but increasing steadily as development proceeds. Nonetheless
the resident population is inadequate to provide sufficient labor for the
mechanized farms which have developed in the area. Consequently, during
sowing, weeding and harvesting periods, large numbers of migrant labor-
ers - an estimated 60,000 in 1968 - enter the region from Ethiopia's de-
pressed northern provinces.
Settlement
4.03      The region is in a pioneer stage of development, and significant
settlement has so far been restricted to the townships of Om Hagar and
Humera, and a few villages sited near permanent sources of water. The
majority of the area's farmers are absentee landlords who live in the
area only during the cropping seasons. Investment in the form of perma-
nent houses, and farm equipment and road vehicle workshops, is increasing
in Humera, however, and living conditions in the town are slowly improv-
ing. Medical facilities remain very scarce, and enteric diseases flour-
ish due to contaminated drinking water supplies.
Soils
4.04      Soils of the project area are largely homogenous, and consist
of alluvial grey-black to brown-colored heavy clays. Containing more
than 50% clay, the soils are low in organic matter, are impervious when



- 6 
wet, and crack deeply when dry. Soil total nitrogen contents are general-
ly satisfactory for the yield levels oDtained in the area and reserves of
potash adequate; phosphorous contents are low, however, and experience
elsewhere with similar soils indicates that economic responses probably
would be obtained from the use of phosphatic fertilizers.
Climate
4.05      Temperatures are high throughout the year, reaching a maximum
of over 500C in April. Annual rainfall, which increases southwards,
varies between 500 and 800 mm and occurs mainly in the months of June
through October, with the highest precipitation levels in July and Au-
gust. Rain falling prior to June, and after October is insignificant
for agricultural purposes. The average rainfall is sufficient to sus-
tain yields considerably above present levels.
Water Supply
4.06      The only sources of surface water are the region's widely spaced
rivers and streams, most of whicn dry up during the dry season. Ground
water resources have not been thoroughly prospected but are believed to
be very limited.  Consequently, for much of the year, water is hauled
over long distances to the area's farms - up to 70 km in many cases -
usually in tanks mounted on tractor pulled trailers. Water for Humera
township, and many farms, is drawn from the Tekkezie River and distributed
in bags on donkeys. Water from these surface sources is heavily contami-
nated, and the general level of health and ability to work is seriously
reduced by water borne enteric diseases. A supply of clean drinking
water for Humera and its nearby farms would do much to improve general
health, and would provide added incentive for people to settle perma-
nently in the town.
4.07      Recently an alternative water supply for Humera has been iden-
tified and investigated. This is the aquifer which underlies the town.
Test pum ings of two recently constructed tubewells showed a production
of 800 ms in 20 hours pumping. These two wells, together with two new
tubewells, would provide sufficient water to meet the present require-
ments of Humera - about 1,500 m3 per day. The development of this sup-
ply would form part of the project.
Communications
4.08      The area is served by 360 km of all weather road from Asmara to
Tessenei, and by 120 km of rudimentary dry weather road from Tessenei to
Humera (see Map). This latter section of the road is impassable to wheel-
ed traffic between June and October, but is the only outlet from the pro-
ject area to the cotton ginneries and grain markets of Asmara, and to the
port of Masawa. The recent construction of an all-weather airfield at
Humera, which was financed by private subscrintion, has improved wet sea-
son access to the project area, and has improved significantly the supply
of farm tractor spares.



- 7 -
4.09      The bulk of future agricultural development will occur south of
the Tekkezie River, but communications to this area are difficult because
a narrow bridge across the river which was built in 1936 was partly de-
stroyed in 1941, and has never been rebuilt. The area is almost com-
pletely cut off between June and September when the river is in full
flood, and from October to January (the period of sesame and cotton har-
vests) transport of crops and goods across the river is possible only
by camel or boat. The government has awarded a contract for the con-
struction of a single lane bridge (see paragraph 5.17), which would be
built on the existing pillars of the old bridge. These pillars are
sound and adequate for the purpose.
4.11      South of the Tekkezie River roads are very poor, and freight
transport impossible during the June through September wet season. More-
over the east-west courses of the Royan and Angareb rivers (see Map)
create additional obstacles to north-south freight movement since these
rivers cannot be forded for the greater part of the year. Extension of
farming activity south of the Tekkezie River will require the bridging
of these rivers and construction of a new system of feeder roads.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Description
5.01      The project would be the first phase of a program to establish
the infrastructure and institutions required to enable the development of
about 320,000 ha of land for mechanized agriculture in the northwest low-
lands of Ethiopia. The project comprises actions to remove the constraints
on further spontaneous development by commercial farmers, and the studies
needed to provide data for the preparation of a second phase project. The
Project would include:
-    improvement of communications between Tessenei and
the Royan river by the construction of about 120 km
of all weather roads, and by bridging the Tekkezie
River;
-    construction of a water supply for the township of
Humera. This would supply about 30,000 people with
clean drinking water dispensed from public hydrants;
-    completion of a demonstration farm including the im-
provement of agricultural extension services; and
-    preparation in detail of an investment project for
the project area which would be aimed at extending
the area under cultivation and at improving produc-
tivity; and the studies precedent to this, including:



- 8 -
(a)  aerial photography and photomosaics;
(b)  soil survey and land use classification;
(c)  agro-economic survey;
(d)  credit, marketing and processing study;
(e)  road engineering of 200 km of new feeder
roads; and
(f)  preparation of a master plan for the agri-
cultural development of the northwest low-
lands.
B. Detailed Features
Improvement of Communications
5.02      The existing dry season track from Tessenei to Humera, see Map,
would be upgraded to gravel standards and be continued a further 17 km
south of Humera to the Royan river. An additional 10 km of road would
provide access to, and a main internal road for the project farm. The
road has been designed to carry truck and trailer units with a gross
loaded weight of about 32 tons and a maximum axle load of 11 tons. In
the relatively flat terrain traversed, design speeds of 100 km.p.h. can
be adopted without increasing cost. The overall width of the road, in-
cluding shoulders, would be 6.0 m; the pavement structure would be grad-
ed sub-soil capped with gravel 6.0 m wide and 20 cm thick, and appropriate
to carry expected traffic loads and volume. In areas of black cotton soil
the top 15 cm would be stabilized with river sand, and fords or culverts
would be built at minor stream and river crossings. These standards are
considered adequate for the traffic envisaged on the proposed road. As-
surances were obtained during negotiations that the road would be con-
structed to these standards and would be maintained thereafter by IRA
and that appropriate measures for weight control of the vehicles would
be taken.
5.03      The proposed road would cross four main rivers which would be
bridged. Bailey bridges suitably reinforced to provide a load capacity
of 37 tons, would be built over the Saubumaye, Geludji and Royan rivers.
At the Tekkezie River, a single lane, reinforced concrete deck bridge
would be built on existing pillars; designed by IHA it would consist of a
single carriageway 206 m long and 3.5 m wide. Further details of road
and bridge construction are given in Annex 2.
Humera Water Supply
5.04      Two tubewells would be installed and energized.  With the two
existing wells they would supply the maximum daily requirement of clean
drinking water. The four tubewells would be linked to reservoirs capable



of storing 8 hours pumping. Water would be distributed through a pipe-
line to ten water fountains placed at strategic points throughout the
town. The system is essentially a rural water supply, with everyone
served by public hydrants and with facilities designed to permit bulk
suppliers to take water for transport to surrounding farms.
Demonstration Farm
5.05      Land suitable for a project demonstration farm has been acquir-
ed by the Government five miles south of Humera. About 300 ha have been
cleared and some machinery has been purchased. However, more staffing,
housing, machinery, and improved infrastructure are required.
5.06      The project would provide housing for a farm manager, extension
officer and two experimental recorders. Farm buildings including an of-
fice, store and workshops would be constructed, and farm implements pur-
chased for farm operations and demonstrations and investigational pur-
poses. The farm would also serve as a base for the preparation of the
second phase investment project. Details are given in Annex 4. Finance
would be required to meet the farm's administrative expenditures for the
first 30 months of operation, by the end of which development would be
complete. Assurances were obtained from the Government that thereafter
adequate funds would be provided under the budget to enable the efficient
operation of the farm.
Preparation of Second Phase Investment Project
5.07      Aerial Photography and Photomosaics.  As part of the United
Kingdom's technical assistance to Ethiopia, an area of 800,000 ha in the
northwestern lowlands region of Ethiopia would be photographed in color
on a scale of 1:20,000 in order to facilitate preparation of a second
stage project. Ground control data for site location and the preparation
of 1:20,000 photomosaics with a maximum error of 2% in horizontal measure-
ment, would be provided under the project by consultants.
5.08      Because aerial photography is an essential prerequisite to
further planning, it would be a condition of effectiveness of this loan
that photographs of a quality satisfactory to the Association had been
obtained, to permit preparation of accurate photomosaics.
5.09      Soil Survey and Land Use Classification.  Details of all land
suitable for cultivation within the project area would be surveyed. Soil
profiles would be described; samples subjected to laboratory analysis;
vegetation, topographical and land use features recorded; and land clas-
sification maps prepared.
5.10      Agro-Economic Survey.  Basic technical, economic, and social
data of the people and farming systems in the project area would be sur-
veyed. Data obtained would enable rational recommendations to be made
for the future development of agriculture in the project area. Studies
of this type have not been made previously in the project area.



- 10 -
5.11      Credit, Marketing and Processing Study.  The needs for both
short and medium-term agricultural credit would be studied and recom-
mendations made on possible sources of credit. Alternatives for oil
seed processing and cotton ginning in the project area would be evalu-
ated, and domestic and export markets reviewed for all crops.
5.12      Road Engineering.  The bulk of future farm development will
occur south of the Royan river, and about 200 km of new feeder roads
would be required to serve this area. The alignment and design of such
new roads, construction of which would form part of a subsequent Phase
II of the project, would be determined.
5.13      Master Plan and Investment Project.  The studies outlined above
would provide the data required for preparing a comprehensive plan for
the development of the area, and for a second phase investment project
within its framework. The second phase project would include improvements
in crop marketing and processing, agricultural credit, technical services,
land registration, and a new feeder road system.
5.14      Detailed descriptions of the studies, and project preparation
work are given in Annex 5.
C. Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements

5.16      Cost estimates for the proposed road works are based on expe-
rience gained in carrying out other Bank financed road construction pro-
jects in Ethiopia. Taking into account contingency allowances of 15% on
physical quantities, and 10% for price escalation during the construction
period of about 30 months, costs are equivalent to about E$ 46,250/km of
road (US$18,500). The foreign exchange component of road construction
costs is about 73%, and includes the full capital cost of road construc-
tion equipment (US$1.39 million). Only the cost of equipment deprecia-
tion during construction (US$0.58 million) has been used in the economic
evaluation. The residual value of the equipment (US$0.81 million) would
be available for road maintenance in the region and for additional road
construction under the second phase of project development.
5.17      The cost of the Tekkezie bridge, about E$ 400,000 (US$160,000),
is based on actual bids received by IHA from reputable local contractors
under local competitive bidding. The cost of purchasing, erecting, and
strengthening Bailey bridges over the Royan, Saubumaye, and Geludji rivers
is estimated by IHA at about E$ 272,000 (US$109,000); this is a reasonable
cost estimate.
5.18      Costs of the Humera water supply, project farm and consultant
services for the regional development studies, are based on data provided
by Government, FAO, WHO and other appropriate agencies, and are compara-
ble with the costs of similar projects in other countries. A contingency
allowance of 20% has been included for the Humera water supply, 10% for
the project farm, and 15% for the development studies.
Financing
5.19      The credit would finance an amount equivalent to the estimated
foreign exchange costs of the project - US$3.1 million and would be re-
payable on standard terms.
5.20      The British Government's contribution would be a grant of
US$16,000 and would comprise aerial photography of the project area.
Agreement has been reached on this matter between IEG and the British
Government.
5.21      The borrower would be the Imperial Ethiopian Government (IEG).
Proceeds of the credit together with government's contribution from the
national budget, would be made available to:
-    the IHA for Road and Bridge Construction;
-    the Ministry of the Interior for the Humera Water
supply system; and
-    the Ministry of Agriculture for project farm, second
phase project preparation and studies.



- 13 -
5.22      A contract has been awarded for construction of the Tekketie
bridge and construction is expected to start before the proposed credit
would be considered by the Board. It was important to start construction
without anv further delay so as to provide access to the area, and it is
therefore recommended that the foreign exchange cost of the bridge ($80,000)
be retroactively financed. IHA has produced a design acceptable to the
Association and has followed satisfactory tendering and bidding procedures.
Procurement
5.23      The procurement of all road construction equipment and Bailey
bridges (US$1.45 million), and the construction of the water supply
(US$161,000), would be on the basis of international competitive bidding.
All goods required for the project farm, including machinery, vehicles,
fertilizers and insecticides (totalling US$75,000), would be procured by
established Government procurement procedures since individual contracts
would be too small to attract international bids, and sufficient imported
farm machinery dealers exist to ensure adequate competitive bidding. Gov-
ernment procurement procedures are satisfactory. Construction of project
farm buildings (US$78,000) would be tendered locally as the amounts in-
volved would preclude international bidding and several building contrac-
tors are available in the area. All other goods, for the project includ-
ing fuel, and road construction materials, totalling US$382,000 would be
tendered locally. The award of local contracts would be administered by
the IEG purchasing committee in accordance with procedures agreed during
negotiations and designed to ensure a satisfactory degree of local com-
petition.
Disbursement
5.24      Disbursement of the proposed credit would be made against 100%
of the cif cost of the imported road construction equipment and Bailey
bridges, and 100% of the foreign exchange costs of consultant services.
For civil works contracts (water supply system, Tekkezie bridge, and proj-
ect farm buildings), supervisory staff, as well as for other project items
to be financed under the credit (which are likely to be procured locally -
e.g. fuel, spares, road construction material and project farm inputs)
reimbursement would be made on a percentage basis of 57% representing
the estimated average foreign exchange component. Estimated disbursements
of the credit over the three-year construction period are:
1969/70   1970/71   1971/72   Total

5.25      The IIlA, the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Agri-
culture would each keep separate accounts for the project. These would



- 14 -
be collated by the Ministry of Agriculture, as coordinator of the pro-
ject (see para. 6.01). Project accounts would be audited annually by an
independent auditor, acceptable to the Association, and would be submitted
to the Association not later than six months after the closing of each
financial year.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
6.01      This project would be completed within 2-1/2 years and would be
carried out by the Imperial Highway Authority (IHA), the Ministry of the
Interior (water supply section), and the Ministry of Agriculture. All
project activity would be coordinated by a senior member of a planning
unit recently established in the Ministry of Agriculture. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the project coordinator appointed
would be mutually acceptable to the Government and the Association. His
appointment would be a condition of effectiveness. The scope and dura-
tion of the project does not warrant the formation of a separate organiza-
tion for its management. In the event of a second phase project being
implemented, however, such an organization would be required; and proposals
for this would be developed in the course of its preparation.
6.02      IHA is an autonomous entity and is responsible for all road
construction in Ethiopia, IHA would direct construction of the proposed
road and the Bailey bridges. Both road and the Bailey bridges would be
constructed by force account, using equipment imported for the project,
which, after construction, would be used to maintain roads in the area
and could also be used for further road construction if the second phase
of development is undertaken. Details of this equipment are given in
Annex 2. Construction work would be supervised by five experienced super-
visors (probably including expatriates as IHA may not have sufficient ex-
perienced staff). The supervisors required would be (i) a senior road
constructor, assisted by (ii) two field mechanics, (iii) one concrete
worker, and (iv) an assistant road constructor. They would be in execu-
tive control of all local personnel necessary for the work, and would
have charge of all equipment financed by the Association for the construc-
tion of the road. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
IRA would appoint five qualified supervisors for road construction who
would be satisfactory to the Association.
6.03      The Tekkezie bridge would be built by a local contractor and IHA
would ensure that construction complied with design requirements.
6.04      The water supply section of the Ministry of the Interior would
be responsible for completing the preliminary design and preparing the
final design of the water supply system, and would arrange for contrac-
tors to install the wells and distribution system. During loan negotia-
tions, assurances were obtained that the Ministry of the Interior would
prepare the final design and submit it to the Association for approval
prior to construction.



- 15 -
6.05      The completed water supply system would, at least initially,
be operated by the Ministry of Interior, which would employ trained
staff to operate and maintain the system. If Humera should-later be-
come a municipality, the Ministry of Interior would still exercise suf-
ficient supervision of municipal operations to ensure adequate operation
and maintenance of the water supply system. Water connections to indi-
vidual dwellings cannot be considered until new town plans for Humera
have been completed. An attendant would be appointed at each fountain
to sell water to townspeople and farmers. This method of distributing
drinking water is common in Ethiopia. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the ex-fountain price of water would not be less than
E$ 0.50/m3 (US$0.20/m3).  This price compares with an existing price for
the delivery of contaminated river water of E$ 6.0/i3 (US$2.40/m3).  A
charge of E$ 0.50/m3 would provide a substantial surplus of revenue over
costs. This surplus would be paid to the central Government, as is the
usual procedure for rural water supply systems financed by IEG.
6.06      In addition to coordinating all project activities the Ministry
of Agriculture would be responsible for establishing and operating the
project farm and for the proper implementation of the regional development
surveys and studies. An organization chart of the Ministry appears at
Annex 4. The project farm would be directly under the Department of Plant
Production and Protection, as are other regional demonstration farms.
6.07      The Ministry of Agriculture would appoint a farm manager who
would be responsible for all activities associated with the project farm.
During negotiations assurance was obtained that the Farm Manager, his
terms of reference and condition of employment would be mutually accept-
able to the Government and the Association. His appointment would be a
condition of effectiveness. The Ministry of Agriculture would transfer
a senior extension officer to the project farm, who would be responsible
for extension work in the project area.
6.08      About one-half of the project farm would be for demonstration
purposes and would be run as a normal farm, except that methods proven
in similar conditions elsewhere, such as row planting and improved va-
rieties, would be adopted. The other half would be used, under the gen-
eral guidance of the Institute of Agricultural Research, to test more
advanced techniques, including the use of fertilizers and pesticides,
alternative crop rotations, and the use of more sophisticated farm ma-
chinery. During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Govern-
ment that a detailed development and testing program for the farm would
be submitted to the Association for approval within three months of ef-
fectiveness.
6.09      Consultant services acceptable to the Association would be re-
tained by the Ministry of Agriculture on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Association, to carry out the studies of the project area and to
prepare the master plan and second phase investment project. Assurances
to this effect were obtained from the Government during negotiations.
Details of the required studies, and form of project preparation are given
in Annex 5.

VII. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Road and Bridges
7.01      The economic benefits of the proposed road would accrue both
from reduced transport costs (road user savings), and from an increase
in mechanized farming within the northwest lowlands, which would not
occur in the absence of improved communications.
7.02      Presently some 140,000 ha of cultivated land (100,000 ha of
mechanized farms and 40,000 ha of subsistence smallholders) produce
about 57,000 tons of agricultural produce. Of this, about 15,000 tons -
mainly sorghum - are consumed within the region; 40,000 tons are trans-
ported from the project area over the unimproved Humera-Tessenei road;
and the remaining 2,000 tons passes out by a mountainous track to the
South of the region.
7.03      Production from mechanized agriculture in the northwest low-
lands increased from almost zero in 1962 to about 45,000 tons in 1968,
an average annual increment of about 6,500 tons (equivalent to the pro-
duction of about 14,000 ha). The pace of agricultural development in
the region is now tending to slow down due to continuing poor communica-
tions, lack of suitable agricultural credit facilities, inefficient mar-
keting arrangements, and the absence of security of tenure to holdings.
It is not anticipated that spontaneous development of the area will cease
if the above constraints remain in force, but that the rate of growth
will slow down significantly. Consequently, in evaluating the economic
benefits of the proposed road it is assumed that without it, only 8,500
ha additional would be developed each year, although during the recent
period of rapid development an average of 15,000 ha were developed an-
nually. On this basis it is estimated that traffic would increase by
about 5% annually during the period 1970 through 1984 (the lifetime of
the proposed road).
7.04      A properly built road surface with a compacted base would re-
duce vehicle time and operating costs, both for trucks and for the buses
which bring in large numbers of laborers during the farming season. It
is estimated that vehicle operating savings would be equivalent to
E$ 105 for each truck and trailer round trip, Asmara-Humera, and E$ 80
for each bus trip. By 1984 vehicle operating savings would amount to
about a total of E$ 730,000 annually (see Annex 2).
7.05      Since the proposed road would provide year round access to
the region, merchants in the project area would no longer need to car-
ry stocks for the four months wet period when the existing track is
closed to all traffic. Thus, there would be substantial savings from
reduced inventories as shown in Annex 2, and it is estimated that by
1984 annual savings in inventories would amount to about E$ 120,000 an-
nually.



- 17 -
7.06      The establishment of year round access to the project area
would stimulate lncreases in agricultural development beyond those that
would occur without improvement of the road. It ia estimated conserv-
atively that the road would cause 1,500 ha to come into production an-
nually over and above the 8,500 ha which would be developed whether or
not the road were built. The annual net value of this production has
been included in project benefits. Beginning at a rate of about
E$ 75,000 annually, it is estimated that in 1984 the annual value of
production generated directly by the road would be some E$ 1.8 million
(see Annex 2).
7.07      The bridge over the Tekkezie River would generate savings by
obviating the need for transshipping goods (destined for or originating
in Humera), across the Tekkezie River by boat or camel, and by providing
direct road access to areas South of the river, see Map. It is estimated
that these savings would average about E$ 50,000 annually, increasing
to a total of E$ 165'000 in 1982 (details are given in Annex 2).  On
the basis of the above quantifiable benefits the economic rate of return
from constructing the Tessenei-Humera road and the Tekkezie bridge would
be 16%, assuming a 12-year life for the road and giving credit for the
residual value of the equipment. In addition there would be benefits
which cannot be quantified; these would include the increased use of
light vehicles and improved administration of the area. Should the
studies and project preparation which form part of the project result,
as anticipated, in the implementation of a development plan for the re-
gion, the economic rate of return from investment in the road would be
greatly increased.
B. Project Farm and Extension Services
7.08      Benefits from completion of the demonstration farm and improve-
ment of the agricultural extension service cannot be quantified. The
scope for improving productivity in terms of land, labor and machinery
units is enormous, however, and the introduction of general use of im-
proved seed alone (varieties are available) would result in large in-
creases in production. The development potential of the area and its
farmers is substantial. Without the farm and its services this potential
would not be realized expeditiously throughout the project area and the
experience for the second phase project would not be available for plan-
ning purposes. While not quantifiable the project farm would be justified.
C. Humera Water Supply
7.09      Public health conditions in Humera are very poor and medical
facilities scarce. Enteric diseases flourish, and a supply of clean
drinking water would do much to alleviate this problem both in Humera
and its surrounding farms. It would also give further encouragement



- 18 -
to permanent settlement in Humera. WThile no attempt has been made to
quantify economic benefits the water supply would provide sufficient
revenue to cover management and amortization costs; and the financial
rate of return from the investment would be about 11% (see Annex 3).
D. Preparation of Second Phase Investment Project
7.10      Insufficient data is available to plan a detailed investment
program for future development of the northwest lowlands. The impressive
spontaneous development that has occurred already is indicative of the
development opportunities existing in the region. The proposed studies
would systematically prepare for the full exploitation of these opportu-
nities, and in view of the existing experience they seem fully justified.
VIII.  RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During credit negotiations agreement was reached on the follow-
ing points:
(a)  IHA would build the project road to the agreed stand-
ards, would maintain it thereafter, and take appro-
priate measures for weight control of vehicles (para.
5.02).
(b) Procedures adequate to ensure a satisfactory degree
of competition for award of local contracts would be
employed (para. 5.23).
(c) The Ministry of the Interior would prepare the final
design of the water distribution system and submit it
to the Association for approval prior to construction
(para. 6.04).
(d) The IEG would prepare a development and testing program
for the project farm and submit it to the Association
for approval within three months of credit effectiveness
(para. 6.08).
(e) The Ministry of Agriculture would retain consultants
acceptable to the Association on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association to carry out the studies
of the project area and to prepare the master plan and
second phase investment project (para. 6.09).
8.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the credit should be that:



- 19 -
(a) Aerial photographs of a quality satisfactory to
the Association had been obtained for an area of
approximately 800,000 ha in the northwestern low-
lands region of Ethiopia (paras. 5.07, 5.08).
(b) The manager of the Project Farm, and the Project
Coordinator had been appointed (paras. 6.01, 6.07).
8.03      With the indicated assurances, the project would be suitable for
a Development Credit of US$3.1 million, on standard terms.

ANNEX 2
HUMERA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ETHIOPIA
IMPROVEMENT OF COMMUNICATIONS
1.        Access to the project area would be by road (120 km) from
Tessenei to a point about 17 km south of Humera, the administrative
headquarters of the project area.
A. Access Road
2.        The proposed access road would follow an existing track which
is in poor condition in the dry season and impassable in the wet season,
June to October. The road would cross four rivers, the Saubumaye, Geludji,
Tekkezie and Royan, all of which would require bridging.
3.        The road would pass mainly through flat black cotton soil land
which is partly developed for the production of cotton, sorghum and ses-
ame. Gravel and sand deposits suitable for road construction are present
in all river beds, and at several other points along the road.
B. Service Roads
4.        A demonstration farm is at present being developed about 5 km
southeast of Humera. About 10 km of service roads would be built to pro-
vide a link with the main road and some internal service roads.
C. Design Standards
Roads
5.        Average traffic volumes are expected to be about 10-15 vehicles
per day rising to a peak of about 60 vehicles per day after harvesting
which will be in the dry season. A low standard gravelled road is suf-
ficient for these traffic volumes. However, since little or no investment
has yet been made along the line of the proposed access road, advantage
would be taken to place its horizontal alignment on as high a standard
and permanent a basis as possible. The horizontal alignment of the road
would be properly designed for a speed of 100 km/h, and the formation
raised, for drainage purposes, above the surrounding land by grading the
natural material inwards from the sides. Formation levels would not be



ANNEX 2
Page 2
accurately surveyed or aligned but would be judged as construction pro-
ceeds by an experienced road constructor. The IHA is competent to pro-
vide the nominal amount of engineering design prior to construction re-
quired for the low standard road proposed. The formation width would be
6.0 m. In areas of black cotton soil the top 15 cm would be stabilized
with river sand, and a gravel running surface 20 cm thick, consisting of
suitable select local materials, would be added throughout the road. The
IHA has proposed that the finished road level should be raised about 1.3
m above the surrounding terrain. However, this is considered too high
and would raise the cost of the embankment construction unnecessarily.
It would be sufficient in most areas to raise the road level by about 0.8
M.
River Crossings
6.        As stated in para 2 the main rivers which would be crossed by
the road are the Saubumaye, Geludji, the Tekkezie and the Royan rivers,
all of which would need to be bridged.
Saubumaye River
7.        The IHA proposes to build a single/single type Bailey bridge
across the Saubumaye River consisting of two spans, each of b6 ft. Since
the heavy lorries and trailers which use this road have a gross loaded
weight of 31 tons, this type of bridge which has load capacity of 15 ton
is inadequate. The bridge loading should be increased by the addition of
chord reinforcing pieces, which would give a load capacity of 37 tons,
which would be adequate.
Geludji River
8.        The IHA proposes to build a single/single type Bailey bridge
across the Geludji River consisting of a single span of 60 ft. The load
capacity for this type of bridge is 15 ton, which again is inadequate.
As above (para 7) the bridge should be strengthened by the addition of
chord reinforcing pieces giving a load capacity of 37 ton.
Tekkezie River
9.        The abutments, piers and part of the steel deck exist of an old
single lane bridge across the Tekkezie River. The IHA has examined these
and found that, although the substructure is sound, the steel deck needs
to be replaced. It has designed a single lane reinforced concrete deck
to fit on the existing substructure. The design is for H20-S16 loading
and the bridge will be 205.80 m long and 3.50 m wide. These standards
are adequate. Contracts were advertised locally on the basis of this
design and the IRA has awarded a contract in the sum of about US$0.16
million to a local contractor. Completion is scheduled for the end of
September 1970.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
Royan River
10.       The DIA proposes to build a single/single Bailey bridge across
the Royan River consisting of two spans each of 60 ft with a load capacity
of 15 tons. As in paras 7 and 8, a single/single Bailey bridge is inade-
quate and the IHA should strengthen the single/single bridge with chord
reinforcing, giving it a load capacity of 37 tons.
Minor Drainage
11.       Minor drainage would be provided by pipe or box culverts or,
where the banks are not too high, by paved fords.
D. Construction
12.       Because the country through which the road would pass is flat
and construction simple, only a traverse survey and staking of the pro-
posed road is necessary to ensure its correct alignment. No levels would
be taken except at stream crossings to ensure a satisfactory arrangement
at approaches to fords and culverts across minor streams. All the neces-
sary survey work would be carried out by the IHA. The proposed road lies
in a very isolated part of Ethiopia and the amount of construction work
involved is relatively small, so it is unlikely to attract any bids from
foreign or local contractors, or if so, only an uneconomic bid. It is
proposed, therefore, that road construction would be undertaken by IHA
under the supervision of experienced supervisors, financed under the
project, with equipment also financed under the project. The list of
equipment required is given in Table 1.
13.       IHA has agreed that provision of equipment would be subject to
international competitive bidding. Erection of the Bailey bridges would
be carried out by the IHA who would also construct any necessary sub-
structures.
14.       As stated above, it is proposed that road construction would be
carried out by the IHA under the supervision of experienced construction
experts, (most probably including expatriates as IHA may not have suffi-
cient experienced staff). The experts required would be: (i) a senior
road construction supervisor assisted by; (ii) an assistant road construc-
tion supervisor; (iii) a concrete supervisor to supervise culvert and
paved ford and other concrete construction; and (iv) two field mechanics.
All these experts would be appointed to work in the IRA under whom the
responsibility for construction of the road would lie. These supervisors
would be in executive control of all personnel necessary for the work and
have charge of all equipment financed by the Bank for the construction of
roads included in the project. In case expatriate experts are employed,
the IHA would provide counterpart personnel to work alongside these ex-
perts for training purposes.

E. Cost Estimates
15.       The total estimated costs of the project are shown in Annex 1.
Road Construction
16.       The estimated cost of road construction (120 km) excluding
bridges is about US$1.4 million equivalent, including only the deprecia-
tion of equipment used on construction and excluding supervision and con-
tingencies. This estimate is based upon a detailed examination of the
road by a road construction expert financed under a previous highway loan
to Ethiopia, Loan 523/Credit Ill-ET. It represents a cost, excluding
bridges, of about US$12,000 equivalent per km. The foreign currency com-
ponent for road construction has been estimated by the same expert at
about 70Z. The cost of culverts and fords is included in the above road
construction estimates and is about US$0.13 million equivalent with a
foreign currency component of about 50%.
Bridges
Saubumaye River
17.       The cost estimate, prepared by the IHA, for erecting a single/
single reinforced Bailey bridge across the Saubumaye River is about US$
20,000 equivalent. It is reasonable and includes (i) chord reinforcing;
(ii) the cost of transporting the bridge components to the site; (iii)
the cost of substructure; and (iv) the cost of erecting the bridge. The
cost of the Bailey bridge is estimated at about US$22,000 equivalent.
Geludji River
18.       The cost estimate, prepared by the IHA, for erecting a single/
single reinforced Bailey bridge across the Geludji River is about US$
12,000 equivalent. It is reasonable and includes (i) chord reinforcing;
(ii) the cost of transporting the bridge components to the site; (iii)
the cost of substructure; and (iv) the cost of erecting the bridge. The
cost of the Bailey bridge is estimated at about US$12,000 equivalent.
Tekkezie River
19.       The cost estimate for constructing the Tekkezie Bridge is about
US$0.16 million equivalent, excluding contingencies, and is based on
actual bids received. The foreign currency component is (about 50% or)
US$0.08 million. As stated above, para 10, a contract has been awarded
for the construction of this bridge. It is recommended that financing
of the project be included in the credit, because the bridge is part of
the improved communications system, and the relatively small size of the
contract and isolated nature of the project area would exclude interest
by international contractors.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
Royan River
20.       The cost estimate, prepared by the IHA, for erecting a single/
single reinforced Bailey bridge across the Royan River is about US$20,000
equivalent. It is reasonable and includes (i) chord reinforcement; (ii)
the cost of transporting the bridge components to the site; (iii) the
cost of substructures; and (iv) the cost of erecting the bridge. The
cost of the Bailey bridge is estimated at about US$22,000 equivalent.
F. Construction Experts
21.       The estimated foreign exchange cost of expatriate construction
experts is assumed to be US$21,000 per year equivalent for the senior
road construction supervisor and US$18,500 per year each for the remain-
der. In addition, there would be a local element of about US$2,000 each,
for subsistence. For any of the positions for which sufficiently qualified
and experienced Ethiopian engineers are available, and for counterpart
personnel for expatriate construction experts, an average annual salary
of US$7,200 is assumed. The estimate of US$145,000 equivalent in foreign
exchange and US$105,000 equivalent in local costs for supervision is based
on an assumption of 3 expatriate experts, 2 fully qualified Ethiopians,
and 3 counterparts. Actual cost will be more or less dependent upon the
success of the IHA in finding sufficiently qualified Ethiopians. In some
cases it may be desirable to pay higher than standard civil service salaries
to attract qualified Ethiopian engineers currently employed by private con-
tractors; this is allowed for in the estimates.
G. Road Maintenance
22.       Because the road to be constructed under the project will be
additional to those for which the IHA is already responsible, additional
maintenance facilities and equipment will be required. Since IHA does
not possess this equipment nor these facilities, the equipment and field
workshops provided under the project for road construction will be retained
after construction for maintenance of roads in the area and for possible
construction of further roads under the second phase of development.

1/ Operating cost of 21 ton truck is estimated at E$1.47 per km on the exsting road and at E$0.97 on the improved road, resulting in saings of X$105 per round trip.
Numsers of truck loads are calculated in Table 2.
2 Sa-ings per round trip for a 62 seats bus are estimated at E$80 per round trip. In 1968 bus comp,nies reported a total of about 100,000 paEsengere; passenger traffic is assumed
to grow in proportion with the area cultivated.
2/ Based on the assumption of 1l/o interest per month for additional inventories carried in anticipatimn of the 4 month wet season; value of local sales estimated at E$0.5
million per month, increasing to E$1.2 million during harvest season.
4/ From 1,500 ha brought into production annually.                                                                                                                                      1 li

ETHIOPIA
HUMERA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PRE-INVESTMENT STUDIES
Besides aerial photographs and photo mosaics of the project
area a series of pre-investment studies are required to enable prepara-
tion of a feasibility study for further development of mechanized rainfed
agriculture in the northwest lowlands of Ethiopia.
The Government would retain a consulting firm to review all
studies made of the project area (and where appropriate areas with similar
soil and climatic conditions), its agriculture, and the processing and
marketing of agricultural products; and taking the findings of these into
account to:
A. Carry out a reconnaissance soil survey of about!400,000
ha of agricultural land in the northwestern lowlands in
the borrowers Awrajas (sub provinces) of Gash-Setit,
Wegera, Gondar and Chilga.
B. Examine agricultural, economic and social conditions of
mechanized farmers in the Humera area.
C. Review present marketing, crop processing and credit
facilities in the Humera area; giving priority to the
possible need for the early establishment of a cotton
ginnery.
D. Review improvements needed in communications for future
development of the area south of Humera.
E. Prepare, in the light of conclusions drawn in carrying
out A. B, C and D above, a feasibility study and invest-
ment proposal for a project for the further development
of the north-western lowlands in Ethiopia.
A. SOIL SURVEY AND LAND USE CLASSIFICATION
To identify areas in the north-western lowlands, suitable for
the development of mechanized rainfed agriculture, a soil survey and land
capability classification are required. Soil survey requirements are as
follows:
(a) Broad outlines of the areas suitable for agricultural
development - about 400,000 ha - should be obtained



ANNEX 5
Page 2
f}--m rece  1-20,000 colored aerial photographs of the
r-a!on.  The photographs should also be used to iI_
drainaee lines, differences in topography, and vee-_,t 4 u.
(b)  A reconnaissance soil survey of the areas suitable for
agricultural development is required. Because sofis are
genera;i.y uniform a sampling clensity of 1 soil prof-le
description per 400 ha will probably be sufficient.  hlow-
el7er, the final, density of soil sampling should be deter-
mined by the survey team after an inspection of tho aerial
photographs, and a consideration of soil surveys carried
out in similar areas elsewhere.
(c) Profile descri.ptions will normally be by auger borings to
a deptlh of 2 m.  However, about 250 soil profile pi,s z m
deep, sh-uid be dug throughout the project area, and fifty
of the.s  shiould supply samples from at least 3 horizons for
l.brorazory :i..alysis.
H)  TF.e play-.lcai and chemical analysis of the soil saT4t&s
collected from the representative soil pits, will cover:

In addition, samples from each of the profile sites should be hand
textured in the field and at least 250 of them should have field determina-
tions of their p.H. made, as wall as full morphological descriptions on an
horizon basis.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
From the results of the soil survey and terrain evaluation a land
capability map (on mosaic basis) will be produced. Classification would be
in accordance with the system used by the USDA Conservation Service modified
where necessary to take account of local conditions and land use requirements.
The soil survey report should include all data on soils, and the
ecology and land use capabilities of the area. The following mosaic maps
of the area suitable for agricultural development should be included:
- soil niap, scale 1:20,000
- land use and classification map, scale 1:20,000
- summary of land classification map, scale 1:100,000
B. AGRICULTURE, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STUDY
Method
1. Establish the distribution of existing farms within the
project area.

of a sample survey. If possible, the list of holdings
granted by the Government should be used as a survey
frame; and the sample stratified according to size of
holdings. An overall sampling percentage of at least
20% should be used, with strata percentages being de-
cided after the details in 1 above have been established.
In carrying out 2 above, the following specific aspects of the
sample holdings should be studied:
