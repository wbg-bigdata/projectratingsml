                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY
1. This paper seeks the approval for restructuring of the Bhutan Second Rural Access
Project (RAP II). The following changes to the original project are being proposed: i)
dropping of two outcome indicators given that they were influenced by external factors (e.g.
fuel prices, government regulated mule rate); ii) changes in the road length component 1 for
new construction by 10km; and iii) dropping technical assistance provisions linked to the
pilot performance-based maintenance mechanisms under Capacity Development and
Implementation Support component (Component 2): and iv) changing the road for Otta-
sealing under Road Access Component (Component 1).
B. PROJECT STATUS
2. The implementation progress of all components and safeguards of RAP II is satisfactory.
Approximately 24 kilometers improvement works, 51.7 km new construction works, 5
bridges and 8.2 km of Otta-sealing of roads are now completed. The remaining 23.5 km new
construction works and 2 bridges are ongoing. As of May 25, 2011, total disbursements
under the grant have reached to 100%.
3. The Project Development Objective (PDO) of RAP II is: Residents of beneficiary
Dzongkhags (Districts) utilize improved rural transport infrastructure and services. The last
review (end-March, 2011) concluded that the project was well placed to achieve its
development objectives. The review has rated the progress towards the achievement of PDO
and the implementation progress as being satisfactory. The project was also reviewed by the
Quality Assurance Group in May 2010 and a “satisfactory? rating was awarded.
4. The following table provides up-to-date summary information of RAP II, which is based
on the latest implementation review report (March, 2011).

C. PROPOSED CHANGES
5. Dropping two outcome indicators: The project has two components: (i) Component 1:
Rural Access; and (ii) Component 2: Capacity Development and Implementation Support.
The restructuring is not proposing any changes to the number of main RAP II components.
The PDO will also remain unchanged. However, there is a need to drop two project outcome
indicators. This is as the project initiated socio-economic study and discussions with
beneficiaries concluded that these indicators were needed to be dropped as they were likely
                                            1
to be influenced by external factors. The external factors include fuel prices, government
regulated mule rates, increase in global food prices, which are beyond the control of the
project. The indicators that are being proposed to be dropped are: (i) reduction in
transportation costs of goods and supplies from/to beneficiary villages to/from the nearest
town; (ii) lower basic commodity prices in project villages than in unconnected villages. The
development objective can still be satisfactorily measured by the remaining two outcome
indicators.
6. The proposed changes in the outcome indicators are outlined in the following table. The
monitoring mechanism of the indicators will be similar to the original project. Details of the
revised results framework are provided in Annex 1.

                                                                             target

7. Apart from the above the following changes are being proposed as part of the
restructuring:
   i)       Change in length of roads for new construction under Component 1: During the
            project preparation it was estimated that a total length of construction of new
            roads would be 64.7km. The length was estimated using topographical sheets
            (scale 1:50,000). However, during the detailed survey the length was found to be
            different from the original estimate. For three roads identified in the project
            appraisal document the variation is 2.32km. PAD also mentions that the project
            would support piloting low-cost sealing in two roads. The length of road that was
            Otta-sealed (8.2km) was not included in the original plan. This means that the
            total length of roads that are undertaken under new construction is 75.13 km
            (64.7km+2.23km+8.2km). The project description in the Financing Agreement
            needs to be changed due to this change in length (Schedule 1 of the Financing
            Agreement).


                                               2
   ii)    Change in road for Otta-Seal pilot: The road access component of the original
          project had envisaged that the pilot of Otta-seal would be undertaken on two
          roads: Riju-Bartsham road and Tangmachu-Takila road. However, Ministry of
          Works and Human Settlements (MOWHS) proposed, and agreed with IDA, to
          pilot Otta-seal on a Drametse road to avoid making an example of Otta-sealing of
          feeder roads. However, the Otta-sealing contract on the Drametse road was
          subsequently cancelled after the completion of approximately 7km, out of planned
          18km length. The cancellation was warranted as the contractor had failed to bring
          specified quality materials. The Otta-seal piloting was undertaken on Bajo-
          Shengana road (8.2km). The piloting on the latter road had considered the lessons
          learned from the earlier road. The construction of the road is now complete.
   iii)   Performance Based Maintenance Scheme: The Capacity Development and
          Implementation Support Component (Component 2) included the provision of
          technical assistance to the Pilot Performance Based Maintenance Mechanism.
          However, Department of Roads (DOR) has been piloting a Performance Based
          Maintenance Scheme, using National Work Force, on its own initiatives.
          Furthermore, DOR also engaged a consultant, with support from ADB, to review
          the outcome of this pilot and to help DOR on trying out new maintenance
          contracts. Although the IDA team provided initial input to DOR, it was decided
          and agreed to drop this activity from the project.
8. The restructuring will require an additional amount of US$ 2.598 million. The Royal
Government of Bhutan has been financing the full amount. There will be no requirements for
additional funding from the Association is (see table below).

D. Appraisal Summary
           A. Economic and financial Analyses
9.     The main tenets of the economic and financial analysis of the project will remain
valid after the restructuring the project. The restructuring proposal only deals with minor
adjustments in road lengths.

           B. Technical & quality assurance:
10.     There will be no changes in the quality assurance system in the case of restructuring
of the project. DOR also has an established system for quality assurance. Two types of audits
are being conducted to ensure quality and transparency of roadworks of RAP II roads: (i) Bi-
annual Technical Audits through the Investigation and Development Division (IDD) of
DOR; (ii) a third party audit by Standard and Quality Control Authority (SQCA), an
independent agency. The roads are under the intense supervision of the Project Monitoring
Units (PMUs) that are set up at road sites. The PMUs are headed by Project Managers
(Executive Engineer or Senior Assistant Executive Engineer level). The Project Coordination
Unit (PCU) established under DOR for RAP II has been acting as the main apex body for the
project implementation and coordination. PCU is headed by a Senior Executive Engineer as
Project Coordinator.

           C. Financial management & Auditing
11.     No changes in the financial management and auditing arrangements are envisaged
after the project is restructured. The financial management and disbursement arrangements
for the ongoing project have been satisfactory and, to the extent possible, use the existing
government systems. The PEMS system is used for accounting and the external audit of the
project is carried out by Royal Audit Authority. The project activities are budgeted within the
overall budget of Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) under a separate FIC code. Quarterly
IUFRs are used for reporting as well as for the disbursement purposes and for the ease of
reporting, local currency Designated Account is used. Currently there are no overdue audit
reports under the project and the audit reports received, have been clean and unqualified.

           D. Procurement, Social & Environmental Safeguards
12. The restructuring will not have any procurement and safeguards related implications. All
the road contracts have already been procured and all of them, barring two road sections
(portions of Drujeygang-Balung road and Khotakpa-Khar-Tsebar road are now under
construction) are physically completed. Safeguards issues of the two incomplete roads are
being addressed as per agreement with the Association. The Association is also monitoring
the safeguard performance of the two roads. The resettlement action plans for all RAP II
roads were cleared by the Association before the start of civil works. RAP II has been using
the Bhutan Country System in terms of environmental safeguards. The system produce
Environmental Information (EI) and an environmental clearance from the competent
authority is also required. Simple site specific Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is
also produced under RAP II before the finalization of detailed design, cost and bidding
document. The Association post-review the environmental procedures followed and activities
undertaken by the project.

           E. Exception to Bank Policy

                                             4
13.   No waiver of Bank policies is envisaged due to the restructuring of the project.

         F. Risk
14.   No additional risk is anticipated due to the restructuring of the project.
