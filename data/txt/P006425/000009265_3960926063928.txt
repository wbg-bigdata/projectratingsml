MEMORANDIUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A NORTHEAST RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
IN THE STATE OF ALAGOAS
1.        The following report on a proposed rural development loan to the
Federative Republic of Brazil for US$42.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years on a fixed
amortization schedule, including 3 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. It would help finance Brazil's Northeast Rural
Development Program (NRDP) for the State of Alagoas.
2.        Background.  Agriculture in Brazil has traditionally been the main
source of exports and employment, though a relatively small contribztor to
GDP. In 1985, agriculture accounted for 13% of GDP, 30% of the economically
active population and 31% of total exports. Throughout the 1970s, there was
rapid expansion in Brazil's agriculture (5% per annum); during the recession
in the early 1980s, output and investment stagnated and then recovered in
1984 and 1985. The performance of the sector in the 1970s masked sharply
disparate rates of growth among regions, farm types and individual crops.
The Northeast of Brazil covers 18% of the country's total area and has been
the nation's foremost problem region since the late 1800s. In 1985, the
Northeast had a population of 39 million, or about 29% of the country's
total, growing at 2.3% per annum. Half the population lives in the rural
areas and over 50% of the work force is engaged in agriculture. Drought and
uncertain rainfall, highly skewed land distribution, illiteracy, endemic
diseases, and limited urban employment opportunities have resulted in high
levels of poverty and underemployment, particularly in rural areas. Despite
the constraints, Northeast agriculture continues to play an important role in
the national economy. The Northeast contributes about one-fifth of the total
value of Brazilian crop production; many regionally produced commodities
(cotton, sisal, cassava and sugar) represent significant shares of national
production.
3.        In 1982, the Government requested Bank assistance in preparing a
new regionwide rural development program, the Northeast Rural Development
Program (NRDP). This initiative was stimulated by the recognition that
previous rural programs had achieved limited results in alleviating poverty
and increasing agricultural production. The NRDP, simpler in design than
previous efforts supported by the Bank, focuses on eliminating key
constraints on small farmer development, such as land tenure insecurity,
drought vulnerability, and limited access to credit and use of modern
technology. The program is complemented by the Northeast Region Land Tenure
Improvement Project (Loan 2593-BR) which finances cadastral activities in all
ten Northeast states. It will be further complemented by a series of sector
projects in education, health, water supply and sanitation. Regional program
guidelines have established (a) unified and streamlined funding and
administrative procedures, and (b) mechanisms for increased beneficiary
participation and improved institutional performance.



4.        Project Obiectives.  The proposed project would: (a) increase
agricultural prduc-tivity and production; (b) generate income and employment
opportunities for the low-income rural families; (c) promote water resource
development and technology generation and diffusion to decrease small
farmers' vulnerability to recurring droughts; (d) increase community
participation in all phases of the development process; and
(e) strengthen the State of Alagoas' capacity to provide efficient
agricultural services to small farmers.
5.        Project Description.  The proposed project would include:
construction of about 160 simple rural water supply systems; agricultural
research and basic seed production; extension services to about 32,400 small
farmers; investment credit for about 10,000 farms including 1,480 irrigated
farms; marketing support services for private traders and small farmers;
funding for community subprojects; project administration and training.
There are no environmental issues associated with the project, and improved
land use and soil and water conservation would have a favorable environmental
impact. Overall, some 40,000 low-income rural families in 49 municipalities
of the State of Alagoas would benefit from the project. Simultaneously, in
all of these municipalities, land cadastral and regularization activities
would be carried out under the regional Land Tenure Improvement Project (Loan
2593-BR).
6.        The project, to be carried out over eight years, provides funds for
civil works; equipment and furniture; rural investment credit; a development
fund for community subprojects; training; and related administrative and
operating costs on a declining basis. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$86.4 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component. of
US$9.2 million (10%). Retroactive financing of about US$2.0 million would be
provided for project expenditures (other than agricultural credit) incurred
after appraisal, but prior to loan signing. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Brazil are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6668-BR, dated May 26, 1987,
is also attached.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's lending strategy in
Brazil aims to promote and assist structural reform; to develop and maintain
essential infrastructure; to increase the productivity and improve the living
conditions of the rural and urban poor; and to protect the environment and
the local populations affected by the exeeution of investment projects. The
Government of Brazil attaches high priority to decreasing regional
disparities. Incomes in Northeast rural areas are less than 35% of the
national average. The NRDP, of which the proposed project is a part, forms a
central part of the Government's investment strategy to narrow the gap
between the Northeast region and the rest of the country and to alleviate
rural poverty. Bank financing in support of the Program has already been
approved for six state projects, one of which includes regional coordination
activities, and the Regional Land Tenure Improvement Project.
8.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the Government agreed on the
following:



- 3 -
(a) as conditions of loan effectiveness: (i) satisfactory staffing of
CEPA-AL; (Mi) creation of a State Rural Development Council, chaired by the
Governor; and (b) as other covenants (i) availability of at least 36,600 ha
by March 31, 1989 and an additional 30,700 ha by March i990 for
redistribution to project beneficiaries; and (ii) satisfactory cost recovery
provision for public domestic water supply.
9.        Justification.  Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from increases in agricultural production as a result of: (i)
increased productivity, through better cultivation practices; (ii) crop
diversification; and (iii) expansion of the cropped area through irrigation
and increased use of animal traction. At full development, about 80% of the
yearly incremental marketable production would come from subsistence crops,
tobacco and fruit, and 20% from livestock products; the internal rate of
return is estimated at 14%. Improved domestic water supply, community
activities and family wood lots would also provide substantial benefits to
the rural populatiot, especially women.  Expanded agricultural activities
would create jobs equivalent to some 8,200 man-years annually. Finally,
improved farming practices and soil and water conservation would have a
beneficial impact on the environment.
10.       Risks.  Possible risks include: (a) insecure land tenure; (b)
possible inefficient delivery of project services, (c) lack of sufficient
interinstitutional cooperation; (d) recurring droughts and cotton pest
otutbreaks; and (e) delays and shortfalls in counterpart funding and credit.
The project has been designed so as to minimize these risks. Progress will
be closely followed up by Bank staff through review of the annual operating
plans and improved supervision, monitoring and evaluation. Impleentation of
the Northeast Region Land Tenure Improvement Project (Loan 2593-BR) and of
the Government's agrarian reform would increase land tenure security.
Streamlined administrative procedures, measures for institutional
strengthening and technical assistance for selected agencies would improve
efficiency and project coordination. Crop diversification and intensified
technology generation and diffusion would make farmers less vulnerable to
drought and pest outbreaks. The Government adopted new measures in 1986 to
ensure the timely availability of counterpart funds and credit. In addition,
the regional scope of the Northeast Program and tl-e support the Program
enjoys among government and new local leaders should help secure adequate
funding and satisfactory implementation of the project.
11.       Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the articles of agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
