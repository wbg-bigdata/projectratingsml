       REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN PROGRAMMATIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANTS
                                   (PDPG4-6)
Recipient                Republic of Tajikistan
Implementing Agency      Ministry of Finance
Financing Data           SDR 13.2 million (US$20 million equivalent)
Operation Type           Programmatic (3rd of 3), single-tranche

Main Policy Areas        The series of three programmatic development policy operations (PDPG4-6) supports
                         the Government of Tajikistan’s two-pronged strategy to mitigate the impact of the
                         2009 global crisis and to pave the way for post-crisis recovery and sustained growth
                         and poverty reduction. The three main policy areas supported by the series are to: (i)
                         protect the delivery of basic services within a sustainable fiscal framework; (ii)
                         improve the environment for private sector development; and (iii) strengthen
                         government effectiveness.
                         Actions under the pillar designed to protect basic services support maintaining or
                         increasing budget allocations for health, education, and social protection services, as
                         well as implementation of per capita financing reforms in the education and health
                         sectors and development of a pilot scheme for better targeting of social assistance.
                         Actions under the pillar designed to improve private sector development include
                         reduced coverage of permits and passage of a law codifying the reduction,
                         introducing a new law governing public-private partnerships, financial sector
                         strengthening by implementing high-priority recommendations of the financial sector
                         assessment program, adoption of an aviation sector policy to liberalize the air
                         transport sector, and accelerated issuance of land-use certificates to farmers to
                         strengthen property rights and boost investments in farm improvements.
                         Actions under the pillar designed to strengthen government effectiveness support
                         improved public financial management through establishing a supreme audit
                         institution and implementation by Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgas of financial
                         management improvement plans, introduction of a new salary grid and law on public
                         administration, and completion of an energy efficiency audit of TALCO to identify
                         options for increasing energy efficiency, which would contribute to part of the
                         solution for mitigating energy deficits in the country during winter months.

Key Outcome Indicators      PHC funding as a share of regional health budget increases / is maintained.
                            Efficiency of expenditure on education improves (as measured by the proportion
                             of schools’ budget not allocated to wages).
                            Improved targeting mechanism is available for channeling social assistance.
                            Total cost of acquiring permits is reduced.
                            Cost and time of dealing with construction permits declines.
                            Farmers gain control over farm management (as measured by the proportion who
                             perceive that they can take independent production and marketing decisions).
                            Access to formal financial services increases; financial system becomes deeper
                             and more efficient.
                            Access to Tajikistan increases (i.e. number of flights, passengers, etc).
                            The attractiveness of the civil service as an employer improves (measured by the
                             ratio of applicants to published vacancies).
                            The regulatory environment improves, as evidenced by an increase in the share
                             of firms saying "licenses and permits are not a problem in doing business" and/or
                             reduction in reported management time spent dealing with public officials.

                               Financial viability of Barki-Tajik and Tajiktransgas increases (measured by
                                increase in cash collection as a ratio of total billed consumption).
                               Transparency of Energy SOEs is increased (measured by entity audits being
                                conducted based on IFRS).

Program Development         The development objectives of PDPG 4–6 are to protect basic services within a
Objective(s) and            sustainable fiscal framework, and to lay the foundation for post-crisis recovery and
Contribution to CPS         growth. The proposed operations are a central element of the Country Partnership
                            Strategy presented to the Board in fiscal year 2010. They support actions in three
                            main policy areas to (i) protect the delivery of basic services within a sustainable
                            fiscal framework; (ii) improve the environment for private sector development; and
                            (iii) strengthen government effectiveness.

Risks and Risk Mitigation   General macroeconomic risks. Overall macroeconomic management may
                            deteriorate due to a slower than projected regional and global recovery which could
                            undermine projected improvements in growth, fiscal and current account balances.
                            The asset quality of the banking sector may face greater difficulties if growth slows
                            or if more borrowers face hardships. Political or economic instability in neighboring
                            countries poses a significant risk to Tajikistan’s economic health. These risks are
                            partially mitigated: the government has prepared a fiscal policy program identifying
                            expenditures of a more provisional nature that can be cut in response to a growth
                            slowdown, and is taking remedial action to reduce financial sector vulnerability. The
                            Bank will regularly monitor progress and actively engage in dialogue and coordinate
                            closely with development partners to monitor and respond to political developments.
                            Risks related to poor governance. Tajikistan’s PFM system is characterized by
                            insufficient internal controls, inadequate transparency, weak governance, low
                            capacity, poor cash management and budget execution, all of which could undermine
                            efforts to enforce fiscal discipline and accountability. During implementation,
                            fiduciary risks will be mitigated by: (i) creating a dedicated foreign currency account
                            into which World Bank funds will be disbursed, (ii) regular reporting on the use of
                            funds disbursed, and (iii) requiring an independent audit on the use of funds provided
                            under the operation. In addition, the following actions will be required in order to
                            realize longer term progress in PFM: (i) implementation of key recommendations of
                            the PEFA, CPSR, and IMF reports; and (ii) satisfactory implementation of the PFM
                            Modernization Project. The World Bank sees closer collaboration with development
                            partners as key to moving this agenda forward as well as a high degree of vigilance.
                            Program-specific risks. Tajikistan’s institutions remain weak and vulnerable to
                            capture by special interests. Stakeholders who benefit from the current institutional
                            arrangements are likely to resist reforms that will leave them worse off. The Bank has
                            supported reforms by improving and expanding its efforts at communications,
                            emphasizing the costs of continuing with the economic status quo, and the long-term
                            benefits of reforms. Better dissemination of the findings of World Bank-supported
                            analytical work, especially the CEM, has been an important vehicle of this enhanced
                            communications effort. Implementation risks are mitigated by strong government
                            ownership of the reform program and through provision of substantial capacity-
                            strengthening support and technical assistance from development partners.

     INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
        PROPOSED SIXTH PROGRAMMATIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT TO
                        THE REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN

                                           I.        INTRODUCTION

1.    The Sixth Programmatic Development Policy Grant (PDPG6) of SDR 13.2 million (US$ 20
million equivalent) is the third in a programmatic series of three operations for the Republic of
Tajikistan. The PDPG4-6 series is central to the World Bank’s engagement in Tajikistan, as envisaged in
the FY10-13 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). It supports the government’s two-pronged strategy to
mitigate the impact of the global crisis and to pave the way for post-crisis recovery and poverty reduction.
The series builds on the PDPG1-3 series completed in 2009, and seeks to (i) protect social spending and
increase its efficiency, (ii) improve the climate for private sector development, and (iii) strengthen
government effectiveness.1
2.     PDPG4 and PDPG5 focused on protecting earlier social sectors gains, and on improving the
environment for private investment. The 2008-09 global economic crisis adversely affected Tajikistan
through lower remittances and exports. Growth slowed to 3.9 percent, from more than 8 percent per
annum during 2000-08. For social spending, the 2010 and 2011 budget allocations for health, education
and social protection were maintained at their 2009 shares relative to overall spending. The government
adopted a health sector master plan, issued resolutions for implementation of per capita financing in
general education, and introduced pilot schemes for better targeting of social assistance. To improve the
investment climate, it reduced coverage of permits and passed a law codifying the reductions. Parliament
passed amendments to commercial banking law, the central bank law, and a revised deposit insurance law
to help strengthen the financial sector. The government adopted an aviation sector policy liberalizing the
air transport market. In agriculture, it removed the old cotton debt overhang on farmers, and issued them
land-use certificates under an accelerated program. Barki Tajik and Tajiktransgas made progress in
implementing financial management improvement plans and in encouraging more efficient use of energy.
3.     PDPG6 supports the economic recovery underway following the 2009 slowdown. GDP growth
has recovered to more than 6 percent in 2010 and 2011. Accordingly, the focus of the PDPG series has
shifted from protecting earlier social sector gains to improving the environment for private sector
development and strengthening government effectiveness. PDPG6 supports continued implementation of
health and education financing reforms and ongoing efforts to improve targeting effectiveness of social
assistance. To help spur private sector-led growth, the government has submitted a new law on public
private partnerships to Parliament in August 2012, and has continued expedited issuance of land-use
certificates to farmers. It has introduced a new salary grid in all central government entities, submitted a
new law on public administration to Parliament which was approved in May 2012, approved the chart of
accounts for public institutions, and prepared the 2012 budget based on the new budget classification. The
government has also conducted an energy efficiency audit of TALCO, the country’s large aluminum
smelter, to identify options for reducing its energy use. This will have several benefits, including reducing
production costs and improving access to scarce electricity for other consumers, particularly in the winter,
which is an energy deficit period.

BACKGROUND

4.    Tajikistan is a small landlocked country vulnerable to natural disasters and the influence of
external economic conditions. Located in the heart of Central Asia, it is blessed with abundant water
resources, contributing to its specialization in cotton production. Tajikistan also has considerable
hydropower potential—inexpensive electricity has led to its other specialization: processing of aluminum.
Shortly after its independence in 1991, the country descended into a civil war that lasted until mid-1997
and brought widespread physical damage and loss of life. It is susceptible to natural disasters and is
regularly affected by floods, landslides, earthquakes, and droughts. Only 7 percent of its total land area is
arable; high mountain ranges make communication between different parts of the country difficult,
especially in winter. These factors combine to make Tajikistan one of the world’s poorest countries, with
a gross national income per capita of US$870 in 2011. Limited employment opportunities at home have
led 40 percent of the working age population to seek better jobs in Russia.
5.    Despite these difficult initial conditions, its economy grew rapidly during the past decade.
Strong economic growth, which averaged nearly 8 percent per annum during 2001-2011, was made
possible by five favorable factors: the peace agreement that permitted businesses and households to
return to normal economic activity; a stabilization dividend from the government’s success in stabilizing
the economy; the growing global and regional economy that led to increased aluminum and cotton
exports as well as rising inflows of remittances; increased development assistance, including from the
international financial institutions; and reforms that permitted businesses and households to take
advantage of emerging opportunities. In the early years following the civil war, the government opened
up trade, established a central bank and a commercial banking system, negotiated visa-free access for
workers to go to Russia and removed taxes on inflows of remittances. Private businesses and households
were given a bigger role than before as small and medium-size enterprises were privatized, and land
reform provided more land for private farms and households. In recent years, reforms have sought to
improve the investment climate, increase access to air transportation, rationalize cotton sector operations,
remove restrictions on exports, and strengthen public expenditure management and governance.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

6.     The 2009 global economic crisis adversely impacted Tajikistan through a sharp fall in
remittances and decline in exports of cotton and aluminum. The impact of the crisis was felt widely
across the country: total remittances inflows, which had grown fivefold in 2004-2008, declined from $2.3
billion in 2008 (equivalent to 45 percent of GDP) to $1.6 billion, while exports dropped by almost 13
percent due to lower international prices of cotton and aluminum. According to the 2010 Life in
Transition Survey (LITS), 58 percent of households in Tajikistan reported they had been adversely
affected by the crisis. International migration and remittances were among the main transmission
channels: one-thirds of respondents said they were affected through a reduced flow of remittances or the
return home of household members who used to work abroad. The financial sector was also adversely
affected by the growth slowdown, with non-performing loans in the banking sector rising to record levels.
The disruption of cargo deliveries due to Uzbekistan border closures added to financial sector difficulties,
which in turn led to a fall in credit flows to the private sector.
7.    The government’s fiscal management plan, depreciation of the somoni, and increased support
from development partners helped mitigate the adverse impact of the crisis. Under its fiscal
management plan adopted in response to the crisis, the government revised the 2009 budget to reflect
revenue shortfalls. It increased public spending on the social sectors (education, health, and social
protection) and expanded employment opportunities through social programs such as a cash-for-work


                                                     2
scheme and measures to facilitate entrepreneurship. Additionally, the government restrained nonessential
current spending, including operation and maintenance spending, but excluded essential nondiscretionary
expenditures like wages and salaries, employer contributions and interest payments. On the revenue side,
the VAT rate was reduced from 20 to 18 percent. Greater exchange rate flexibility and depreciation of the
somoni served as an effective shock absorber during the crisis, contributing to improved competitiveness
compared to other countries in the region, and facilitated current account adjustment (Table 1). Higher
international prices of aluminum and cotton were also important contributory factors. Development
partners provided increased external assistance in 2009—grants equivalent to 3.4 percent compared to 1.6
percent of GDP in 2008. While adversely affected by the global downturn, Tajikistan’s economic growth
of 3.9 percent in 2009 was better than most other countries in the region.

8.     Economic activity has recovered following the 2009 slowdown. The economy grew by 6.5
percent in 2010, 7.4 percent in 2011, and 7.4 percent in the first half of 2012. For 2012, this growth
reflected higher growth in industry (up 12 percent) and in services (up 13.1 percent). The agriculture
sector performed well too, expanding by 6.5 percent despite a harsh winter (Figure 1). Strong growth
during the post-crisis period has been spurred by the rebound in inflows of remittances (equivalent to
about 40 percent of GDP in 2011), reflecting a higher outflow of migrants following the economic
recovery in Russia. This in turn has led to strong growth in the services sector, which accounted for more
than one-third of the growth in 2011 and 2012. Imports surged 37 percent in 2011 and the current account
balance reverted to an estimated $153m deficit in 2011 from the $120m surplus the previous year.2

 Several factors contributed to the sharp observed rise in imports: (i) imports in 2010 were constrained by intermittent blockage
of rail transit through Uzbekistan, and part of this pent-up demand was realized in 2011; (ii) the recovery of remittances from
Russia helped fuel higher import demand; (ii) the rise in international food and fuel prices increased import costs; (iv) higher
public spending related to the 20th independence anniversary celebrations in 2011 was also an important contributory factor.

9.    Revenues have posted strong growth, and the fiscal deficit has declined. Public expenditures
have increased considerably during the past decade (Box 1). During the past 4 years, the government has
maintained generally good fiscal discipline, with the overall fiscal deficit (i.e. including the Public
Investment Program, PIP) declining steadily from 6.1 percent of GDP in 2007 to 2.5 percent in 2011
(Table 2). The improved performance in all key sectors of the economy and increase in imports
contributed to higher revenue collection, which amounted to about 27 percent of GDP in Jan-June 2012.
The Value Added Tax (VAT) continued to be the main contributor (39 percent of total revenue,
equivalent to 10 percent of GDP). Total government expenditures (excluding the PIP) were contained to
25 percent of GDP, and the fiscal accounts (excluding the PIP) recorded a surplus of 2 percent of GDP
during Jan-June 2012. Available data indicate that social sectors (education, health, and social protection)
remained priority recipients of budgetary funds, and total public spending on these key sub-sectors was
broadly in line with earlier projections.

Tajikistan’s external debt decreased from over 100 percent of GDP in 2000 to about 33 percent in 2011 (Figure 2, left
panel). A debt-for-equity swap with Russia in 2004 and reduction in external debt due to the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative reduced the country’s debt burden. Since then, public sp ending has increased steady, from an average of around
19 percent of GDP per annum in 2001-2003 to 28 percent in 2007-2011 (Figure 2, right panel). The consolidated fiscal
deficits (i.e. including expenditure on the Public Investment Program, PIP) as well as PIP-related grants and credits,
initially rose sharply in 2007, but have since declined.

Capital expenditures have increased sharply during the past 5 years, and constituted about 48 percent of total expenditure
during this period (Figure 3, left panel). Increased capital spending was mainly targeted at transport and energy projects;
the share of the PIP allocated to these sectors increased from 32 percent in 2001-2003 to 77 percent in 2007-2011 (Figure
3, right panel). The education and health sectors were also priority recipients of budgetary funds: between 2006 and
2011, public spending on these two sectors more than doubled in real terms. The share of expenditures allocated to the
social sectors (education, health, social insurance and social protection) has increased steadily from 36.3 percent of total
public expenditures (excluding the PIP) in 2001-2003 to 42.9 percent in 2007-2011.

Capital spending in Tajikistan (12.5 percent of GDP in 2011) is much higher than in other countries of comparable
incomes. Once the large infrastructure investment projects currently underway are completed, the government will have
to either significantly increase spending on their upkeep, or else find other means of paying for their maintenance and
repair. Though there has been a modest increase in “wages and employer contributions? as a share of GDP (4.9 percent
in 2011), public spending on this category continues to be much lower than in comparator countries. The government has
developed a new salary grid for public sector employees, and introduced it in all central government entities in 2012,
with the aim of eventually extending it to cover all government entities. The gradual introduction of much-needed
increases in real wages will increase the overall public sector wage bill and recurrent expenditure needs.

10. Annual inflation has been within single digits in the last three years. While reserve money
surged during the first half of 2011, the government tightened monetary policy in the second half of the
year, and managed to curb inflation to less than 10 percent. In the context of the recent IMF program, the
authorities have agreed to target reserve money growth consistent with further reduction in inflation,
while providing sufficient room for private sector credit. During January to July 2012, the consumer price
index (CPI) rose by 2.9 percent, a modest increase compared to recent trends, which has allowed NBT to
gradually lower the refinance rate from around 10 percent in end-2011 to 6.5 percent in August. Since
Tajikistan is highly dependent on food grain imports, in light of the recent spike in international food
prices the government recently signed contracts with suppliers in Kazakhstan and Pakistan to replenish its
reserves. The somoni has been stable in relation to the dollar, and international reserves accumulation by
NBT has been in line with IMF program targets.
11. The financial sector remains vulnerable. The required capital adequacy ratio of the eight largest
banks has been increased from 12 to 15 percent. Non-performing loans (NPLs) grew rapidly in 2009 and
2010, reaching a peak of 28 percent, before falling to 14.1 percent at the end of 2011. However, the drop
in 2011 was largely due to writing off cotton loans under the government’s cotton debt resolution
framework and replacing them with government bonds.3 Asset quality has again deteriorated in the first
six months of 2012, with NPLs reaching 16.4 percent in June. In line with tighter regulations, the ratio of
provisions to non-performing loans has also increased significantly. The continued practice of
government-directed lending has resulted in the deterioration of the balance sheet of one large bank,
which struggled to meet the minimum CAR, and recently led to government intervention.4 While
intervening quickly to preserve the stability of the banking system is clearly important, the IMF and
World Bank have recommended that bank resolution should be pursued in conformance with widely-
accepted principles of imposing the least cost possible on taxpayers, requiring shareholders to bear the
first costs, and holding management accountable for its actions.
12. The government has taken some steps to improve monitoring and enhance transparency of
state-owned enterprises, but more effort is needed to strengthen fiscal discipline. While nearly all the
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the medium and large enterprise sector in Tajikistan have been
corporatized, they continue to remain under state control. In 2011, gross income of the 16-largest SOEs
was about 4.5b somoni (about $950m), equivalent to 15 percent of GDP. During 2009-2011, gross
income of SOEs exceeded expenditure by about 300 mln somoni ($70 mln) per annum. Since the
expenditures reported by the various SOEs did not include allowance for depreciation of capital, actual
profitability of the SOE sector was likely considerably lower than indicated by these estimates. Many of
these enterprises face financial weaknesses, including inter-enterprise and tax arrears. Some progress has
been made in improving SOE monitoring, with a supervisory unit now set up in the Ministry of Finance
with the European Commission and IMF technical assistance to prepare and publish reports on SOE
performance. A fiscal risk assessment covering the condition of SOEs was published in April 2012, the
results of which highlight the importance of subjecting these enterprises to hard budget constraints and,
where needed, restructuring to help move towards greater financial viability. The government has taken a
few steps in this direction, including approval of a plan to restructure Barki Tajik, the largest SOE, by
2015 with assistance from development partners. In addition, sufficient resources were allocated under
the budget to help ensure all spending units remained current on their spending obligations.

  The cotton debt resolution strategy adopted in 2009 envisaged the write-off of total farm debt of around $550 million. The
government agreed to compensate commercial banks and the NBT for losses incurred as a result of financing of the cotton sector,
and issued around $100 million treasury bills in 2009 with a 2 percent interest rate and mandatory rollover at maturity.

  In April 2012, the Ministry of Finance issued 200m somoni government securities to the problem bank ostensibly to help meet
the minimum CAR, plus 500m somoni govt. securities to purchase 37 non-performing loans with a face value of 528m somoni.
However, these transactions have not been finalized, and the IMF and World Bank are in discussions with the authorities to
revisit the least-cost resolution options.

13. In May 2012, the government concluded the Extended Credit Facility arrangement with the
IMF, with most economic outcomes under the program meeting or exceeding projections. Under the
IMF-supported program, the government committed to a flexible exchange rate regime, targeted reserve
money as a nominal anchor for the economy, and pursued several key structural reforms such as
increasing social sector spending, expanding the number of large taxpayers under the Large Taxpayer
Inspectorate, preparing a revised tax code, and introducing several measures to improve the transparency
and accountability of state-owned enterprises. GDP growth averaged 5.9 percent per annum during 2009-
2011 vs. 3.3 percent projections at the onset of the program, inflation was lower than earlier projected
(8.0 percent vs. 10.7 percent per annum), external debt remained within a manageable level, while gross
reserve accumulation exceeded targets ($572m. in 2011 vs. $348m. projected earlier).5

POVERTY DEVELOPMENTS
14. Strong growth over the past decade has helped reduce poverty. According to official poverty
estimates based on the Tajikistan Living Standards Survey (TLSS) series, the poverty headcount rate has
declined steadily from 72 percent in 2003 to 47 percent in 2009 (Figure 4). Several key non-income
dimensions of living conditions have also improved. Tajikistan is approaching universal enrollment in
primary and lower secondary education with gender parity. Enrollment for 14 year-olds increased from 88
percent in 2007 to 95 percent in 2009. The under-5 mortality rate fell from 93 in 2000 to 65 in 2009.
Tajikistan also has one of the highest rates of life satisfaction in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA)
region. According to the 2010 LITS, over 75 percent of respondents in Tajikistan said that the economic
situation had improved since 2006 and 64 percent said that the political climate also got better.6 Almost
70 percent of households reported that they live better today than in 2006, and almost 60 percent were
satisfied with their financial situation. There was widespread optimism for future generations across all
age and income groups, despite the fact that Tajikistan, with a per capita GNI of $870 in 2011, remains
one of the poorest countries in the region.

15. Notwithstanding these impressive achievements, significant challenges remain. Poverty
remains widespread and linked to specific characteristics, such as high fertility and poor labor market
conditions and high dependence on remittances. The poor continue to be disadvantaged in terms of access
to good-quality education and health care services, and receive little help from the weak social protection

mortality, under-five mortality, and maternal mortality. Child nutrition, especially stunting of children
(i.e. low height-for-age) is of concern, averaging 28.9 percent of children aged 6-59 months. Tajikistan
suffers from several critical gender inequalities, which place it in the lowest ranking in ECA. The main
gender inequalities in the country include (i) maternal mortality, (ii) gender gaps in human capital, and
(iii) gender gaps in economic opportunities (Table 3).

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
16. While Tajikistan’s economy has performed well, it remains vulnerable to external factors.
Recent intermittent interruptions in transit trade through Uzbekistan and higher levied transportation
charges have also had adverse economic and fiscal impacts. Tajikistan is highly dependent on imports of
fuel and food, and on inflows of remittances. With the external economic environment continuing to be
uncertain, the main risks for Tajikistan of a global slowdown are through declining remittances and
exports. A recession in Russia—where more than 90 percent Tajik migrants are employed—would lower
domestic demand and growth and would adversely impact government revenues, leading to an increase in
the projected fiscal deficit compared to the baseline scenario. In 2010 and 2011, frequent disruption of
transit cargo adversely impacted both government revenues receipts as well as the rest of the economy.
VAT receipts constitute a large share of total tax revenues, and in turn are heavily dependent on taxes
levied on imports. Disruption of imports also adversely affected other sectors—e.g. agriculture (supply of
fertilizers and other inputs), industrial production (supply of critical inputs for aluminum production), and
services (working capital of firms tied-up in transit goods).
17. Continued implementation of structural reforms to improve governance and market-
orientation will be important to overcome domestic economic challenges. Financial sector
vulnerabilities and possible quasi-fiscal risks arising from the lack of hard budget constraints in the SOE
sector are two key internal fiscal risks. As highlighted in a recent IMF report, the completion of an SOE
fiscal risk assessment has been an important step in enhancing SOE transparency and moving towards
stronger public financial management; supporting reform of the legislative and court system will also be
needed to better-regulate inter-enterprise financial relationships and strengthen enforcement of collection
efforts.7 The IMF and World Bank teams are in agreement on the steps the government should continue to
follow to address its main macroeconomic challenges, namely to (i) maintain public debt at or below its
40 percent of GDP ceiling, (ii) further strengthen NBT governance and enhance effectiveness of monetary
policy, (iii) subject SOEs to greater financial discipline, and (iv) strengthen bank supervision and develop
the financial sector for more effective mediation of savings and investment.
18. These internal and external risks highlight the importance of prudent macroeconomic
management, and building fiscal buffers and international reserves. Tajikistan’s 2012 state budget

envisages total expenditures of 10.3 bln somoni (excluding the PIP) vs. total revenues of 10.1 bln somoni,
leading to a projected budget deficit of 180 mln somoni (0.5 percent of GDP) and unidentified financing
needs of 560 mln somoni ($112 mln). The government has projected that additional expenditures of 170
mln somoni may be needed in 2012 to implement social protection measures related to possible rising
food and fuel prices. Absent additional revenues or other identified external financing sources, a sharper
fiscal consolidation of 1-2 percent of GDP may be needed beyond the government’s baseline projections
of 0.5 percent deficit (excluding PIP) for 2012 and 0.6 percent of GDP surplus for 2013 (Table 4).8 Any
revenue over-performance in excess of current targets should be saved to help rebuild fiscal buffers drawn
down during the 2009 economic slowdown.
19. Over the medium term real GDP is projected to grow at around 6 percent a year. The outlook
for 2012 and beyond is generally positive (Table 4). Most of the projected 6 percent per annum growth
over the medium term is expected to come from construction, trade, and other services initially; with
time, exports of non-cotton agriculture, power, and mining are expected to make an increasing
contribution. Cotton and aluminum are unlikely to be as important as in the past. Starting from a high
base, remittances are expected to grow more slowly compared to the last 5-6 years. Nonetheless, they
could be a bigger contributor to future growth if a larger share is directed into private investment. The
expected sales of summer surplus electricity to Afghanistan will also be important for future growth, once
Tajikistan has resumed earning much-needed foreign exchange through electricity exports, which stopped
in 2010 due to the withdrawal of Uzbekistan from the Central Asia Unified Electricity grid.

 Recognizing the greater uncertainty in the global economic environment and need for continued vigilance, the government has
prepared a 2012 fiscal policy program for management of public finances under which it has classified the state budget into
primary expenditures needed to ensure social obligations of the state as well as those of a more provisional nature that can be cut
proportionately in response to reduction in revenue collection.

                                                                9
20. Future growth will depend on increasing efficiency and private investment. Concerted efforts
will be needed to reduce cost and raise profitability of private investments and exports, especially in
agriculture and agro-processing (Box 2). Earlier reforms in agriculture have created an improved
environment on which to build further. Increased involvement of the private sector in the economy and
improvements in governance, in particular improvements in the overall business environment and SOE
management, greater fiscal transparency and strengthened public financial management, would help make
the economy more resilient to shocks. The government is committed to making it less costly for investors
to start a business and pay taxes as well as to increase access to reliable power, in order to address the
major constraints cited by investors. Efforts are also underway to make investment in agriculture,
especially for exports, more profitable by enhancing access to markets, empowering farmers by removing
the debt overhang and strengthening their rights to land, targeting irrigation investment and improving
farmers’ access to inputs. The recent growth in non-cotton agricultural exports suggests that there is
considerable room to tap the potential for future growth in agriculture and in agro-processing, provided
there are appropriate reforms to help stimulate higher private investment, and more competitive cross-
border movement of goods to regional markets. Enhanced regional cooperation and priority public
investments in roads and energy will be important for that purpose.

                                   Box 2: Promoting Increased Private Investment

  Key recommendations from the World Bank’s 2011 Country Economic Memorandum include:
     Continue to simplify regulations and processes for starting and operating businesses.
     Make special efforts to attract foreign and regional investors with technology and market linkages in agriculture
      and agro-processed goods, by increasing transparency, and limiting arbitrariness in the application of regulations.
     Reduce complexity and non-transparency of tax administration; reduce the number of taxes and payments, clarify
      tax regulations; develop a tax manual showing clearly obligations and rights of tax administrators and payers.
     Strengthen banking sector by implementing recently adopted strategy and action plan to increase soundness of
      banks and improve financial services.
     Consider the option of establishing a special export/industrial zone area in Dushanbe and Khujand where
      businesses would have streamlined processes for investment and operation, reliable power supply etc.
     Increase efforts at regional cooperation by working closely with neighboring country governments for various
      purposes, including the goal of improving trade and transport connections to regional markets.
     Upgrade and rehabilitate a few key legs of the north-south corridor that would reduce transportation cost of
      moving goods to regional markets, and ensure better connections of the cities with their hinterlands.
     Continue to foster competition in air transport to expand access; strengthen aviation sector operations.
     Issue land use certificates to confirm family farms’ land -use rights, announce/implement elimination of old
      cotton debt of farmers, enhance timely access to working capital, irrigation, and inputs; expand availability of
      storage facilities with access to electricity.


21. Tajikistan’s risk of debt distress remains high; however, the country may soon progress to a
“medium-performer? in terms of its policies and institutions, with significant implications for its debt
tolerance thresholds. According to the 2012 Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) update by the World
Bank, Tajikistan’s external debt to GDP ratio stands at 32.6 percent as of end-2011. External debt is
largely concessional, held in broadly equal parts between multilateral and bilateral creditors, with the
share of China at 43 percent; domestic debt represents only 2 percent of GDP. Under the baseline
scenario, external debt burden indicators remain below their respective thresholds except the debt-to-
exports ratio which is significantly above the threshold, but none of the debt-flow indicators breach their
thresholds. The debt service-to-exports ratio (9 percent in 2012) and debt service-to-revenue ratio (7
percent in 2012) remain well within their respective thresholds of 15 and 25 percent under the baseline as
well as under nearly all the bound tests and various alternative scenarios considered.
22. The government has taken steps to improve public debt management. In 2011, the government
conducted a comprehensive assessment of Tajikistan’s debt management policy, functions, objectives,


                                                            10
legal and institutional arrangements with World Bank support using the Debt Management Performance
Assessment Tool. The Ministry of Finance has also prepared a draft Public Debt Management Strategy
for 2012-14 reaffirming its commitment to keep government debt below 40 percent of GDP, take on new
loans only if they have a minimum 35 percent grant element, and carry out careful cost-benefit
assessment of large-scale investment projects.
23. Tajikistan’s macroeconomic policy framework is adequate for purposes of the proposed
operation. The government successfully concluded its IMF program in May 2012, with most economic
outcomes meeting or exceeding projections, and good progress is being made in key reform areas. The
IMF has taken the lead in helping the government strengthen NBT governance; key reform areas include:
monetary policy formulation, NBT independence and role as lender of last resort, internal and external
audit processes, budgeting and monetary instruments. Through the ongoing Public Expenditure Review,
the World Bank is reviewing the progress achieved by Barki Tajik in reducing its quasi-fiscal deficit.
Through technical support from the FIRST Initiative, NBT is working to strengthen bank regulation and
supervision, move towards consolidated and risk-based supervision, develop a prompt remedial action
framework, and is in the process of implementing its Financial Sector Stability Action Plan.

       III.    THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

24. In February 2010 the government formally approved its Third Poverty Reduction Strategy
(PRS 3) for 2010–2012. Building on the first and second PRS, PRS 3 operationalizes the country’s long-
term development vision outlined in the 2006-2015 National Development Strategy. Its overarching
objectives are to promote sustainable strong economic growth and to improve the population’s living
standards, especially of vulnerable groups, through three main strategic areas:
25. The functional block aims at (i) improving overall institutional conditions to stimulate economic
growth, and (ii) enhancing the quality and scope of provision of social services, and encompasses the
following main pillars:
   Establish an effective public administration system through introduction of professional civil service;
    enhance capacity to implement development policies; improve the public financial management
    (PFM) system to enable transparent and effective use of public resources; link policy decision making
    to the budget process, and strengthen the public procurement function.
   Improve the investment climate by lowering barriers to and reducing the costs of operating business.
    This is to be done through reforms to reduce the regulatory burden, introduce one-stop shop for
    business registration, reduce the number of inspections, simplify the process of bankruptcy,
    strengthen property rights, establish free economic zones, and refine tax administration.
   Develop more effective regional cooperation to stimulate trade, reduce exposure to external shocks by
    diversifying export base and formulate a sound labor migration policy to reduce high exposure of
    remittances to fluctuations in the Russian economy.
26. The government has taken a number of important steps to strengthen public sector performance.
Following adoption of the Public Sector Reform Strategy in 2006, it has taken several measures to (i)
reform the public administration system to reduce fragmentation and clarify mandates, (ii) introduce
competitive recruitment and link pay to job descriptions to modernize the wage and career progression
systems, and (iii) modernize the PFM system. In 2010, PDPG4 supported the introduction in five pilot
ministries and agencies of a civil service salary grid linking compensation to levels of responsibility,
experience, and complexity of work. With the support of the Public Sector Reform Project, the
government has undertaken preparatory work to introduce the salary grid throughout the civil service,
including by approving a revised job classification and developing the salary grid that ensures a uniform
pay structure based on a single job classification system applicable across civil service organizations,
while ensuring that the wage bill remains fiscally sustainable.

                                                    11
27. The production block calls for improving food security by developing the agriculture sector,
addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, and resolving the chronic energy deficit in winter period along with
building capacity to export available summer electricity surpluses:
   Secure access to land-use rights for small farmers; ensure universal adherence to the freedom-to-farm
    declaration, promote equal access to land both by men and women; enhance agricultural research and
    training, and strengthen access to financial services.
   Harness the country’s significant hydropower potential; promote efficient use of energy; take urgent
    measures to resolve the persistent winter energy deficits faced by business and citizens.
   Invest in largely worn-out railroad and road infrastructure; roads upgrades include routes connecting
    Dushanbe to the Kyrgyz and Afghan border and markets in Iran and Pakistan.
28. The social block of the PRS 3 emphasizes the government’s commitment to continue improving
social service delivery:
   The recently approved health sector strategy (2010-2020) aims to improve quality, equity, efficiency
    and cost-effectiveness of the health system through, inter alia, an increase in public funding, in
    particular to primary health care (PHC).
   The National Strategy for Education Development for 2006-2015 guides the Government’s efforts in
    reforming the sector, targeted at improving the quality of high school education, increasing school
    attendance rates and addressing gender inequalities, including switching to per capita financing
    countrywide by 2010.
   Social protection reforms include work to strengthen social insurance and pension systems, improve
    coverage and quality of social assistance services, develop better labor market regulations and
    enhance management capacity; consolidate multiple social assistance programs and introduce better
    targeting mechanism to improve pro-poor focus.
29. The health financing strategy aims to improve equity, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the health
system through inter alia an increase in public funding to the health sector and in particular primary
health care, an introduction of per capita financing for primary health care (PHC), the introduction of the
Basic-Benefits-Package (BBP) at hospital level and purchasing function by means of pooling of public
resources at regional level, thereby moving away from input- to output-based financing and better-
matching needs and resource allocation. The BBP provides free services for vulnerable population groups
and a legal framework for developing the copayment policy for selected health services in hospitals. At
the same time, the BBP is designed to reinforce the role of the PHC given that the majority of PHC
services remain free to the population. The implementation of BBP in hospitals will support efforts to
formalize informal payments and to gradually move hospitals away from budget finance to a combination
of budgetary funds and fee revenues from patients.
30. PRS 3 has been developed through a participatory process. Sector working groups, comprising
government officials, civil society organizations, private sector representatives, academia, and
development partners all contributed to its development. A coordinating group was established to oversee
the process of drafting and regional consultation. The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade has
commissioned the Association of Scientific and Technical Intelligentsia of Tajikistan to conduct the
public monitoring of the execution of the PRS. As part of this effort, pilot families living across the
country will be surveyed by a program monitoring support group that includes 19 civil society support
organizations. Among the topics covered in the planned survey is peoples’ access to medical services,
education, and other such public services, with a view to developing recommendations for the
government on improvement of implementation of the national development programs.

31. The government organized a Development Forum in Dushanbe in December 2011 to review recent
economic developments and discuss reform priorities for the last year of its PRS for 2010-12 (Box 3).

                                 Box 3: December 2011 National Development Forum
A Joint Meeting of the National Development Council and Development Coordination Council was held on 12
December 2011 in Dushanbe. The purpose of the meeting was to review recent economic developments and, in
particular, to review the progress of Tajikistan’s National Development Strategy, 2006 -15 (NDS), third Poverty
Reduction Strategy, 2010-12 (PRS-3) and the 2010 Development Forum Action Plan (DFAP). Discussions during the
forum resulted in following findings, agreements and suggestions for the next steps:
Development partners cooperation and the next PRS: It was noted that the priority areas for development partner
collaboration and support were: macroeconomic growth and stability; a strengthened, more efficient and transparent
public administration; and, above all, private sector development, which included the need to attract increased domestic
and foreign direct investment. Besides, inter-ministerial working groups would be created in early 2012 to start
preparation of the next three-year medium-term development strategy, 2013-15 (following completion of PRS-3).
Economic growth: The meeting noted that growth prospects for the Central Asia were broadly positive, but with
increasing downside risks. If these materialized, it would be important for Central Asian countries, including Tajikistan,
to allow greater exchange rate flexibility, ease monetary policy if conditions warranted, and improve the quality of public
spending—specifically to protect the most vulnerable.
Living standards: Participants agreed that to sustain higher levels of growth and improve living standards, two actions
were needed from the government: to attract private investment; and to use public resources wisely.
Implementation of reforms: In the authorities’ view, some progress had been achieved in education, health and also in
access to potable water, but further strengthening of energy, transport and other economic and social infrastructure was
required. It was also noted that, in general, additional financial and technical resources were required to support
continued and timely implementation of the reforms included in the PRS-3; and that in particular, given the external risks
posed by the uncertain global economic outlook, Tajikistan needed to have an anti-global economic crisis strategy.
Agriculture: The government stressed that agriculture was a high priority, not only because of its connection to the labor
market and job creation, but also, given the periodic, artificial barriers to trade imposed by some neighboring countries.
Financial Sector: The key priorities for NBT in 2012 would be to enhance the efficiency of banking supervision in
accordance with the Basel principles, to accelerate activities of the national processing center, and to extend the scope
and activities of the credit history bureau.
Cooperation and Trade: The government informed the meeting that the country enjoyed productive relations with a
wide and increasing range of countries, with several multilateral financial institutions, and with the international
community at large. It was also said that Tajikistan hoped to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) in due course
and was in the process of trying to align its legislation with WTO requirements and standards.




               IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

LINKAGES TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
32. The PDPG4-6 programmatic series of operations are central to the World Bank’s FY10 -FY13
Country Partnership Strategy. The two main objectives of the CPS are to mitigate the negative impact
of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability, and pave the way for post-crisis recovery and sustained growth.
PDPG 4–6 support these objectives. These operations serve as the World Bank’s primary vehicle for
engaging in policy dialogue with the government and for discussions with other development partners on
how best to align support for the Government’s program (Section 3).
COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS
33. The World Bank, the IMF, and other development partners are collaborating closely to help
the government implement its PRS 3. The Joint Country Partnership Strategy signed in November 2009
by the Government of Tajikistan and 12 development partners, including the World Bank, provides a
shared framework for improving aid coordination and increasing aid effectiveness in Tajikistan. The

                                                           13
World Bank and the Fund are coordinating their policy dialogue and support programs. As outlined in the
2011 Joint Management Action Plan, the World Bank takes the lead in agriculture, energy, and
investment climate reforms. The Fund leads in advice on fiscal and monetary policies, central bank
governance, tax policy, and external trade policies. The World Bank and the Fund share responsibility for
public sector management, budget planning and execution, and financial sector reform.
34. Many development partners are providing technical assistance, policy advice, and financial
support for the reform program supported by PDPG 4–6. For example, the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) is assisting with streamlining of business regulations and agriculture
sector reforms. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Commission (EC) are supporting
the implementation of agriculture sector reforms, including establishment of privately-led agriculture
finance schemes. The World Bank, the EC, the UK Department for International Development (DFID),
and USAID are working closely to support the government’s public sector reform and public financial
management. The World Bank, EC, World Health Organization (WHO), USAID, and United Nations
Children Fund (UNICEF) are all supporting reforms in the health and education sectors. In addition, the
EC is also collaborating with the World Bank to help the government improve the targeting and
administration of the country’s social protection system. The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs
is providing technical assistance for external audit.

RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER WORK BANK OPERATIONS
35. The PDPG 4-6 series support policy reforms that are critical to the success of World Bank-
financed investment and technical assistance operations. The reforms supported by PDPG 4-6
complement the World Bank’s ongoing and planned investment projects in public administration, public
financial management, agriculture, energy, education, and health. PDPG4-6 follows the completion in
2009 of the first programmatic PDPG1-3 series. PDPG1-3 began as Tajikistan was coming out of its UN-
designated post-conflict status and thus the end-of series outcome targets were relatively modest. The
government adopted a program of reforms aimed at improving private investment climate (in particular,
actions to reduce licensing restrictions and frequency of inspections) and at strengthening public sector
management (enactment and implementation of a new Procurement law, steps to strengthen internal
financial control, introduction of medium term expenditure framework for budgetary planning). Details of
actions and outcomes are provided in the Implementation Completion and Results Report.9

LESSONS LEARNT
36. The design of the proposed operation reflects several lessons from the implementation of
PDPG 1–3 and other operations. Experience with past such operations in Tajikistan has shown that
PDPG implementation was most successful in areas that benefited from strong government ownership,
complementary technical assistance, consensus among development partners on the way forward, and
long-term engagement on the part of the World Bank Group.
   Given the importance of government ownership of the reform program, PDPG 4 –6 was designed in
    close collaboration with the relevant ministries and the Executive Office of the President.
   The Government has mobilized substantial technical assistance, expert advice, and training to support
    its reform agenda. Such technical assistance was found critical for successful implementation of
    various parts of the earlier programmatic series.
   Given the importance of enhanced policy coordination within government, the PDPG missions brings
    together decision makers across different ministries and agencies to discuss the rationale for reform,
    progress in implementation, and its expected benefits.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS
37. The World Bank has undertaken economic and sector work in virtually all areas covered by
the PDPG 4–6 series. In addition to the economic and sector work carried out recently (Table 5), the
World Bank’s analytical and advisory services have also included several round-tables with the
government, civil society and private sector representatives, and other development partners on the broad
spectrum of policy issues covered by the World Bank’s program of economic and sector work, and have
helped shape the design of the PDPG4-6 series (Table 6)

    sector environment, and government effectiveness. Commencing as it did during the peak of the 2009
    global economic crisis, the main aim of the PDPG4-6 series was to strike an appropriate balance between
    actions to mitigate the impact of the global crisis and actions to support post-crisis recovery and sustained
    growth, with emphasis on the latter rising with time. Greater attention was paid under PDPG4 to protect
    social spending and gains from earlier reforms, while PDPG5 and PDPG6 have accorded progressively
    greater emphasis on supporting growth through actions to raise private investment and to increase
    transparency, accountability, and efficiency of public resource use. Prior actions for PDPG6 are
    presented in Table 7 above. Through PDPG6 support, the government has extended to two districts the
    per-capita formula to allocate primary health care (PHC) resources. To improve the environment for
    private sector development, the government has submitted a new law on public-private partnerships to
    Parliament. The State Land Committee has confirmed that the PDPG6 target of issuing 65,000 land-use
    certificates has been exceeded. The government has adopted resolution #383 confirming the 2012-2020
    program for reform of agriculture. To strengthen government effectiveness, it has introduced a new salary
    grid and submitted a new law on public administration to Parliament. The President and Parliament have
    approved the appointment of core personnel of the new Accounts Chamber, and the government has
    secured premises for the new institution. Unified chart of accounts has been approved and the new
    administrative budget classification has been adopted in the state budget to bring Tajikistan in line with
    international standards. Finally, the government has improved collection of billed energy, and completed
    an energy efficiency audit of TALCO’s energy use to identify options for increasing efficiency. These
    prior actions are mostly unchanged from the proposed triggers envisaged earlier in the PDPG5 program
    matrix, but with some modification (Table 8).

POLICY AREAS
Policy Area 1: Protecting Delivery of Basic Services within a Sustainable Fiscal Framework
(i) Protecting the gains in access and improving efficiency of public spending on health
39. To help mitigate the adverse impact of the crisis, PDPG4 supported the maintenance of the
2010 health budget at no less than the 2009 level. Public spending on health (excl. PIP) rose from 5.1
percent of the budget in 2005 to 6.9 percent in 2008, but then fell to 6.1 percent in 2009. Under PDPG4,
the government committed to maintain the budget share allocated to health services in 2010 at no less
than 2009 levels. Health expenditures constituted 7.2 percent and 7.4 percent of total expenditures from
budget sources (excluding PIP) in 2010 and 2011 respectively.
40. PDPG5 supported the adoption by the government of the health sector master plan consistent
with the new health sector strategy. To help achieve the sector objectives laid out in the health sector
strategy and PRS 3, the government has developed a health sector master plan to guide more efficient
planning of the health service delivery system. The master plan was discussed with a wide range of
stakeholders, including at regional level, and adopted by the Government on April 1, 2011.
41. PDPG6 focused on implementation of a health financing reform, and supported as a prior action
the utilization by 2 new districts of a per-capita formula in allocating 100 percent of primary health care
resources (Box 4). Work on the full per capita financing is underway, and the per capita formula has been
discussed and revised by the Ministry of Health together with the development partners. Further
refinement of the existing capitation payment system was one of the main activities included in the
Government decree No. 536 on "New Financing Mechanisms for Health Facilities of the Republic of
Tajikistan", which specifies Ministry of Health and Finance's joint implementation of financing reforms
for the health sector in Soghd Oblast in 2012-2015. The decree was signed on 2nd November, 2011,
thereby fulfilling the health sector prior action for PDPG6. Partners supporting health-sector reform
include the WHO and other United Nations agencies, USAID, and the EC.

                     Box 4: Health: Ongoing World Bank Supported Interventions and Key Results
  The health system in Tajikistan is focused largely on curative in-patient services, with poorly paid providers that are not held
  accountable for results, under-funded Primary Health Care (PHC), and wide disparities in PHC spending across rayons. Recent
  reforms have addressed these inter-related issues that contribute to poor health system performance by prioritizing PHC and
  reform of the payment systems. Key reforms include the introduction of a basic benefits package and partial capitation-based
  financing for PHC. Through PDPG support, the government has raised PHC worker salaries, maintained increased public
  spending on health (6+ percent of the state budget in 2009-2012), adopted a Health Sector Master Plan in 2010, and is
  moving on implementing and expanding per capita PHC financing and case-based financing of hospital services.
  With the IDA support, the Ministry of Health is implementing a project aimed at increasing access to health services in
  project-supported areas, and strengthening capacity and efficiency at the national, oblast, and rayon levels in administering the
  basic benefit package and per capita financing for primary health care. With funding from Japanese Social Development Fund,
  the World Bank is supporting the Ministry of Health to address high malnutrition rates among infants and young children by
  reducing the exposure of poor people to food insecurity and by improving the long-term health and well-being of infants and
  children. The World Bank is also preparing a USD 10 million Health Results-based Financing (RBF) Project that seeks to
  contribute to the improvement of coverage and quality of a basic package of PHC services in rural health facilities. The RBF
  modality will focus on maternal and child health services delivered in PHC setting in about 8 rayons of Sogd and Khatlon
  oblasts, and will thus tackle one of the key gender concerns in Tajikistan.
  Key Results: According to data from the 2010 Life in Transition Survey, 57 percent of Tajik citizens were satisfied with the
  quality and efficiency of public service delivery in the public health system. Compared to 2006, the data show a 20 percentage
  point rise in proportion of citizens satisfied with service delivery through the public health system.



(ii) Protecting the gains in access and improving efficiency of public spending on education
42. PDPG4 protected the 2010 budget allocation for education. Education accounted for 18.8
percent of the central government budget in 2007, 18.0 percent in 2008, and 17.8 percent in 2009. With

                                                               19
support from PDPG4, the education share of the government budget in 2010 was set at 17.9 percent.
Actual expenditure on education constituted 19.9 percent and 18.1 percent of total expenditures from
budget sources (excluding PIP) in 2010 and 2011 respectively.
43. PDPG5 supported submission to Parliament of amendments to legal documents to
accommodate national implementation of per capita financing in general education. This has aligned
the legal basis for per capita financing with other laws on education financing and budgeting. The
Ministry of Education hired consultants under the Fast Track Initiative grant to consult with key
stakeholders and review existing laws to identify the changes needed. The amended public finances law
was submitted to Parliament pursuant to the Government Resolution No. 100 of March 3, 2011.
44. The government has implemented measures agreed at the 2010 Development Forum. These
included (i) reviewing the schedule and related arrangements for planned transition to 10/12 years of
general education to allow sufficient time for adequate preparation and implementation, (ii) maintaining
increased state budget allocations for education, and (iii) continuing to fully implement per capita
financing and adopt a more equitable approach to financial resource planning and allocation across rayons
(Box 5). All primary grades will soon receive new modern textbooks for math and languages which were
developed with support from the World Bank-funded Education Modernization Project. During the
academic year 2012-13 the Academy of Education will produce an advanced draft of the upgraded
standards and program for basic education (primary and lower secondary) that is gender-neutral, more
competency-based, and incorporates life skills. The Global Partnership for Education has played an
important role in enabling better coordination among the various development partners supporting the
education sector in Tajikistan. Partners supporting education sector reforms in Tajikistan include the
UNICEF, German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), EC, Open Society Institute (OSI), World
Food Program (WFP), Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) and USAID.

                 Box 5: Education: Implementation of Per Capita Financing Reforms and Key Results
 As highlighted in the 2011 CEM, even though the Tajik population is relatively well educated for a country of its income level
 (as measured by standard indicators such as enrollment and literacy), the quality of public education has deteriorated compared
 to that provided to older cohorts. Public spending on education has doubled in real terms during the last five years, but is still
 much lower than pre-transition levels. As a result, school infrastructure remains fairly poor, especially in rural areas, and there
 are large inequalities across regions. Most schools depend on funding and decisions of local governments, which are only
 slightly accountable to central government. This system results in the unequal funding of schools, hinders oversight, and
 provides little incentives for efficiency at the school level.
 To address these issues, the Government is implementing the National Strategy for Education Development 2006 –18, which
 focuses on ensuring equal access to education, addressing gender issues, improving the quality of education, and increasing
 literacy. The World Bank is helping to modernize the education system through reform of education financing, developing and
 supplying textbooks, community participation in the decision making process at the school and district levels. Using the World
 Bank and Catalytic Funds, the Government has introduced per capita based financing in education, improved sector
 management and implementation capacity, and has increased access to schools and reduced shortage in textbooks.
 Key Results: According to data from the 2010 Life in Transition Survey, 62 percent of Tajik citizens were satisfied with the
 quality and efficiency of public service delivery in primary/secondary education, while 51 percent were satisfied with public
 service delivery in vocational/tertiary education, up 6 percentage points compared to 2006 (assessment of changes over time in
 satisfaction with primary/secondary education is not possible because of data unavailability for 2006).


(iii) Maintaining an adequate social protection system
45. PDPG4 protected social protection spending in 2010. The Government of Tajikistan operates a
relatively large contribution-based pension system and supplements this with non-contributory social
pensions for poor households. However, the consolidated budget for social assistance is one of the lowest
in the ECA region—about 0.2 percent of GDP in 2009. To help protect the population from the adverse
impacts of the crisis, PDPG4 set the total expenditures on social protection at no less than in 2009 (16.8
percent of total expenditures). Actual expenditure on social protection constituted 17.3 percent and 20.5
percent of total expenditures from budget sources (excluding PIP) in 2010 and 2011 respectively.

                                                                20
46. PDPG5 supported the issuance of a government resolution to introduce improved targeting of
social assistance in at least two rayons. The pilot employed an explicit mechanism for poverty-targeting
based on proxy-means testing (PMT) methodology—i.e. deriving a “proxy estimate? of need to determine
eligibility for social assistance. In addition, the two main social assistance programs were consolidated to
facilitate and lower the cost of administration (Box 6).
47. The government has continued implementation of the program to strengthen targeting of
social assistance. It launched the pilot in two districts with support from the EC and World Bank in
January 2011. This pilot used a proxy-means test prepared by the World Bank team. The government
built a rudimentary electronic database to manage information on the pilot and has been making payments
to about 12,000 households identified through the proxy-means test. Preliminary results from evaluation
of the pilot suggest that its coverage rate of the poorest 20 percent of the population was twice as good as
for the Government’s standard program, and the pilot will be expanded to ten districts in 2013. The
government favors this step-by-step approach to piloting and implementing reforms, rather than a quick
national roll-out of the reform so that it can learn from experience and build capacity.

                     Box 6: Improving Targeting and Effectiveness of Social Assistance Programs
According to the 2010 World Bank report Tajikistan: Delivering Social Assistance to the Poorest Households, social assistance
programs lower the poverty rate by only 0.3 percentage points. The most important reason is low budget outlays: total social
assistance is not particularly generous, and in 2009 amounted to less than 3 percent of the per capita consumption expenditures
of the poorest 20 percent of households. Another reason is that the budget for social assistance is not well targeted to the poor:
only 23 percent of payments reached the poorest quintile of the population, with the rest “leaking? to better -off groups. There is
no national electronic registry of program beneficiaries, only paper files in district offices where just one paid staff member is
responsible for collecting information on beneficiaries of social assistance (in addition to other functions and responsibilities).
Given limited incentives to perform the registration function well, district-level files are often inaccurate or out-of-date.
The recently approved World Bank-funded social safety net project seeks to improve the capacity of the government to plan,
monitor, and manage social assistance for the poor through the developing a national registry of social protection and provide
training, equipment and related items for improving this capacity. This would help offset some of the worst consequences of
poverty and could contribute to addressing the impact of shocks, such as financial crises and droughts. The project will also
benefit the broader public by supporting mechanisms designed to improve targeting and reduce waste in the use of scarce public
funds for social assistance. Importantly, it would promote accountability to the public by opening channels for complaints of
abuses and for appeals of social assistance decision.
Under the ongoing pilot in two rayons in Sogd, the government has consolidated the two main social assistance programs and
decoupled social assistance from consumption of electricity and natural gas. This is important given that some very poor people
live in isolated mountainous areas where they are not connected to the grid and thus do not benefit from these transfers. In
addition, the government is using a formula for estimating the per capita consumption of each household as a “proxy estimate?
of welfare, which in turn is then used to determine eligibility for social assistance. With such a scoring formula, households with
estimated per capita consumption below a stipulated poverty threshold receive social assistance. An evaluation is currently
underway to assess the extent of success of the proxy-means-testing (PMT) methodology recently developed to identify and
deliver social assistance to the poorest households. Preliminary results from evaluation of the pilot suggest that its coverage rate
of the poorest 20 percent of the population was twice as good as for the Government’s standard program.



Policy Area 2: Improving the Environment for Private Sector Development
(i) Reducing the burden of regulations on business
48. Despite recent progress in reducing the burden of doing business,10 Tajikistan remains a relatively
unattractive country for investment with significant under-exploited economic diversification potential:
the 2012 Doing Business report ranks it 147 among 183 economies on the overall Ease of Doing Business
index—higher than Uzbekistan (ranked 166), but considerably lower than Kazakhstan (ranked 47) and the

10
     The 2011 Doing Business reported Tajikistan to be among the top 10 reforming countries for two years in a row.


                                                                21
Kyrgyz Republic (ranked 77). According to the 2009 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance
Survey, major constraints to business growth cited by firms include tax rates (55 percent), corruption (41
percent), and electricity supply (39 percent of respondents).
49.     PDPG5 supported as a prior action the submission to Parliament of a new permits law to
codify the reduction in coverage of sectors by permits in line with the recommendations of the
Government Commission for Permits Review, and to regulate the procedures for introducing new permits
(Box 7). PDPG5 also supported the establishment of one-stop-shops to enable entrepreneurs to receive
information, forms, and other services needed to start a business, including consolidated registration with
the Tax Authority, Statistical Committee, and the Social Insurance and Pension Agency.
50.     PDPG6 has supported as a prior action the submission to Parliament of a new public-
private partnership law. Though Tajikistan has limited experience in this area, public private
partnerships (PPP) are a viable option for the country to attract more investment for key sectors such as
energy, infrastructure, transport, and potentially health. While there is a law on concessions and various
other investment related laws, the absence of a PPP law and a dedicated institution or agency to
administer these agreements has had several negative consequences, including poor oversight and
transparency on concessions, limited capacity to negotiate with international investors, and a slow
processing timeframe to close deals. The government received technical assistance from the World Bank,
IFC, and EBRD to craft the new PPP law in line with good international practice, which was submitted to
Parliament in August 2012.

                             Box 7: Business Environment: Reforming the Permits Regime
 Among the many successful reforms that have been implemented in Tajikistan related to improving the business environment,
 the reform of business permits was the most challenging one. The 2003, 2006 and 2009 Small and Medium Enterprise (SME)
 Surveys conducted by IFC identified the permits regime as one of the most problematic among others. For instance, 10 permits
 issued by the Ministry of Transport and Communication regulated mobile phone operators’ activity, which officially cost
 about $23,000 for a new business entering the market, while an existing business had to spend about $2,600 to renew these
 permits annually. The actual cost that mobile operators were paying annually was much higher, as the Ministry had set up a
 network of private third-parties to assess compliance (e.g. laboratories to access the newly imported mobile equipment).
 The PDPG series supported the submission to parliament of a new permits law to codify the decisions and recommendations
 of the Government Commission for Permits Review, and to regulate the procedures for introducing new permits. This
 commission was set up by the government to implement and monitor a guillotine process to review and eliminate permits. The
 primary success of permits reform was an 85 percent reduction in the number of the permits from 609 to 85. The IFC
 conducted a Standard Cost Model analysis (SCM) which estimated that the annual savings by the private sector would be
 around $18 million. If shared between the 19 sectors of economy that represent the whole Tajik SME activity, a hefty part of
 the savings would go to Pharmaceuticals ($8.7 million), Construction ($1.15 million); Communication ($0.5 million) and the
 other sectors sharing equally the remaining 50 percent of the savings.

(ii) Reforming agricultural institutions
51.     The main objectives of PDPG4-6 are to improve farmers’ property rights and improve
access to farm inputs to help raise agricultural productivity. Through PDPG4 support, the
government undertook several measures to reduce farmers’ debt and improve the agricultural financial
system, issuing 6,390 debt write-off certificates to farmers as part of the cotton debt resolution. PDPG5
supported the strengthening of criteria for site selection for on-farm irrigation investment. PDPG 4-6
support as prior actions the accelerated issuance of land use certificates to family farms to empower
farmers and promote farmland restructuring (Box 8). The cumulative target for land use certificates issued
in accordance with agreed standards is 10,000 for PDPG4, 30,000 for PDPG5, and 65,000 for PDPG6.
PDPG6 is also supporting deepening of reforms in agricultural institutions.
52.    There continues to be good progress with the land agenda: the State Land Committee has
confirmed that the PDPG6 target of issuing 65,000 land use certificates had been met. Through support

                                                             22
from development partners, the government has created a high-level Working Group on Agricultural
Reform to help design a comprehensive agriculture reform strategy, comprising six main sub-working
groups: (i) water and irrigation, (ii) land reform, (iii) new mechanisms for agricultural financing, (iv) rural
social development, (v) local government reform, and (vi) cotton debt write-off. PDPG6 has also
supported measures to improve the enabling environment for agriculture based on action plans for reform
developed by these various sub-working groups, including the implementation of an improved irrigation
investment framework and reform of policies designed to improve farmer access to inputs.

                     Box 8: Promoting Farmland Restructuring and Sustainable Land Management
 A study examining the impact on rural households of operational efforts in farmland restructuring and sustainable agricultural
 land management was completed in July 2011 based on a quantitative survey of 1,800 farmers in 18 rayons, supplemented by
 focus groups, in-depth interviews, and case studies in eight rayons. Key findings relevant to the land agenda supported by the
 PDPG4-6 series are presented below, and highlight the importance of continued commitment to issuing family land use
 certificates, as well as future legislation, including amendments to the Land Code, to develop marketable land rights:
     Compared to 10-15 years ago, more than half of men and 44 percent of women say they are better-off; only about one in
      ten said they were worse-off, while the rest reported being the same. Qualitative results indicate that migrant remittances
      played a key role in the improved status of many households. For both farmers in lowland and upland areas, financial
      concerns such as access to credit and markets as well as farm debt are key sources of risk and problems in agriculture.
     Farms with 25 or fewer members are more likely to invest in livestock, make investments in farm improvement, and have
      two or more income sources. This confirms the findings of earlier surveys that household plots and family farms in
      Tajikistan have played a key role in observed productivity increases in the agricultural sector.
     There has been a significant acceleration in the issuance of land use certificates for family farms since 2009. The
      confidence of farmers that they control use of their land has increased significantly since 2007. In 2011, close to half
      strongly agree that farmers can make farming decisions, compared to slightly more than 25 percent in 2007 (more details
      on these findings are presented in Annex 3)
    Survey respondents reported that women were omitted from certificates in one of every ten cases, thereby adversely
     impacting their long-term rights. In about 40 percent of such cases, the social tax was cited as a somewhat important or
     very important reason for the omission (these findings have subsequently been discussed with the authorities to try to
     devise corrective measures to minimize such omissions).

 Reform and Sustainable Agricultural Efforts in Tajikistan?, Washington DC.

53.     The government has adopted a program for reform of agriculture for 2012-2020, including
an action plan for its realization, in August 2012 through Government Resolution No. 383. The 22 point
action plan includes measures aimed at reforming policies for better farmer access to inputs, improving
access to irrigation, and ensuring sustainable use and improved management of natural resources. This
reform program has been developed based on the work of the six main sub-working groups noted above,
with extensive involvement and support from all main development partners.

(iii) Strengthening the financial sector
54. The government is implementing high-priority recommendations of the 2008 Financial Sector
Assessment Program. This includes addressing weaknesses in the legal framework through adoption of
new legislation, introducing governance improvements in NBT, strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory framework, and developing institutions and infrastructure. In addition, based on the World
Bank’s 2010 Banking Sector Vulnerability Assessment and with support from the IMF, NBT adopted a
financial sector stability action plan to strengthen key vulnerabilities in the financial sector (Box 9).
55. PDPG4 supported the implementation of key first-year legal and regulatory actions, including
submission to parliament of a revised banking law and of amendments to NBT law, and the issuance by
the NBT of revised versions of key regulations and instructions in line with amended laws.11

11
  These legal and regulatory changes, among other things (i) strengthened prudential norms (e.g. with respect to insider lending
and large exposure limits); (ii) strengthened NBT’s authority to require stronger credit appraisal standards, risk management , and

(iv) Modernizing aviation services
57.      Through PDPG4 support, the government approved the national aviation policy in 2010,
which allows progressively increased access to international airlines in terms of routes and frequency;
removes any restrictions on air cargo in terms of aircraft types, size, frequency, uplift or discharge (as
long as technically feasible); ensures equal treatment at the airports for all carriers in terms of pricing,
fueling, and other services; and improves air safety through adequate funding and strengthened licensing
certification, monitoring compliance and inspection. The Bank has continued to monitor implementation
of the new aviation policy and assess the extent to which PDPG-supported reforms have helped expand
access to cheaper, safer, and more frequent aviation services (Box 10).

                                 Box 10: Situational Review of Aviation Sector Reforms
With PDPG support, the government approved the National Aviation Policy in 2010, and issued the “Government Policy
Strategy for Development of Civil Aviation of the Republic of Tajikistan?. The Bank conducted a situational review in 2011 to
measure available international travel options in terms of routes, frequencies, and airlines (competition) and to contrast these
findings against connectivity levels two years ago to determine the effect of reforms. The market analysis examined annual
available capacity at Dushanbe and Khujand airports (which account for over 90 percent of international travel). Available
capacity for 2011 was derived from airline schedules, while data for 2009 was obtained from the Official Airline Guide, a
database that includes the schedules of most commercial airlines around the world.
   Between 2009 and 2011, overall capacity from Dushanbe (i.e. total seats available) increased by about 22 percent. In 2011,
    Moscow (21 percent), St. Petersburg (9 percent), Yekaterinburg (8 percent), Istanbul (6 percent) and Almaty (5 percent)
    accounted for the bulk of total seat capacity from Dushanbe.
   In 2011, Dushanbe was connected to 28 markets in 12 countries (Afghanistan, China, Germany, Iran, Afghanistan,
    Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Russia, Latvia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Ukraine, UAE), six more markets than in 2009
    (connections added to Mazar-e-Sharif, Perm, Sochi, Surgut, Ufa, Jeddah, and Simferopol, connection to Baku terminated).
   In 2011, Eastern Europe accounted for about 50 percent of total seat capacity, followed by North East Asia (22 percent),
    South-Central Asia (13 percent), and Western Europe and the Middle-East (about 7 percent each). Compared to 2009, the
    share of Eastern Europe fell 12 points, while South-Central Asia and North-East Asia rose by 4 and 8 points respectively.
   In 2011, Tajik Air and Somon Air had the largest capacity share (27-28 percent each), followed by Ural Airlines (10
    percent), Orenair, Pamir, Rossiya, Turkish Airlines, and Air Astana (3-4 percent each). Between 2009 and 2011, Tajik
    Air’s capacity share declined by 18 points, while that of foreign carriers and Somon Air rose by 12 and 6 points.
   In 2011, Moscow was the only market with two flights per day, but seven markets offered 4-7 weekly flights, up from 5 in
    2009. In addition, in 2011 there was a choice of two or more carriers to 18 markets, up from 8 in 2009.
    In 2011, Khujand was connected to 16 markets (other than Urumqi in China, all others were in Russia). Moscow accounted
     for 31 percent of total seats, followed by St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Orenburg, and Novosibirsk (7-10 percent each).
Despite the observed improvement in regional connectivity between 2009 and 2011, evidenced by increased capacity,
frequencies, and competition to Russia and nearby Asian countries, the review found considerable scope for further
improvement to help enhance Tajikistan’s trade and tourism potential. Connectivity to North America, Western Europe, and
East Asia is still very limited, mainly because of the absence of major carriers operating to major international hubs, and the
lack of code-share and inter-airline agreements between local carriers (Tajik and Somon Air) and foreign airlines.




Policy Area 3: Strengthening Government Effectiveness
58. The World Bank has assisted the government in implementing its Public Sector Reform Strategy to
help establish legal and organizational prerequisites for improved public sector management, enhance
public access to information, and strengthen the regulatory framework. The rollout of the wage and
administrative reform measures supported by the PDPG program is intrinsically related to reforms in the
education and health sector described earlier. The 2012 budget places greater emphasis on wage and
salaries, and the government plans to continue to gradually increase compensation of employees to bring
it in line with other comparator countries. Improved equity and efficiency of public spending, better
incentives for service providers, and strengthening of accountability mechanisms are at the heart of the
Bank’s support strategy to improve public administration and service delivery. Through its Public
Financial Management Modernization Project, the Bank is helping to strengthen PFM by supporting basic

                                                              25
processes for efficient and transparent management of public expenditures and developing adequate
capacity to support implementation and sustained functioning of automated financial management
information system.12 In the energy sector, the Bank is helping Tajikistan reduce energy losses and
strengthen the financial position of Barki Tajik. Technical assistance is also being provided to strengthen
institutional capacity for energy sector reforms and for exports of available summer surplus of electricity.
(i) Strengthening capacity of government institutions
59. PDPG5 supported introduction of a performance appraisal system in the civil service. The
Government prepared a regulation on performance appraisal system in consultation with line ministries,
which was also reviewed by the Executive Office of the President, and a new decree was issued in
February 2011. In parallel, the Civil Service Department drafted an action plan to implement the new
performance appraisal system in the civil service in 2011, which inter alia involves extensive training as
well as various informational and awareness-raising events.
60. PDPG6 has supported a new law on public administration reform and introduction of a new
salary grid. The new Public Administration Law passed by Parliament in May 2012 clarifies the
functions of the executive through a three-tier structure that assigns the development of national policy
priorities to the Executive Office of the President, the development of sectoral policies to ministries, and
implementation and regulatory functions to agencies and services. PDPG6 has also supported the
development of the new salary grid for all central government employees, which has been introduced by
the Government in the 2012 budget.13 Both PDPG6 prior actions in this area have been completed.
(ii) Promoting transparent public financial management
61. PDPG5 and PDPG6 have supported the development of an external audit law and
establishment of an independent external audit body. In June 2011, the government passed the “Law
on Chamber of Accounts?, paving the way for the establishment of an independent Supreme Audit
Institution (SAI). The Presidential Decree No 1173 was passed in December 2011 providing SAI with 15
core staff. On September 5, Parliament approved the appointment of the chairman and deputy chairman of
the SAI, thereby fulfilling the PDPG6-supported prior action in this area. The World Bank has provided
advisory support to the government, especially to help develop an institutional structure for the external
audit function, outreach, and capacity building. In addition, with support through the ongoing PFM
Modernization Project, the government has embarked on further reforms to strengthen public financial
management in partnership with other development partners active in this area (IMF, EC, DFID, EDB,
and USAID).
62. PDPG6 has also supported measures to improve budget presentation and transparency. The
government has approved unified chart of accounts (UCOA) for public institutions, and has prepared the
2012 state budget based on new budget classification. Adoption of these measures (PDPG6 prior action)
has brought Tajikistan’s PFM system in line with international standards (GFS 2001), and will help
enhance PFM transparency and coverage. UCOA integrates budget and financial accounting, which
provides consistency on those types of accounting. In future UCOA can also support public sector
accounting reform aimed at implementing international public sector accounting standards (IPSAS). The
budget is published in a timely manner and available to the public. In addition, quarterly, bi-annual, and
annual reports are produced and published on the website of the Ministry of Finance.

12
  The capacity development component of the Governance Partnership Facility program implemented by the World Bank in
Tajikistan takes a holistic view of capacity development as institutional, human, information-technology, and leadership capacity,
and works with the civil service department to streamline its business processes and human resource practices to make it more
capable of achieving its goals, and in turn make civil service more attractive.
13
  The new salary grid will improve the transparency of pay in the civil service by eliminating all previous salary increments and
ad hoc bonuses, while increasing salary levels for junior professional staff, where attraction and retention had been most
problematic. The extension of the salary grid throughout the civil service is expected to help attract more well-qualified
candidates to civil service vacancies, thereby enabling genuinely competitive selection.

                                                               26
(iii) Enhancing transparency and efficiency of state-owned enterprises
63. PDPG6 has supported measures to improve transparency, accountability, and energy
efficiency in the electricity sector. Through support from the World Bank’s Energy Loss Reduction
Project, the government reform effort in the energy sector has focused on improving commercial
performance and financial transparency of the energy utilities Barki Tajik (BT) and Tajiktransgas (TTG).
Both companies have moved from the old practices of normative-consumption based billing to ones based
on actual metered billing, and are implementing comprehensive Financial Management Improvement
Programs (FMIP). As part of the FMIP, both organizations have migrated to International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS). PDPG6 has supported improvement in billing and collection by Barki Tajik
(Box 11). In addition, the Bank team has worked closely with Tajikistan Aluminium Company (TALCO),
which alone accounts for 40 percent of domestic energy consumption, to help identify options for
increasing its efficiency of energy usage. An energy efficiency audit of TALCO has recently been
completed, which has pre-identified a list of priority measures to help realize significant energy savings at
the plant. TALCO plans to prepare an action plan to implement the study’s recommendations to improve
energy efficiency.

                                                      VI. Issues in the Power Sector
                                    Box 11: Key Governance
 The energy sector fails to provide reliable electricity supply to users, while running large deficits that are financed through
 underinvestment in capital and maintenance, and tax and inter-enterprise arrears. It also impedes faster economic growth: some
 39 percent of respondents to the 2009 BEEPS survey in Tajikistan (vs. 11 percent in 2005) cited the unreliable energy supply—
 with serious rationing during winter—as the second most important constraint to doing business in the country. The winter
 power shortages, conservatively estimated above 2.5 TWh or around 18 percent of annual consumption, is a major constraint for
 economic growth, including development of new industries. Winter power shortages also affect the quality of life of the
 population, including impacts on health care and education of children, who have to endure long (6-18 hrs) power and heat cuts.
 To help improve transparency, accountability, and efficiency of the sector, the government has prepared a restructuring plan for
 BT for 2011-18, which envisages development of methodology for tariff adjustments and their determination, gradual
 unbundling of BT into separate entities responsible for electricity generation, transmission, and distribution, and their eventual
 privatization. BT has improved its billing and collection system, and installed electricity meters. As a result of gradual tariff
 adjustments, improved coverage, and higher billing and collection rates, total billings have increased nearly five-fold between
 2006 and 2011 (even after adjusting for inflation, they have nearly tripled in real terms). Furthermore, collection efficiency of
 BT, as measured as total collections divided by total billings, has increased substantially from the low point of 74 percent
 recorded in 2009; as a result total collections have more than trebled in real terms since 2006 (Table 9).

 While the government has taken steps to increase energy efficiency by residential consumers, no concerted efforts have yet been
 made until recently (please see below) to increase energy efficiency of TALCO—sector policy dialogue in this area has been
 stymied by the lack of information and hard data on concrete steps that could be taken and electricity savings potentially
 realized through action in this area. Through support from PDPG6, the government has undertaken an energy efficiency audit of
 TALCO to help identify priority options for reducing its energy use, and plans to prepare a follow-up action plan to implement
 the recommendation of the efficiency audit. This work is being carried out in close collaboration with the Public Expenditure
 Review (PER), and Institutional and Governance Review (IGR) teams, and has potentially very high payoffs, as even modest
 improvements in TALCO’s energy efficiency (e.g. 10 percent reduction in energy consumption) would help significantly
 improve access to scarce electricity for other domestic consumers.

                                                               27
                                      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
64. A key objective of the PDPG series is to protect delivery of basic services (health, education,
and social protection) and support implementation of reforms designed to ensure more equitable
resource allocation across regions. Introduction of partial capitation in primary health care and greater
emphasis on maternal and child care is also expected to have positive equity and gender impacts. The
social assistance pilot supported by the series is expected to help the government design and eventually
scale-up an improved social assistance program nationwide. This program will use refined targeting
mechanisms to channel resources to needy households. Given Tajikistan’s vulnerability to natural
disasters, the presence of on-the-ground improved social assistance programs is particular important, as it
provides the government with the ability to potentially scale-up these programs in response to increased
needs. The government launched the pilot in two districts in January 2011, and has been making
payments to about 12,000 households identified through the improved proxy-means test. Preliminary
results from evaluation of the pilot suggest that the coverage rate of the poorest 20 percent of the
population was twice as good as for the Government’s standard program.
65. Other program-supported measures are also expected to have pro-poor impacts. According to
official statistics, agriculture accounts for more than half of total employment. Labor force participation
rates of women and men have increased by 15 and 13 percentage points over the last decade. In the
medium term, strengthening farmers’ rights to land and improving access to inputs is likely to lead to
greater agricultural profitability, reduced production risk, and lower rural poverty. The 2009 Cotton Farm
Survey showed that women working in cotton farms outnumber men by a factor of nearly 3 to 1.
Promoting greater freedom to farm and choice of which crops to grow therefore has both positive gender
and poverty reduction impacts. Similarly, poor households and women are also more likely to benefit
from efforts to improve the business environment and reduce the regulatory burden: for example, the time
needed to register a business in Tajikistan is higher for women than men.14 The new PPP law is expected
to help spur private investment and growth.
66. Similarly, more reliable energy services will help promote growth—essential for poverty reduction.
Improved billing and collection in the energy has helped establish a more equitable system, with
electricity tariffs in Tajikistan continuing to be quite low in relation to other comparator countries.
Finally, there is no expected poverty or social impact from implementing performance appraisal scheme
or from introduction of the law on public administration (neither of these envisages lay-off of public
sector employees). An improved incentive framework for service providers is expected to have a positive
impact on public service delivery. Citizen satisfaction with service delivery in Tajikistan, though low
compared to other ECA countries, has improved in recent years. Citizens’ satisfaction with education was
higher than most other public services: in 2010, 62 percent were satisfied with the quality and efficiency
of primary and secondary services received during the past 12 months (Table 10). Fifty seven percent of
Tajik citizens were satisfied with the quality and efficiency of public service delivery in the public health
system; compared to 2006, the data show a 20 percentage point rise in proportion of satisfied citizens.
67. An important objective of the program is to strengthen national monitoring systems to track
poverty and human development outcomes. With the support of a 2-year trust fund financed by DFID,
the World Bank has substantially increased technical assistance provided to the government. The target
audience includes local data collection agencies, researchers, government policy makers, and other
development partners in Tajikistan. To-date, joint analytic work has been initiated in a number of areas,
with the findings of these studies expected to feed into the government’s ongoing policy formulation
process, including being used in the development of the Government of Tajikistan’s Fourth Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS 4) for the period 2013-2015 (Box 12).

                                  Box 12: Central Asia Poverty Analysis Support Project
The main objectives of this DFID-funded TA project are to contribute to improved social policies by increasing in-country
capacity to collect policy-relevant and gender-disaggregated data through integrated multi-topic household surveys, analyze
these data, and utilize the analysis in policy formulation. To this end, the program focuses on the following main activities:
    Facilitate greater interaction and information exchange between data producers and users
          Full-time national staff recruited to serve as primary points of contact for all project-sponsored activities. Inception
          workshop held in Dushanbe (MoEDT PRS unit, Statistics Committee, Economic Institute, Strategic Research Center).
          Accelerated Data Program training at Stat Agency, followed by on-the-job consultation with staff at their departments.
          The next step is to prepare data dissemination packages for all key household surveys (including unit-record data as
          well as relevant documentation) to aid use by in-country analysts and research community.
    Provide TA to strengthen local analytic capacity both within and outside government and to improve availability of locally
     produced analytical outputs of requisite high-quality. Analytic work initiated in Tajikistan on:
               Equity of public spending on health and education
               Satisfaction with life and public service delivery completed
               Impact of recent electricity tariff increases on the poor
               Labor Market, Remittances, and Poverty: Assessing Recent Trends and Developments
               Definition of the middle-class: Profile of key characteristics and trends
               Comparison of HBS and TLSS-based poverty estimates
    Promote peer-assisted learning and experience-sharing from other countries in the region.
          First ADEPT training (core modules: Poverty and Social Protection) for staff from National Statistics Office, PRS unit
          of Ministry of Economy; and selected agencies outside government. PRS unit staff has requested TA in identification
          and analysis of the middle-class in Tajikistan using TLSS data.
          Activities planned for 2012 include sharing experiences from other CIS countries (and possibly other countries outside
          the region) that have built upon common HBS platform to add modules to collect policy-relevant poverty data
Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade has requested technical assistance from the World Bank in the
preparation of the 2013-2015 medium term strategy (MTS) for national development and poverty reduction. A consultant has
been hired to work closely with the ministerial team and the working-level groups responsible for developing the MTS, and will
provide advice on the content and coverage of the MTS, the methodologies to be used, as well as on the process of the
formulation of the MTS using best international practice and guidance developed by the Bank and the Fund.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
68. Policy reforms supported by PDPG6 are not expected to have adverse impacts on the
environment and natural resources. The measures supported by PDPG6 are primarily geared at
enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of spending in the social sectors, strengthening government
effectiveness, and helping to pave the way for post-crisis recovery and growth. Positive impacts on the
environment are expected through measures such as farmland restructuring. International experience has
shown that command-economy approaches to agriculture and/or insecure tenure contributes to land
degradation. The PDPG4-6 operations support farmland restructuring, whereby larger government-
directed farms are being broken down into smaller family farms. The tenure security associated with the
issuance of land use rights to families strengthens the incentive framework for sustainable natural
resource management and empowers the families to have more control over farm management. The
program of reform of agriculture for 2012-2020 recently formally approved by the government is
supported by a 22-point action plan to help realize its implementation. Envisaged actions, many of which
are already underway, include several which are expected to reduce environmental degradation and
promote more efficient use of natural resources in Tajikistan. These include raising public awareness on
measures to prevent degradation of natural resources, development of a draft law on pastures, improved
cropping patterns, as well as development of proposals for commercialization of promising
environmentally friendly energy-efficient technologies in the agricultural sector.
IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION
69. The Ministry of Finance will be responsible for overall implementation of the proposed operation
and for coordinating actions among other concerned ministries, agencies, and departments, with
additional help to be provided by the State Advisor of the President of Tajikistan for Economic Policy.
The Executive Office of the President will be responsible for implementing the public sector reforms. The
agencies and line ministries involved (NBT, agriculture, energy, and transportation, and labor) are
accountable for implementing the reforms under their responsibility. The State Committee for
Investments and State Property Management will be responsible for overseeing policy actions related to
streamlining business regulations. World Bank staff will monitor actions and review progress using the
Program Policy Matrix.
FIDUCIARY ASPECTS
70. Starting from a very low base, there has been some progress recently in strengthening public
financial management systems. The 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment
(PEFA) highlighted a number of weaknesses in Tajikistan’s PFM system, including poor systems of
public accountability and weak mechanisms for public sector transparency; weak internal control systems
and internal audit function; weak institutional capacity to implement some of the budget reforms being
undertaken; fragmented budgets and poor cash management; and weak capacity within the legislative
bodies to provide effective oversight over the working of the government. The World Bank’s PFM
Modernization Project is addressing many of these weaknesses. The Bank and other development partners
have provided advisory support to the government on establishing an independent external audit function,
and a law on external audit was passed by the Parliament (a PDPG5 prior action) and approved by the
President in June 2011. The EC has supported the establishment of internal audit function that resulted
into adoption of the internal audit law and establishment of internal audit units in key pilot ministries. The
IMF has provided technical assistance on budget classification issues and SOE monitoring, aiming to
reduce quasi-fiscal activity and increase transparency. Monitoring of fiscal aspects of large SOEs has also
been improved. Other steps towards strengthening the PFM system include the revision to the organic
budget system and changes made in the budget classification system. A PFM strategy has also been
drafted aiming to implement an electronic financial management information system, and a full Treasury
Single Account has been introduced at the Republican level with support from the development partners.
A Public Sector Accounting Strategy has been developed together with a proposal for step-by-step


                                                     30
introduction of Public Sector Accounting Standards. Other complementary reforms in the social sectors—
in particular the per capita financing reforms, improvements in equity and efficiency of public spending,
and efforts to improve the overall incentive framework for public service providers and make them more
accountable—are also playing an important role in strengthening overall public financial management.
71. Due to weaknesses in the overall PFM structure most World Bank-financed projects in
Tajikistan do not rely on country systems of accounting, reporting, and audit . However, with
reforms being undertaken in the country’s PFM systems, including implementation of the PFM strategy,
as well as planned introduction of international public sector accounting standards and establishment of a
Supreme Audit Institution (a PDPG6 prior action), the World Bank and other development partners may
begin to progressively rely on some elements of the country’s PFM system.
72. Foreign exchange environment. The IMF’s most recent safeguards assessment that was
completed in June 2010 noted that Tajikistan has taken initial steps to address the risks identified by the
special audit on cotton sector financing. However, considerable safeguard risks at the NBT remain. Both
the accounting and the organizational structure are still fragmented; due to the weak internal audit
function and an absence of any oversight bodies, access to broad and complete information remains
restricted. Consequently, there is a need to further enhance data systems and the transparency of
operational integrity. Restoring the credibility of the central bank and building the required capacity in
key functions, such as internal audit and financial reporting will require more time. The last safeguards
assessment recommended several measures to address these weaknesses, mainly in the areas of financial
accounting and reporting and auditing.
73. The external audit of the NBT’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010 resulted
in the auditor issuing a modified opinion, similar to the opinion issued on the financial statements for the
eight months ended December 31, 2009. However, the audit results of the financial statements for 2011
were unqualified and have been published in September 2012 on the NBT website. Given the weaknesses
in the PFM arrangements, as well as the risks identified earlier at NBT (i.e. prior to the recently-released
2011 financial statements), dedicated foreign currency and local currency deposit accounts will be opened
at the NBT, in the name of the Ministry of Finance, to receive funds under the operation.
74. The recent country procurement status review has provided recommendations to improve the
public procurement system. The 2012 Country Procurement Status Review (CPSR) by the World Bank
has concluded that while the public procurement legislative and regulatory framework in Tajikistan has
evolved considerably since its inception 15 years ago, there is still room for improvement in certain
aspects of public procurement. The study notes that the procurement system would benefit from revisions
to the legislative framework to help ensure the various instruments are comprehensive, coordinated, and
current; developing implementation regulations that detail matters set out in the public procurement law;
better integration of procurement reforms with other ongoing reform efforts targeted at improving public
administration, public financial management, and audit, accountability, and strengthening anti-corruption
measures; separation of the function of regulation from conducting procurement; and strengthening
capacity for collection, maintenance, analysis, and dissemination of procurement data. The CPSR presents
an action plan with key recommendations to improve the public procurement system, including (i) review
and revision of the procurement legislative framework, (ii) preparation of a strategy including indicators
for better performance monitoring and evaluation as well as improved contract management procedures,
(iii) better integration of procurement with public financial management, (iv) expedited decentralization
of the procurement function to procuring entities, (v) establishment of a reliable system to collect and
report procurement information, and (vi) various other training and capacity-building activities. The draft
report and recommendations are being discussed with the authorities to develop a time-bound action plan
as well as to identify capacity-building support and technical assistance needed to implement the report’s
main recommendations. If relevant, the World Bank may also consider supporting this reform effort
through the proposed follow-up development policy grants series.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING
75. The administration and accounting of the Grant will be the responsibility of the Ministry of
Finance. The proceeds of the Grant will be deposited into a foreign currency designated account opened
for the purpose in the National Bank of Tajikistan (the Central Bank), and will be converted into local
currency to cover budget expenditures, or will be used for refinancing foreign debt repayments. The
Ministry of Finance will be responsible for the Grant administration and for preparing the withdrawal
application, and maintaining the withdrawal application as required. The Ministry of Finance, with the
assistance of NBT, will maintain records of all transactions under the Grant in accordance with sound
accounting practices. The Ministry of Finance of the Recipient will provide confirmation of the amounts
received and withdrawn from the deposit accounts, and ensure that the proceeds of the Grant are not used
for ineligible expenditures defined in the IDA “negative list? as agreed during negotiati ons and specified
in the Financing Agreement. The final statement on the utilization of the proceeds of the foreign currency,
showing the total amount deposited into the deposit accounts and the transactions from these accounts
will be independently audited in accordance with terms of reference agreed with IDA and by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA. The audit of the deposit account is to be conducted once at the end of the
fiscal year following utilization of the final balance in the deposit accounts. The audit reports for PDPG 4
and PDPG 5 were unqualified and revealed no issues of concern, but were delayed. The audit report for
PDPG 6 is due within six months of the final withdrawal from the Deposit Accounts.
RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
76. Successful implementation of the reform program faces three main risks: general macroeconomic
risks, risks related to poor governance and corruption, and program specific risks.
 General macroeconomic risks. First, overall macroeconomic management may deteriorate due to a
  slower than projected regional and global recovery which could undermine projected improvements in
  growth as well as in fiscal and current account balance. Second, the asset quality of the banking sector
  which has relatively high non-performing loans may face greater difficulties if growth slows or if more
  borrowers face hardships. Third, political or economic instability in neighboring countries poses a
  significant risk to Tajikistan’s economic health; recent border closures disrupted trade and had an
  adverse impact, and there remains uncertainty about how this is likely to play out in the coming
  months. These risks are partially mitigated: the government has prepared a fiscal policy program under
  which it has identified expenditures of a more provisional nature that can be cut in response to a
  growth slowdown and consequent fall in revenue collection, and is taking remedial action to reduce
  financial sector vulnerability with support from the IMF and the World Bank. The World Bank will
  regularly monitor progress and actively engage in dialogue and coordinate closely with development
  partners to monitor and respond to political developments. However, some residual macroeconomic
  risks remain, and may have an adverse impact on the poor were they to materialize.
 Risks related to poor governance. Tajikistan’s PFM system is characterized by insufficient internal
  controls, inadequate transparency, weak governance, low capacity, poor cash management and budget
  execution, all of which could undermine efforts to enforce fiscal discipline and accountability. During
  implementation, fiduciary risks will be mitigated by: (i) creating a dedicated foreign currency account
  into which World Bank funds will be disbursed, (ii) regular reporting on the use of funds disbursed,
  and (iii) requiring an independent audit on the use of funds provided under the operation. In addition,
  the following actions will be required in order to realize longer term progress in PFM: (i) satisfactory
  implementation of key recommendations of the PEFA, CPSR, and IMF reports; and (ii) satisfactory
  implementation of the PFM Modernization Project. The World Bank sees closer collaboration with
  development partners as key to moving this agenda forward as well as a high degree of vigilance.
  However, some risks related to the weak PFM system remain and cannot be fully mitigated.
 Program-specific risks. Tajikistan’s institutions remain weak and vulnerable to capture by special
  interests. Stakeholders who benefit from the current institutional arrangements are likely to resist

                                                    32
reforms that will leave them worse off. The World Bank has supported reforms by improving and
expanding its efforts at communications, emphasizing the costs of continuing with the economic status
quo, and the long-term benefits of reforms. Better dissemination of the findings of World Bank-
supported analytical work, especially the CEM, has been an important vehicle of this enhanced
communications effort. Implementation risks are mitigated by strong government ownership of the
reform program as well as through provision of substantial capacity-strengthening support and
technical assistance from development partners. Nevertheless, the above risks related to weak
institutions and their capture by special interests remain significant, and cannot be fully mitigated.

        Ref#23.1/I-8

        Your Excellency Mr. President,

         Let me express my sincere gratitude to you and World Bank Group for your continuous support
provided to the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan in implementation of social and economic and
institutional reforms.

        This letter on development policies (hereinafter referred to as LDP) is submitted to inform of the
progress and recent changes in social and economic situation in Tajikistan and relevant actions for the
following mid-term perspective. It is based on the fundamental strategic documents of the Republic of
Tajikistan, including the National Development Strategy up to 2015 (hereinafter referred to as NDS),
World Bank Country Partnership Strategy (hereinafter referred to as CPS) and Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper for 2010-1012 (hereinafter referred to as PRSP). In addition it should be noted that the
National Development Forum (hereinafter referred to as NDF) was organized by the Government in
Dushanbe in December 2011 with the support of development partners, to review recent economic
developments and to discuss Tajikistan’s reform priorities for the last period of PRSP.

         Overall vision of the state within the strategic development of the country in a long term
perspective is reflected in the NDS and the CPS, while PRSP is a mechanism for implementation of the
NDS objectives and tasks in a medium term perspective. In addition, the LDP is also drafted based on
sector strategic documents such as Public Administration Reform Strategy (2006), the National Education
Sector Development Strategy (NEDS) and National Health Sector Development Strategy (NHDS) which
are presently being implemented under support of development partners.

        Under CPS for 2010-2013, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan closely cooperates with
World Bank in the context of the Programmatic Development Policy Grants (hereafter referred to as
PDPG) to implement reforms and development of social sector, key sectors of economy including energy,
agriculture, transport infrastructure, aviation, including improvement of public administration efficiency
and promotion of entrepreneurial activity.

        PDPG actions are aimed at ensuring a sustainable economic development, public sector reform,
private sector development, and improving quality of provision of public services in social area. The
Government of the Republic of Tajikistan continues to be fully committed to implement these reforms


                                                    34
under PDPG as elaborated in the earlier LDPs dated March 7, 2010 and April 7, 2011, which is proved by
success achieved in implementing five previous PDPG, as well as ongoing discussion of the reform
program under the sixth tranche.

                  I. MANAGEMENT OF THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATION
         Tajikistan’s economy is continuing its steady recovery following the adverse impact of the 2009
global economic crisis, when the GDP growth rate fell to 3.9 percent. Following the 6.5 percent and 7.4
percent growth recorded in 2010 and 2011 respectively, the economy grew by 7.4 percent in the first half
of 2012. Economic growth this year has been spurred by higher growth in industry (up 12 percent) and in
services (up 13.1 percent). Despite a harsh winter, the agricultural sector has performed well too, and
grew by 6.5 percent. Remittance inflows have continued to grow steadily following the sharp drop
recorded in 2009, and reached $1.36 billion in Jan-June 2012 (up 17 percent compared to the same period
last year).

         The Government of Tajikistan has successfully implementing its reform program supported by
the IMF’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF), and met or over-performed on all the end-December 2011
performance criteria and indicative targets. Economic outcomes during 2009-2011 were strong: real GDP
growth rates generally exceeded earlier projections, inflation came in below forecast, external debt was
kept in check, and gross reserve accumulation exceeded targets set under the original program.
Investment spending remained strong while the government managed to increase social sector spending
and introduce much-needed public sector salary increases. In addition, progress was also achieved in
increasing transparency at the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) activity and in the financial operations
of state-owned enterprises, as well as in reforming the tax code. At present we are considering and
discussing possibilities to implement a new Program with the IMF.

          While non-performing loans have largely stabilized, weaknesses in some financial institutions
remain a concern and one bank recently faced challenges with respect to meeting established prudential
criteria. We recognize that government-directed lending played a key role in creating these problems, and
we will end this practice immediately. NBT received technical assistance missions from the IMF and
World Bank, and in relation to the bank facing challenges we are committed to finding a credible,
equitable, and lasting solution. In this regard we will (i) undertake a review and revision of the bank’s
end-year financial statements, as needed, to conform to International Financial Reporting Standards and
NBT regulations; (ii) develop and implement an activity plan to resolve this bank by November 30, 2012,
that will include a recovery program for the bank’s delinquent loans that led to its balance sheet
deterioration; (iii) reduce equity as appropriate and adjust other instruments of ownership to the extent
necessary to absorb losses; (iv) hold the bank’s senior management accountable in strict compliance with
the legislation of RT, the NBT regulations, and the operational norms of joint stock companies; and (v)
work with the IMF and the World Bank to achieve strict compliance with the international best practices.
At the same time, all efforts will be made to minimize the burden on the budget.

         In 2012 the Government of Tajikistan seeks to achieve GDP growth of at least 7 percent and limit
inflation to 10.5 percent. Recognizing the greater uncertainty in the external economic environment, the
government has prepared a program for management of public finances under which it has classified the
state budget into primary expenditures needed to ensure the state’s social obligations, and those of a more
provisional nature that can be cut in response to unexpected revenue shortfalls. We will protect social
spending from possible cuts, and use any additional donor grants that are available for spending in this
area.

        Given the need to balance pressing social and development needs against limited domestic
resources, we intend to target a deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP (excluding the externally financed public

                                                    35
investment program—PIP) to help ensure that the economic recovery does not falter, and the government
can increase social spending. In the medium term, we hope that a more favorable international
environment will pave the way toward higher growth and external balance. In the fiscal area, we will
balance the pressing spending needs in the social and infrastructure areas, while broadly aiming for
overall fiscal balance (excluding the PIP) with a view to keeping government debt below the ceiling of 40
percent of GDP that we have set in our debt strategy.

  II. PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT, INVESTMENT CLIMATE FACILITATION AND
                        FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMS
        Creation of more favorable investment climate and private sector development are the priority
reforms of the country. Significant progress has already been achieved in several sectors —notably major
reforms in agriculture underway since 2009 and continued efforts to rehabilitate and modernize the
country’s energy and transport infrastructure. The improved business environment is exemplified by
Tajikistan’s performance as a top reformer in the World Bank/International Finance Corporation’s Doing
Business in 2010 and 2011.

         At the 2011 NDF, the government reaffirmed its commitment to continue implementing key
measures to improve the business environment. In relation to the financial sector, these include a properly
sequenced roadmap to strengthen the banking system, enhance the NBT’s regulatory role, and expand the
banking system’s capital base. We continue implementation of reforms to improve the business
environment based on ongoing collaboration with private sector and civil society institutions, as well as
linked to Doing Business indicators. We plan to submit to Parliament shortly further amendments to the
customs code to simplify trade procedures by reducing the number of documents required for trade. Last
year we enacted a law on permits codifying the reduced list of permits recommended by the Government
Commission for Permits Review and regulating the process for introducing new ones. Attracting more
private investment, particularly in public infrastructure, energy, and the social sectors, is a key strategy
priority for the government, for which public private partnerships are a viable option. The Working Group
entrusted by the government has developed a new public private partnership in accordance with
international best practices and standards, which was approved by the Government on August 29, 2012
and submitted to the Parliament.

         There have been a number of achievements in the energy sector in the areas of energy
conservation, loss reduction, and improved governance. In this regard, we recognize that continued
institutional reforms in both OJSHC Barki Tajik and OJSC Tajiktransgas are prerequisite for attracting
private and public investments. The government’s main priority is to export energy surpluses in the
summer and to reduce rapidly the energy deficits in the winter. The government is committed to continue
working with its development partners towards (i) completing reforms in OJSHC Barki Tajik and OJSC
Tajiktransgas; (ii) adjusting electricity tariffs and improving collection rates to ensure full-cost recovery,
along with appropriate social protection schemes for low income consumers; (iii) energy conservation and
loss reduction; and, (iv) undertaking all necessary measures to significantly reduce the winter energy
shortages by 2015. To ensure energy efficiency, we have completed an energy efficiency audit of SUE
TALCO with help from the World Bank; the government plans to issue a resolution by end-2012
adopting a time-bound action plan to implement its recommendations to reduce energy used per unit of
production.

         Construction of additional road and railroad track are key measures needed to boost regional trade
integration. At the same time, we recognize that the transport sector faces similar institutional challenges
as the energy sector in financing and management. The government plans to work with development
partners to prepare a transport action plan, and to take measures to (i) improve traffic planning and
management; (iii) ensure that road user charges reflected full economic costs; and (iii) implement national

aviation policy, including access to international airlines. We also remain fully committed to
implementation of the aviation policy aimed at expanding access to cheaper, safer, and more frequent
aviation services.

         The provision of rights to land is a fundamental issue in the context of improvement of private
investment prospects of the agricultural sector. Restructuring of agricultural lands by issuance of land use
certificates to family farms is one of the government’s main reform priorities. A precondition for having a
private-sector led financing mechanism will be the ability to use land-use rights as collateral. We are
working closely with the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other donors on the implementation
of the action plan. We are also seeking donor financing for the agriculture sector to ensure that farmers
have sufficient access to credit under the new mechanisms being developed.

        At the 2011 NDF, the government prioritized the following measures related to the agricultural
sector in consultation with development partners: (i) completion of the “Action Plan on Reforming the
Agricultural Sector? (Resolution 406); (ii) continued implementation of ongoing reforms such as
“freedom to farm,? (iii) issuance of land use certificates, farmland restructuring, etc.; (iv) development of
an action plan for trade, tax and rural finance regulatory reforms to increase farmers’ access to inputs,
financing, advisory services, and markets; and (vi) reform of existing support services services—input
supply, marketing / processing, training/veterinary services—to the needs of new smallholder-based
agriculture.

                             III. PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION REFORMS

         With assistance from the World Bank, we are continuing steps to improve social sector outcomes
and to strengthen the civil service. In the health sector, this involves allocating resources in an asymmetric
fashion favoring primary health care. We have introduced a basic benefits package along with partial
capitation-based financing for primary health centers. In education, we are implementing the 2006-2018
National Strategy for Education Development to help ensure equal access to education, address gender
issues, and improve the quality of education. We have launched the pilot for the reform of social
assistance in Yavan and Istaravshan districts, which consolidates the two largest social assistance
programs and applies a proxy-means test to identify the poorest households. We also plan to build a
National Registry for Social Protection to manage applications, eligibility decisions, and payments.

        To help improve the linkages between performance and pay, we have instituted a new civil
service performance appraisal system along with measures linking performance appraisal to the new
salary grid developed for all central government employees. The government has rehabilitated the Civil
Service Network connecting 47 agencies across the country, and is completing the process of automation
and on-line operation of the Civil Service Registry. Implementation of the Treasury Single Account at the
republican level has now been completed, and expansion to other entities is planned during 2013-2014.
Other recent noteworthy achievements include the adoption by government of the 2011-2016 Treasury
Modernization Program and the 2011-2018 Public Accounting Reform Strategy.

        We seek to raise the revenue-to-GDP ratio over time to create space for pressing spending needs.
The government is implementing the 2011-2015 tax administration reform strategy approved by the
cabinet with a view to building capacity in tax administration and improving the quality of tax
administration services, and increase collection of budget revenue. We have expanded the number of
large taxpayers covered by the Large Taxpayer Inspectorate and are planning to adopt a new function-
based organizational structure for the Tax Committee in 2012. With the help of technical assistance from
the IMF and the World Bank Group, we have undertaken a comprehensive review of tax policy with a
view to formulating a strategy for reform of the tax regime and decreasing our reliance on non-tax
revenues. The revised tax code was approved by the lower House of Parliament on September 5, 2012.

                                                     37
         We are pursuing steps to further enhance public financial and debt management, and received
technical assistance from the World Bank in formulating an improved medium-term debt management
strategy. We have recently adopted a law on internal audit and state financial control, an external audit
law, as well as a new law on public administration. We also established the Chamber of Accounts and
appointed the management staff for the Chamber. We are taking steps to address financial weaknesses—
including inter-enterprise and tax arrears—in key state owned enterprises (SOEs) and put them on sound
financial footing. We seek a lasting and financially viable means of addressing these problems, and to
subject SOEs to financial discipline going forward. For the near-term, we have ensured that the 2011 and
2012 budgets include sufficient resources for all spending agencies to remain current on their obligations.
A fiscal risk assessment covering the condition of SOEs was completed in April with donor-supported
technical assistance. We are also working closely with the World Bank and other development partners to
strengthen public financial management through the Public Financial Management Modernization
Project.


                                            CONCLUSIONS

        Taking into account the current social and economic reforms, initiatives and actions aimed at
improving country’s investment climate and private sector development, the Government of the Republic
of Tajikistan is firmly committed to continue implementing respective critical reforms to promote a
sustainable economic growth and improvement of quality of the public services.

        In this context, the World Bank support of the actions of the Government of the Republic of
Tajikistan in implementation of the reforms will be significant through approval of the Programmatic
Development Policy Financing.

        We hope for further fruitful cooperation with the World Bank in implementation of the above
reform agenda.

        Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration.

                Under the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries
           Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
                      Approved by David Owen and Daneshwar Ghura (IMF) and

Based on the external low income country (LIC) debt sustainability analysis (DSA), Tajikistan’s risk
of debt distress remains high. Under the baseline scenario, external debt burden indicators in present
value terms remain below their respective indicative thresholds, with the exception of the debt-to-
exports ratio. Stress tests within the public DSA demonstrate the sensitivity of the fiscal position with
respect to a slightly lower long run growth rate and the necessity of the assumed fiscal consolidation.
The DSA results thus underscore the need for: i) the planned fiscal consolidation; ii) caution in
contracting new debt; and iii) careful cost-benefit assessment of large-scale investment projects, to
make sure that external resources are used productively. Furthermore, a one-off increase in the
government’s debt obligations, e.g. related to existing contingent liabilities, would push the debt-to-
GDP ratio higher, but would not put the country on an unsustainable debt path in the long run. Sound
macroeconomic policies and acceleration of structural reforms would also be needed to strengthen
Tajikistan’s growth potential and safeguard external stability.

                                           I.       BACKGROUND

1.      While declining significantly over the last decade, Tajikistan’s debt burden remains
high. Tajikistan’s external debt1 to GDP ratio decreased from slightly over 100 percent in 2000 to
about 34½ percent in 2010. A debt-for-equity swap with Russia in 2004 reduced considerably the
debt burden and tilted the composition of debt toward multilaterals. Against the backdrop of a sharp
increase in loans from China since 2007, the share of bilateral creditors picked up rapidly. As of end-
2010, Tajikistan’s external debt is largely concessional and held in broadly equal parts between
multilateral and bilateral creditors, with the share of China quite prominent at about 38 percent. The
share of commercial creditors is small.2

2.      Domestic debt has constituted a very small part of overall public debt owing to low
primary fiscal deficits (excluding the externally financed public investment program) and a
shallow government securities market. Domestic debt represented about 2 percent of GDP (6
percent of total public debt) at end-2010, consisting mostly of nontradable government securities held
by the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT). Since 2009, the government has undertaken regular
issuance of Treasury-bills (T-bills), but only in small amounts, with short maturity, and at rates below

 Tajikistan’s public and publicly guaranteed external debt covers the general government and both guaranteed
and non-guaranteed debt of SOEs (state-owned enterprises).
2
  In addition, the authorities accumulated a trivial amount of arrears, which are not taken into account in this
DSA as they do not have any macroeconomic impact. External payments arrears were accumulated in 2010 on
two loans guaranteed by the government. For the first loan, arrears reached a maximum of Euro 103,032
(US$148,428) during the course of the year. Original payment arrears were cleared by end-August 2010, and
penalty interest was cleared by end-December. For the second loan, an arrears of US$216 was cleared in
January 2011.

the current NBT refinancing rate.3 Moreover, eight-year government bonds were issued to
commercial banks in 2010 as part of the cotton debt resolution with rollover provisions and an
interest rate of only 2 percent.

3.     The present value (PV) of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt at end-
2010 was higher than projected in the last DSA, mainly on account of higher external
borrowing. PPG external debt came to about 34½ percent of GDP at
end-2010—roughly 2½ percent of GDP higher than projected in the last DSA update.

4.       The current DSA concludes that Tajikistan’s risk of debt distress remains high (see
Figure 1).4 The PV of PPG external debt to exports of goods and services stood at 147 percent at end-
2010, significantly above its threshold, and prolonged breaches of the threshold throughout the
projection period are anticipated. Other debt burden indicators are projected to remain below their
respective thresholds under the baseline scenario. In Tajikistan, remittance inflows have become the
most prominent source of foreign exchange earnings through a dramatic structural increase from less
than 10 percent of GDP in 2003 to almost 40 percent in 2010 (after posting a pre-global crisis peak of
49 percent of GDP in 2008). However, projected prolonged breaches of the original threshold for the
NPV of debt-to-exports ratio under the baseline scenario and stress tests preclude the incorporation of
remittances in the debt sustainability assessment.5 If debt burden indicators incorporating remittances
in the denominator are used, Tajikistan’s risk of debt distress would likely be reduced to medium (see
Figure 2).

                                   II.      UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS

5.     The macroeconomic framework over the medium term is broadly comparable to the
one presented in the last DSA and is described in more detail in Box 1.

      Tajikistan’s underlying growth potential is projected to be about 5 percent, broadly comparable to
       the last DSA. Real GDP growth in 2010 turned out stronger than projected at 6½ percent,
       supported by robust growth in remittances and a pickup in manufacturing and construction.
      On account of anticipated terms of trade shocks in 2011 and 2012, a modest depreciation of the
       real effective exchange rate is incorporated, which would help bring the current account balance
       towards its estimated medium-term norm.


3
    In 2010, the total level of issuance was less than 0.3 percent of GDP.
4
  According to the latest three-year average of the World Bank’s CPIA rating (2007–09) of 3.2, Tajikistan’s
policies and institutions are assessed as those corresponding to a “weak performer.?Three -year average of CPIA
ratings is used according to recently issued joint Bank-Fund Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the joint
Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework (October 2008). These guidelines aim at a less volatile assessment
of risk than that based on a single latest CPIA rating. The thresholds for the debt burden for weak performers
are 100, 30 and 200 for the NPV of debt to exports, GDP and revenue respectively; debt service thresholds are
15 and 25 percent of exports and revenue, respectively. In the scenarios that include remittances, the thresholds
have been revised downward by 10 percent so the corresponding threshold for NPV of debt and debt service to
exports and remittances is 90 percent and is 13½ respectively.

  Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low
Income Countries (Jan 25, 2010 available from http://www.imf.org/external/pp/longres.aspx?id=4419)
identifies the maximum permissible length of the breach of the thresholds as 10 years starting from the current
period, i.e., half of the projection period.

   Medium- and long-term projections for growth in nondebt creating flows are comparable to the
    last DSA (see Table 1a).
   Underlying assumptions for the fiscal projections are that the government budget deficit
    (excluding Public Investment Program) of about 1 percent of GDP in 2011 will be eliminated in
    the medium term and beyond. This seems feasible based on current spending plans and revenue
    projections.

                            Box 1. Tajikistan: Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth is projected at 5¾ percent in 2011, and at 5 percent beyond 2011. These figures are
significantly below their ten-year historical average of 8 percent (2001–10). The historical output trajectory
was supported by fast growth in the aftermath of the civil war, a sharp structural increase in remittances during
2004–08, and a benign global environment for the most part of the historical base. Expected long-term growth
will be driven primarily by exports once investment in the energy sector is completed and structural reforms
trigger a more dynamic private sector. The U.S. dollar GDP deflator is projected to increase from 6 percent in
2010 to 12 percent in 2011, but expected to decelerate to about 3 percent through 2031 reflecting progress
toward a low-inflation environment while assuming no commodity price shocks beyond the medium term.
Export of goods and services is expected to pick up to an average of 9 percent during 2011–16, despite a
projected sharp deceleration in 2012 on account of an anticipated adverse shock to cotton prices. Expansion in
nontraditional agriculture sectors and increase in energy exports would support this growth. An average
growth rate of about 7¾ percent is projected for 2016–31 as export will be supported by completion of the
infrastructure projects in the energy sector and progress with structural reforms, including in the agriculture
sector and improvement in the business environment.
The external current account posted a surplus of 2¼ percent of GDP in 2010. However, the improvement is
expected to be temporary with the current account reverting to a deficit of 3¾ percent of GDP in 2011 in light
of anticipated adverse terms of trade shocks (higher food and fuel prices), the full year impact of Russian
export duties on fuel (imposed in May 2010), and the reversal of the one-off factors that curbed imports in
2010 (intermittent blockade of rail transit during the first half of 2010 and a slowdown in external
disbursements for the Public Investment Program). A projected significant drop in cotton prices in 2012 would
add to the balance of payments pressures. Reflecting these adverse shocks, a modest depreciation of the real
effective exchange rate that would help bring the current account balance close to its medium-term norm is
factored in. During 2012–15 external borrowing on concessional terms to finance the construction of Roghun
HPP is incorporated. Owing to its high import content, the current account deficit is expected to rise
temporarily to a range of 6–7 percent of GDP. Beyond the medium term, the current account balance is
expected to improve gradually. Reserve coverage is projected to build up gradually to about 3¼ months of
imports by 2031.
Fiscal policy is assumed to aim for an overall balance (excluding the externally financed public investment
program) over the medium term and beyond, after modest deficits in 2009 –11.
External assistance. Official external loan financing on concessional terms is estimated to decline from
4¾ percent of GDP in 2011 to 2¾ percent of GDP through 2031. The grant element of new external debt is
assumed to decline slightly to 31 percent from 35 percent over the projection horizon.
Public domestic debt. A modest increase in domestic debt to GDP ratio is assumed from about 2 percent to
5½ percent by 2017 and gradually declining to 4 percent by 2031.
Real interest rates. For domestic debt, it is expected that real interest rate becomes slightly positive starting
2016.

                                         III.        EXTERNAL DSA

                                                A.     Baseline

6.      Under the baseline scenario, only one of Tajikistan’s external debt burden indicators,
the PV of debt-to-exports ratio, is projected to breach the indicative policy-dependent
thresholds significantly and for a protracted period of time (see Figure 1 and Table 1a). The debt-
to-exports ratio will peak at 178 percent in 2015, exceeding the threshold of 100 percent significantly.
After that, it is projected to decrease gradually throughout 2031. However, during the entire
projection period the threshold will be breached by a wide margin.

7.       External debt service ratios are expected to stay below their thresholds over the entire
period. During the projection period, debt service payments continue to be manageable, albeit
spiking during the years when principal payments on loans from China fall due. As a result, from
2016 to 2019, the debt service-to-export trajectory approaches the indicative threshold. It is assumed
that all of Tajikistan’s external public and publicly guaranteed debt is contracted on concessional
terms.

                            B.       Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests

8.      Under the historical scenario, the debt burden indicators are significantly lower than
under the baseline scenario. The historical scenario is based on averages from 2001 to 2010,6 during
which the current account deficit was relatively low—at below 3 percent of GDP, and growth was
much stronger. Therefore, under this scenario, all debt burden ratios—excluding the PV of debt-to-
exports ratio—remain well below the baseline trajectory and follow a downward trend throughout the
projection period.

9.       A high-investment low-growth scenario underscores the risk to debt sustainability if
growth dividends are less than projected (see Table 1b). The scenario demonstrates that, starting in
2012, when growth is reduced by half due to lower-than-expected productivity of investments, all
ratios deteriorate notably, with the ratio of the PV of debt-to-GDP approaching its sustainability
threshold by the end of projection period. The ratio of the PV of debt-to-exports deteriorates even
further. Nevertheless, the growth projections under the baseline are already cautious and no
significant growth impact from the completion of Roghun HPP and other energy projects are
incorporated. Consequently, a high-investment low-growth scenario may prove pessimistic.

10.      A scenario assuming contracting external debt on less favorable terms would lead to a
significant deterioration of Tajikistan’s external debt indicators compared to the baseline
scenario. If all new borrowing were to be contracted on less favorable terms during the projection
period, Tajikistan’s PV of debt-to-export ratio would rise substantially. Specifically, with the increase
in the average interest rate on new disbursements by 2 percentage points, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio
would rise continuously and breach the threshold starting in 2030, and the PV of debt-to-exports ratio
would increase further from levels projected under the baseline and stay above the threshold.

 For exports and noninterest current account averages for only 2006 –10 were used due to a break in the export
series reflecting a change in the treatment of exports of aluminum in the current account. For all others, the
usual ten-year historical average was applied.

                                                       55
11.     Bound tests show that adverse macroeconomic shocks would also have a profound
negative impact on Tajikistan’s external position. In the event of a shock to nondebt creating
inflows, all ratios, except debt service-to-revenues, exceed the indicative policy-dependent thresholds
by a significant margin and almost all of them remain above the thresholds throughout the projection
period.

                                            IV.       PUBLIC DSA

12.       The baseline trajectory in the public sector DSA is very similar to the trajectory in of
the external DSA, given that public sector domestic debt is small. The most extreme stress test is
embodied in a lower long run growth compared to the baseline. In other words, a growth rate 0.5
percentage points smaller compared to the one assumed in the baseline would result in ever-
increasing trajectories of all solvency and liquidity debt burden measures in the public template. This
stress reflects the sensitivity of fiscal sustainability to the underlying growth assumption. Another
important stress test in the public sector DSA includes the impact of the government facing a
contingent liability notionally equal to 10 percent of GDP.7 In this scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP
ratio peaks at 40 in 2015, indicating considerable risks to debt sustainability from contingent fiscal
liabilities. Under low growth and/or fixed primary balance scenarios public debt is unsustainable (see
Figure 3). This highlights the importance of relying fully on concessional financing and risks
associated with diverging from the fiscal consolidation assumed in the baseline scenario.

                     V.       DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS

13.     The current DSA concludes that Tajikistan’s risk of debt distress remains high. The PV
of PPG external debt to exports of goods and services breaches the indicative threshold significantly
throughout the projection period. Other debt burden indicators are projected to remain below their
respective thresholds under the baseline scenario.

14.      The results of the alternative scenarios and stress tests indicate that the debt
sustainability situation could further deteriorate. A modestly lower long run growth rate,
borrowing on less favorable terms of financing or absence of a fiscal consolidation could result in an
unsustainable debt burden trajectory. The DSA results thus underscore the need for fiscal
consolidation and extreme caution in contracting new debt and to carefully vet large-scale investment
projects, to make sure that external resources are used productively. Sound macroeconomic policies
and acceleration of structural reforms would also be essential for maintaining debt sustainability by
strengthening Tajikistan’s growth potential and safeguarding external stability. Going forward,
continued emphasis should also be placed on strengthening debt management capacity by closely
monitoring the debts of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs), assessing potential contingent liabilities
arising from the financial sector and quasi-fiscal activities of SOEs. The mission highly
recommended the authorities to undertake the Debt Management and Performance Assessment
(DEMPA) to identify and address weaknesses in various aspects of Tajikistan’s debt management
institutions and practices.


7
 Possible contingent fiscal liabilities stem from nonperforming loans in the financial system and arrears (tax
and inter-enterprise) in the state enterprises. The figure of 10 percent of GDP is notional, but likely represents
an outer bound for potential fiscal costs.

                                                       56
15.      The authorities concurred with the conclusions of the DSA exercise. The External Debt
Unit at the Ministry of Finance has received technical assistance to improve the in-house capacity for
debt sustainability assessment. The authorities’ results were in agreement with the staff findings. In
response to the authorities’ request, a World Bank DEMPA mission will take place during April 14–
24, 2011. Staff welcomed the authorities’ voluntary and swift action in this area that will help
facilitate assessment of the strengths and weaknesses in debt management and design of actionable
reform plans to improve debt management capacity.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ?(1+g)]/(1+g+?+g?) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ? = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
 (implicitely assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

ANNEX 4: PUBLIC INFORMATION NOTICE ON EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY

IMF Executive Board Completes Sixth Review Under ECF Arrangement
for Tajikistan and Approves US$20.2 Million Disbursement
Press Release No. 12/162
May 7, 2012


The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed its sixth review
of Tajikistan’s economic performance under a program supported by the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) arrangement. The decision enables the authorities to draw an amount
equivalent to SDR 13.045 million (US$20.2 million), bringing total disbursements under the
arrangement to an amount equivalent to SDR104.4 million (US$161.9 million). The Board's
decision was taken on a lapse of time basis.22


The three-year SDR 104.4 million (US$161.9 million) ECF arrangement with Tajikistan was
originally approved by the IMF’s Executive Board on April 21, 2009 and subsequently
augmented on June 7, 2010 (see Press Releases No. 09/136 and No. 10/230).


Adherence to the policies agreed under the Fund-supported program has played an important
role in helping Tajikistan maintain solid growth despite adverse external shocks. Stronger
than expected agricultural production and a robust rise in inward remittances helped fuel real
GDP growth in excess of 7 percent in 2011. Headline inflation has also returned to single
digits, due in large part to declining international food prices. A relatively stable exchange
rate in the second half of the year likely helped to moderate inflation expectations and could,
together with a more benign outlook for non-energy commodity prices and prudent fiscal and
monetary policies, lead to a lasting decline of inflation rates.


Program performance through end-2011 was strong, with all quantitative targets met and
most structural benchmarks completed. A treasury single account was introduced at the
beginning of April to strengthen public financial management, a fiscal risk assessment related
to the condition of state owned enterprises was completed and published on the ministry of
finance website, and a draft of a revised tax code, incorporating a number of
recommendations from IMF technical assistance, was submitted to government. An external
financial audit of the Roghun Open Joint Stock Company (OJSC) is also near completion, and
is expected to be published soon.


The outlook for 2012 and the medium-term is positive, but not without risks. High oil prices
and recent increases in electricity tariffs will add upward pressure on energy prices. Trade
disruptions and higher rail transport tariffs at the beginning of 2012 highlight risks to import
prices. Decisive action is needed to address financial sector weaknesses, which represent a
quasi-fiscal risk. Key will be minimizing taxpayer cost and addressing the root causes of the
problem—directed lending, weak corporate governance, and regulatory forbearance. Over the
medium-term, steady budget consolidation will be needed to maintain fiscal sustainability
and rebuild buffers drawn down during the crisis. Further reform of tax policy and tax
administration will also be needed to support private sector-led growth and job creation.

  The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse of time procedure, when it is agreed by the Board that a
proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.
