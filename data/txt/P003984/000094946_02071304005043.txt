3.1 Original Objective:
The objectives of the project were to improve efficiency and equity of Indonesia's land markets and to
assist in further development of land managemnent policies. Achievement of these objectives would reduce
conflicts over land, increase security of tenure, and alleviate poverty.



a) Relevance: These objectives were directly relevant to Indonesia's rapid growth and structural change.

leaving a lot of room for administrative discretion, arbitrainess, and loss of confidence.
b) Consistency: The objectives and design were consistent with the Banles approach to land
adminmsurauon as presented in the various land projects througnout the Bank  Tne project was also
consistent with environmental and indigenous peoples policies, though this 1994 project did not have an
explicit and independent assessment of likely impacts or evidence of beneficiary consultation. Tne project
objectives were also consistent with those in the 1994 CAS but these were rather general - growth with
macroeconomic stabiiity, poverty reduction, and improved public sector management
c) Commitment: Both Govermment and the Bank seem to have been committed to the project objectives
and design though there is evidence that parts of the Goverment and the main implementing agency were
not fully committed to the entire package. First. the Ministry of Agnrian Affairs (Agraria) and its BPN
were not convinced of the need for the policy studies under Part C and this led to delayed start of this
component (under BAPP1ENAS). Second. commitment at the District Land Office level was often mixed.
The systematic adjudication teams came from the Province and usually set up a temporary office separate
from the local land office. These teams carried out the survey and adjudication activities leaving the
registration, certification, and storage  to the Land Office.  Third, forestry authorities showed no
commitment to the project despite common interest in traditional land tenure, forestlnon-forest boundary
issues, and administration of land on behalf of the nation.
d) Ease of Implementation: Implementation of accelerated land titling and registration was initially
difficult because of the shortage of surveyors both within BPN and in the private sector. BPN also had
difficulty with the logistics of starting up and maintaining such a large program and coordinating the
centalized titling program with local LOs. HR management proved an enduring challenge. Budget
preparation for activities at three levels of govemment (Centre, Province and Local BPN, with several
sources of funds) was complex and consistently late. By the third year, project management was able to
work around most of these problems and implementation progress became satisfactory. Assistance in
management of implementation provided by the consultant team funded by Australia was of considerable
inportance in dealing with these difficulties and in implementing the institution-building component.
Integration of Part C into the rest of the project remained difficult because of cross-institutional
considerations.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were unchanged.
3.3 Orginal Components:
The components consisted of land parcel surveying, registration and certification (Part A), improvement
of legal, regulatoxy and administrabve framework for land administration (Part B), and development of
land management policies (Part C). The total project cost was estimated to be US$140.1 million, of which
the Bank was to finance US$80.0 million and Australia was to finance US$15.2 million for technical
assistance for all except the policy studies. Land Certification and Registration was the largest component
responsible for 88% of total project cost while inprovement on Legal, Regulatory, and Administrative

firms to be trained by the project and managed by BPN Central Office.
Two types of registration would be supported, namely sporadic( 8 LOs) and systematic (10 LOs).
Sporadic registration identifies. adiudicates and registers riahts to land on an ad-hoc basis usually when
walk-in customers approach the land agency and request registration of their parcel regardless of the
intentions of their neiehbors in this reuarcd It is suitable under some circumstances such as where the
number of parcels to be adjudicated in a given area is small. The local LO would carry out sporadic
registration  Systematic registration identifies; adiudicateq and registers rivhts to all adiacent land parcels
in a selected locality and within a given period of time. This program method is cheaper and faster and is
more tansparent since adiudicahion is made by a amnel of renreqentatives of RPN; villare leaders and the
survey firms. It is also accompanied by Customer Relations and Services (CRS) which disseminates

B. Improvement of Legal, Regulatory, and Administrative Framework for Land Administration
(US$30.9 million of which US$4.6 million Bank)
This consisted of: (i) a review of existing land laws and regulations, assistance in drafting new regulations
to improve the legal framework for land administration, and to prepare a legal database to cross-reference
the many laws related to land, and, (ii) activities to improve long-term development of land administration.
These were a study of BPNs fee structure, a study of ways to improve security of tenure of customary (
adat) lands. training and scholarships.
C. Development of Land Management Policies (US$4.4 million of which US$3.7 million Bank)
This consisted of an integrated program of studies, seminars and workshops on selected topic areas in land
management aiming at supporting policy formulation. These would examine: (i) institutional roles in land
management, (ii) land acquisition, (iii) displacement and resettlement of people, (iv) options for land
assembly, (v) spatial development planning, (vi) land rights issues, (vii) boundary issues between forest
land and non-forest lands, and (viii) land management policies for sustainable development. At the time of
project preparation, these topics were, and remain, of major concern. Although only 3% of total project
costs, this policy development component was necessary.
3.4 Revised Components:
Components were left essentially unchanged. A small pilot to test procedures for identifying and mapping
communal adat (ulayat) land was added (West Sumatra - Tiggo Jenko) after the relevant regulation was

balance between urban and rural sites was appropriate to capture the problems of rapidly urbanizing areas.
Limiting the sites to Ja-va, with only two cities in Sumatra, was correct given tiat it was soon found that
more adat/ulayat land existed than was thought at the time, and despite the reluctance of agencies to accept
the survival of hnis tenure form. T-ne design was noi unduly compiex or risKy. Parts A, B and C were all
necessary.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Project outcome is rated satisfactory. The net impact of the project was to begin the process of reform and
modemization of Indonesia's administration of its non-forest lands across the full range of considerations -
institutional, legal, administrative, social, and technical. Over 2 million predominately poor people for the
first time received clear title to their land at little or no cost and generally without long delays and
irregularities. This gave them both a measure of protection of their rights and an asset that could be used
in wealth-creation, if they so wished. The impact surveys revealed a high degree of beneficiary satisfaction
and strong demand fiom communities not yet in the progran.
Transactions in land in participating LOs were simpified with attention being paid to quality management
Large numbers of land parcels were registered at a fraction of the per parcel cost to BPN of sporadic
registration and the reliability of the register immroved markedly. BPN staff were trained locallv or were
sent abroad for formal education (Masters degrees in land management topics). These graduates returned
to BPN where their external education is being put to good use. Staff were involved with extermal advisers
in reviewing and in implementing the recommendations on surveying and registration, customer relations
and services; human resources and institutional development recordsn mana-gement infnmation technolnorv
land laws, financial management, derivative registration, decentralized land admiistraton, and traditional

The project was designed as the first time-slice of a 25 year land administration program in which
follow-on project is under preparation. While the project was generally successful in achieving its
objecu-ves, *Lere were a nU oope- UU!piauUI, po%Ulc;, insdLUUUna41 laIU legisilU-v issUeVs WkIaL reduIe(j oiiiy
partially resolved by project closing. Chief among these were:
- 4-



(i)   tie accuracy of the pre-project cadastai data was iess than expected making records integration
more difficult and costly;
(ii)  the accuracy of project-supported cadastral data was often less than expected particuiarly withi
newly trained private surveyors;
(iii)  coordination of terrestnra survey and photo-mapping was more difficult than expected because of
scheduling conflicts between the centralized program and local govemment;
(iv)   progress on tenure reform was less than expected because of difficulties in reaching a social
consensus on land. Land conflicts continued with wide administraive and judicial ciscretion
making the system seem arbitrary;
(v)    the level of registration of transactions in land subsequent to the initial registration is generally
satisfactory in urban areas but not satisfactory in rural areas, affecting the reliability of the new
register over tine;
(vi)   program  management responsibilities and budget were split between BPN Pusat in Jakarta, the
Provincial BPN and the local land office malcing planning and budgeting overly complex and
time-consuming (budgets always late) and contributing to fragmented monitoring, and supervision;
(vii) land office competence was more variable than expected resulting in uneven ability to perform
adequately with standard project support;
(viii)  provision of resources and technical assistance to BPN's training institutes, by itself, proved
insufficient to lift staff sldlls adequately;
(ix)   document storage and management problems increased significantly with progress of registration;
(x)    Customer Relations and Services (CRS)  was never fully incorporated into the registration
program;
(xi)   while studies in land policy and laws were comprehensive, the political context was not conducive
to reform in the short-run;
(xii)  development of a strategy for the long-term institutional development of BPN became of limited
value upon promulgation of the Regional Autonomy Laws of 1999, giving the role of land
administration to the regions, and upon the Decree No. of 2001 providing for a delay of two years
in the case of land and the consequent uncertainty over BPNs future; and
(xiii)  the cross-Ministry coordinating committee did not function and Part A& B, and Part C, were
implemented essentially as separate projects with no institutional mechanism to ensure that the
findings of each were incorporated into the project.
Social Impact Evaluation    A Beneficiary Survey of 1,596 respondents was carried out by an
independent NGO in 14 districts and cities (Annex 8). The results were favorable to the proaram and the

increased from 10 to 33, while the number in the sporadic program was reduced from 8 to 2. The project
introducea full disclosure, of information on costs of itues, rignts and obligations, adjudication prmcess
carried out in public, interim results were published prominently in the village and time allowed to dispute
the outcome, and certificates were, in fact actually delivered as promised. Tne program also promoted a
major expansion in private sector surveying. Under the project, an Act(2/98) and Regulations (PMNA
8/98) were drafted and passed to provide for examining, licensing and quality control of private surveyors.
The success of the certification program though, put considerable stress on BPNs management and
exposed deficiencies in the Basic Agrarian Law and the implementing regulations, only partly resolved by
project closing.

greater. Nevertheless, there is need for this service. In retrospect, this component should have encouraged
self-help (swadaya) survey and registauon whereuy adujacent parcel holders apply for registuaon as a
group, assist with field activities, and pay registration costs. This avoids many of the drawbacks of

technology, service provision, customer relations, systematic adjudication, records management, program
m_nitoring, and other asnectts of land administnition Tn additionn the orant spnonsored 40 BPN staff to
complete masters degrees in land administration in Australia. Quantitative targets were generally met. Most
of the trning was viven by PUS L ATKT,A- BPN's own Centre for EAirantion and Trining. Howeverp te
general quality of training proved to be questionable and low staff skill level remains a major problem.

The TA team provided to help BPN in project management was experienced and well qualified. Working
relationships with counterparts were very good. In addition to direct implementation assistance, the team
produced a large number of working papers and reports on the full range of aspects of land administration.
These were discussed with and made available to BPN managers. This sub-component is rated highly

5. Improvement of Legal Framework (US$2.2 million SAR, US$4.2 million Actual)
This comnonent set uD a comDuterized database of the some 2,000 laws and regulations on land to
facilitate a reform of the legal fmmework which had become overly complex and confusing. The database
was inftequently used and was not maintained and is rated unsatisfactorv.
A Systematic Review of Land Laws and Regulations was carried out and PP 10/1961 was redrafted to
introduce more practical procedures for land registration. This, together with the policy studies in Part C
has made a major contribution to the basis for comprehensive land law reform and is rated highly
satisfactory. The Review concludes that the Basic Agranian Law of 1960, although an excellent statement
of principles, has not been supported by a set of unambiguous implementing laws and regulations
consistent with Indonesia's social reality and capable of supporting a rapidly developing economy and no
provision is made for protecting customary land rights. Land disputes are increasing and reportedly some
400/o of cases in civil courts now concern land. This is because of considerable uncertainty about the rights
being registered and the administrative discretion it allows. There is now support in Govemment and civil
society for redrafing the land laws. The People's Assembly (MPR Provision IX of 2001) directed GOI to
review and reform land legislation.
6. Long-term Development ofLand Administration (US$10.3 million SAR, US$13.0 million Actual)
This component assisted BPN to develop long-term policies, procedures, and a corporate strategy. Studies
were carried out on costs and pricing (fees) of land services and on ways to improve security for
undocumented customary rights over land belonging to indigenous people. Technical assistance and civil
works were financed for the National Land Institute Yogyakarta, the geodetic faculties of the University of
Gadjah Mada and the Institute of Technology Bandung, and BPN's Centre for Training and Education.The
component is rated satisfactory.
7. Development of Land Management Policies (US$4.4 million SARk US$3.9 million Actual)
Consultant studies wommenceu, after a iwo-yar delay, anu pruouced repours on: land admnstrauon
policies and institutions, land acquisition, land use planning and development controls, land laws and
tenure, land rights, customary land tenure and law, forest land issues, commerciai wansactions in land,
environmental impacts of land development, displacement of people and resettlement, reform of land policy
and institutions. Generaly these are of a high quality and provide a wealth of mateial and a framework for
land policy discussions and institutional reforms. They have been made accessible to all by being posted on
a website. Overall, the component was successfui but the success was limited by the failure of Govemment
to be substantially engaged. There was little interaction between the component and the rest of the project,
The main himitation on the use of this, material remains the turbulent state of social and political affairs in
Indonesia, making it difficult to forge the broad social consensus need to support changes of the magnitude
required. The Bank is co-sponsoring with WI a series of workishops outside the project as a long-run
policy dialogue on land with stakeholders in the hope that it will facilitate a move towards the needed
consensus. The project studies provide the discussion framework and, in this context, the component is
rated successful.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
TYhe economic rate of return was calculated using the household- and plot-level data collected by the
Beneficiary Survey. The overall economic rate of retn  for the project is 33%. The assumptions and
methodologies are given in Annex 3. No ERR was calculated at appraisal.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
The financial rate of return (FRR) is 15.3% and the NPV is 43.5 million. The revenues were extrapolated
over a 35 year period and no further assumptions were made regarding any expected changes or
enhancements to these current actual benefits. The FRR is financially sensitive to the changes of the base



assumption of re-registration following sale (see Annex 3 for methodologies and assumptions).

on DrlBPs operations was mxed. ny thal ume, oficial papers proauccu oy BrN manageemt mcluded a
comprehensive list of reforms needed to make those concepts operational (for example, see BPN's
presentation for Agrarian Services Month, Oct 24, 2000). 1Tne change in BP'N s view of itself and its role
was influenced by both internal and external factors. The studies, technical assistance consultants, and the
overseas scholarship program provided a lot of exposure to practice in other countries, paricuiariy to
younger staff gradually occupying senior positions. The political liberalization provided the context for
institutional reform. Tne main constraint on further strengthening of BPN remains the uncertainty of its
mandate under the Regional Autonomy Law. In addition, BPN and other institutions involved in land
(including the judiciary and local government) still have a legacy of mistrust wihich has to be dealt with
through credible dispute resolution mechanisms and public consultation to form a consensus on land
foliowed by further reform of land laws and policies. Fortunately, in January, 2002, the MPR (Peoples
Assembly) passed a resolution (No.IX, 2002) directing the GOI to begin such a consultation and revision.
Consolidation of institutional gains is contingent; to a large extent, on the Govenmment's willingness to
perervere with the institutional reform program and to move quickly to the next phase of the program
made all the more urgent by decentralization giving a greater role to local governement While this presents
important opportunities in land administration and many local govenments are quite strong, others are in
great need of institutional strengthening as soon as possible.
5. Major Factors Afiecting implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agencv:
Indonesia's land laws, traditions, practices and institutions (to a large extent) evolved to manage land in a
traditional villa2e settina where transactions were few and took place among Deople who generallv knew
each other. This context changed rapidly as Indonesia underwent a sustained period of strong economic
rowth and urbanization. The mix of tenure traditions, laws written and unwritten, and local practices
soon became too complex and too cumbersome to support timely dealings in land. Comprehensive reform -
started bv the 1961 Basic Land Law - was neglected in favor of administrative decisions over land. While
this produced quick results, it was seen as often arbitrary and subject to abuse. The design of the project
acsumed snme commnitment to reform. but the conditions needed to nroduce a gmundswell of nolitical and
public support for change were simply absent. Failing this, the emphasis of project implementation was on
rntarhing up with the ennomous hbackng of imreristered nan-els; somewhat similar to that umdertaken in
ThaiLand a few years earlier, but under very different circumstances. With the change in govermment and
the lihprali7Ation nf niuhlir .nnininn it then hepr-m. appnre_t that disgatiqfhrtinn with rovpmrnmpnt'. hrnvilirncr

devalued. The regional autonomy decree and the several reorganizations of govemment agencies have left

nt-clicrilp if at all. Thig w.s prfti larlv nnti.-p.hIp in the nultrr,mi of Part Cr npoicy and institithnnal
studies, which although providing a comprehensive basis for reform were not given the follow-up attention

they wamranted.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The main project shortcoming that could have been better managed by BPN was the Customer Relations
and Services (CRS) component BPN missed an opportunity for consmictive engagement of communities.
BPN did not manage to retain qualified financial staff and this became a persistent project management
problem.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The massive devaluation of the Rupiah, from Rp 2,105/US$l at appraisal in 1993, to Rp 10,000/US$1 at
ioan ciosmg m i Ui2 , was nUo fuy passeu aloiig ii Miicreau rup-nh costs, parutcularly for lawor vosts. As
a result, the actual project cost was US$80.7 million equivalent compared with US$140.1 million expected.
Even without te devaluation, tne costs had bee-n overestimateud Of the total, the Bank financed USwo.1
million, AusAID US$20 million, and the GOI the balance. Of the Bank Loan amount of US$80 million,
uS$33.9 million was canceled. Foreign excnange costs denominated in dollars were as expected while
survey and other costs denominated in Rupiah rose. However, it is surprising to note that despite the large
devaluation, the unit costs to BPN for survey and registration remained fairly consistent at about Rp
120,000 - 140,000/parcel throughout the period 1996-2000 (the US$ cost dropped from US$58 to
US$1 1/parcel during this time due to devaluation). Late arrival of budget was a consistent problem. This
was made worse by frequent changes in budget rules.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
The proiect is rated sustainable provided that the follow-on proiect eventuates, as prorammed. The
project was not designed as a stand-alone intervention. The project supported only some of the activities of
less than 100/o of the land offices for iust a few vears. A larger, more sustained effort coupled with
meaningful policy and institutional reform is required to bring about permanent and comprehensive
chanae.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
With the closing of the project, the systematic registration program has ceased and the activities it
supported have been absorbed into normal operations of the local land offices. Of the 122 systematic
registration adjudication teams reached in the peak year of 1999, only 2 are still in operation. The
specialized staff on the teams have been reassigned to their origial land offices. These staff take with
them special skills and insights learned with the project and to a large extent this will benefit their offices.
The follow-on proiect is expected to focus on all the operations of these decentralized land offices. the
expected technical assistance and standards functions of BPN, and on fostering consultation-based policy
and leeal reform.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance

was also helped by the experiences with land administration and mapping as components in previous
projects in indonesia. Tne apprausal team was appropriately staffed and suppiemented by experts from
AusAID.

7.2 Supervision:
The Bankis supervision performance is rated satisfactory. The supervision team was greatly strengthened
by subject-matter specialists from AusAID. The teams were multi-disciplinary, cross-sectoral (urban,
rural) and carried out comprehensive reviews on a continuous basis with substantial field work.
Preparation for supervision missions was superb with the technical assistance team preparing substantial
documents on progress, issues and options. A total of 12 formal supervision missions were carried out
with frequent ad hoc assistance being given by the staff of the Bank's Jakarta Office.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Bank performance overall is rated satisfactory. At the time the project was prepared, the political
conditions for comprehensive reform of land management were quite restrictive and the project focus was
on the non-controversiai activities connected with survey and registration while comissioning detailed
studies into policy, institutional, and legislative issues in land. This approach built up a relationship
between Bank, GOI and AusAID in which more sensitive issues could be discussed. Aii parties benefitted
from the relationship and towards the end of the project, with the benefit of the completed Part C studies,
these issues became the topics of a series of stakieholder "Policy Dialogues" sponsored by WI/Bank.

8. Lessons Learned
Project Design and Policy implicadions
* Land administration, particularly in societies with large indigenous populations, is complex. The
project design appreciated this complexity to some extent and included a mix of technical, institutionai
and policy components. Whether these were in the "right" proportions depended on the context in which
the project was prepared and implemnented. At the time of project preparation in the early 1990s, the
emphasis was on the efficiency of the land titling process with difficult reform issues relegated to
studies. The primary land administration development objective was to close the cadastre within 25
- 1 1 -



years. This followed the Thai expenence and in the context of that time was probably the best way
forward. By project closure in December 2001, it had become clear that the refonn issues were
paramount and that the anticipated further Bank assistance would have to focus on that above all else.
The social circumstances in Indonesia proved to be very different from those in Thailand with a more
complicated mix of land tenure traditions. Land legisLation is much less developed in Indonesia and the
rights being registered are not clearly defined and understood nor are protected by the land
administration agencies or the judiciary. The registration process itself does not guarantee ownership.
The rights being registered should be clarified and backed up by a supportive land administration
agency and judiciary;
*   The project studies were intended to help resolve these problems. The key lesson is that studies by
themselves do not guarantee progress on policy and institutional reforms and more direct linkage to the
project activities is required up front;
*   Modenization of land administrfion is fundamental to a rapidly evolving modem economy. This
requires more than updating data management systems. It also requires that land rights be defined and
allocated, that they be accessible, transferable and defensible. It also requires that change should be
acceptable to stakeholders. The SAR does not define any process for reaching a broad consensus on
issues in land. The reform process is defined as one of studying a problem, presenting the results to
govermnent, and waiting for the changes in due course. Project preparation should have identified
constituencies for reform and designed an appropriate forum for involving them. Towards the later
stage of the project, this shortcoming became very apparent and a "Policy Dialogue" forum was
established to include stakeholders in discussions of the LAP-C reform recommendations;
* Land legislation should be complete so that rights, obligations, redress, and processes, are transparent.
In the case of Indonesia, land legislation has been left incomplete for four decades since promulgation
of the Basic Agrarian Law in 1961. This has led to a general decline in confidence in the agencies
involved in land and is a positive disincentive to registering dealings in land,
* Grievance resolution procedures must be established to settle land disputes according to the rule of law.
The large backlog of unsettled land disputes, the settlement of so many in favor of elites, and the
obscurity of the process, brings into question the value of the rights being registered,
* Land administration is a local government function by its nature since land records register how land is
held and these records are used locally. This is especially the case where there is a large variability in
local land tenure traditions. Centralized programs run the risk of setting up a formal system (BPN) in
narallel with traditional systems (adat) and with local non-traditional (1urahkecamatan) systems, as in
the case of Indonesia;
*   Centralized land admnmistration promgas become difficult to manage if they relege some functions to
the central teams (adjudication) and some to the local office (records management). Local support may
not match central surnnort resulting in a rnmgrm imbalance. In some cases- local offices freiuentlv
rejected data produced by the provincially contracted teams because of problems with quality over
wuhih they hadno oantml- In other ca e,ocal land offices did not have the resources to comnlete the
registration process, or to manage the large volume of records generated. Registration should be an

9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The GOI prepared a separate ICR (Annex 10), and also commented on the Bank ICR. In geneml, the
conclusions were the same. Comments given to the Bank on the draft were incorporated into the final
version. Probably the most important comment on Part A&B came from BPN who considered that the
Bank did not fully appreciate the difficulty of hurmfan resources management involved in project
implementation and that overcoming these constraints was one of the major achievements of the project
On Part C, BAPPENAS' main comment was that the consultant studies were carried out without the close
involvement of BAPPENAS and that the output remained as discussion papers rather than detailed policy
recommendations.

(c) Otherpartners (NGOs/private sector):
The views of NGOs and beneficiaries are given in the discussion (Section 4) of the Stakeholder Workshop
Results and Beneficiary Survey Results and in Annexes 8 and 9. In general, NGOs support the project but
consider that not enough was done to influence policy and some question whether loan funds should be used
for the project purposes.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
A. Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
Qualitative benefis
The beneficiary survey conducted by the SMERU Research Institute clearly showed that the LAP has the
following economic and social benefits:
1. First; tenure security has been increased. 700/o of respondents believed that they now have greater
tenure secunity than before because of obtaining land titles;
2. Second, land certificates improved landholders' access to credit from financial institutions. According
to the study, in the project area the rate of using land certificate as coUateral to obtain credit was 12.8
percentage point hiaher than that in the non-proiect area;
3. Third, there was evidence showing that land certificates strengthen investment incentives of
landholders. In the control aroup, 17.90/o of households reported that they had made land improvement
related investments; in the project areas, the number was 23.3%; and
4. FourdL in the proiect area. land markets became more active and land prices were higher than those in
the non-project area. About 2% of households reported that they had sold their land since the LAP's
ininlementation in the control group; however, the number was 4% in the proiect area Preliminary
analysis also shows that the land price in the project area is about 65 percentage point higher than that
im the control area. There are some other benefits which are difficult to be quantify, such as reducing
land conflicts, strengthening landholders' negotiation position in the process of land acquisition by
govermment etc.
MethodoloPV
Based on the household- and plot-level data collected by SMERU, a standard econometric methodology
was used tn analy_e the effect of titling on land pnrices to et the economic rate of retur. Land prices were
used as a proxy for economic value of land to calculate ERR under the assumption that all titling benefits
will evenhlinllv he reflected hv the pnice chamge- that ija the change of land nices captures the net effect of
all the benefits of land tilting. Many factors affect land prices besides the land title; therefore, factors other
than land itte .were enntrolletd in order to have a setmeininful analvsis= These are: familv characteristics
(such as consumption per capita, education level, age, and gender of the household head, etc.) and plot
caraeteristics (sc wh as whether there is land-mnmvenent investment nn the nlot since the LAP. if the
plot is house, what's the construction materials of the house, etc.). Also controlled were the regional

;0,000.U,000J is VAVUpuuue m -wx UpI w 2001. llSxm exempuon fguirc wu oc increased oy Rp S runno
every subsequent 5 years. Based on the data supplied by BPN, first time registration of State land
represents abut 2u-/0 of alu regisuiations; and
3. Payment of income tax on transfer of right on land/building (5% sellers tax, Government Regulation
No. 4 8/iw4). Ainy subsequent sales of syst matic registration titles sh oux oe inciuaed as these taxes
would not have been collected had the project not commenced.
The financial costs to the government are the all project cost (including Part A, B, and C) and the loan
interest costs (8%, based on Loan Agreement) and the Government's fiture management costs associated
with each title issued by the project (2.5% of average cost of each project year). The reason why the loan
interest costs are included is that the government will pay interests on loans that support tte project and thus
is a direct additional cost of the project. Should the interest costs be excluded, the FRR will be 16.5%.
Methodology and major assumptions
All calculations are based on the actual costs and benefits associated with the LAP I (1994-20 0). The
actual benefits (revenues) are extrapolated over a 35 year period and no further assumptions are made
regarding any expected changes or enhancements to these current actual benefits. The capital dLscount
factor is 0.1. Derivative registrations (turnover rate) is 1% for year 2-6, 3% for year 7-20, and 5% for
year 21-35. These figures are based on the observations made by TA team financed by AUSAID (LASA
Valuation Report, June 20, 1996).
Results
The financial rate of return (FRR) is 15.3% and the NPV is 43.5 million. The FRR is financially sensitive
to the changes of the base assumption of derivate registration. Should the assumption be changed to 5%
turnover rate for all periods, then the FRR will increase to 200/o.

Annex 8. Beneficiary Survey Results
impact Evaluation of Systematic Land Titling under the Land Administration Project - SMERU Local
NGO.
1.     This study entitled "An Impact Evaluation of Systematic Land Titling" was undertaken at the
request of the World Bank, and conducted between January and May 2002. TFhe general objectives of the
study are to assess: (i) the economic and social impacts of systematic land certification/titling under the
LAP; (ii) the ways in which the process of implementation of certification has affected outcomes; and (iii)
policy conclusions and implications for further policy development.
2.     A quantitative survey that involved questionnaires and was supplemented by in-depth interviews
with key informants was used in data collection. Fourteen districts and cities in which the LAP had been
conducted were selected purposely for data collection. Within these areas, sub-districts (kecamatan) were
chosen purposely based on the extent of urbanization (urban, rural and semi-urban characteristics), as were
the specific kelurahan and desa selected as research sites. In all, 1,596 respondent households were
selected randomly from within the villages. These consisted of 1,004 households that received a land
certificate under the LAP, 84 households that lived in the same area and who were eligible but did not
participate in the LAP, and 508 households that could not obtain a certificate because the LAP was not
carried out in their area. The third group was intended to be a control group. In addition to the survey, a
visit was made to Nagari Tigo Jangko in Tanah Datar District, West Sumatra. The purpose was to make a
qualitative study of a community mapping pilot project supported by the World Bank for the mapping of
ulayat land and in particular to ascertain the extent to which the pilot project has been carried out.
3.     Some 15% of the 84 non-participant respondents said that they did not have the opportunity to
participate in the LAP because they could not submit adequate proof of their ownership claims. However,
the most common reason given was they lacked money at the time. Other reasons for non-participation
were conflicts over land boundaries, non-subdivision among heirs of inherited land, insufficient
information, no advantages in having a certificate, absence from home at the time of adjudication and
lateness in making an application.
4.     The official charge per land parcel for LAP certification was Rp 11,500 in urban and semi-urban
areas and Rp 2,500 in rural areas. Information from respondents, however, indicated that the average cost
for the certificate itself was Rp 13,204 and that actual expenditure on certification ranged from zero to Rp
100,000 because of supplementary costs. The total average cost was Rp 36,449 with the inclusion of other
charges and was higher in urban and semi-urban areas than in rural areas.
5.     The majority (94.7%) of respondents who participated in the LAP said that the time, effort and
expenses taken to obtain a certificate were small by comparison with the usefulness of the certificate. More
than half felt that the certificate would be verv useful. while 39% mentioned the low cost and the easv
process as benefits. In saying this, respondents were maling comparisons with the trouble, money and time
needed to obtain a certificate through the snoradic nromr. Anprximately 700/% of resnondents believe
that they now have greater security of tenure because a land certificate recognizes their ownership rights.
(A kilurahan is the administrative unit below a sub-ditrict in an area officialv classed qs iirhrn while S,
desa or village is the corresponding unit in a rural subdistrict).
6.     The majority of respondents (89.7%) said that there was no discrimination against women
ndholders Aring the T AP nrnpess  However, s,ey data revea a stonEg .dmcy for the husband's
name to be put on the certificate in cases where land has been purchased jointly by husband and wife after



marriage. In 70.90/o of cases the husband's name has been used, with only 16.9% in the wife's name and
3% in both names. The tendency is somewhat greater in urban areas than in mral areas. The reason given
by the majority (86%) of respondents for this trend was that the decision about the name to go on the
certificate was rnade by husband and wife together. BPN officials, however, stated that they used the name
written on a deed of sale or a receipt in preparing LAP certificates for purchased land. Where land has been
inherited from the wife's parents, the certificate was issued in the wife's name. In the case of land
originating from the husband's side of the family, the certificate was in his name.
7.     Information fron key informants indicated that there are Indonesian citizens of Chinese ethnic
origin in survey LAP areas and that they had been obliged to meet one additional requirement in the form of
proof of citizenship when submitting LAP applications.
8.     The proportion of the average number of land parcels certificated through the LAP in all qtuntiles
of per capita household expenditures is greater than 90%. This indicates that systematic land registration
touched all socio-economic groups within the community.
9.     With expansion in land titling through the LAP, there has been a net impact in the form of an
average increase of 12.8% in the mortgaging of land with certificates as collateral. The highest impact was
in rural areas (28.4%), followed by semi-urban (13.4%) and urban (2.5%). Analysis by monthly per capita
household expenditure reveals a U-shaped pattern in the impact on the use of certificates to obtain credits.
The highest impact (15.2%) occurs among respondents in Quintile 1 and the second highest is in Quintile 5
(14.7%). while the lowest is in Ouintile 3 (9%).
10.    The average net impact of LAP certification on investment in land imrovements is estimated to be
5.3%. The highest impact (12.3%) was found in rural areas. Comparative figures for urban and semi-urban
areas are both around 3.5%. Most of the imnrovements consisted of the buildine or reDair of houses. but in
a few cases they took the form of a change in land use, with rice-fields being replaced by a house.
11.    Systematic land titling through the LAP has had a net impact of a 1.7% increase on the extent of
land transactions in the survey locations. The tvne of land most commnonly sold has been home-lots
followed by non-irrigated land.
12.    Survey data indicate that the LAP caused the PBB tax to rise by an average of 33.2%. The highest
increase was in urban areas and the Inwest in semi-urhan Incations- There were no increases in villave
levies and no new fees or charges were introduced.
13.   In the perception of respondents, the net impact of LAP certificates on the value of land was an
a of 54.                5 nn lnA- pru~ Th.e  hin-,pat *n r  t (133.2,O/A hAa1 ,eA *n I   rn a. Whl1

which implies that there is now more demand for notrial services. The second is the decline that has

15.    One effect of the LAP on nearby villages has been increased awareness of the benefits of
certification. There is, however, no indication that the LAP has encouraged an increase in sooradic land
registration, the cost of which has always been very high. For that reason many communities are attempting



to establish a swadaya (self-help) system of land tithtig that would be somewhat more expensive than the
LAP yet much cheaper than sporadic registration.
16.    Some 94% of respondents said that the cost of LAP certification was no burden on household
finances. The majority (78.9%) feel that, if the cost of the certificate has to be raised, it should be no more
than Rp 50,000, or Rp 90,000 if supplementary charges are included. This is much lower than amounts
quoted by certain control group respondents who, in planning for swadaya certification, have proposed Rp
150,000 to Rp 350,000 per parcel. Many feel that the cost of a certificate should be related to the size of
the land parcel, while others suggest stratified charges that would reflect the size and location of the land,
proximity to transport and the other factors.
17.    With regard to the community mapping pilot project in Nagari Tigo Jangko, research revealed that
the pilot project, as carried out, has differed from what was intended and in reality has adopted the standard
systematic adjudication (LAP) approach. Instead of identifying the boundaries of ulayat (traditional
communal tenure) land, the Land Office surveyed and mapped parcels within the residential area. The
result was a map showing some 1,505 land parcels. Copies are kept in the BPN office in Jakarta and in
provincial and district Land Offices and have not been forwarded to village officials and other stakeholders.
Up to the time of the SMERU visit in April 2002, no land certificates had been issued through systematic
registration as a follow-up to mapping. The reason given by the district-level Land Office is the absence of
information from the central BPN office about the continuation of World Bank fimding. Less than 30% of
traditional lineage family heads (uncles in this matrilineal society) objected to surveying, mapping, or
registration activities.



Annex 9. Stakeholder Workshop Results
A smikenohuer woncshop was nelu on ivMay 14, 2w2J to WsUUss -he  alUM iUUpUtL x-vtiuaUUUO R.plU ului
project's ICR. The participants included senior government officials from MoHA, EKUIN, BAPPENAS,
BPN, eight NGOs Including an aaat representautive from Aceh, representa-ives f:rnm acadmia, a-nu
representatives of six local governments. The participants welcomed the opportunity to discuss the impact
of the LAP and concluded thai the certification program was a clear success. Paricipants believed that tne
SEMRU's study was conducted in an independent and objective manner and hence accepted the study's
major findings (see Annex 8 for detail). Tne discussions of the workshop basically can be summaized
around three topics: continuation of the LAP program, land policy issues, and other land administration
issues.
Continuation of the LAPprogram
Participants believed that the LAP has inproved the awareness of local communities regarding the
advantages of obtaing a land title. Companng with the sporadic certification program, the LAP also
provides an opportunity for landholders to get a title in a fast and cost-effective manner. Therefore, the
participants, particularly those from the regional governments and local communities, expressed a strong
demand for continuing the program with some modifications. The modifications would focus on increasing
transarency, improving socialization program by better involving local communities and its leaders,
paying more attention to the area with serious land conflicts, and effectively adapting to the ongoing
regional autonomy process.
Participants understood that the LAP certification is highly subsidized. To reduce the government's fiscal
burden and to ensure more people benefit from the land certification, participants also suggested to promote
swadaya (community contribution) program in relatively well-off areas. Government officials indicated
that the land administration program will be continued even if there is no external financial resources, such
as the World Bank loan, which clearly shows that the govermment attaches great importance to the land
administration program and their willingness to push it forward.
Current practice is that the LAP adjudication team will avoid land parcels which are still in conflicts,
except the conflicts can be solved quickly through community consultation. Participants understood that
solving land disputes was not and also should not be the responsibility of the adjudication teams.
Therefore, participants hoped that a separate team can be established to settle the land conflicts besides the
adjudication team
Land Policy
Participants from the local governments, NGOs, and academia pointed out that an integrated land policy is
needed and expressed a clear demand for land policy reform Various existing land-related laws are
contradicting with each other. Participants pointed out that land management would be an impossible
mission to perform if an umbrella policy is not available, which is particularly true after the enactment of
Law Number 22 of 1999.
Participants emphasized that the issue of adat/ulayat (traditional) land should be addressed from both
nolicy and technical administration prnspectives, but the policy should a priority. On the policy side. as the
first step, a national fonum should be established to enable an open discussion between the government and
the anat mrnminitv to reach a consennLs on the definition of the adat/ulavat land. On the technical side-
there is no record exists about adat/ulayat land at all and participants believed that land mapping is needed
hkdi.pe the nolirv dialngiec. The retnrd vyten_ of adathilavat land will serve a ha e for caolvina mnanv
land conflicts.



Other Land Adminitradion Issues
Participants argued that an comprehensive and periodically updated land information database is urgently
needed. This information database has important implications to solve conflicts related to land acquisition,
location pernit, and other land disputes.
Some NGO's criticized that the BPN is not transparent enough and does not provide room for community
participation. "Informal payments" are still being charged as a result of the unawareness of the public
regarding the actual certification costs. BPN needs to change its mindset as well as its operation approach.
Some participants also criticized the negative system of land administration in Indonesia and asked for
exploring the possibility of transforming it into a positive system, that is, land titles would be guaranteed by
the Government

Part A and B
Summarv and Condusion
1.     The iuplementation of LAP progressed satisfactorily with major objectives accomplished. The
Proiect has achieved the target in land titling; cadstral mapping. record manazement institutional
development, and legal and policy studies. The targets were unmet in the sub-component of Base Mapping
and Gnrahical Indices (GIM' in LAP Part A Alheit Customer Relations and Services (CRS) in LAP Part
B financially realized the budget allocated, the findings from a number of studies and observations
pinpointed the lack of transparency in svstenmatit- land repistmlinn memaing ineffective fiuctinn of CRS
activities on the field. The delegation of CRS function to Land Offices would improve the effectiveness of
;infntrmatinn dic*pmin2tinn and Inhlii, tnnciultntinn
2.     As the core activity, the distribution of almost 2.0 millions certificates to eligible land holders
provides the benefit of security of tenure to almost 2.0 millions families. The study revealed that the project
had no adverse impact on their livelihood and benefited them in term of greater security of land holding and
pride by landholders about their land rights; security against eviction; the setting of long standing land
disputes; greater ease in settling inheritance matters especially with children, increased land values, and
more incentives to improve properties.
3.     Systematic land registration under LAP has been pro-poor allowing the project beneficiaries with
low income to secure land certificates in a simple, low cost, and timely manner. In addition, LAP has
positive outcomes on the improvement of land administration infrastructure in BPN for land resource
management and development. To have impact on other sector, an up and downslream linkage is
prerequisite for project arrangement in the future undertaking.

10.    The setting-up of Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) on all aspect in the implementation of
systematic land registration is a must , to include the surveying and mapping aspect, legal data collection
aspect, the specification of land registration product and land record, structure and format of digital data.
11.   The necessity of culture mi Quality Management to include quality control, quality assurance and
continuous improvement
12.    a unification of mapping system with related sectors is a prerequisite to facilitate the linkage of
parcel-based information produced from BPN products, thereby allowing a multipurpose infornation
system to develop.
13.    To improve the tnmsparency in systematic land registration implementation by changing paradigm
on the public service to the customer focus. This could be implemented by empowering the CRS unit at
Land Offices in bringing out the information about the systematic land registration to the public.
14.   In the autonomy era, LAP needs to empower Land offices to perform a bigger role in day-to-day
operation of LAP while Pusat allow to have a role in the maintenance and supervision, and set up standard
of quality, thereby transferring the technical aspect of systematic land registration is directly under the
control of the Head of Land Office as provided by the PP No.24 year 1997.
15.    To accelerate land registration requires the recruitment of huge number of employees but the
availability of staff is limited, however the Pilot Project in Tangerang and Malang in empowering the
locals to become partners adjudication teams demonstrated possibility of overcoming the limitation of staff
by employing locals as partners in systematic land administration process.
16.   To built the capacity of the Land Office in undertaking the acceleration of land registration by
conducting trainings in systematic land registration the whole land offices, the provision of office
equipment to sustain the land record management.
17.   To extent the areas of systematic land registration, empowering the BPN partners particularly in
surveying and mapping is a must, but the license surveyors are mostly based in Bandung and Jakarta,
consequently the budget for mobilization across the country become more costly . The project should,
instead, empower the local partner as much as possible by undertaidng cooperation with some organization
such as APSPI (The Indonesian Association of Surveying and Mapping Corporation), ISKI ( Indonesian
Association of Cadastral Surveyors) and ISI ( Indonesian Association of Surveyors).
PoUijcalAspect
18.   The execution of grand development program requires "Political will" and consistency from top
management involved, political will is always the key ingrecient in any development initiatives in Indonesia
to pave the way for the improvement to happen.
19.    Statutory mandate to register all land ownership throughout Indonesia requires the government to
advance participation from the community with self-financing any development initiatives by as the option
to loan scheme and state budget and to set up institutional arrangement ( "Rule of the game") to allow the
alternative scheme to take place.



Part C
Assessment of Development Objecive
1. The obiective of LAP part C was to support GOI's efforts to develop land management policies. The
policies were expected to provide new guidance and direction for national land managemnent as well as
pinciDles relevant to current condition for resolving the land-related issues. The objective was very
important and relevant to the need of GOI to develop national land policy and management system.
Realizing the complexity of the land related prmblems due to Indonesian geogphical factor, culture and
customary law, the magnitude of vested interests and the multitude of the players of players involved, quick
solution for land-related issues cannot and should not be sought This nart of the nroiect was introduced
based on recognition that developing national land policy and management system thrmugh a
prner-orientad annmach and facilitate an interantive fonrnlaiton of solutions was very imnortant to deal
with the land-related issue.

addition the Indonesian version is more difficult to understand due to changes of meaning and terminologies

study. Third, some changes taking place in the last few year in Indonesia has brought the country into

land management Since the policies formulated through part C were expected to provide new guidance and
direction for national land management as well as principles relevant to current condition for resolving the
land-related issues, the result of the study needs to be reviewed and updated if needed to make it suitable to
present condition and requirement.
Output by components
4. The result of the program of studies was in the form on document reports and on CDs. The reports were
organized into a number of topic cycles as follows:
Topic Cycle 1: The Institutional Setting for Land Management Policy
Topic Cycle 2: Land Acquisition and Land Development Controls
Topic Cycle 3: Spatial Development Planning, Land Use Planning and the Land Development Process
- 32 -



Topic Cycle 4: Indonesian Land Law and Tlenures - Issues in Land Rights
Topic Cycle 5: Forest/Non-Forest Land Issues
Topic Cycle 6: Commercial Transactions in Land-Secunty Interests in a Market System
Topic Cycle 7: Sustainable Development, Environmental Impacts and the Land Development Process
Topic Cycle 8: Displacement of People and Resettlement
Topic Cycle 9: Final Report and Policy Matrix
Topic Cycle 10: Institutional Framework Reforms for Land Administration
5. In addition to the topic cycles, a web site at address http://www.landpolicy.org was also constructed
under part C to provide a place for land information and public discussion on the land matter. However, the
web site is not optimally maintained since the hand over of the website from the consultant to GOI was not
running well.
6. An International Conference on Land Policy Reform was held on July 26-27 2000 in Jakarta. The
conference invited intemnational and national experts to review and advance debate on land policy reform
for Indonesia. Learning from the papers presented by international experts and discussing with them was
actually a good opportunity to leam experiences on how dealing with similar land issues in other countries.
The result of the conference, however, was not used by the consultant to improve the product of the study.
Insttutional Development Impact
7. This project has provided learning experience in land policy and program development process, as well
as action plan in land management considering the resources available. However, the result of the study has
very limited impact on the govemment land institutional development since the consultant was conducting
the study exclusively and failing to make positive cooperation with related agencies. The consultant did not
even officially submit the final result of the study to GOI.
Major Factors Affecting Implementaton and Outcome
8. Although most part of the project was satisfactorily performed, there are some aspects that need to be
noted. Firstly, There was no official hand over of the project result from the consultant to implementing
agency. This had caused difficulties for the implementing agency to have the overall document reports.
Secondly, Chief Advisor of the consultant left before the project was finished so he was not able to give
final comprehensive presentation on the result of the project. Thirdly, at a meeting before the end of time
period for the consultant to manage the land policy web site, it was agreed between the consultant and the
implementing agency that a redesign would be made so as the web site would be a suitable representation
of GOI. The consultant, however, was not fully successful to perform that task
There was also a complaint from an Indonesian expert since her work (article) was used by expatriate in
the study without providing any credit to her. In addition, there is a problem on the web site that needs to be
resolved by the consultant since although the website has been handing over to GOI under
www.landnolicv.org- up to now. there is a web site that usina name and information of LAP-C being
maintained at the address of http://www.sli.unimelb.edu.au/Deople/Iandpolicy/.



9. The responsible person involved in part C such as project duirector, project manager etc changing se;verali
times due to organizational restructuring in the implementing agency and other agencies involved. This
situation had caused some difficulties in controlling, coordinating and maintaining the sustainabliiyi of ute
project There were some issues need to be noted. Part C experienced implementation delay to 1997.
Beside, during the project time, communication and coordination with the consultant as well as evaluation
and monitorng were not smoothly performed. These might have contributed to the exclusiveness of the
consultant in conducting the study.
Sustainabiiy
10. Sustainability of the project is likely, as LAP will be followed by an activity entitled Land
Management and Policy Development Program (LMPDP) that will assist WI0 desigmng a program in land
management and policy reform. The program is expected to produce policies that will serve as the main
reference of the Indonesian land management This activity is important considering the transition to the
democratization and decentralization that Indonesia is experiencing and the need to resolve land related
conflicts. Through LMPDP the need of GOI land policy and management will be reviewed and pnioritized.
The LMPDP will put emphasize on the aspect of taking the result of the previous study including part C as
inputs in developing land policy and management that is suitable to Indonesian current condition.
Therefore, LMPDP study will take many advantages from the result of LAP-C. With changes and
modification made as adjustment of Indonesian current condition, the study result of part C should be a
good basis for LMPDP.
Bank Performance
11. The Bank performance in assisting the project is rated satisfactory. Bank had given support over the
project period either through the Jakarta's office or through the supervision mission. In general, the Bank's
staffs had provided adequate assistance and have developed good cooperation with GOI. Bank had been
able to solve the arising problem and provided support for any changes needed during the project time.
Consultant Perfiormance
12. During the period of study the consultant had studied many aspect of Indonesian land policy and
management and had been qtutely successfully writing them in the form on document reports and on CDs,
which is organized in 10 topic cycles as on point 4.2. The consultant had been also built a website for land
policy and conducted an International Conference on Land Policy Reform in Jakarta. Despite the
achievement of the consultant, there are several things need to be noted for improvement on the future
related activities. Those include officially handing over the result of the consultant work to the
implementing agency as representative of GOI, having the Chief Advisor/expert or his representative to
perform final comprehensive presentation on the result of the project, and not using the study material
including the one in the website after the official hand over of the study.
Government
13. The govermment and implementing agency overall performance were rated satisfactory. On the
financial aspect, since land policy management was an important issue of national development, GOI has
filly mned the proiect through provision of countermart fund. In addition GOI was always available for
discussion regarding the issue and problem facing the project. On the technical aspect, although, there were
severa. changes on the pronject management due to norganization restrnuturing the irmnlementing agency had
always made an effort to avoid any delayed and adverse impacts it could be done to the project

Tne project has also initiated to prepare an embryo of stakehoider forum, which is still man ed until
today even in a more limited way. Through this project we have identified competent and relevant
stakeholders in government institutions, private sectors, property businesses, universities, research centers,
NGOs, etc. These important stakeholders will be assets for developing innovative and transparent
communications amnong stakehoiders.
The study had also made comparative analysis on how other countries addressed simiiar issues for each
topic cycle, which will be very much of use for development of Indonesia land policy. The study has
produced Land Policy Reform Matrix, which can be a useful reference in performing land policy and
regulation reform in Indonesia. However, since there is a need to accommodate the changes in the
Indonesian governance system into the democratization and decentralization as well as the fact that the
result of the part C study still needs to be modified from discussion paper into policy formulation, LMPDP
has become a significant and necessary activity. LMPDP is expected to bridge the result of the LAP and
changes condition in Indonesian govemance system with the future need of Indonesian land policy and
managemnent system. As an accompaniment to the study, the workshop has also provided papers and
valuable inputs for many land management and policy aspects from the international and national experts.

Additional Annex 11.A usAlI) ICR Summary
Summary
Commencing in 1994, LAP has been implemented during perhaps the most volatile social and economic
period in the short history of the Republic of Indonesia. Notwithstanding this, the project has successfully
achieved the titling and registration targets in 5 provinces of Java where, as a result, the economic and
social potential of more than 1.8 million households has been improved. A gradual, but discemable shift in
BPN from a closed, autocratic, self-serving central agency to a more open, inclusive and service delivery
organization has assisted the governance objectives of the program. Also, the TA has assisted the
establishment of a cadastral survey industry in the private sector of Indonesia to support land
administration in the future. The technical operations of the registration program could be regarded as
susainable with evidence of independent planning and implementation by BPN. While Drogress has been
made in institutional change, this aspect of the program will require considerably more assistance before
changes can be regarded as sustainable.
The TA Drogram devloved a total of 54 International and National consultants in deliverinn some 250
milestones over 7 year of assistance to the project. Significant progress was made in reviewing the laws and
regulations that govern land administration. however little imnact was made on overall reform of land
policy. The separation of Part C from the other parts of the project was not successful and this is one
lesson that would need to be carefully reviewed in any further stages. Other lessons from LAP include the
successful approach to the education and training program and the development of the pnvate sector to
undertake all aspects of survevina and manning. The shortcomings in the Conununitv Relations and
Services (CRS) component present perhaps the clearest lesson and reference to this issue permeates most
elementc of the Proiect Conmletion Renort-
Lov.ens Le tad
The key lessons from LAP are:
1.     Mobllisation: The rapid mobilisation of a relatively large adviser team tested the capacity of BPN
to provide immediate counterpart support. This resulted in some loss of effectiveness in early advisers and
postponement of others. Agreed pre-mobiisation conditions with the implementing agency will assist in
overcoming this problem.
2.     Agency Capacity: The capacity of BPN to support project implementation, and absorb the budget,
in the first two years was over-estimated. This is common in large scale titling projects where agencies,
which are generally large and conservative, are called upon to manage programs and resources hitherto not
experienced. As result most loans are extended. While this is not a major problem in itself, there is a lesson
that with more realistic levels of disbursement in the early stages, less pressure would be applied to the
implementing agency.
3.     rroject ivMnagement anud ireCuuon; Tne project was most successfu in those areas that were
under single agency control (Parts A & B). However, it is usual for jurisdictions to have numerous
agencies involved in tne land adminisiration function. Some over-arching, high level, committee structure
must be put in place to coordinate and control implementation, however this in itself will not provide
coordination and policy direction in implementation. For example the PEC was not called upon to
deliberate one policy issue, to provide direction during volatile political times nor respond to one
Supervision Mission Aide Memoire. Establishment of a senior level, full time secretariat responsible for
scheduling of meetings and ensuring appropriate agendas should be considered in future project designs.
4.     Area Selection: The project design was based on decentralised project management, with



management Supponr umts responsibie for the project at the Provincial (MVISUK) level. However,
implementation was too concentrated in three provincial offices. For example, the West Java provincial
office was responsible for 80 systematic registration field teams at the peak, which was beyond the
management capacity of the office. The solution was to divide the project into more manageable units by
shifting responsibility to the district land office land and the establishment of a MSU at that level
(MSUKp). This was done in PY4 and involved considerable re-structuring. In future designs project
implementation should be devolved to the land office level from the outset and land offices resourced
accordingly.
5.     Customer Relations and Services: The initial focus of CRS was on publicizing the systematic
rBglsauonp.ugr-wi"n th -vet loca i:-ue.si  i  o cove- 'uZ. -  fL "-1 ---uneo c-m t  a--ar

can be exploited. The term CRS is too narrow and future projects should design a Community Extension

7.     Social and Economic Benefits: The project design included a Socio-Economic Baseline Survey.
These methods have been used to prove the overall benefits of larme scale land titling, however they have
not proved to be an effective short term assessment tool. Apart from the elapsed time inherent in the
avvroach (between baseline establishment and the follow up survevs). the influence of factors other than
title registration on the socio-economic status of land adversely complicates the methodology. In the case of
LAP, short term tools are needed to eauae the extent that the exoected benefits are evident in a timelier
manner. The regular scheduling of assessment surveys throughout the duration of the project would have
nrovided information on specific issues and point to changes which mav be needed in approach or desigm
8.     Adviser Reporting: The contract milestones were essentially reports, many being the final reports
of TA advisers. Considerable attention was given to these reports as tangible outputs for contract purposes.
However, the final report is believed to be less important than the impact of the adviser on the environment
covered by his/her Terms of Reference; change will be easier to achieve while the adviser is present to
guide and mentor, rather than through the legacy of a final report The adviser final report should be
secondary to a formal process of periodical review of adviser progress toward the achievement of TOR
9.     Land Law: Customaly iand ownership, under community based tenure systems, has its own
unique political, social and registration issues that need to be handled with a degree of caution and
sensitivity. BPN has begun to address the co-existence of customary ownership and the formal registration
system. On a more general note, the numerous types of rights that currently exist over land in Indonesia
create confusion and make the operation and understanding of the registration system difficult. The
numerous types, and complexity, of rights will make future computerisation of the registration system very
difficult BPN have commenced a review of the categorization of rights aimed at distilling the existing large
range of rights into two basic types -freehold and leasehold This will simplify future land administration.
10.    Community Participation: LAP  commenced in an environment where communication and
community participation was extremely limited. Tne resultant tension at both local and international levei

posed a serious threat to the viability of the project. A clear lesson is that major reform programs such as
LAP, which not only impact on the community, but rely on their full support for ultimate success, cannot
be undertaken without transparent processes involving all stakeholders.
11.    Training and Capacity Building: The TA also assisted a large number of Bank funded intemal
turining programs. Pusdikldat itself conducted a total of 21 separate training programs, however the general
quality of the training proved to be questionable. The organizational structure, the skill and knowledge level
of training personnel and the level of available resources within Pusdilat have all been matters of concern.
The emphasis generally has been on the quantity of training delivered rather than the quality and its
relevance to need. Attempts to change training methodologies and the implementation of a modern approach
to the development of training modules have generally been unsuccessful. The problem with training has
been further exacerbated with the introduction of decentralisation. as the heads of land offices have
identified low staff skill levels as one of the major problems they will face. The fact that more than 2,000
BPN staff undertake trairnig each Year and more than 3,000 BPN staff have undertaken a four year
diploma course at STPN does not appear to address the basic problem. In future LAP phases, as the
Dogram moves to the less develoDed regions of Indonesia (off -Java) education and trainin will remain a
high priority. However the TA emphasis in this component should shift to delivery of in-country training
rnoraoms in decentralised locations. These proarms should be develoned and delivered bv international
institutions in conjunction with Pusdiklat and local institutions and take priority over Australian based
courses of study. They could be modelled on a similar oranms being introduced by AusAll) in the T Los
