LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECr SUMMARY
Borrower:             The Republic of Indonesia
Amount:               US$80.0 million equivalent
Prqject Objectives
and Description:     The main objective of the project is to foster efficient and
equitable land markets and alleviate social conflicts over land,
through acceleration of land registration in support of the initial
phase of GOI's long-term land registration program to register
all non-forest parcels, and through improvement of the
institutional framework for land administration needed to sustain
the program. The second main objective is to support GOI's
efforts to develop long-term land management policies. The
main components of the project are:
(a)   systematic registration of 1.2 million parcels in ten
districts in Java, relying on special systematic
adjudication teams capitalizing on economies of scale,
cadastral surveying by private firms, utilization of new
technology such as GPS, and dissemination of
information to the public;
(b)   development of a database of land laws and regulations,
and assistance to GOI's program for reviewing and
drafting land laws and regulations;
(c)   long-term development of BPN's institutional capacity
for land administration, mostly through support to BPN's
training and education units, training, scholarships and
studies on ways to improve tenure security for
customary (adat) land rights; and
(d)   an integrated program  of studies, seminars and
workshops on selected topic areas in land management
while improving inter-agency coordination and drawing
on international experience.
Benefits and Risks:    The project would foster more efficient and equitable land
markets in terms of: more efficient and transparent land
transactions; less risk in land-related investment; mobilization
of financial resources through use of land as collateral; and
provision of incentives for longer-term investment towards more
sustainable land use. About 4 million people in Java would



benefit directly by having their land registered systematically,
including about 100,000 families estimated to be below the low
income threshold.   The project would also build the
institutional, human resource, technical, financial and regulatory
foundations needed to sustain GOI's long-term land registration
program. The development of long-term land management
policies would contribute to improvements in such key areas as
land acquisition. The progress to be achieved under the project
would be instrumental to development in various sectors and
encourage foreign investment.  The major risks are over-
stretching BPN's implementation capabilities, as well as the land
owners' lack of confidence in the registration system and their
lack of understanding of the need for land registration. The
first risk would be addressed by utilizing the private sector for
certain tasks, and by providing technical assistance for project
implementation.  The second risk would be addressed by
systematic adjudication which is an open, transparent process
involving the affected people, and by disseminating relevant
information widely.

BACKGROUND
A. LAND RESOURCE AD LAND USE
1.1         Indonesia's land resources are abundant at 1.9 million square kilometers
(190 million ha), which is the third largest in Asia and larger than the four American states
of Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona combined. The land is scattered over
some 13,000 islands, with Kalimantan accounting for 28 percent of the total, Sumatra
25 percent, Irian Jaya 22 percent, Sulawesi 10 percent and Java 7 percent. Much of the
outer islands are covered with forests, which amount to about 60 percent of total land and
rank as the largest in Asia (amounting to nearly 60 percent of all tropical forest in Asia).
1.2          Population, economic activity and intensive land use are heavily concenerated
in Java. More than 60 percent of Indonesia's total population of 186 million live in Java,
where population density is more than 800 people per square kilometer, one of the highest
in the world. Java contributes about 60 percent of Indonesia's GDP, which far out
distances the second-placed Sumatra with about 30 percent. The most intensive land use
is also found in Java, with more than 70 percent of the area under such use, much higher
than the second-ranked Sumatra with about 20 percent (Table 1.1).

1.3         With GDP growing at the robust rate of over 6 percent per annum on
average in the last 25 years, ranking among the 10 fastest growing economies during the
period, land use patterns are changing rapidly. Data on land use is difficult to compile and
the areas under respective uses vary significantly between different estimates (especially
forest land). According to GOI's official statistics, total areas covered by plantations
increased by 3.9 million ha, upland paddy fields by 3.2 million ha and human settlements



by 1.6 million ha during 1980-92, mostly at the expense of forest land and the "other'
category (Table 1.2). The total of these areas converted during the period amounts to
about 5 percent of Indonesia's total land, or roughly the size of the American state of
Indiana. Rapid changes in land use patterns are expected to continue: one major source
of change is the urban population growth of about 5 percent per year, more than twice the
total population growth.

B. STATUS OF LAND RIGHTS AND LAND REGIsrRATioN
1.4         Efficient and equitable land markets are an important basis for modem
economic development, since they would quickly and flexibly accommodate changes in
land use, allow fair land transactions, and mobilize financial resources through collateral
arrangements. A comprehensive, accurate and efficient land registration system is a sine
qua non in developing such land markets, since it enables land to be freely traded, by
reducing or eliminating the risk perceived by purchasers and vendors of land. However,
land registration in Indonesia has not yet reached that stage.
1.5        In Indonesia, only about 12 million of the nation's estimated 54 million land
parcels (22 percent) have been registered in the 33 years since land registration began.



- 3 -
If the current pace continues and the number of parcels remains static, it would take more
than 90 years to register all the parcels. More realistically, land registration will never
catch up with the total number of parcels, since the number of parcels is estimated to be
growing now by more than 1 million per year. Since forest land is excluded from the
land cadastre, as in many countries with substantial forest land, the total land area
currently registered would amount to merely 7 percent of all land. Over 75 percent of the
unregistered parcels are estimated to be in Java, where only 19 percent of the parcels are
registered (Annex 1.1). The province of West Java has the lowest coverage of land
registration, with only 13 percent. The main reasons for such low coverage in Java are
the large number of parcels, rapid increase in the number of parcels due to economic and
population growth, and the large number of informally occupied parcels.
1.6          The scarcity of registered land and the relative security of tenure offered by
land registration are translated by the market into higher prices. According to a study
(Dowall and Leaf, 1990), the premium placed on registered parcels over unregistered
parcels was more than 50 percent in Jakarta's central business district (CBD) in 1989, and
land values were positively correlated with security of tenure (Table 1.3).

1.7          Other issues in the land registration system are: (a) it is not responsive to
the beneficiaries' needs, for instance in the amount of time needed to process title deeds;
(b) it is difficult to obtain legally reliable information; and (c) lack of legal provisions to
protect customary (adat) rights and rights of long-time, locally accepted occupants, which
often hinders land provision for investment. These problems have often led to social
conflicts, inhibited land transactions and discouraged private investment. The low
percentage of parcels registered and other issues demonstrate that there is an urgent need
to accelerate land titling and registration,1/ by addressing the institutional, technical and
human resource constraints of the National Land Agency (BPN), the GOI agency
1/ In Indonesia, 'land titling" is used to describe the process of granting private rights to state land.
Within BPN, land registration is the responsibility of Deputy IV, while land titling is handled by
Deputy III. In this report, the term 'land registration' includes land titling in the Indonesian
context, except where the differences need to be empbasized.

responsible for land registration (see para. 1.15). The proposed project would help GOI
address these constraints.
C. POUCY FRMEWORK FOR LAND MANAGEMENT AND ADMINITRATION
1.8         Recognizing that the lack of efficient and equitable land markets has been
a major impediment to investment growth and contributed to land disputes, GOI has
intensified its efforts to accelerate land registration since about 1988. Further, since about
1992, GOI has taken strong initiatives to improve land policy, of which the most important
ones are:
(a)   announcement by BPN in February 1992 of a 25-year program to title and
register all non-forest land parcels in Indonesia (hereafter referred to as
'GOI's long-term land registration program");
(b)   passing in the parliament of the Law concerning Population Development
and the Development of Happy and Prosperous Families (Law No.10/1992),
which places a higher priority on traditional land rights than modern
development rights;
(c)   passing in the parliament of the Law for Spatial Development (Law
no.24/1992), which includes clear provisions for local participation,
decentralization and information dissemination;
(d)   issuance of the Presidential Decree (Kepres) No. 55/1993, which inter alia
requires land acquisition for public interests to be conducted on the basis of
clear agreement (negotiation) between the parties concerned; and
(e)   establishment in August 1993 of the Coordinating Board for National Spatial
Planning (BKTRN), coordinated by the State Minister of National
Development Planning/Chairman of the National Development Planning
Agency (BAPPENAS) and represented by GOI agencies with major roles
in land matters. These agencies are the Ministries of Home Affairs,
Defense and Security, Public Works, and Environment, as well as the State
Secretariat and BPN.
1.9         The above laws and decree need to be followed up with implementing
regulations. Furthermore, several policy issues need to be addressed, such as the possible
negative impacts of the location permit (izin lokasi) issued by GOI to facilitate land
purchase, the need to clarify boundaries between "forest land" and "non-forest land," and
the need to devise efficient and equitable land assembly techniques. The project would
assist GOI in reviewing these and other policy issues.
D. IEGAL FRAmEwORK FOR LAND MANAGEMENT AND ADMrSIRATION
1.10        GOI has also acknowledged that there are issues in the legal framework,
which need to be addressed to improve land administration and further to develop efficient



and equitable land markets. The most important of these issues, described below, would
be addressed under the project.
1.11        Implementation of the Basic Agrarian Law. Formally, all current land
law in Indonesia is based on Law No. 5/1960, the Basic Agrarian Law (UUPA). The
UUPA abolished the pre-1960 system of land rights, whereby land was categorized as
either "westernm land (subject to the provisions of the Dutch Civil Code) or as
'Indonesian' land (subject to the provisions of unwritten customary law). The UUPA also
established that Indonesian land law will be based on customary (adat) law. However,
most of the implementing laws and regulations prescribed by the UUPA, needed to clearly
define the land rights specified in the UUPA, have not yet been enacted.
1.12        Security of Private Land Ownership. Based on the Constitution, ultimate
control of all land, water and airspace is vested with the state. For example, due to the
"social function" of land, the state can theoretically revoke private ownership of land if
the owner fails to make use of the land within a certain period of time. A legal framework
establishing private land rights is needed to improve security of private land ownership.
1.13        Registration of Land Rights.  Under Indonesian law, there are three
distinct categories of land rights to be registered:  (a) the three real property rights
specified in the UUPA, i.e., ownership right (hak milik), the right to build (hak guna
bangunan) and the right of exploitation (hak guna usaha); (b) the pre-1960 land rights on
former 'western" and 'Indonesian" land that have been 'converted" to one of the three
UUPA rights mentioned above;Z/ and (c) three additional types of land rights introduced
after enactment of the UUPA, i.e., the right of use on state land (hak pakai atas tanah
negara), the 'development right" (hak pengelolaan)J/ and the strata title (hak miuk
satuan rwnah susun). However, there are issues related to the legal framework which
hinder the registration of the above land rights, of which the major ones are the following:
(a)   a large number of land-related laws and regulations, which make land
transactions and land registration more complex and less transparent than
needed. About 2,000 land laws and regulations have been identified
already, through the compilation and documentation work carried out as
part of the project preparation by BPN, with assistance from the Legal
Documentation Center of the University of Indonesia;
(b)   stringent evidence requirements: documentary evidence of a land right
dating back to 1960 (the year the UUPA was promulgated) or earlier is
required for land registration. This frequently poses problems, since such
documentary evidence is no longer available in many cases. If satisfactory
evidence is unavailable, the land in question can be considered state land,
in which case the land may be granted to the occupants at a fee. While in
/   This 'conversion" in principle took place automatically on the basis of guidelines provided in the
UUPA. However, the status of much of these pre-1960 rights need to be clarified further.
I/  "Hak pengelolaan' is the right given to government agencies to develop areas of state land, e.g.,
housing projects, industrial estates, agricultural estates.



- 6 -
many countries similar problems are addressed by a statute of limitations or
prescription rights, which would formalize rights of long-term and locally
accepted land occupants, such provisions do not exist in Indonesia;
(c)   lack of mechanisms to improve security of customary communal land
rights: although the UUPA explicitly recognizes customary communal land
rights (hak ulayat), only individually held land rights are registered. While
hak ulayat is no longer common and the extent to which it exists is not
totally clear, there are still some distinctively traditional communities, for
instance in West Sumatra, where much of the land is owned communally
without protection from squatters, fraudulent transactions and other risks,
and lacking secure bargaining position vis-a-vis land purchasers; and
(d)   undear boundaries between "forest land" and "non-forest land": forest
land is considered state land, administered by the Ministry of Forestry. In
areas where boundaries between "forest" and "non-forest" land are not
clear, registration of private land rights therefore is difficult. The difficulty
in determining boundaries between the state forest land and hak ulayai land
is also a problem.
1.14        In order to address the above problems, the following actions would be
needed: (a) a systematic review of the legal framework aimed in particular at rationalizing
the multitude of lower level legislation (in particular to improve the security of private land
rights); (b) a revision of the existing government regulation on land registration, PP No.
10/1961, to make the land registration process more efficient; and (c) development of
options to strengthen tenure security of customary (adat) communal land rights. GOI has
already started on the first two actions, and all three would be supported under the
proposed project.
E. ITlVmroNAL FRAMzwoRK FOR LAND MANAGEMENT AND ADmINSRATION
1.15        National Land Agency (BPN).  BPN is the only government agency
responsible for land registration. In 1988, the Directorate General of Agrarian Affairs in
the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) was transformed into BPN, an agency reporting
directly to the President of the Republic. BPN's responsibilities include: formulation of
policies and planning for land reform and ownership; administration of survey, mapping
and registration of land; and granting of land rights to state land. In terms of BPN's
revenues and expenditures, the last two are particularly important. Provision to BPN of
the status of the State Ministry of Agrarian Affairs in March 1993 underlined GOI's
recognition of the importance of BPN's mandate.
1.16        BPN is a large agency with about 26,000 staff, 27 offices at the provincial
level, and 293 at the district (municipality/regency) level which are called land offices (see
Chart 1). Approxnimately 6 percent of the staff are assigned at headquarters, 26 percent
at the provincial level and 68 percent at the land office level. Land registration is
performed only at the land offices. Granting of titles to state land accounts for more than



90 percent of BPN's total revenue. While BPN collects various fees, almost all of them
are transferred to the State Budget.
1.17        BPN is faced with formidable human resource, institutional and technical
constraints in carrying out its responsibilities. The large number of offices and the wide
range of tasks aggravate the absence of a strong human resource base. With their land
registration work, the technologies currently being used for land registration, especially
in mapping, cadastral surveying and land records management, are costly and time-
consuming. While some of these technical constraints can be circumvented by contracting
out work to the private sector, this has been done only on a pilot basis. These constraints
would start to be addressed under the project.
1.18        Other Agencies Involved in Land Management.  At least seven
government agencies are directly involved in land use planning (the Ministries of Forestry,
Public Works, Agriculture, Home Affairs and Housing, in addition to BPN and the
National Investment Coordination Board or BKPM), as well as regional governments at
all levels. Other agencies with involvement in other aspects of land management include
BAPPENAS, as well as the Ministries of Finance, Environment and Justice. However,
division of responsibility in land use matters is often not clear, and coordination among
them needs to be improved. The project would support GOI's efforts to improve
coordination among government agencies concerned with land management.

BANK EXPERIENCE, STRATEGY AND RATIONALE
FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
A. BANK EXPERIENCE
2.1         Perhaps the most successful illustration of the Bank's involvement in land
administration is the two land titling projects in Thailand cofinanced with the Australian
International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), one just completed (Loan No.
2440) and the other started in 1990 (Loan No. 3254). The first project concentrated on
nine rural provinces and mapping in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area, while the second
went into 30 other provinces. Under these projects, the average annual output of title
deeds increased ten-fold, conflicts over land declined substantially, and cost recovery
improved significantly over the last decade.  A third project is expected to start
implementation later this calendar year. With the increase in land values and access to
credit as the major incentives, there has been a strong interest for land owners to have
their land titled. The major lessons are the successful roles played by: specially formed
and trained systematic adjudication teams which involved the communities concerned and
capitalized on economies of scale; new technologies (e.g., with mapping, land records
management); and a graduated increase in cost recovery, where initial titling was
encouraged by low fees and costs were recovered from administrative fees charged on
subsequent registration of title deeds.
2.2         The Bank conducted a sector study on Indonesia's land management and
land use planning in 1991, which basically recommended the use of market mechanisms
based on appropriate pricing, and the acceleration of land registration. As for its lending
operations, the Bank has been addressing land-related issues mainly through projects in the
sectors of agriculture and infrastructure. The National Resource Survey and Mapping
Project (Loan No. 1197) successfully strengthened the institutional capacity of the National
Coordinating Agency for Surveying and Mapping (BAKOSURTANAL). The Urban
Sector Development Project (Loan No. 2816) supported a productive sector dialogue, and
also financed a pilot project for collecting the land and property tax (PBB), which provided
the basis for the highly successful ongoing GOI program aimed at raising PBB revenue.
The Fourth Urban Development Project (Loan No. 1972) produced large-scale photomaps
for 100 cities, aimed at supporting land registration, physical planning and property
taxation: many of these maps would be used for land registration under the proposed
project. The Fifth Transmigration Project (Loan No. 2578) supported a national mapping
program in the outer islands, which successully transferred mapping technology to the
local industry. The Irrigation Subsector Projects (Loan Nos. 2880 and 3392) have



- 9 -
supported the introduction of PBB into project areas, notably by implementing a new land
reclassification and valuation system. Such experience has provided, inter alia, the
following lessons: (a) contracting out work to private firms has been effective in
generating land information (e.g., maps); (b) expected project outputs should be identified
carefully and monitored during implementation; (c) production of land-related information
needs to be demand rather than supply driven; and (d) land-related information should be
used more effectively, by disseminating it widely to potential users along with training.
These lessons have been taken into account in designing the proposed project.
B. BANK STRATEGY AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
2.3         Bank Strategy. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Indonesia
presented to the World Bank's Board of Executive Directors in April 1994 proposed five
major objectives: continuing growth with macroeconomic stability, supporting private
sector developmnent and conpetitiveness, fostering poverty reduction, improving public
sector management, and supporting environmental management.  Accelerated land
registration, the major thrust of the project, would contribute significantly to the private
sector development objective, by: (a) providing the basis for efficient and equitable land
markets; (b) encouraging private investment by reducing investment risk; (c) mobilizing
more financial resources by allowing land to be used as collateral; and (d) providing
opportunities for growth to related industries, especially surveying and mapping. Land
registration would also contribute to the poverty reduction objective, by providing many
poor families with opportunities to have their land registered, which would increase land
value, enable land to be sold at fair prices and improve their access to credit. In the long
term, land registration is expected to contribute to the environmental management
objective, by encouraging long-term investment in land for sustainable use.
2.4         The Bank's strategy for improving land administration and management in
Indonesia has generally been to support specific interventions such as mapping, surveying
and improved tax collection, through individual projects in particular areas. As land-
related issues have become more pervasive, the need has emerged for a more coordinated
and comprehensive approach to address land-related issues directly at all administrative
levels of the government, building on the gains already made. The project would provide
the basis for such a new strategy, by directly supporting accelerated land registration and
by providing a forum and technical inputs to formulate land management policies. The
Bank's strategy would also draw heavily on the sector and macroeconomic dialogue, which
has recently focussed on the policy implications and possible negative impacts of the
location permit (izin lokasi) and the concept of land banking.

THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.1          The main objective of the project is to foster efficient and equitable land
markets and alleviate social conflicts over land, through acceleration of land registration
as the initial phase of GOI's long-term land registration program (part A), and
improvement of the institutional framework for land administration which is needed to
sustain the program (part B). The second main objective of the project (part C) is to
support GOI's efforts to develop land management policies. Related objectives of the
accelerated registration are to support poverty alleviation through increased tenure security
and collateral opportunities to land owners, and to provide incentives for long-term
investment and sustainable land use.
B. PROJECT DESCRITON
3.2          The proposed project comprises three major "parts," as described below.
3.3          Part A: acceleration of land registration. This is the main thrust of the
project, accounting for about 87 percent of the project cost. The accelerated registration
would take place in 18 districts, called kotamadya (municipality) in urban areas and
kabupaten (regency) in rural areas, of which ten in Java would be supported for systenatic
registration and the remaining eight in Java and Sumatra for sporadic registration.4/
The emphasis during the first two years would be on building the institutional, technical,
human resource and regulatory foundations of systematic registration, which would be the
main engine of GOI's long-term land registration program. Between project years 3 and
6, 1.2 million parcels are expected to be registered and have certificates issued through
systematic registration, of which 68 percent would be in West Java (see para. 3.12).
3.4          The hub of Part A is the actual implementation of systematic adjudication,
with special BPN teams (Systematic Adjudication Teams) going from door to door to
adjudicate parcels in the selected districts. This approach capitalizes on economies of
scale, and is much less costly and faster than sporadic adjudication. It is also more

transparent and involves the communities more, which leads to greater support from the
potential beneficiaries. Due to these reasons, the approach has been highly successful in
Thailand (see para.2. 1). These Teams would stay in a designated area for one field season
(ten months) per year, producing 500 certificates per month. Each Team would comprise
sixteen BPN staff, five representatives of local village heads, and private surveying firms.
By project year five, there would be 122 Teams in operation. There would be two trials
of the systematic adjudication: one in project years one/two in Kab. Bogor (2,500 parcels)
and the other in project years two/three in Kab. Karawang (5,000 parcels), to refine the
approach and procedures used. There are two ongoing land registration programs with
systematic aspects (the special registration program for low-income households or PRONA,
and the special village-by-village registration program based on PP No.10/1961 or the
PP1O program): to prevent confusion and inefficiency in carrying out similar yet different
programs, an assurance was obtained from GOI during negotiations that, if the PRONA
and PP10 programs are implemented in the project areas, they will be closely coordinated
with the proposed project through BPN's project implementation units (MSUP and MSUK,
see paras. 5.2 and 5.3), especially by using the procedures developed under the proposed
project. An understanding was also reached with GOI during negotiations that the
PRONA and PP10 programs will not be carried out in villages where systematic
adjudication is implemented under the project. The project also aims at improving the
efficiency of sporadic registration, mainly to: (a) make the land registration system more
responsive to public demand (e.g., shorter turnaround times for services), (b) increase the
reliability of the land cadastre (e.g., by reducing fraudulent certificates through the use of
graphical indices); and (c) prepare certain land offices (e.g., the two in Sumatra) for
systematic registration in the next phase.
3.5         Part A comprises four components. Thefirst is controlpoints densification,
base mapping, and graphical index compilation.SI The actual scope of control points
densification and base mapping to be carried out under the project is summarized in Annex
3. 1, and the graphical index program is described in Annex 3.2 Base mapping would be
carried out by private firms, as with most of the control points densification which would
be based on the Global Positioning System (GPS). During negotiations, an assurance was
obtained from GOI that the flying and mapping plans under the project will be
incorporated into BPN's annual flying and mapping program by December 31 each year.
The second is systematic registration, including systematic adjudication, cadastral
surveying, provision of land office facilities and equipment; and information dissemination
to and consultation with the public and the regional governments on the procedures, fees
and benefits of land registration (called customer relations and services or CRS activities).
Cadastral surveying would be conducted by private firms, which would be trained on GOI
requirements for land registration purposes. The systematic and sporadic registration
programs are described in detail in Annexes 3.3 and 3.4 respectively, and the civil works
to be supported under the project are summarized in Annex 3.5. The third is sporadic
registration, witi provision of facilities and equipment to the land offices supported. The
fourth is the institutional supportfor land registraton, comprising implementation support

to BPN (including advisers on various aspects of land registration); training of BPN staff
for accelerated land registration; support for BPN's technology development related to land
registration; technical assistance to BPN for project progress monitoring; and a
socioeconomic baseline study for systematically registered areas (see para. 6.8). During
negotiations an assurance was obtained from GOI that the training will be implemented
according to the agreed schedule (Annex 4.4) and a program satisfactory to the Bank.
3.6         The Bank's loan would finance: control points densification (about 90
percent to be carried out by the private sector and the rest by BPN itself),6/ mapping
and cadastral surveying by private firms; civil works for renovation and expansion of
BPN's offices; the implementation costs of land registration;7/ equipment for the field
teams and the supported BPN offices; training of BPN staff; and some technical assistance
(to BPN for the monitoring of project progress, a socioeconomic baseline study, and
advisers in customary land tenure and sociology/anthropology called the "Customary Land
Tenure Team" which would assist BPN with, inter alia, CRS activities). An AIDAB grant
would finance a team of advisers in various areas of expertise (440 international and 241
national person-months, see Annex 4.2 for breakdown), which would assist BPN in
implementing Part A, as well as the operating costs for the technical assistance.
3.7         Part B:   improvement of the institutional framework for land
administration. It is made up of two components. The first is the improvement of the
legal framework for land administration, by developing a database for land laws and
regulations, and assisting BPN with its efforts to systematically review and draft land laws
and regulations. The latter would include finalization of the new government regulation
revising PP No.10/1961, and drafting of a new Land Rights Act which would set forth
private rights on land. The revision of PP No. 10/1961, to introduce more practical and
efficient procedures for land registration, could significantly improve the land registration
process, in terms of providing more tenure security to more people more quickly. During
negotiations, an assurance was obtained from GOI that GOI will carry out the revision on
the basis of the timetable agreed at appraisal, so that a final BPN draft of the new
government regulation revising PP No. 10/1961 (ready for approval by the State
Secretariat) can be furnished to the Bank for comments by November 30, 1994 and take
all measures necessary to enact the regulation by August 31, 1995. The second is the
long-term development of land administration, through: a study on BPN's overall fee
structure; studies on ways to improve tenure security for customary (adat) land rights; and
BPN's institutional development through training, scholarships and masters degree courses
both in Indonesia and abroad on such longer-term themes as information science, as well
as support to PUSDIKLAT (the Center for Training and Education), STPN (the National
Land Institute in Yogyakarta which provides university level degree courses for BPN staff)
6/ Of the 8,122 control points to be established in the project areas, 835 points (all of Kod. Jakarta
Selatan, Kod. Jakarta Barat and Kod. Jakarta Timur, as well as 100 in Kab. Bogor and 200 in Kab.
Bandung) would be established by BPN's special teams.
7/ Implementing costs for land registration are defined here as one-time (not recurrent) inputs for use
by BPN tearm carrying out control points densification, graphical index compilation and systematic
adjudication, covering such items as travel allowance for BPN staff, their deployment costs and
supplies. They are investment costs needed to establish a land cadastre, which is a social capital.



- 13 -
and the geodetic faculties of the University of Gadjah Mada in Yogyakarta and the Institute
of Technology in Bandung.
3.8         The Bank's loan would finance:  training in Indonesia (Annex 4.4);
dormitories and equipment for PUSDIKLAT and STPN; scholarships in Indonesia; and
part of the technical assistance (adat land rights studies; a team of law specialists which
would assist BPN in the review and drafting of land laws and regulations called "the Land
Law Resource Group"; and computer-based compilation of land laws and regulations).
See para. 6.7 for details on the adat land-rights studies. AIDAB would finance a team of
advisers on land law, human resource development and overseas training (totalling 90
international and 60 national person months for Part B alone), as well as overseas
scholarships on selected long-term topics and some overseas short-term training including
those in Thailand to learn from the Land Titling Projects (Annex 4.3).
3.9         Part C: development of land management policies, with provision of
Bank-financed technical assistance to a core team of GOI agencies working under BKTRN.
Part C is an integrated program of studies, seminars and workshops on selected topic areas
in land management aiming at supporting policy formulation and inter-agency coordination,
while drawing heavily on international experience, to be coordinated by BAPPENAS as
the chairing agency for BKTRN. The origin of Part C was the recognition that quick
solutions for land-related issues cannot and should not be sought, given the magnitude of
vested interests and the multitude of the players involved, and that a process-oriented
approach is needed to sensitize the players involved and facilitate an inter-active
formulation of solutions. Through Part C activities, the nature of the problems would be
analyzed, options for improving existing policies identified, policy guidelines developed,
and action plans formulated. Part C would be inter-actively linked with parts A and B,
by addressing specific issues in land administration which cannot be resolved by BPN
itself, such as the issue of forest/non-forest boundary areas mentioned in subpara. 1.13 (d).
3.10        The following have been identified with GOI as the topic areas which should
be examined under Part C: (a) institutional roles of government agencies involved with
land management; (b) different approaches to land acquisition (including the location
permit or izin lokasi); (c) displacement and resettlement of people; (d) options for land
assembly (including land banking); (e) spatial development planning; (f) issues in land
rights; (g) forest-non forest boundary issues; and (h) land management policies aimed at
sustainable development. It has already been agreed with GOI that items (a) and (b) above
would be taken up starting the first year of the project, as the highest priority issues.
During negotiations, an assurance would be sought from GOI that the topic areas to be
examined under Part C will be selected from the above agreed list (detailed in Annex 3.6),
or such other topic areas as may be agreed with the Bank.
C. PROJCwr AREA

West Java province:     Kab. Bandung
DKI Jakarta province:    Kod. Jakarta Barat (West), Kod. Jakarta Timur
(East)
Central Java province:    Kab. Klaten, Kab. Wonogiri
East Java province:     Kod. Surabaya
North Sumatra province:  Kod. Medan
South Sumatra province:  Kod. Palembang
3.12        The above areas were chosen on the basis of the following criteria: strong
economic growth; no confirmed cases of customary communal land rights (hak ulayat);
small percentage of forest land; high percentage of uncertified land; high percentage of
land covered with existing maps; strong increase in the number of parcels in recent years;
and the capacity and interest of the BPN offices concerned. The details of the chosen
districts are provided in Annex 1.2. The systematic program is limited only to Java, to
avoid logistical problems in introducing new technologies, mobilizing a large number of
staff, and coordinating closely with the regional governments. Sixty-eight percent of the
parcels to be titled by the systematic program are concentrated in the West Java province,
due to the large number of unregistered parcels (24 percent of the estimated total for
Indonesia, see Annex 1.1), and proximity to BPN's headquarters. All eligible parcels in
six districts are expected to be systematically registered under the project: those in Kod.
Bandung, Kab. Bekasi, Kab. Karawang, Kod. Jakarta Selatan, Kod. Semarang and Kod.
Malang. In the province of DKI Jakarta, systematic registration would be implemented
in only one of the five municipalities (Kod. Jakarta Selatan), because systematic
registration would generally be difficult in Jakarta due to the large number of informal
occupants, lack of documentary evidence, etc., especially at the initial stage of the
program when procedures are still being refined. Two other municipalities, Barat and
Timur, would be supported for sporadic registration. The ratio of "rural" to "urban"
parcels in the systematic registration areas, according to GOI's classification, is estimated
at about 65 percent versus 35 percent, with many of the rural parcels found in peri-urban
areas where land use is changing dynamically.
3.13        Those areas chosen for the sporadic program basically fulfilled the above
criteria, but were judged not to be ready for systematic registration for various reasons
(e.g., scattered uncertified parcels, local BPN land office not yet ready, distance from
other project areas). Some of these areas may be supported for systematic registration
under the second phase of GOI's long-term land registration program.

PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
A. PRojECr CosT
4.1         The project cost, including physical and price contingencies, is estimated at
Rp 295.0 billion (US$140.1 million) over six years. The foreign exchange portion
accounts for Rp 87.1 billion (US$41.4 million) or about 30 percent of the project cost, and
Rp 23.8 billion (US$11.3 million) would be duties and taxes. Eighty-seven percent of the
total base cost is allocated to Part A, with Parts B and C accounting for 9 and 4 percent,
respectively. Physical contingencies of 10 percent have been used for civil works, and
5 percent for service contracts, reproduction of maps, technical assistance, and
implementing costs for land registration. Price contingencies of 5.5 percent per year have
been used for local currency costs and 2.8 percent per year for foreign currency costs.
Project cost estimates are summarized in Table 4.1 and detailed in Annex 2.
B. FINANCNG PLAN
4.2         The proposed Bank loan of US$80.0 million equivalent would finance
65 percent of the total project cost, excluding taxes (US$11.3 million) and procurement
of vehicles which GOI wishes to finance (US$6.5 million). About 32 percent of the total
project cost (US$44.9 million) would be financed by GOI, and the balance of 11 percent
(US$15.2 million equivalent) by a grant provided by AIDAB.
4.3         The project financing plan is summarized in Table 4.2.
C. PROCUREMENT
4.4         Overview. At BPN, there will be three types of institutional arrangements
for procurement under the project:  BPN headquarters would be responsible for
procurement of such items as equipment and furniture to be used at headquarters, base
mapping, control points densification, civil works other than land offices, vehicles and
imported equipment; BPN's provincial offices for such items as cadastral surveying and
civil works for land offices, as well as small furniture for the Systematic Adjudication
Teams; and BPN's special teams carrying out control points densification, graphical index
compilation and systematic adjudication for supplies and services to be purchased locally

addition of one floor at BPN's headquarters building to accommodate project staff and
consultants; a dormitory at BPN's PUSDIKLAT; and a dormitory and lecturer
accommodation at STPN (see para. 3.7). As these civil works are small, scattered
geographically over five provinces and not complex, they are unlikely to attract foreign
competition, and hence would be procured in accordance with LCB procedures acceptable
to the Bank. A summary of civil works to be financed under the project is attached as
Annex 3.5.
4.6         Service Contacts (US$35.1 million) consist of control points densification
(US$2.2 million); mapping including aerial photography, aerial triangulation and
enlargement (US$12.5 million); cadastral surveying including establishment of boundary
marks (US$19.8 million); and media publicity on systematic registration (US$0.6 million).
About 90 percent of the control points densification would be carried out on the basis of
contracts, and the rest by BPN itself under "implementing costs for land registration" (see
page 12, footnote 7 for details). During negotiations, an understanding was reached with
GOI that control points densification, aerial photography and base mapping will be
packaged together in a given area to be undertaken by the same contractor, due to the
requirement for close coordination between these activities. There would be about 19 of
these packages, ranging in value from US$100,000 to US$2.1 million, to cover 18 districts
in seven provinces over six years (see Annex 3.1). Since these contracts are unlikely to
attract foreign contractors, and because such base mapping in Indonesia was supported
under at least six Bank projects all through LCB with satisfactory results, these packages
would be tendered through LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank and open to interested
foreign bidders. Cadastral surveying would in principle be contracted through LCB at
least to two different firms for each district, to encourage competition between them in the
longer term: this is because landowners may wish to have subdivision work or general
boundary definition carried out in the future, and the use of at least two firms will reduce
the possibility of one company monopolizing all such future work in one area. However,
this is a general principle, and in the case of smaller districts, only one company may be
contracted on the grounds of efficiency. Since the cadastral surveying would not start fully
until project year three, the detailed packaging arrangements will be finalized after the first
systematic adjudication trial at the end of project year one/beginning of project year two.
The cadastral surveying contracts would include two-week training to be provided by
qualified surveyors whose names would be listed by BPN prior to bidding. Most

(US$200,000) of the media announcement contracts would be procured through local
shopping, due to their small amounts: some would be procured through direct contracting,
in geographical areas where there is only one newspaper or one television channel.
4.7         Equipment to be financed under the loan (US$5.6 million) would be
suitably packaged and procured by BPN's headquarters and provincial offices. (All
furniture required for the project totalling US$3.0 million would be financed fully by
GOI.) Equipment such as electronic distance measurement (EDM) devices, GPS
equipment, analytical plotters and theodolites would be procured through ICB, as well as
most of the computers.  In bid comparison and evaluation under ICB, domestic
manufacturers may be granted a margin of preference of 15 percent or the prevailing
import duty, whichever is lower. Other contracts would be packaged into contracts each
amounting to less than US$200,000 equivalent and up to the aggregate amount of US$2.1
million, and procured through LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts not
exceeding US$20,000 (up to an aggregate value of US$610,000), for such equipment to
be used by BPN's provincial and land offices as telephones and photocopiers, would be
procured through local shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank. Library books for
STPN (US$18,000) would be procured through direct contracting.
4.8         Map Reproduction (US$0.5 million). Maps currently being used by the
Directorate of the Land and Property Tax (PBB) at the Ministry of Finance and the
National Coordinating Agency for Surveys and Mapping (BAKOSURTANAL) will be
reproduced for use under the project. About half of the maps (US$270,000) would be
reproduced by contractors selected through local shopping procedures acceptable to the
Bank; the rest would be reproduced by BPN itself using its own equipment.
4.9         Consulting Services to be financed under the loan (US$7.4 million) will be
hired under the Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants, after inviting proposals from
firms short-listed by GOI and acceptable to the Bank. This would include: (a) Part C
consultancy (US$4.2 million); (b) adat land rights studies (US$0.7 million); (c) supervision
and quality checking of control points densification, aerial photography and base mapping
(US$0.6 million); (d) the Land Law Resource Group (US$0.6 million); (e) the Customary
Land Tenure Team (US$0.6 million); (f) assistance for the monitoring of project progress
(US$0.4 million); (g) the socioeconomic baseline study (US$0.3 million); and (h) the
computer-based compilation of land laws and regulations (US$0.1 million). All of the
contracts would use the Bank's standard forms of contract. The final draft TOR, short list
and letters of invitation acceptable to the Bank for all the consultancies above, except (c),
were brought by GOI to negotiations for agreement with the Bank. During negotiations,
an understanding was reached with GOI that the final draft TOR, short list and letter of
invitation for (c) above will be provided to the Bank by March 31, 1995.
4.10        Training (US$2.7 million) to be financed under the loan would be carried
out by using local and governmental procedures acceptable to the Bank.  Private
institutions would be selected and hired for short-term training on human resource
development and desk-top publishing, using governmental administrative procedures.
4.11        Implementing Costs for Land Registration (US$28.9 million) consist of
two categories of items. One is the inputs for systematic adjudication, graphical index

compilation and control points densification, to be carried out by BPN's special teams
(US$27.9 million). This includes travel allowance (US$15.2 million) for these BPN teams
and miscellaneous supplies such as stationery and computer consumables. The other
category is materials to be procured in large amounts totalling US$1.0 million, namely
drafting films and forms other than certificate forms, which would be packaged and
procured through LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank, for use by the special BPN
teams. The certificate forms would be printed by GOI according to its regulations, and
its costs would be fully borne by GOI. The definition of the term 'implementing costs
for land registration" is provided in footnote 7, page 12.
Items Financed by GOI and the AIDAB Grant
4.12        Vehides and Furniture. GOI will provide the required vehicles for the
project under their own procedures, in accordance with the schedule agreed with the Bank
(Annex 3.7). An assurance to this effect was obtained from GOI during negotiations. All
furniture required for the project would also be financed fully by GOI.
4.13        Items Financed by the AIDAB Grant. Items financed by the AIDAB grant
would be procured in accordance with AIDAB's procedures. They consist of: a team of
advisers to assist BPN with the implementation of Parts A and B (Annex 4.2); vehicles for
their own use (nine standard four-wheel vehicles and one microbus); their office costs
including support staff and vehicle operation; scholarships in Australia including pre-
departure English training; short-term training courses and study tours overseas (Annex
4.3) and equipment (US$0. 1 million) for geodetic faculties of two universities (para. 3.7).
The signing of the Project Arrangement by GOI with the Government of Australia, and
the completion of accreditation for at least the seven AIDAB-financed consultants needed
at the project start-up,8/ have been completed as a Board condition.
Review of Procurement
4.14        The Bank would conduct a prior review of all documents concerning the
tendering and award of: (a) all ICB contracts (namely for imported equipment and
equipment packaged into contracts exceeding US$200,000); (b) the civil works and service
contracts to be prepared first and the subsequent ones exceeding US$750,000 equivalent;
and (c) all consultancy contracts financed by the Bank which exceed US$100,000 for firms
and US$50,000 for individuals. The above prior review thresholds would result in the
prior review of about 70 percent of the total value of contracts financed under the loan,
which can be justified by the use of standard bidding documents, BPN's prior experience
with some Bank projects, and the relatively large number of simple contracts of a
repetitive nature. The other contracts would be retained by BPN's headquarters and
provincial offices, and reviewed by the Bank on a post award sample basis. The Bank's
standard bidding documents will be used for ICB. For LCB, standard bidding documents,
a draft of which was brought to negotiations by GOI for agreement with the Bank, will be
used. During negotiations, an understanding was reached with GOI that GOI will provide
8/ The seven consultants are the team leader, and the international advisers for project administration,
geodesy, mapping, systematic registration, human resource development and land law.

the Bank with the draft bidding documents for control points densification, aerial
photography and base mapping by September 30, 1994, and the draft bidding documents
for cadastral surveying by January 31, 1995 (both based on the above standard bidding
documents for LCB). For consultant services to be financed by the Bank, the prior review
would include TOR, short list, letter of invitation, recommendation for award and the final
contract.
D. DISBURSEMEN
4.15        Disbursements under the Bank loan will be completed by September 30,
2000, about six years after loan effectiveness. The estimated schedule of disbursement is
given in Annex 2.4. The schedule differs substantially from the disbursement profile of
agricultural projects in Indonesia, which extends over eight and a half years. The main
reason is the advanced state of project preparation (para. 5.9).
4.16        Loan Allocation. The proposed allocation of the loan and percentage of
expenditures to be financed by the Bank would be as follows:
(a)   90 percent of expenditures on civil works;
(b)   90 percent of expenditures on service contracts, including mapping, control
points densification and cadastral surveying;
(c)   100 percent of foreign expenditures (CIF) for directly imported equipment,
100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured
equipment, and 65 percent of total expenditures for other items procured
locally;
(d)   90 percent of map reproduction;
(e)   100 percent of consulting services financed by the loan;
(f)   60 percent of expenditures on training; and
(g)   75 percent of implementation costs for land registration.
4.17        Disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditure (SOE) for
contracts of civil works and service contracts valued less than US$750,000 equivalent,
equipment valued less than US$200,000 equivalent, implementation costs for land
registration, training, map reproduction and consultancy contracts with amounts not
exceeding US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. Contracts disbursed
under SOEs would be based on standard bid documents approved by the Bank and
disbursement for all other expenditures would be on the basis of full documentation.
Documentation for SOE expenditures would not be submitted for review, but would be
retained by BPN's headquarters and provincial offices, and made available for inspection
by the Bank during project supervision.



- 22 -
4.18        Special Accounts. To enable BPN to implement the project effectively and
to make prompt payments to contractors and consultants, a Special Account of US$2.5
million would be established in Bank Indonesia or a commercial bank satisfactory to the
Bank. This account should be maintained by the Director General of Budget (DG Budget)
in the Ministry of Finance. The Special Account would be used for all eligible local and
foreign expenditures under the project. This account would be replenished on a monthly
basis, or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever occurs first. A
monthly statement on the Special Account would be submitted by DG Budget to the Bank.
E. AccouNTs AND AuDrrs
4.19        Accounts and Audits. It has been agreed that: (a) separate accounts would
be set up at BPN's headquarters and the five BPN provincial offices supported under the
project (and the relevant office at BAPPENAS for Part C); (b) BPN's provincial office
would be responsible for filing a monthly report on the project's accounts to the Provincial
Project Management Committee (see para. 5.3); (c) every quarter the accounts would be
compiled into one consolidated account report by BPN's headquarters; and (d) BPN, as
the lead agency for the project, should include in the above consolidated report the
accounts for Part C. A report on the consolidated account will be provided to the Bank
by BPN, by December 31 every year, or less than nine months after the close of GOI's
fiscal year. These accounts, as well as the SOE, will be audited by GOI's Central Audit
Bureau (BPKP) in accordance with GOI's standard procedures.
4.20        Technical Audits. Because of the significant number of small purchases,
the substantial amount of procurement expected to be carried out through SOE procedures
and the relatively large scale of training in Indonesia supported under the project, GOI
would carry out technical audits of the activities carried out under the project, with special
emphasis on contracts not subject to prior review by the Bank. The technical audit would
focus on the whole or part of the contract approval and execution process, include post-
review of the documentation for completed contracts, and cover both technical and
financial aspects. During negotiations, an assurance was obtained from GOI that: (a) GOI
will provide the Bank with TOR and proposed organizational arrangements for the
technical audits of Parts A and B of the project, by June 1, 1995; (b) GOI will carry out
the technical audits annually during project implementation, commencing not later than
April 1, 1996; and (c) GOI will provide the Bank with copies of these audit reports for
review and comments starting not later than October 1, 1996.

ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT
AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMLEMENTATION
5.1         There are two separate arrangements for project management and
implementation: one for Parts A and B, and the other for Part C. For Parts A and B, the
project has adopted a decentralized approach in developing BPN's implementation
capacity, by emphasizing capacity development at the provincial level. This is necessary
due to the large geographical coverage, the important role to be played by BPN's
provincial offices, and the large number of staff to be trained. The details are explained
below and illustrated in Chart 1.
Parts A and B
5.2         At BPN's headquarters, a Project Management Committee (PMC), which
is responsible for overall supervision as well as policy-level decisions, would be formed.
It would be chaired by Deputy IV (Surveying and Land Registration), vice-chaired by
Deputy I (General Affairs) and consisting of other BPN Deputies, as well as the Director
General of Public Administration and Regional Autonomy (PUOD) at MOHA, Director
General of Taxes at the Ministry of Finance, and Deputy I (Base Mapping) of
BAKOSURTANAL. Other GOI agencies, such as BAPPENAS, the Ministry of Justice
and the State Secretariat, would be invited as necessary. The Project Director would be
its secretary, and the Project Manager (Pimpro) and the heads of BPN's provincial offices
supported under the project would also be invited as needed. Below the PMC, a Project
Technical Committee (PTC) would be established to supervise and coordinate the
operations, to be chaired by the Project Director and comprising the other BPN directors
concerned as well as the Director of PBB at the Ministry of Finance and the Director of
Government Affairs at MOHA. The full-time Project Manager, reporting to the Project
Director and operating as the secretary of the PTC, would be responsible for the day-to-
day implementation and management. To support project implementation at BPN
headquarters (Pusat), a full-time Management Support Unit at Pusat (MSUP) would be
established. The PMC and MSUP would be supported by full-time advisers financed by
AIDAB (hereafter called "the TA Team"). BPN's Center for Research and Development
would manage the adat land rights studies, with assistance from the Customary Land
Tenure Team.
5.3         The project implementation and management structure at the provincial
level mirrors the structure at BPN's headquarters. At each of the five provinces where



- 24 -
systematic adjudication would be carried out, a Provincial Project Management Committee
(PMC-K) would be established to supervise and coordinate the systematic program, and
a Management Support Unit at BPN's provincial office (MSUK) would be set up, to be
chaired by one (not multiple) provincial subproject manager (PiniBagPro), to implement
project activities at the provincial level. PMC-K would have as members representatives
of the local governments concerned, BPN's provincial office head (as the vice-
chairperson), and the appointed Project Manager (BPN staff assigned by the provincial
head). MSUK would assist PMC-K in implementing the project at the provincial level.
The PMC-K and MSUK would be supported by advisers of the TA Team who are
positioned at the provincial offices.
5.4         At the district level, a Land Office Project Coordinator would be appointed
in each land office supported for systematic registration to liaise with the Systematic
Adjudication Teams, especially to: facilitate the Teams' access to information stored in
the land offices; coordinate with other district-level government agencies with the support
of BPN's Customer Relations and Services (CRS) staff assigned to the land offices; and
facilitate the land offices' acceptance of documents produced by these Teams.
5.5         The Systematic Adjudication Teams would report administratively to
BPN's provincial offices.  However, they would report legally, operationally and
technically to the land offices in the districts they are assigned to. The provincial offices
can therefore deploy and re-deploy the Teams to other districts quickly, on completion of
their tasks in one district. On the completion of their tasks in the province, up to three
years in duration, they would be deployed into adjacent or nearby provinces by the PMC
in Jakarta, coordinated by MSUP. The implementation of control points densification,
base mapping, graphical index compilation and systematic adjudication would be managed
by the Project Director, under coordination by MSUP.
Part C
5.6         The Coordinating Board for National Spatial Planning (BKTRN) would
provide overall policy guidance to Part C, especially through its secretary who is Deputy
V (Regional Development Affairs) of BAPPENAS.
5.7         The Expert Advisor on Spatial Planning and Land to the State Minister for
National Development Planning, as the Project Director for Part C, would provide
operational guidance and supervision to Part C. To help manage and execute the work of
Part C, the Part C consultancy would include the services of a Land Policy Support Team,
including one senior international land policy expert, two national experts, and a small
core of support staff. The Project Manager (Pimpro) for Part C and the Land Policy
Support Team would coordinate and implement Part C on a day-to-day basis.
Overall Project Coordination
5.8         A Project Coordination Committee (PCC), consisting of the Secretary of
BKTRN (Deputy V, BAPPENAS), the Chairperson of the PMC and the two Project
Directors, would coordinate between Parts A/B and Part C. Given the need to implement
the whole project in the context of spatial management activities carried out by different



- 25 -
GOI agencies, the Secretary of BKTRN would chair the PCC. The Land Policy Support
Team would serve as its secretariat.
Status of Project Preparation
5.9         The project was prepared by GOI with TA provided under the Population
and Human Resource Development grant of the Government of Japan. BPN established
a special task force for this purpose. The PMC and MSUP have been formally
established, and the Project Managers for both Parts A/B and Part C have been officially
appointed, which were conditions of board presentation. The budget for project year one
has been allocated. The Project Directors for Parts A and B have been appointed. The
detailed staffing plans for the Systematic Adjudication Teams to be mobilized in the first
year of systematic adjudication have been largely completed. The TOR for the AIDAB-
financed TA Team, accounting for 54 percent of the total value of TA provided under the
project, have been completed and a consultant firm has been selected. A letter from the
Directorate of Land and Property Tax (PBB) on map availability and a letter from the
National Coordinating Agency for Surveys and Mapping (BAKOSURTANAL) on the
availability of aerial photographs have been provided to the Bank. A schedule of training
has been agreed upon (Annex 4.4). The final draft TOR for five consultancies financed
by the Bank were provided by GOI at negotiations, for agreement with the Bank. The list
of contracts to be financed under the loan and the project implementation schedule are
attached as Annexes 3.8 and 3.9, respectively.
B. HUMAN REsouRcE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT
5.10        To successfully implement the accelerated land titling and registration,
sufficient implementation capacity needs to be built up in a timely manner. According to
the staffing plan, BPN would re-assign about 2,300 staff (about 9 percent of its existing
work force) to project-related tasks (about 2,000 of them to the Systematic Adjudication
Teams) and hire about 1,000 new staff to replace some of the re-assigned staff (see
Annexes 3.10 and 3.11). Both financial and career development incentives would be given
to members of the Teams, as they would have to spend extended periods away from their
homes. BPN has already requested the Ministry of Finance formally to raise the level of
financial incentives. Career development incentives are also important: while members
of these Teams would not return to the jobs they previously held in the land offices, they
would have the same opportunities as other staff for participation in BPN's training
programs required for promotion. During negotiations, an assurance was obtained from
GOI that BPN's teams for systematic adjudication, control points densification and
graphical index compilation, as well as MSUP, shall be maintained until completion of the
project with qualified staff in adequate numbers.
5.11        With a view to rationalizing the use of its human resources, BPN would
replace only half of the staff to be assigned to systematic registration with newly recruited
staff, who can only be assigned to positions when BPN's mandatory training is completed
nearly two years after recruitment. Costs for the mandatory training (including costs to
train staff recruited in project years 4 and 5, who would become operational in the next
phase), have been incorporated in the project's incremental cost. Since such costs, to be



- 26 -
financed by GOI, are significant (more than US$7 million over the project period), the TA
Team would assist BPN in streamlining these training programs.
5.12        The project also supports human resource development in the private sector,
in particular training of cadastral surveyors selected to participate in systematic
adjudication, aimed at enabling them to carry out their task in strict adherence to the
regulations concerned. In Indonesia, cadastral surveying for land registration has been
done by the private sector in only a few pilot schemes. The training is thus not provided
to help realize their private gains, but to maximize the public gains from the project. The
training would also induce private surveyors to start taking an active role in land
registration: in the later phases of the long-term land registration program, such training
may no longer be necessary. The project also supports the geodetic faculties of two
universities in Indonesia (see para. 3.7).
C. MoNrORING AND EVALUATION
Key Progress Indicators
5.13        The progress and performance of Parts A and B would be measured and
monitored closely against the key progress indicators (KPI) agreed between GOI and the
Bank (Annex 3.12). The introduction of KPI as a management tool would help BPN in
achieving improved performance, planning, monitoring of project progress, problem
solving and budgeting: such indicators have been effectively used, for example, in the
land offices in the United Kingdom. The three following types of key progress indicators
(KPI) would be monitored for the project:
(a)   output indicators, which are straightforward indicators of the project's
various outputs, grouped into four broad categories:  (i) systematic
registration outputs; (ii) sporadic registration outputs; (iii) outputs related
to land office up-grading; and (iv) outputs concerning institutional
development (e.g., training courses, seminars, studies);
(b)   financial indicators, which indicate BPN's improvements in financial yields
and efficiency.  They comprise:  (i) revenues from land registration;
(ii) expenditures for a land office; and (iii) unit costs for parcel surveys,
adjudication and certificate production; and
(c)   efficiency indicators, which indicate the efficiency gains made in the land
registration system. They include: total office transactions (i.e., number
of sales, mortgages, discharges of mortgages, subdivisions) per employee;
percentage of sales registrations handled within a fixed period of time (e.g.,
30 days); percentage of subdivisions completed within a fixed period of time
(e.g., 60 days); and incidence of disputes.
BPN (mainly MSUP, MSUK and the land offices) is responsible for the preparation and
monitoring of KPI. For each KPI, targets would be set annually, refined over time, and
reviewed during supervision missions.



- 27 -
Progress Monitoring Consultancy
5.14        Of the above three types of KPI, BPN is expected to encounter difficulty
initially in monitoring the financial and efficiency indicators, as these indicators involve
concepts mostly foreign to BPN at present. Technical assistance by project monitoring
specialists would therefore be provided from project year two, to enable BPN to conduct
the monitoring fully by project year five. During negotiations, an assurance was obtained
from GOI that the consultants will be employed by April 1, 1995.
Reporting Requirements
5.15        For Parts A and B, MSUP would compile quarterly reports for submission
to the two Project Directors, the Bank and AIDAB, with the KPI from the previous
quarter. For Part C, the Project Manager assisted by the Land Policy Support Team
would provide quarterly reports to the two Project Directors, the Bank and AIDAB.
Supervision Missions and Mid-Term Review
5.16        Project supervision would be conducted in principle on a semi-annual basis
jointly by the Bank and AIDAB. There would be a mid-term review after project year two
(currently scheduled for September 1996), after completion of the two systematic
adjudication trials, to review the progress made (e.g., the purchase of vehicles), examine
the need to adjust design, etc. The expected mission timing and expertise requirements
for these missions are described in Annex 3.13.
Annual Work Program Review
5.17        Project implementation would be reviewed annually, so that findings can be
reflected in GOI's budgetary process and adjustments can be made in the implementation
schedule. The review would take place concurrently with the Bank's regular supervision
missions, and the first review would take place around September 1995 to review progress
of the project's start-up activities and discuss a draft work program for the following year.
During negotiations an assurance was obtained from GOI that GOI will provide to the
Bank for its review and comments: (a) a coordinated work program, together with budget
estimates, for the following fiscal year by September 30 each year, commencing
November 30, 1994; and (b) the budget proposals for the following fiscal year by
December 31 each year, commencing December 31, 1994.

BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. BENEFICRES  ND BENEFIm
6.1         Beneficiaries. With the output target of 1.2 million parcels, the systematic
land titling and registration program is expected to provide direct benefits to households
residing in these parcels, in the form of registered land and certificates of title. Based on
the methodology used during project preparation, the above would amount to about 4
million people:2/ they currently have little protection against unfair land acquisition
(e.g., "land-grabbing," low compensation), no access to formal credit based on land as
collateral, and difficulty in selling their land at fair prices. Many of them are expected to
be below the low-income threshold (about 14 percent of the population according to
incidence of poverty in Java), especially since the affluent tend to have their parcels
registered early. The project would build the basis for GOI's long-term land registration
program, which would realize benefits to much larger groups of people when other
geographical areas are reached during later stages. Part C would benefit a significant
number of people through improved land management policy, especially in such areas as
land acquisition.
6.2         Benefits.  Direct project benefits to the beneficiaries of systematic
registration include:  improved tenure security against unfair land acquisition; the
possibility to sell their land at fair prices; the ability to use land as collateral; and reduction
in conflicts over land rights. The project would also build the foundations of GOI's long-
term land registration program, which would foster more efficient and equitable land
markets in Indonesia, in terms of: more efficient and transparent land transactions; less
risk in land-related investment; mobilization of financial resources through use of land as
collateral; and provision of incentives for longer-term investment towards more sustainable
land use. Finally, the development of land management policies through Part C would
contribute to improvements in some key land policy areas.
B. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPAcT
6.3         The project's impact on the physical environment would be neutral in the
short- and medium-term. Experience in the Bank-supported Land Titling Project in
Thailand and the Northeast Region Land Tenure Improvement Project in Brazil do not
2/  This is estimated by first inflating the number of legal parcels by 25 percent to derive the number
of tax parcels, then applying the estimate of 2.65 persons to each tax parcel.



- 29 -
indicate, as reported in their Project Completion Reports (Nos. 11896 and 10710,
respectively), any significant impact on the environment. A socioeconomic study for the
Thailand project also did not show any significant environmental impacts.
6.4         In the long term, land registration could have positive impacts on the
environment in two respects: it would provide incentives to invest for long-term land use
(e.g., soil conservation in rural areas, and investments in environmental infrastructure such
as kitchens and bathrooms in urban areas); and provide information which could be useful
in environmental management. The latter may be particularly important: the project
would provide information (e.g., land rights information, photomaps, aerial photographs)
which can be used by the government authorities concerned, especially the local
governments, to monitor and address environmental impacts through building permits,
investment licenses, hindrance permits and other regulatory mechanisms. If impacts are
significant, the government would make such projects subject to the analysis of
environmental impacts (AMDAL). This division of organizational responsibilities is
similar to those of many OECD countries, where the land registration functions are
conducted by agencies independent from those which conduct subdivisions, development
approval and environmental assessment.
6.5         Institutional arrangements and policies to help GOI protect environmentally
sensitive areas, including ways with which land registration can be coordinated with
strategic structural plans developed by provincial and local governments, would be
explored under Part C, given the cross-agency nature of the issue.
C. SOCIL EMPACT
6.6         The accelerated land titling and registration is expected to result in a
reduction of disputes over land rights in the project areas, which would represent a
significantly positive social impact. This is indeed what has happened with the Thailand
project, as shown in its socioeconomic impact study. Sociological inputs have been
provided during the project preparation.
6.7         Not very many cases of customary communal land rights (hak ulayat) are
now confirmed in Indonesia, and still less in areas where land registration is possible (i.e.,
non-forest areas). However, care will be taken so as not to affect these rights adversely
through land registration. A strategy to prevent such negative impacts, agreed with GOI,
would: (a) exclude areas with confirmed cases of hak ulayat (e.g., West Sumatra) from
areas for systematic registration under the project; (b) not register systematically any hak
ulayat land under the project if such rights are found in the project area; (c) examine the
feasibility, desirability and methodology of registering hak ulayat in three selected areas
through the ada: land rights studies, to prepare for the later stages of GOI's long-term land
registration program; and (d) identify issues related to such rights and formulate a strategy
for addressing these issues under Part C. With regard to (c) above, an assurance was
obtained from GOI during negotiations that the results from the first phase (detailed work
program design, work definition of hak ulayat, etc.) of the adat land rights studies will be
completed and furnished to the Bank for comments by September 30, 1995, and that the
results from the third phase (actual implementation of studies in three selected areas) will



- 30 -
be completed and an action plan to implement the recommendations endorsed by GOI and
the Bank will be furnished to the Bank for comments by March 31, 1997.
6.8         In consideration of the strong linkages that land has with the local traditions,
customs and societies, the Customary Land Tenure Team would be financed under the loan
to support BPN, particularly in carrying out its CRS tasks (see paras. 3.5 and 3.6), and
the adat land rights studies. The socioeconomic baseline study would enable monitoring
of social impacts on the systematically-registered areas over time: during negotiations an
assurance was obtained from GOI that the study will be completed and its results will be
furnished to the Bank for comments by March 31, 1996. It is envisaged that an imnpact
study will be carried out at least five years after the baseline study, under a possible
follow-on project.
6.9         A major objective of the project itself is to legalize and register land rights
of long-term occupants, through: (a) systematic registration; (b) the ongoing revision of
PP No.10/1961, particularly in terms of reducing emphasis on documentary evidence
requirements to enable such occupants to obtain titles; and (c) monitoring of indicators
concerning the actual delivery of titles to such occupants (e.g., the types of titles issued)
assisted by the project monitoring TA and the Customary Land Tenure Team. Such
measures would minimize the potential for displacement of long-term occupants as an
indirect result of clarification of land rights. The impact on long-term occupants would
be examined closely during the two systematic adjudication trials.
D. GENDER ISSUES
6.10        The main potential negative impact of land registration on women's rights
to land would be the possible strengthening of traditional, customary land tenure systems
which are patrilineal, i.e., those systems where land can only be inherited through the
male line (e.g., Batak societies in North Sumatra). On the other hand, there are
matrilineal systems (e.g., Minangkabau in West Sumatra) which also might be
strengthened by land registration. The general features of these traditional tenure systems
were examined under the sociological analysis carried out during project preparation:
while these tenure systems are no longer very common, especially in non-forest areas
where land registration is possible, joint ownership of land by husband and wife is
unknown in such societies. The project would not carry out systematic adjudication in the
geographical areas where these systems exist. As these systems are an integral part of the
culture of these traditional peoples, the feasibility and desirability of registering patrilineal
and matrilineal land rights, as well as its implications on gender issues, would be looked
at carefully under the adat land rights studies.
6.11        Outside of the patrilineal and matrilineal systems, men and women are
equally entitled to hold and register land titles. The Marriage Law (Law No. 1/1974)
specifies that any property acquired during marriage is regarded as joint property. Any
transaction of such joint property requires the approval of both spouses, even where the
spouse is not formally registered as a joint title holder. This requirement is strictly upheld
by the courts. Land registered in the name of a woman prior to her marriage remains her
individual property, and is not included in the joint property acquired during marriage.



- 31 -
As a consequence, the woman retains full rights to such individual property in case of
annulment of the marriage. Registration of land titles is expected to, therefore, strengthen
the legal position of married women, as such registration would include data as to when
the property was acquired and from whom. Such information would also confirm whether
the land in question is: (a) joint property of both spouses; (b) individual property of the
husband; or (c) individual property of the wife. While the impact of on women is thus
likely to be positive, this type of impact would be given particular attention during the
project progress monitoring, with assistance from the Customary Land Tenure Team. The
socioeconomic baseline study would provide the basis for assessing the impact on women
in the longer term.
6.12        In Indonesia, most notaries and land deed officials (PPAT) are women.
They are expected to benefit from the increased business caused by the large number of
certificates produced under the project. About 16 percent of BPN employees are female,
and one senior position, the Director of PUSDIKLAT, is occupied by a female officer.
E. SusTNABxILrry
6.13        There has been strong GOI commitment to improve land management and
administration, as described in para. 1.8. Further, the project would focus on building the
institutional, human resource, technical, financial and regulatory foundations needed to
sustain GOI's long-term land registration program, especially during the first two years
of the project. The strategy of graduated increase in cost recovery (see para. 2.1) would
be pursued under the project, with support from a study on BPN's overall fee structure.
During negotiations, an assurance was obtained from GOI that BPN will complete the
service fee structure study by April 30, 1996, and furnish to the Bank an action plan to
implement the recommendations endorsed by GOI and the Bank by June 30, 1996. To
prevent BPN from being overburdened, an assurance was obtained from GOI that GOI
will provide the Bank with an assessment of the impact, on the proposed project, of any
proposed large project to be carried out by BPN. A mid-term review would be held after
project year two, to ensure that mechanisms are in place to launch the accelerated
program.
6.14        The sustainability of GOI's long-term land registration program would
depend to a large extent on how much the private sector can be involved, since it is clear
that no public agency can undertake the program by itself. The project would develop the
related private industries, by contracting out work, training cadastral surveyors, and
supporting two university programs (see para. 3.7). Active participation by the public,
supported under the project with the Customer Relations and Services (CRS) activities,
would also be vital to the sustained success of the program. An assurance was obtained
from GOI during negotiations that a national information dissemination campaign, clearly
describing the procedures, fees and benefits of land registration, will be started by June
30, 1995, and that land information to be produced under the project, and included in the
land books, will be made readily available to the public.

F. RISKS
6.15        Risks.   Major risks could  include:   (a) over-stretching  BPN's
implementation capabilities; (b) the land owners' lack of confidence in the registration
system and their lack of understanding of the need for land registration; (c) hesitancy
within BPN staff to change the modus operandi of land registration; and (d) opposition
from government agencies and the private sector to changes in land management policies
which would be proposed by part C. These risks would be handled, respectively, by:
(i) keeping the project design as simple as possible, utilizing the private sector to carry out
certain tasks, and providing technical assistance for project implementation; (ii) carrying
out an open, transparent process involving the beneficiaries, including CRS activities aimed
specifically at informing the public of the benefits, costs and procedures for land
registration; (iii) monitoring KPI to enable BPN management to track progress made and
problems occurred during implementation; and (iv) involving the government agencies
concerned directly in identifying possible solutions under Part C.
