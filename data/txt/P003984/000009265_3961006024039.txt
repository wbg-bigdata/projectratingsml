MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendetion on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for US$80.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be for twenty years, including five years
of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would help
finance a Land Administration Project (LAP) in Indonesia.
2.        Backaround.  Indonesia's land resources are abundant at 1.9 million
square kilometers (190 million ha), the third largest in Asia and larger than
the four American states of Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona
combined. The land is scattered over some 13,000 islands, but population and
economic activity are heavily concentrated on Java which accounts for only
7 percent of the total land. More than 60 percent of Indonesia's total
population of 186 million live in Java, where population density has exceeded
800 people per square kilometer, one of the highest in the world. Java also
contributes about 60 percent of Indonesia's GDP.
3.        Efficient and equitable land markets are an important basis for
modern economic development, since they would quickly accommodate changes in
land use, allow fair land transactions, and mobilize financial resources
through collateral arrangements. A comprehensive, accurate and efficient land
registration system is a prerequisite to developing such land markets, since
it enables land to be freely traded, by reducing or eliminating the risks
perceived by purchasers and vendors of land.
4.        In Indonesia, only about 12 million of the nation's estimated 54
million land parcels (22 percent) have been registered in the 33 years since
land registration began. Since forest land is excluded from the land
cadasere, as in many countries with substantial forest land, the total land
area registered amounts to only 7 percent of all land. Over 75 percent of the
unregistered parcels are estimated to be in Java, where only 19 percent of the
parcels are registered. If the current pace of about half a million parcels
registered per year continues, land registration will never catch up with the
total number of parcels, since the number of parcels is estimated to be
growing at more than 1 million per year. The scarcity of registered land and
its relative security of tenure are translated by the market into higher
prices: the premium on registered parcels in 1989 over unregistered parcels
was more than 50 percent in Jakarta's central business district.
5.        Other issue3 in the land registration system are:  (a) it is not
responsive to the beneficiaries' needs, for instance in the amount of time
needed to process title deeds; (b) it is difficult to obtain legally reliable
information; and (c) lack of legal provisions to protect long-time, locally
accepted occupants. Such problems have led to social conflicts, inhibited
land transactions and discouraged private investmont. There is an urgent need
to accelerate land titling and registration, by addressing the institutional,
technical and human resource constraints of the government agency concerned,
the National Land Agency (BPN).

6.        Lessons Learned from Previous Operations.  Perhaps the most
successful illustration of the Bank's involvement in land administration is
the two land titling projects in Thailand co-financed with the Australian
International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), one just completed and
the other started in 1990 (Loan Nos. 2440 and 3254 respectively). With these
projects, the average annual output of title deeds increased ten-fold,
conflicts ovir land have declined substantially, and fee revenues have
increased ten-fold in nominal terms, over the last decade. The major lessons
are the successful roles played by: systematic adjudication, i.e., surveying
and adjudication of all eligible parcels in a contiguous area, conducted by
special teams involving the communities and capitalizing on economies of
scale; new technologies (e.g., with mapping, land records); and a graduated
increase in cost recovery. In Indonesia, the Bank has been addressing land-
related issues mainly through agriculture and infrastructure projects, from
which the lessons have included the effectiveness of contracting out work to
private firms to generate land information, and the need to identify expected
outputs and to monitor them closely during implementation.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy for Indonesia presented to the Board of Executive Directors in April
1994 proposed five major objectives: continuing growth with macroeconomic
stability, supporting private sector development and competitiveness,
fostering poverty reduction, improving public sector management, and
supporting environmental management. Accelerated land registration, the major
thrust of the project, would contribute significantly to the private sector
development objective, by: (a) providing the basis of efficient and equitable
land markets; (b) encouraging private investment by reducing investment risk;
(c) mobilizing financial resources by allowing land to be used as collateral;
and (d) providing opportunities to related industries such as surveying and
mapping. The project is therefore consistent with the thrust of the Country
Assistance Strategy.
8.        Project Obiectives.  The main objective of the project is to foster
efficient and equitable land markets and alleviate social conflicts over land,
through acceleration of land registration as the initial phase of GOI's
25-year program to title and register all non-forest parcels, and to improve
the institutional framework for land administration which is needed to sustain
the program. The second main objective is to support GOI's efforts to develop
land management policies.
9.        Proiect Description.  The proposed project will be implemented over
a six-year period, spanning the Indonesia fiscal years 1994/95 to 2000/2001.
During the first two years, the emphasis will be on developing the
institutional and technical basis for accelerating land titling and
registration, and the actual implementation of the systematic approach will
begin in the third year. The project consists of three "Parts": Part A,
acceleration of land titling and registration, covering eighteen districts in
Java and Sumatra; Part B, improvement of the institutional framework for land
administration; and Part C, technical assistance to GOI in developing 3snd
management policies. They would include the following main components:



-3-
Part A
(a) systematic titling and registration to cover 1.2 million parcels in
ten districts in Java, relying on systematic adjudication,
cadastral surveying by the private sector, introduction of new
technologies, and information dissemination to the public on the
procedures, fees and benefits of land registration (called the
Customer Relations and Services or CRS activities);
(b) sporadic titling and registration, which is based on individual
applications by landowners, in eight districts in Java and Sumatra,
to make the land registration system in these areas more efficient,
reliable and responsive to demand;
Part B:
(c)  the improvement of the legal framework for land administration, by
developing a database for land laws and regulations, and assisting
BPN with its efforts to systematically review and draft land laws
and regulations. The latter activity, to be assisted by a group of
law experts in specific topics (called the Land Law Resource
Group), would include drafting of a new Land Rights Act which would
set forth private rights on land;
(d) development of BPN's institutional capacity for land
administration, mostly through training, education and
scholarships;
(e) studies to examine the extent to which customary (adat) land rights
exist (especially customary communal rights or hak ulavat), and
explore the feasibility, desirability and methodology for improving
their security through land registration, to prepare for the later
stages of GOI's land registration program; and
Part C:
(f) an integrated program of studies, seminars arnd workshops on
selected topic areas in land management to be conducted under GOI's
Coordinating Board for National Spatial Planning (BKTRN), aiming at
improved policy formulation and inter-agency coordination.
lO.       Prolect Costs and Financing Plan.  The total project costs are
estimated at US$140.1 million. The proposed loan of US$80.0 million would
finance 65 percent of the total costs, exclusive of taxes and duties (US$11.3
million) and GOI's purchase of vehicle.. (US$6.5 million). GOI would provide
US$44.9 million, and AIDAB would provide a grant of US$15.2 million
equivalent. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are presented
in Schedule A, and the procurement and disbursement arrangements in Schedule
B. A timetable for key project processing events is attached as Schedule C,
and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia is given in Schedule D.
Two maps (IBRD-25611 and 25612) are attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
12820-IND, dated August 16, 1994 is being distributed separately.



-4-
11.       Implementation Arrangements.  Parts A and B would be implemented by
BPN, and Part C would be coordinated by the National Development Planning
Agency (BAPPENAS) as the chairing agency of BKTRN. The Ministries of Home
Affaira, Defense and Security, Public Works, and Environment, as well as the
State Secretariat and BPN, are represented in BKTRN. There would be a Project
Management Committee (PMC) for Parts A/B, and a Project Coordination Committee
chaired by BAPPENAS would ensure coordination between Parts A/B and Part C. A
full-time Management Support Unit established at BPN's headquarters (Pusat),
or MSUP, will play a central role in implementing Parts A/B. BPN will monitor
the progress of Parts A and B based on agreed indicators; technical assistance
would be provided under the loan to help monitor those that are more difficult
initially.
12.       Proiect Sustainability.  There has been strong GOI commitment to
improve land management and administration, as demonstrated by the
announcement of the 25-year program to title and register all non-forest
parcels, and the passing in the parliament of the Law for Spatial Development
(Law No. 24/1992) which includes clear provisions for local participation and
information dissemination. As for the sustainability of BPN's implementation
capacity, the project would help build its institutional, human resource,
technical, financial and regulatory foundations, especially during the first
two years. The sustainability of GOI's land registration program would depend
to a large extent on how much the private sector can be involved: the project
would draw heavily on existing private sector capabilities, and also develop
the related areas of the private sector.
13.       Gender Issues.  The main potential negative impact of land
registration on women's rights to land would be the possible strengthening of
traditional tenure systems which are patrilineal, i.e., land can only be
inherited through the male line. However, these systems are no longer very
common, and the project would not carry out systematic adjudication in the
geographical areas where these systems exist. As these systems are an
integral part of the culture of'these traditional peoples, possible
registration of patrilineal land rights, as well as its implication on gender
issues, would be looked at carefully under the adat land right studies.'
Outside of these patrilineal (and matrilineal) systems, men and women are
equally entitled to hold land tisles, and land registered in the name of a
woman prior to her marriage remains her individual property. Registration of
land titles would, therefore, strengthen the rights of married women to land,
as such registration would clarify when the property was acquired and from
whom. While the impact on women is thus likely to be positive, this type of
impact would be given particular attention during the project progress
monitoring, with assistance from the Customary Land Tenure Team comprising
sociology and anthropology experts to be financed under the proposed loan. A
socioeconomic baseline study, also financed under the loan, would provide the
basis for assessing the impact on women in the longer term.
14.       Environmental and Social Impact.  The project's impact on the
physical environment would be neutral in the short- and medium-terms. In the
long term, land registration could have positive impacts on the environment in
two respects: it would provide incentives to invest for long-term land use
(e.g., soil conservation in rural areas and investments in environmental
infrastructure such as kitchens and bathrooms in urban areas); and provide
information (e.g., land rights information, photomaps, aerial photographs)
which can be used by the government agencies concerned, especially the local
governments, to monitor and address environmental impacts.



-5-
15.       Concerning social impacts, the accelerated land titling and
registration is expected to result in a reduction of disputes over land rights
in the project areas. This is indeed what happened with the Thailand
projects. A socio-economic baseline study would be conducted under the
project, to enable impact analysis in the near future. As for customary
communal land rights (hak ulavat), not many such cases are now confirmed in
Indonesia (except for specific geographical areas such as West Sumatra), and
still less in areas where land registration is possible (i.e., non-forest
areas). However, an agreed strategy to prevent land registration from
inflicting negative impacts on these rights would, inter alia: (a) exclude
areas with confirmed cases of hak ulavat from areas for systematic
registration; and (b) examine the feasibility, desirability and methodology of
registering hak ulavat thiough the adat land rights studies. In consideration
of the strong linkages that land has with the local traditions, cust_:.ms and
societies, the CLutomary Land Tenure Team would assist GOI in addressing the
social aspects of the project.
16.       Impact on Poverty.  Many of the estimated 4 million people whose
land would be systematically registered under the project are expected to be
below the low-income threshold (about 14 percent of the population according
to the i.icidence of poverty in Java, which woUd be about 100,000 families),
especially since the affluent tend to have their parcels registered early.
The project woula increase their land value, enable their land to be sold at
fair prices, and improve their access to credit.
17.       At negotiations. the following documents were obtained from GOI:
(a) the final draft terms of reference, short list and letter of
invitation for agreement with the Bank, for: (i) the adat land
rights studies; (ii) the Land Law Resource Group; (iii) the
Customary Land Tenure Team; (iv) the progress monitoring
consultants; and (v) the Part C consultancy; and
(b) draft standard bidding documents to be used for LCB.
18.       At negotiations. the Bank obtained the following key assurances
from GOI:
(a) to provide the Bank with the final BPN draft of a new government
regulation revising the existing regulation on land registration
(PP No. 10/1961) by November 30, 1994 and take all measures
necessary to enact the new regulation by August 31, 1995;
(b) to provide the required vehicles for the project in accordance with
the schedule and timetable agreed with the Bank;
(c) to complete the first phase of the adat land rights studies and
furnish its results to the Bank by September 30, 1995, and to
complete the third phase of the adat land rights studies P-nd
furnish to the Bank an action plan to implement the recommendations
endorsed by GOI and the Bank by March 31, 1997;
(d) to complete the BPN service fee structure study by April 30, 1996,
and furnish to the Bank an action plan to implement the
recommendations endorsed by GOI and the Bank by June 30, 1996;



-6-
(e) to start a national information dissemination campaign on loan
registration procedures, fees and benefits, by June 30, 1995; and
(f) to make the land information produce' under the project, and
included in its land books, readily available to the public.
19.       GOI has completed the followinz actions, which were the conditions
of board presentation:
(a) the signing of the Project Arrangement with the Gov.ernment of
Australia on the AIDAB grant, and the completion of accreditation
of the seven AIDAB-financed consultants needed at the project
start-up; and
(b)  the establishment of the PMC and MSUP, as well as the official
appointment of the Project Managers for Parts A/B and Part C.
20.       Proiect Benefits and Risks.  The project would foster more
efficient and equitable land markets in terms of: more efficient and
transparent land transactions; less risk in investment; mobilization of
financial resources through use of land as collateral; and provision of
incentives for longer-term invastment towards more sustainable land use.
About 4 million people in Java would benefit directly by having their land
registered systematically, in terms of: improved security against unfair laad
acquisition; the possibility to sell their land at fair prices; the ability to
use land as collateral; and reduction in conflicts over land rights. Finally,
the development of land management policies through Part C would contribute to
improvements in some key land policy areas, such as land acquisition. Major
risks include over-stretching BPN's implementation capabilities, and lack of
confidence in the registration system on the part of land owners. The first
risk would be addressed by utilizing the private sector for certain tasks, and
providing technical assistance for project implementation. The second risk
would be alleviated by carrying out an open process of systematic registration
involving the beneficiaries, by initiating a national information
dissemination campaign, and by making the land information produced under the
project freely available to the public.
21.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of the Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
