REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND PORT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCIUSIONS
i.        Honduras is mountainous with forests covering half of the country.
The terrain is rugged and the country only recently started to construct a
modern highway network to connect the principal centers. The ports play an
important role in the country's transport system handling a very high pro-
portion of its international trade, including virtually all of the banana
and most of the lumber exports which are vital to the Honduran economy.
Traffic threugh Puerto Cortes, in the Caribbean, amounted to 877,000 tons of
dry cargo in 1970 (53% of all dry cargo port traffic). Amapala, in the
Pacific, handled 177,000 tons (ii%).  Almost all the remaining dry cargo was
handled at Tela and La Ceiba, banana export ports in the Caribbean.
-i.       In 1966 the Bank made Loan No.463-HO for the expansion of Puerto
Cortes including two new berths and supporting facilities. The project was
completed in March 1970 but traffic growth has been such that additional port
capacity has to be provided immediately.
iii.      There are only lighterage facilities on the Pacific coast and
because of draft limitations, goods must be discharged into barges at Amapala
or El Yuerto for transfer to San Lorenzo some distance away. Operations are
slow and costly with consequent delays to ships and some damage to cargo.
Traffic has reached a level where the construction of a wharf for direct dis-
charge or loading of cargo is justified.
iv.       The project is designed to provide adequate facilities at Puerto
Cortes to handle traffic projected until about 1978. At Henecan, a suitable
site some 3 km from San Lorenzo, an alongside facility would be constructed
to handle an estimated 90% of the traffic through the Pacific port; the
balance, handled in ships whose drafts would prevent them from reaching
Henecan, would continue to be transferred to or from barges at Amapala.
v.        The project is based on studies carried out by Tippetts-Abbett-
McCarthy-Stratton (TAMS) and Netherlands Engineering Consultants (NEDECO) for
the development of Puerto Cortes and Henecan respectively, the latter financed
under Loan No.463-HO. The project at Puerto Cortes comprises construction
of two berths for banana and lumber ships, a roll-on/roll-off ramp, a belt
conveyor system for banana loading, a tug, supporting facilities and the
provision of engineering services. At Henecan the project comprises construc-
tion of two berths, supporting facilities, cargo-handling equipment and the
provision of engineering services. The total estimated cost is L 19.6 million
(US$9.8 million). The proposed loan would be for L 12.0 million (us$6.o mil-
lion) which is the estimated foreign exchange component. Contracts would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding.



- ii -
vi.       The loan would be made to Empresa Nacional Portuaria (ENP), an
autonomous port undertaking, created in 1965. ENP has until now administered
only Puerto Cortes but the Government plans to transfer responsibility for
the new facilities at Henecan to ENP. ENP has a sound organization, good
management and is carrying out a well-conceived training program. ENP can
fill most of the posts to operate Henecan from its own ranks; however, the
Port Superintendent will be recxuited from outside ENP.
vii.      ENP's financial position is strong.  A new schedule of port charges,
based on a consultant's study financed under Loan No.463-H0, was introduced
in 1970. Together with funds on hand at present, ENP will generate sufficient
funds during construction to meet the local currency costs of the project.
viii.     The evaluation of economic costs and benefits shows that the project
is justified; the internal economic return at Puerto Cortes and Henecan are
40% and 33% respectively.
ix.       The project is suitable for a loan of US$6.0 million equivalent
repayable over 20 years including a four-year grace period.



REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS
APPRAISAI CF THE SECOND PORT PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1966 the Bank made Loan No.463-HO to Empresa Nacional Portuaria
(ENP)for the building of two deep-water berths and supporting facilities at
Puerto Cortes. Construction was completed in March 1970. During construction
the management and operating efficiency of the new port authority (ENP) were
improved with the assistance of consultants financed under the loan. It be-
came clear during this period that traffic was growing at a much higher rate
than had been forecast when the project was designed and a study of the next
expansion phase was commissioned.  This study, financed by ENP, was carried
out by Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton (TAWS), an American consulting firm.
The resulting project, which is the subject of this report, covers extension
of the wharf, construction of a roll-on/roll-off ramp and provision of sup-
porting facilities, handling equipment, a tug and engineering services.
1.02      The project also covers the development of a deep-water facility on
Honduras' short Pacific coastline at Henecan to replace the very inefficient
lighterage operations now carried out at various points. Funds to finance a
feasibility study for such a development were included in Loan No.463-HO and
the study was carried out by Netherlands Engineering Consultants (NEDECO).
The facility at Henecan will include a new wharf, supporting facilities, han-
dling equipment and engineering services.
1.03      The total project cost is estimated at US$9.8 million equivalent;
the proposed loan is for the foreign exchange component which is US$6.0 million
equivalent.
1.o4      Other than Loan No.463-HO, there have been two credits and four loans
for transportation totaling US$36.8 million,all for highways. All are
for completed projects except a joint IDA-Bank operation (Cr.71-HO and Loan
No4.OO-HO) in 1965 for US$9.5 million and Loan No.495-HO in 1967 for US$8.6
million, both for highways which are about 90% complete.  These projects are
being carried out satisfactorily although there have been some delays due
mainly to unusually bad weather.
1.05      This report is based on the TAMS and NEDECO reports and the findings
of an appraisal mission to Honduras in January 1971 composed of Messrs. A.
Fateen (Port Engineer), N. Heggemsnes and T. Oursin (Economists) and H. Jones
(Financial Analyst). Mr. W. Bannan (Research Assistant) assisted the mission
in data collection.

2.  BACKGROUND
A. General (Map 1)
2.01      Honduras, the most mountainous of the Central American countries,
borders on Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.  It covers some 45,000 sq
mi and is divided into three climatic zones. The Atlantic Zone comprises the
most fertile plateaus and river valleys, featuring regular and abundant rain-
falls. The Central Zone is rugged, with less arable land and a marked dry
season. The Pacific Zone is more fertile and largely arable, but it also has
a severe dry season. Forests cover about half of the country.
2.02      Honduras ranks second in area and third in population in Central
America, with about 2.5 million people. Its population is growing rapidly,
by some 3.5 percent per year.
2.03      In 1970, GNP was US$679 million equivalent and has been increasing
at about 5% per annum; GNP per capita is about US$270. Agriculture accounts
for 35% of GNP, industry 14%, commerce ita%, construction 5% and transportation
6%; the remainder consists of services and government administration.
B. Transport Sector
2.04      Inadequate transportation infrastructure has been one of the major
obstacles to development in Honduras.  The terrain is ragged and traversed by
many rivers and streams and these features, together with the tropical climate,
make road and railroad construction and maintenance difficult and expensive.
2.05      Transport improvements are of high priority in the Government's
development plans.  Of the L 570 million in the 1970-1974 Public Investment
Program, L 240 million (42%) is allocated to the transport sector, of which
81% will be spent on highways, 13% on ports, 5% on railways and 1% on airports.
The country only recently started to construct a modern highway network and
investments have been concentrated on trunk roads to connect the major pro-
ducing and consuming centers and to open new areas. The Government plans to
shift the emphasis to secondary and feeder roads in the next phase.
Highways
2.06      The road network totals about 5,000 km of which 370 km are paved and
900 km are under construction. By the end of the current planning period in
1974 the country is expected to have a system of paved roads between the main
centers.
Railways
2.07      Honduras has three small railway lines located on the North Coast
adjacent to the major ports. Two lines are owned by foreign fruit companies
and are used primarily for shipping bananas to the Caribbean ports and to



- 3 -
transport imporued supplies to the plantations.  The Uational Railway, own3d
and operated by the Government, operates in the Ulua Valley and between San
Pedro Sula and Puerto Cortes. It handles banana and lumber exports, wheat
and general cargo imports and some local traffic mainly betmeen Puerto Cortes
and San Pedro Sula.
Air Transport
2.08      Due to the lack of adequate land transportation facilities, air
service plays an important role, and provides the only modern means of trans-
port for remote areas. Honduras has an extensive air transport network
serving many commmnities on a schedule basis, supplemented by air taxi services
to practically all parts of the country. As a result of the recent improve-
ment of the highway systam, air services to some areas have been discontinued.
Nevertheless, total air traffic has been rising steadily, passenger Ica increas-
ing at about 10% a year since 1564 to 22 million in 1968.
Ports
2.09      The Govermnent attaches high priority to the development of adequate
port facilities, which play a key role in the transport system and handled
96% of export and 93% of import tonnages in 1970. There are four deep-water
ports on the Caribbean coast. Puerto Cortes, near the Guaternalan border,
handles about half of banana exports and is the leading port for otihor cargos.
Tela, east of Cortes, was developed by the United Fruit Company for banana
exports.  La Ceiba, still further east, is used mainly for bzaiana exports by
the Standard Fruit Company. At Tela and la Ceiba ships are berthed at unpro-
tected piers unusable during storms. Puerto Castilla, located at the
mid-point of the Caribbean coast, and Roatan, on a small Caribbean island,
handle a very small amount of traffic.
2.10      Amapala, on the island of Tigre, is the only port on the Pacific
coast. It is a lighterage port and cargos are transported 30 km to and from
San Lorenzo on the mainland. Goods are also handled by lighters at an anchor-
age (El Muerto) in the Gulf of Fonseca and transported to and from San Lorenzo
some seven km away.
2.11      1970 port traffic,including petroleum products,was as follows:

2.12      Central America has a large number of ports on both the Caribbean
and the Pacific coasts. In an effort to provide a framework for rational in-
vestment decisions, taking into account national requirements and regional
interdependencies, the Bank in 1970 carried out a study of the ports of the
region (Central American Ports Study) which provides a model for the opti-
mization of port investment decisions. The developments included in the
proposed project are supported by the findings of this study.
3. PORT ADMINISTRATION
EXISTING ORGANIZATION, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS
A. Organization
Puerto Cortes
3.01      ENP, an autonomous port undertaking, was created under a law which
came into effect on December 1, 1965, to be responsible for all seaports in
the country. The law was acceptable to the Bank, which assisted the Govern-
ment in its formulation. Initially, ENP took over Puerto Cortes; the Govern-
ment will extend ENP's control to other ports when appropriate. The Government
and ENP undertook in Loan No.463-HO that ENP will not undertake the adminis-
tration or operation of any other port without affording the Bank a reasonable
opportunity to exchange views with the Borrower (ENP).
3.02      ENP has a Board of seven members consisting of three Ministers
(Economy and Finance, Cormunications and Public Works, Natural Resources)
or senior officials designated by them, a representative from the Economic
Planning Council, and three delegates, one each from (a) chambers of commerce
and industry, (b) trade unions, and (c) shipping companies. The latter three
members are appointed by the President from lists submitted by the respective
groups.  The Minister of Economy and Finance is chairman. A General Manager
is responsible for the administration of ENP as a whole and there is to be a
Port Superintendent at each port. There is a proper division of responsibil-
ities between the Board and the Manager and ENP's affairs are carried out in
an efficient manner.
3.03      The Government consulted the Bank before the first General Manager
was appointed in 1966 and in Loan No.463-HO has undertaken to consult the Bank
before any change is made (this undertaking would run throughout the term of
the proposed loan as both loans would be repaid at about the same time). At
the same time, ENP undertook to employ management consultants acceptable to
the Bank. Booz, Allen and Hamilton International, Inc. (BAHINT), operations
consultants, were appointed at the end of 1966 to provide advice on operating
procedhures and eqitrpment procurement and assistance in establishing an admin-
istrative organization, installing financial and cost accounting systems,
revising tar-ffs and establishin)g and supervising staff trairing schemes. All
these aims -lave been achieved and ENP now has a sound organization structure,
good management and a satisfactory program for training its staff.



3.04      At present, EiP employs 172 staff in administration and superinten-
dence, finance, engineering and maintenance and 345 for cargo-handling and
warehousing operations, 112 of whom are hired on a casual basis. The number
of staff is not excessive.
3.o5      The Government internds to transfer responsibility to INP for the
construction, administration, operation and mainteriance of the new facilities
to be constructed at Henecan and it was agreed during negotiations that the
contract for construction at Henecan would not be signed until this transfer
of responsibility was achieved.  ENP expects, reasonably, to be able to provide
all but a few of the staff required to operate a new facility at Henecan from
its own ranks and to engage the rest, including the Port Superintendent, from
outside EXP.  ENP undertook during negotiations to consult with the Bank be-
fore the first and subsequent appointments to the post of Port Superintendent,
Henecan, are made.
Other Ports
3.06      Port administration at the other ports is the responsibility of the
Directorate General of Customs and Indirect Taxes (Ministry of Economy and
Finance). At Tela and La Ceiba some facilities are ouned and operated by
private interests (United Fruit and Standard Fruit Companies).  The Government
at present has no plans to extend ENP operations beyond Puerto Cortes and
Henecan and agreement was obtained during negotiations that EQ? will not under-
take the administration or operation of ports other than Puerto Cortes and
Henecan unless the Government, the Bank and EN? agree that ENP has the re-
quiired administrative and financial capacity.   There is a possibility that
port facilities will be needed at, or in the vicinity of, La Ceiba to
accommodate the traffic generated by a pulp and paper plant the feasibility of
-which is now being investigated. IFC has an equity in the pilot company that
was formed to exploit the forest resources of north central Honduras and has
undertaken to help promote the pulp and paper project at the request of the
Government. A study may be needed to identify the most suitable location for
the related port facilities and it was agreed that such a study should be
carried out under the auspices of Ei?P and could be financed from the loan
(see para. 4.12).
B. Facilities
3.07      Puerto Cortes is situated in a well-protected natural bay with 12 to
16 m depth of water. Tidal range is only 0.3 m. The shore facilities (see
Map 2) consist essentially of: (a) Government Wharves No. 1 and 2 totaling
523 m in length completed in 1955 and 1970 used for general cargo, bulk cargo
and lumber3 (b) a banana -wharf 292 m long; (c) a petroleum pier constructed in
1959; and (d) two transit sheds and two warehouses.
3.08      The Banana Wharf was constructed in 1919 by Tela Railroad Company
(TRR) for the Government.  Although ownership was transferred to ENP in 1966,
TRR continues to operate it and carry out what little maintenance is done on
it (see also para. 3.11). Major setblements have occurred in this wharf and
it is in very poor condition.



3.09      Amapala and El Muerto are the only accessible anchorages on the
Pacific Coast of Honduras for ocean-going ships.  Channels to both Amapala
and El Muerto are tortuous and each is about 30 km long (Map 3). Between
El Muerto and San Lorenzo barges pass through a creek 7 km long. Amapala
has old bulkheads which barges moor alongside during the two hours of high
tide. In San Lorenzo old masonry walls accommodate barges during part of
the tide. There are four storage sheds at Amapala and nine at San Lorenzo.
Details of facilities in Puerto Cortes and Amapala-San Lorenzo-Henecan are
given in Annex 1.
C. Maintenance
3.10      Maintenance of ENP equipment is good.  Forklift and tractor drivers,
mechanics and servicemen are well trained.
3.11      TRR would like to rehabilitate the Banana Wharf because its conces-
sion agreement exempts it from paying any port charges for its use. However,
the wharf is beyond economical repair. TRR is expected to continue using
Banana Wharf in its deteriorated condition as long as possible.
3.12      Government WIharf No. 1, constructed in 1955, is already in a state
of deterioration. More than 20% of the piles and main beams are cracked,
exposing the reinforcement to corrosion. The damage is mainly attributable
to inadequate fendering. The fender system was changed in 1970, but the deck
was not repaired. Unless these repairs are undertaken as a matter of urgency
by a qualified contractor, the remaining effective life of the wharf will be
seriously shortened. It was confirmed during negotiations that ENP will have
the necessary repair work carried out promptly by a comnpetent contractor.
The Bank pointed out that it would not object if this work were included as
a separate item in the tender documents for the construction of the project,
although the repair work would not be part of the Bank-financed project.
3.13      The fendering systems of both Government Wharves No. 1 and No. 2
have been severely damaged by ships docking or undocking. The majority of
these accidents occur because ENP does not employ pilots or tugs to assist in
berthing operations. ENP agreed during negotiations that it (i) shall carry
out repairs to fenders within a month of their damage and (ii) introduce man-
datory pilotage by January 1, 1972 at Puerto Cortes and at Henecan when the
project there is completed. A 700 hp tug is included in the project.
D. Operations
Puerto Cortes
3.14      Puerto Cortes operates 24 hours a day, 362 days a year.  Ships
handling perishable commodities are given priority and generally, banana ships
have highest priority.



- 7 -
3.15      Import cargo-handling at the Government Wharves is by ENP staff.
Export cargo is transferred directly to ships from railroad cars or trucks
by labor supplied by the ship's agents and all stevedoring is carried out
by private contractors.
3.16      Cargo-handling productivity has improved in recent years particularly
with the conpletion of the new wharves in early 1970 and the acquisition of
modern cargo-handling equipment. A substantial proportion of general cargo
is palletized. General cargo is handled at an average of about 11-12 tons
per gang hour which is satisfactory.
3.17      United Fruit Company uses four gantry-type conveyor loaders for
handling bananas at the Banana Wharf. Standard Fruit Company has four portable
conveyor loaders at the Government Wharves and loads ships through side hatches.
Productivity is good and averages 100 tons per ship hour for the United Fruit
and 60 tons for the Standard Fruit systems.
3.18      Bundled lumber is loaded at all wharves directly from railroad flat-
cars by ship's gear. Loading rates average only 16 tons per ship hour mainly
because of poor coordination between the lumber ships, with their low priority
in berthing, and the arrival of flatcars from the lumberyards. Loading opera-
tions are also often delayed by a shortage of switch locomotives and adequate
railroad crossovers. These delays will be alleviated in the future by (a) the
acquisition of a shunting locomotive by the National Railroad and (b) the new
railroad yard and improved layout provided in the proposed project.
3.19      Import cargo is permitted 15 days free storage (reduced in September
1970 from 22 days). ENP plans to reduce this period further as traffic in-
creases and agreed during negotiations to reduce the free period to 10 days
by January 1, 1974. Export cargo is permitted five days free storage.
Am22apala, El_1NVerto2 San Lorenzo
3.20      A 1961 decree prescribes that all goods for Honduras coming via the
Pacific Ocean have to be imported through Amapala so all ships anchor there
for customs clearance. Easily discernible items such as cars and buses are
allowed to be transshipped by barge directly to San Iorenzo. Other goods must
be transferred from barges to Customs' warehouses in Amapala and, after custons
clearance, reloaded into barges to be towed 30 km to San Lorenzo. These
operations are ver-y slow because barges can only berth at Amapala during high
tide. Some cargo is handled as often as seven times before reaching San Lorenzo.
3.21      Nlearly all exports are loaded into barges at San Lorenzo wharves
for loading into ships at El 1uerto. A small quantity of goods to be shipped
by deep-draft ships which cannot reach El Muerto are transported by barges to
Amapala for loading. Cargo-handling operations at Amapala and San Lorenzo are
done by hand except for heavy pieces which are lifted from barges at San
Lorenzo by small, hand-operated cranes. The rates of handling cargo are low.



- 8 -
3.22      With the building of a new port at Henecan the Government intends
to modify the 1961 decree and transfer the main Customs office to Henecan.
The Government confirmed during negotiations that this will be done by the
date the nev facilities in Henecan are ready for operation.
4. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.O1      The project is to expand port facilities at Puerto Cortes and to
provide new deep-water berthing facilities at Henecan to accommodate the fore-
cast traffic up to 1978.  Except for the possible replacement of the Banana
Wharf at Puerto Cortes, no further major port expansion is envisaged for several
years after project completion. However, both sites have adequate water and
land areas for future expansion.
Puerto Cortes (Map 2)
4.02      The project in Puerto Cortes is:
(i)  Construction of a new deep-water wharf 285 m long for banana
and lumber loading with a reinforced concrete deck on piles.
(ii) Procurement of a belt conveyor system for banana loading.
(iii)  Land reclamation of about eight acres for a new railroad yard
to handle banana and lumber wagons; and construction of the yard.
(iv)  Construction of a roll-on/roll-off ramp at the junction of
Government Wharves Nos. 1 and 2.
(v)  Construction of roads, with parking, sorting and open storage
areas.
(vi)  Procurement of a tugboat, a pilot boat, forklift trucks and
pallets.
(vii) Acquisition of about 2.5 acres of land needed for the project.
(viiJ) Provision of engineering consultant services.
4.O3      The new wharf, which is an extension of the existing Government
Wharf No. 2, will berth concurrently one banana ship and one large or two
small lumber ships. The roll-on/roll-off ramp will handle one ship at Govern-
ment Wharf No. 1 and one at Government Wharf No. 2. A detailed description
of the project at Puerto Cortes is given in Annex 2 and a calculation of the
berthage required is given in Table 1.



- 9 -
4.04      Except for banana containerization, with which the United Fruit
Company is now experimenting, no significant trend towards containerization
is expected at Puerto Cortes in the near future. lNonetheless, the wharf will
be designed to handle containers, should the need arise. The additional cost
of constructing the wharf so that it can be used for containers is minimal.
Henecan (Map 4)
4.05      The project at Henecan is:
(i) Construction of a new 'IT" shaped, deep-water wharf 290 m long
and 25 m wide with a reinforced concrete deck on piles for lumber and general
cargo; an access bridge about 70 m long and 10 m wide to connect the wharf with
the shore.
(ii) Reclamation of about seven acres of land for storage and
parking.
(iii)  Construction of a transit shed (about 100 m x 30 m) and of
administration and operations buildings, utilities and fencing.
(iv) Construction of an access road about 2.5 km long to connect
the port facilities with San Lorenzo.
(v) Procurement of a pilot boat and cargo-handling equipment.
(vi) Procurement and installation of navigation aids.
(vii) Acquisition of about 15 acres of land needed for the project.
(viii) Provision of engineering consultant services.
4.o6      Deepening of the navigation channel is not planned for this project.
The new wharf will berth concurrently two general cargo or lumber ships along
the outer side and eight barges or two coasters along the inner side. No trend
towards containerization at Henecan is expected in the near future. A detailed
project description and the requirements for Henecan Port (channel, navigation
aids, wharves, buildings, roads and equipment) are given in Annex 3 and
Tables 2 and 3.
B. Cost Estimates
4.07      The total estimated cost of the project is L 19.6 million (US$9.8
million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of Us$6.0 million equiv-
alent. Details are given in Tables 4 and 5 for Puerto Cortes and Henecan
respectively and are summarized below:

4.08      The cost estimates are based on TAOS' report for Puerto Cortes and
NEDECO's report for Henecan, both as revised by Bank staff. They take account
of knomn costs of local labor and materials and imported materials.  Duties on
imported equipment are included but not those on imported materials for civil
works for which ENP as a public corporation wdll be granted exemption. The
estimates for civil engineering work include 15% for physical contingencies
and 10% for price escalation (5% per year) - based on price increases of labor
and materials in the last five years and taking into account a construction
period of three years from 1972 through 1974. Price escalation for equipment
varies with the expected date of purchase.
C. Project Execution and Financing
4.09     EIP, with the help of consultants acceptable to the Bank, will be
responsible for carrying out the project. It was agreed during negotiations
that consultants will be retained to carry out the additional investigations
required for final design (Annex 3, para. 8), prepare tender documents and
assist with contract bidding procedures and carry out construction supervision.
ENIP has indicated that TA14S and NEDECO will be employed for the project at
Puerto Cortes and Heniecan respectively and these firms are acceptable to the
Bank.
D. Procurement and Disbursements
4.10      Contracts for construction and equipment supply will be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guide-
lines. It is unlikely that a local contractor would be awarded the civil engi-
neering contract as there are no local contractors specialized in this type of
work.



- 11 -
4.11      Construction at both ports is expected to start early in 1972 and
will be completed by the end of 1974. A schedule of estimated disbursements
by quarter is given in Table 6. Disbursements will be made to cover (a) the
estimated foreign exchange component (57%) of all civil engineering works and
(b) the actual foreign exchange costs of imported equipment and consultant
services.
4.12      A puilp and paper project is under investigation in northern Honduras
which may require special port facilities at or near La Ceiba. Consulting
services to identify a suitable location for such port facilities may be needed
and it was agreed during negotiations that these could be financed from the
loan. It is expected that any study which may be required will be small and
can be financed from the provision in the loan for engineering services.
If any surplus funds are available on completion of the project, it is
recommeided that consideration be given at the time to providing additional
cargo-handling equipment at Puerto Cortes as some equipment there may need
replacement in three or four years.
E. Land Acquisition
4.13      About 75% of the land required in Puerto Cortes for the railway yard
is to be reclaimed by filling. The rest, about 10,000 m.2 is to be acquired
from private owners by purchase or expropriation.  In Henecan, ENP will acquire
from the Government about 15 acres required for the access road, transit sheds,
open storage and parking areas and administration and operations buildings.
No difficulties are anticipated because ENP may petition the Government for its
expropriation. It was agreed during negotiations that all the land required
would be acquired before January 1, 1972 and that a contract for construction
at a particular port would not be awarded until the land at that port was
acquired.
F. Future Development
4.14      In Puerto Cortes, the two sites for port development that are related
to the physical arrangement of the town and the existing port facilities are:
(a) an area east of Government Wharf No. 2, and (b) the site of the existing
Banana Wharf.  In both areas the wharves combine naturally with existing nearby
commercial and industrial zones to form a consolidated area effectively segre-
gated from other areas of the town. At both locations a number of existing
small wooden structures in poor condition will have to be removed as the port
grows, but neither is threatened by encroachment of future town development.
4.15      At Henecan, the facilities could be expanded along the direction of
the proposed wharf, as the natural channel north and south of the new facil-
ities is sufficiently wide and deep.

5. ECON\OMIC EVALUATION
A. Traffic
5.01      The economy of Honduras is highly dependent on its ports.  In 1968
the ports handled some 82% of import and export tonnages; however, because of
the war with El Salvador and other problems within the Central American Common
Market (CACM), trade with this area decreased and the proportion of foreign
trade handled by the ports increased to 94% in 1970. Direct trade between
Honduras and El Salvador, major trading partners in the CACM in the past, was
completely interrupted and Honduras has now canceled the trade preferences
formerly given to the other members of the CACM. It is unlikely that normal
relationships amongst the member countries will be resumed in the near future.
5.02      The total international trade of Honduras by cormodities and tonnages
moved by sea for the years 1968-1970 is  summarized in Table 7 and details for
Puerto Cortes and Amapala are given in Tables 8 and 9. Dry cargo traffic
through Puerto Cortes has grown rapidly in recent years increasing from 431,000
tons in 1963 to 877,000 tons in 1970.  This was wel above the foreast for 1970 of
572,000 tons made in 1965 during the appraisal of the first Puerto Cortes
Project when the outlook for lumber exports was uncertain and when it was ex-
pected that other ports in the area would be more competitive with Puerto
Cortes than they have proved to be. 1970 traffic included 401,000 tons of
banana and 161,000 tons of lumber exports. 776,000 tons of petroleum imports
and 367,000 tons of petroleum and petroleum product exports were also handled
there. At Amapala the 1970 traffic of 177,000 tons included 128,000 tons of
lumber and 15,000 tons of cotton and cotton seed exports.
5.03      Traffic forecasts were prepared by the consultants TANS for Puerto
Cortes and by NiEDECO for Amapala-Henecan. They have been used with some modi-
fications, mainly for lumber, in the project evaluation. The port service
areas (Map 1) were detenmined and traffic allocated between them taking into
account estimated total transport costs between origin and destination of goods.
Consideration was given to the alternative of diverting part of the Henecan
traffic through the Port of Corinto (Nicaragua) when the road connecting
Choluteca and Corinto is completed. Such diversion was found to be consider-
ably more costly than shipping through a new port at Henecan even under the
unlikely assumption that Corinto had sufficient excess capacity to handle this
traffic. This alternative was therefore rejected. The forecasts (Tables 8 and
9) for individual commodities are discussed in Annex 3. Actual traffic growth
from 1963 to 1970 and estimated growth to 1978 are shown below:

B. Costs and Benefits
Puerto Cortes
5.04      The project at Puerto Cortes is designed to increase the capacity
and improve cargo-handling rates by better rail access and equipment. Its
principal benefits would be:
(i)  reduction in anticipated ship-waiting time, Whbich
will rise sharply if port capacity is not increased;
(ii) avoidance of cargo diversion to other ports;
(iii) faster turnaround time for ships in port;
(iv)  lower cargo-handling costs; -nd
(v)  reduction in wharf damage by employing a tug.
5.05      The procedure followed in quantifying the benefits is outlined in
Annex 4. Excluding improvements in port producn2vrity which could be achieved
without new investments, these benefits are est.,!ated to yield an internal
economic return on the investment, excludinig thie tug, of 40%. The rate is highi
because, due to recont rapid traffic growth, the port would soon be congested
without the project.
5.o6      A sensitivity analysis was carried out assuming a reduction in
traffic of 10% and a change in all cost and benefit parameters in a negative
dizection by 10%. Even with these unlikely assumptions the Puerto Cortes
project would yield a satisfactory return of 20%.
5.07      The savings in reduced wharf damage by using a tug in docking and
undocking operations are expected to amount to at least US$60,000 a year. Thle
internal economic return on the investment in the tug will amount to about 13%.
Henecan
5.08      The project at Henecan is designed to replace present lighterage
operations by handling cargo across the new wharf. Its principal benefits
would be:
(i) lower cargo-handling costs;
(ii) faster turnaround time for ships in port; and
(iii) reduced cargo damage.
A quantification of these benefits is given in Annex 4. The internal economic
return on the investment is estimated at 33%.  The return is high because of
the inefficiency of the present lighterage operations and the high savings
which will result from replacing them.



- 14 -
5.09      A sensitivity analysis was also carried out for the project at
Henecan, assuming a reduction in traffic of 10% and a change in all cost and
benefit parameters in a negative direction by 10%. The rate of return in
this unlikely case is estimated to be a still acceptable 23%.
C. Conclusion
5.1o      The evaluation shows that the proposed project is economically
sound and well justified. Considerable benefits will accrue, in the first
instance, to the international shipping industry, but the financial evalua-
tion (Chapter 6) demonstrates that ENP will recover substantial amounits
through charges against ships calling at the ports. Insufficient port facili-
ties would again result in surcharges on ocean freight as in 1969, with ad-
verse consequences on the economy as a whole. The project is, therefore, an
important contribution to the country's economic development.
6. FINANCES
A * Introduction
6.01      Puerto Coites has been the only port operated by ENP and the
following comments on the present finances of ENP refer only to that port.
No financial infonmation is given on the existing operations at Amapala-El
Yuerto-San Lorenzo as these will be replaced by new facilities at Henecan.
ENP will operate Henecan and the financial forecasts cover the operations of
this port and Puerto Cortes.
B. Present Finances - ENP
6.02      Since its establishment in 1966 ENP has produced large operating
surpluses and at the end of 1970 its financial position was strong. Operating
results given in detail in Table 10 are summarized below for the years 1967
through 1970:
(L'o0o)
1961    1968    1969    1970
Operating Revenue             4,209   4,773   5,012   6,555

Operating Ratios               35%      35%     32%     41%



- 15 -
6.03      The operating ratio increased to 41% in 1970 as operating costs
increased whei the new facilities cane into use. However, because the level
of port charges in Puerto Cortes is generally high relative to costs, the
operating ratio is still very low. Harbor dues amounted to L 1.9 million in
1970 although ENP has no breakwater to maintain and does very little dredging.
ENP justifies this levy as a source of revenue to be used for port developr!±it
and does not plan to reduce port charges until the proposed project is comr
pleted (para. 6.12).
6.o0      ENP balance sheets as of December 31, 1966 through 1970 are shown
in Table 11 and are summarized below (1967-1970):

Government Equity              5,715    8s737   12,364   16,245
6,370   11,230   19,025   25,973
Debt/Equity Ratio              10/90    22/78    35/65    37/63
6.05      EUP's financial position is strong; working capital at the end of
1970 was large and included L 7.7 million (US$3.8 million equivalent) of bank
time deposits and short-term Government and Municipal bonds. ENP fixed assets
were revalued at the end of 1968; additions thereafter were at cost. The
debt/equity ratio was 37/63 so there is ample scope for borrowing.
6.o6      The L 1.920 million due from the Government at the end of 1970
included L 1.819 million for services provided by ENP to TRR which claims
exemption from charges under its concession agreement with the Government.
The Government undertook to pay for services granted to users exempted from
payment of port charges, but has not paid this amount. There has been argu-
ment about the validity of the charges and about the political difficulty of
openly subsidizing MRR. There has been also recognition that ENP does not
need the money to maintain its financial strength. However, in order to
settle its debt, the Government is now considering selling rather than donating
the property needed by ENP for its future development. This proposal will
enable the Government to meet its obligation without actually transferring
cash. TRR's exemption from payment for services is linked to the physical
life of the Banana Wharf which it built; and this exemption should cease in
four to five years' time when it is expected the wharf will have to be replaced.
C. Future Finances
6.07      ENP forecast income accounts, cash flow data and balance sheets for
the years 1971-1978 are given in Table 12, 13 and 14 and are summarized below
for the project period 1971-1974. Bases and assumptions used in the projec-
tions are given in the notes appended to the Tables.

6.08      The Bank loan  ill De made to ENP and will be repayable in 20 years
including a four-year grace period. This is a reasonable term takLng into
account the useful life of tVie facilities financed and ENP's financial
strength. During construction, ENP will have sufficient internally generated
resources to finance the 1'r-al currency costs of the project and L 4.4 million
of other capital expenditu2e planned by MP (including an estimated L 2 million
of propertuy to be acquired from the Government in settlement of its debt to
ENP). Other capital expencitures are shown in Table 13. During negotiations
the Government undertook to provide any funds needed by ENP to carry out the
proJect if the resources available to ENP are inadequate. At the same tite
ENP agreed that capital expenditures during the construction period for items
not included in its investment program would not exceed US$250,000 equivalent
per annum without prior consultation with the Bank.
6.09      Subsequent to project construction cash resources are expected to
rise rapidly, cash investments increasing to some L 29 million (us$14.5 million
equivalent) by the end of 1978. Except for the possible replacement of the
Banana Wiharf at Puerto Cortes no further major port expansion is envisaged for
several years after project completion. Furthermore, ENP debt will have de-
clined to 28% of its total capitalization by the end of 1978 allowing ample
scope for borrowing for the next expansion phase. The projected accumulation
of cash is unlikely to be needed and agreement was reached to review the level
of port charges when the project is completed (see para. 6.12).
6.10      ENP's operating ratio is less than 60% in each year 1971-1978 - a low
ratio because port charges are generally high. Annual debt service would be
covered in each year at least twice by cash generated. However, in order to
protect the Bank's position, ENP agreed during negotiations not to incur
long-term debt without the Bankts prior agreement, unless net cash revenue is,
and will remain, at least one and three-quarters times the maximum debt service
requirements.
6.11      After the project is completed the rate of return on the average net
fixed assets of ENP is expected to increase from 11.7% in 1975 to 18.2% in
1978. Table 15 shows forecast revenues and expenses for Puerto Cortes and
Henecan individually for the first four years after the project is completed,
1975-1978.  The financial rates of return on average net fixed assets are
summarized below:
1975    1976    1977    1978
Puerto Cortes               14.2%   16.5%   18.9%   21.5%
Henecan                      3.8%    6. Vp    8.4h  1io.4h
ENP                         11.7%   14.1%   16.1%   18.2%



- 18 -
6.12      During loan negotiations ENP agreed to reasonably relate port charges
to costs and to achieve a financial rate of return on average net fixed assets
of at least 8% per annum, effective irmediately.  In view of the high rates of
return expected to be earned at Puerto Cortes (para. 6.11) ENS agreed during
negotiations that when the project is completed it will consult with the Bank
to review and revise its schedule of port charges. During negotiations dis-
cussions were held on the possibility of EiP transferring unneeded surpluses
to the Government to be used for general developmsznt p;-rposes. ENP mentioned
that it is exempt from taxes on its income but ii.> Board may authorize trans-
fers to the Government when the project is completed.
6.13      ENP's accounts are audited by Price Waterhouse & Co. in a form
acceptable to the Pank. Agreomant was obt:Jned during negotiations that EINP
will continue to retain qualified indcpendent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
6.14      ENP has adequate insurance coverage and intends to obtain similar
coverage in due course at Henecan. Assurances were obtained that ENP will
take out and maintain adequate insurance.
7. RECCHMIEDATIONS
7.01      In addition to the standard Bank requirements for bidding and pro-
curement procedures, insurance coverage, appointing consultants and retaining
qualified auditors, the following principal points were discussed and agreed
with ENP and the Govermnent:
a) All land required for carrying out the project will be
acquired by January 1, 1972; ENP will not award a cons-
truction contract at either port until it shall have
acquired all land required at that port. Furthermore,
in the case of Henecan the contract will not be awarded
until ENP has exclusive jurisdiction over this port
(paras. 3.05 and 4.13).
b) By the time the project at Henecan is cornpleted the
Government will modify a 1961 decree thereby permitting
the importation and exportation of goods through the
new port (para. 3.22).
c) ENP will not administer other ports unless it has the
necessary administrative and financial capacity
(para. 3.06).
d) The free storage period will be reduced from the present
15 days to ten days by January 1, 1974 at Puerto Cortes
and established at ten days from the date of project
completion at Henecan (para. 3.19).



- 19 -
e) Long-term debt of ENP will be limited and LIfP will
consult with the Bank when the project is completed
to review and revise its schedule of port charges
(paras. 6.10 and 6.12).
7.02      The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$6.0
million to E1P to be repayable in 20 years including a four-year grace period.

REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND PORT PROJECT
Existing Port Facilities
A. Puerto Cortes
1. Channel and Water Area
Puerto Cortes bay is a well-protected, natural harbor, readily
accessible to ocean-going ships. There is no defined channel entering
the bay. Water depths are 12 m or more in the approach area, which is
ample for the ships that use the port. The water area is some 12 km
and provides anchorage depths of up to 16 m. The prevailing winds are
easterly and northeasterly and do not interfere with the safe berthing
of ships. Because of the small tidal range of about 0.3 m and the wide
entrance to the bay, tidal currents are usually less than one knot.
2. Wharves
With the recent completion of two new wharves, Puerto Cortes
now has three wharves for general cargo and lumber, one wharf for bananas
and one pier for petroleum products. The characteristics of these wharves
are given at the end of this Annex.
3. Transit Sheds, Warehouses and Open Storage Areas
i)  8,100 m2 of transit shed area is available oM the Government
wharves - 3,200 m  at Wharf No.1 and 4,900 m  at Wharf No.2.
ii)  ENP owns two warehouses:  One has 2,600 m2 of floor area, automatic
sprinklers, and is in excellent condition.  The other is located
just outside the port area, has 1,800 m2 of floor area and is
scheduled for demolition and replacement. In January 1971, a
5,000 ton capacity warehouse for wheat imports was built just
outside the port area.
iii)  About 10,000 mi2 of open-storage area is available at four sites
about 80 m away from the berths and behind the transit sheds.
These sites are paved and have adequate drainage.
4. Handling Equipment
i)  At Puerto Cortes, as at most Central American ports, general
cargo and lumber are usually handled by ships' gear.
ii) Privately-owned mechanized cargo-handling equipment is almost
entirely limited to banana loading. TRR owns four gantry-type
conveyors on the Banana Wharf which, although installed in 1934,
are in good working condition. The Standard Fruit Company owns



Page 2
mobile belt and roller conveyors to load, through side openings,
banana ships berthed at Government Wharves.
iii)  Mineral exporters use hoppers mounted on trucks and wheat importers
use closed boxed trucks.
iv)  EIP owns some equipment to handle general cargo between ships,
transit sheds, warehouses and open storage areas. Most of this
equipment was acquired in 1968-1969 and is in good working
condition.
5. Ship Repair Facilities
There are no ship repair yards at Puerto Cortes. The TRR shop,
two km east of the port, can be used for emergency engine and equipment
repairs. Ships needing major repair or overhaul use facilities in the
IJnited States and, to a lesser extent, shipyards in the Carribean. ENP
has a maintenance shop of limited capacity for maintaining and repairing
handling equipment. This work is carried out in a satisfactory manner.
6. Railroad Service
Puerto Cortes was developed as a railroad port; there was no
adequate highway connection between the port and the interior until 1961
when the Buffalo-Cortes Highway was completed. The port is served directly
by the National Railroad and by TRR operating over the National Railroad
42-inch gauge track. Rail facilities are available at all berths.
B. Amapala-San Lorenzo-Henecan
1. The Channels (Map 3)
Amapala and El Muerto are the only accessible anchorages on the
Pacific Coast of Honduras for ocean-going ships. Both fairways to Amapala
and El Muerto are tortuous and insufficiently marked.
i) There is a natural entrance channel about 30 km long leading to
Amapala at the northwestern corner of Tigre Island. The depth
is 6.5 m (21 ft) below MLWL at the entrance and ranges between
7 and 8 m (23 to 26 Zt) in the channel. Anchorage opposite
Amapala varies in depth between 11 and 16 m. The range between
MiL and HUL1 is 3.3 m (11 ft).  Ships ranging between 6.5 m
and 8.5 m draft (21 to 28 St) enter Amapala at high tide. In
the channel, which has no navigation aids, ships must alter
course six times.
ii) Navigation through a channel 27 km long to the El Muerto anchorage
is possible at MHWL with ships drawing up to 5.8 m (19 ft).  This
limitation is partly due to insufficient buoys. With good markings,
especially at the outer bar, located about 5 km southeast of Tigre



ANNEX 1
Page 3
Island, ships of up to 7.0 m (23 ft) can pass at IIIhL.  At the
outer bar and at Henecan the range between IMHWL and MLWL is
3.3 m (11 ft).  The inner bar is located north of Raton Island.
In 1962 the natural channel to El r4uerto was surveyed, mapped
and marked with three buoys. Sufficient depths and widths are
available near Henecan for anchorage and turning of ships which
now use El Muerto,
iii)  Between Amapala and San Lorenzo barges pass through a tortuous
route 30 km long with some shallows where water deDth is only
one meter at low water.
2. 'Wharves and Transit Sheds
i)  Although there are masonry bulkheads about 400 m long along the
Amapala waterfront, barges can only moor alongside during two
hours of high tide; at other times they must anchor about 80 m
offshore. On shore, there are four customs sheds and seven
privately-owned wooden sheds. Cranes are not available at the
berths and all cargo operations are carried out by hand.
ii)  In San Lorenzo, barges can moor alongside seven masonry berths
and a wooden jetty which were built near the low water line and
can only be used during part of the tide. There are two hand-
operated and two electric cranes, all of the fixed type. Covered
storage consists of eight wooden Governnient-owned sheds an2d one
concrete privately-owned shed with a total area of 3,500 m .
The shipping agencies have extensive lumber yards (total area -
about 112,000 m ) where timbers is stored and sorted.
3. Floating Equipment
All floating equipment at Amapala and San Lorenzo is owned by the
shipping agencies and consists of 25 barges with a total carrying capacity
of 1,600 tons and seven tugs, ranging from 65 to 150 HP.

ANNEX 2
REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS
APPAISAL OF THE SECOND PORT PROJECT
Puerto Cortes Project Description
The project in Puerto Cortes is:
1o   Construction of a deepwater wharf 285 m long and 53 m wide im-
mediately east of existing Government wharf No. 2. The new wharf will have
a reinforced concrete deck supported on reinforced concrete piles and will
be similar in construction to Government wharf No. 2. The berth alongside
the wharf will be dredged initially to 9.0 m below MLIJL to serve the sizes
of ships presently calling at the port. The wharf should be designed to
permit deepening of the berth to 11.0 m in the future, should it become
necessary, The wharf will also be designed to handle containers, should the
need arise. Two railway tracks will be installed near the wharf face to permit
direct transfer of cargo from ships to rail wagons.  These tracks will be
connected to the tracks of Government wharf No. 2 and, if needed in the
future., to tracks behind the transit shed on that wharf.
2.   Construction of a railway yard east of the new wharf to handle
loaded rail wagons and for marshalling empty ones. The yard will consist
of five tracks 800 m in length. Two tracks will accommodate loaded lwagons
for two ships at berth, two will be used for marshalling empty wagons and
the fifth track can be used by another loaded train arriving for a succeeding
vessel. The track layout will permit uncoupling the trains into six wagon
units for shunting to the wharf over a short connecting track. The track will
be constructed on fill faced with riprap for protection against wave action.
3.  Four mechanical belt conveyors will be installed on the wharf to
handle banana boxes bet-ween railway wagons and ships. Bananas will be
loaded into ships through side openings using mobile conveyors fed from
the mechanical belt conveyors, All conveyors will be covered by canopies
to protect the banana boxes during handling.
4.   Construction of a roll-on/roll-off ramp at the junction of Govern-
ment wharves Nos. 1 and 2. This ramp will be about 30 m long and 15 m wide
and will be used to discharge loaded tractors from two ships simultaneously
berthing at the Government wharves. The structure will consist of a rein-
forced concrete deck supported on reinforced concrete piles.
5.   Provision for power distribution facilities, lighting, water hy-
drants and a drainage system. The customs fence will be extended alongside
the new reclaimed area and the railway yard. An access road leading to the
new facilities will be constructed between the railway yard and the customs
fence.
6.  Acquisition of a tug boat of about 700 HP to assist in docking and
undocking of ships, a 'ilot boat, three "orklift trucks of five tons each,
two forklift trucks of two tons each and 300 nallets.

As Amapala-Henecan is an intermediate port of call, ships rarely enter or
leave the port fully loaded. The maximum loaded draft of ships calling at
El Muerto in each of the years 1967, 1968 and 1969 was 8.2 m (27 ft). The
distribution of the actual drafts of ships calling at Amapala and El Muerto
during that period was as follows:

ii) The percentages of all ships, including coasters, anchoring at
El Muerto in 1957, 1968 and 1969 to the total number of ships in Amapala
and El 4u.erto were 42%, 43% and 46%v, respectively.  Assuming a re-distri-
bution, whereby all ships with an actual draft of 7.0 n (23 ft) or less
were handled at El Muerto and those with deeper draft were handled at
Amapala, the percentages of El Muerto ships would have been 74%, 70% and



ANNEX 3
Page 2
70% for 1967, 1968 and 1969, respectively, which indicate a considerable
change from the present pattern. In terms of commodities shipped, Amapala'ss
share would have been about 20% of the total flow of goods (Table 2) against
an actual share of 36.0%, 32.8% and 28.3% in 1967, 1968 and 1969, respectively.
iii) A comparison of soundings taken in the natural channel leading
to El Muerto in 1884, 1961 and 1968 shows that the reg-me varied little
during these periods and that the channel remained st(l. e irni ;,sition and
depths. Deepening of the existing natural navigation channel is not planned
for the proposed project. The maximum draft of ships which could use the
new facilities at Henecan would be 7.0 m (23 ft) at MENL. The draft of
general cargo ships calling has increased only slightly during recent years.
iv) Sizeable quantities of containerized cargos are not likely to
be handled via Amapala-Henecan in the near future. Lumber is not readily
suitable for containerization and consignments of other commodities are
small. Lighter aboard ship (IASH) vessels could serve the new port.
2. Elavigation Aids
To allow safe navigation during day and night, the c;,nnel should
be marked by light buoys.  The entrance of the channel shouli ce imarked
by a reconnaissance light buoy with visibility of at least 8 nautical. miles
at a level of 5 m above water level.
3. VMharves
i)  The shallow-draft wharves at San Lorenzo are old, inadequate,
inefficient and expensive to improve. All cargo-handling and customs
operations, whether for sea-going ships or barges, will, therefore, be
concentrated at Henecan.
ii) Table 3 gives forecast traffic for Henecan and Amapala taking
into account origin and destination of cargo. Two deep-water berths 290 m
long are needed to handle the forecast of Henecan traffic - one exclusively
for lumber and one for lumber and general cargo. In 1978, the berths will
handle 168,000 of lumber exports and 89,000 tons of general cargo imports
and exports. This is the maximum capacity of the proposed two berths.
The remaining 42,000 tons of lumber exports will be loaded into barges at
Henecan's inner berths and transferred to ships anchoring at El Muerto.
Amapala's cargo (totaling 29,000 tons of imports and exports in 1978) will
be loaded or unloaded into barges using the inner side of the Henecan wharf.
4. Transit Sheds and Open Storage Areas
i) All import cargos handledin .Amapala and Henecan are expected to
use the new transit shed at Henecan. Consignees will be allowed a 10-day
free period. The average daily import tonnage of storable general cargo
in 1978 is estimated to be 200 tons. Assuming one square meter for each
ton of cargo and 33% of the shed area for the movement of goods, the total
transit shed area would be 200 x 10 x 100   3,200 m2. Since it is not



ANNEX 3
Page 3
expected that all cargo wilUl be kept in the shed for the full period of
10 days it may be possible to allocate a closed area inside the shed for
long-term storage.
ii) Cotton and non-storable general cargo (vehicles, machinery,
etc.) may use the open storage areas. Lumber sorting and storage is expected
to continue in San Lorenzo.
5. Access Road
The new berths are linked to San Lorenzo by an access road 2.6
km long and 7.0 m wide with 1.5 m of shoulders. The pavement is to consist
of a sub-base of select volcanic material, a crushed-stone base and a
surface of concrete blocks on a sand layer. This access road could be
linked to the nearby Pan American Highway by a road bypassing San Lorenzo
proper.
6. Cargo-Handling Equipment
Ten 2-ton forklift trucks, 8 tractors, 100 trailers and 1,200
pallets are required to handle cargo on the apron, to and f,c ,  the transit
shed and open storage areas and in the transit shed arnd ope:. storage areas.
Four 2-ton mobile cranes will handle cargo to and from bargas berthing on
the inner side of the berth. One 10-ton crane will be used to handle
heavy loads.
7. Port Land Area
The area required for the proposed port facilities is about 15
acres including that required for the access road. ENP is also expected
to acquire from the Government additional areas adjacent to the new
facilities, for future port development. The cost estimate of the project
does not include these additional areas.
8. Investigations Required for Final Design
i)  For TAharves Design:  (a) determination, on site, of the soil
bearing capacity; (b) determination of soil compressibility; and (c) cone
or standard penetration tests to establish pile length.
ii) For Wharves Location and Alignment: Determination of contour
lines by measuring cross sections at and to the north of the site.
iii) For Access Road: (a) collection of data as mentioned in (i)(a)
and (b) above, at access road site, and (b) tri-axial tests on undistributed
samples to determine bearing capacity.

Economic Evaluation
A. Traffic Forecasts
Bananas
Honduras' banana production increased at an average alnual rate
of 15% between 1963 and 1968, compared with an annual increase in world
consumption of some 3% during the same period. Exports declined in 1969
and 1970 due to the hurricane which damlaged much of the United Fruit
plantations in September 1969. United Fruit production is expected to
recover by 1972 and increase thereafter at about 3½2% a year.  Standard
Fruit production is expected to increase from 103,000 tons in 1970 to
175,000 tons in 1972, in accordance with expansion currently underway,
and increase thereafter at 3f  a year.  This compares wita a 21  growth
rate for world consumption predicted by FAO; the higher growTh rate reflects
Honduras' advantages of excellent soil for bananas and proximity to major
markets. Exports through the ports are expected to grow as follows between
1970 and 1978.

Lumber
Lumber production increased in Honduras at an average of 8.4%
a year between 1962 and 1969 and amourted to 489,ooo tons in 1969. FAO
estimates that at present Levels of cultivation, annual production could
reach and be sustained at between 1.5 and 2.0 ilillion tons and considers that
production could be increased well above this level iath better forest
management.



ANINEX h
Page 2
The proportion of lumber production exported increased from
55% in 1962 to about 60% in 1969 and this rate is expected to be maintained
in the future. FAQ forecast that exports of Honduras lumber to the
Caribbean would grow at 71$ a year between 1965 and 1985. Because of the
recent growth of competition from other Central American producers, a
growth rate has been adopted. Exports to Central America declined signi-
ficantly in 1969 and 1970 due to the war with 21 Salvador and difficulties
within the Central American Common Market. It is assumed that lumber exports
to these countries will not reach the level attained in 1969 again until
1978. Exports to Europe are expected to grow at 4% a year in line wqith
recent grow-ith rates of sales to this area.
The traffic allocation between Puerto Cortes and Henecan is based on
an analysis of estimated total transport costs, including ocean freight, from
the lumber producing regions of Honduras to overseas destinations.
Ninerals
Nineral exports are mainly zinc and lead concentrates mined
within the Puerto Cortes service area. Output has increased at an average
of about 10% a year since 1963. The mining company operating in the area
expects that this growth rate will continue through the forecast period.
Coffee
Honduran coffee exports amounted to 32,000 tons in 1970. Exports
through Puerto Cortes are shipped mostly to the United States markets and
are not expected to grow at more than 2% a year. Exports through Henecan
are to Japan and Europe and they are expected to grow slightly faster.
Other Dry Cargo Exports
Other dry cargo consists mainly of agricultural products (meat,
cereals, maize, fruit, banana puree, beans, sugar and molasses) and raw
materials (cement, chemicals, cotton and cotton seed). This traffic grew
at very high rates, averaging above 151 growtuh in value terms in the years
1962 to 1968. Normally, some 50% of these products are exported to Central
American countries. Trade with Honduras' partners in the Central American
Common lIarket, which has declined in recent years, is expected to regain
the 1968 level by 1977 and increase thereafter. Exports of these commodities
through the ports are expected to increase at 7% a year between 1970 and
1978.
Pheat
Honduras has very little area suited to whleat cultivation and
imports most of its requirements, mainly from the United States Gulf ports.
Imports are expected to grow rapidly as the standard of living rises.
The sole importer expects an annual growth rate of at least 10%0 during
the 1970$s and this rate has been assumed in the forecasts.



AZTJEX
Page 3
Other Imports
Other imports have increased at the following annual rates since
1963:
Machinery & Transport Equipment             7%
Chemical Products                          12%
Other General Cargo                        10%
TAMS predicts a growth rate for imports of machinery and transport
equipment of 7% in line with developments in industry and agriculture, and
this rate has been used in the forecasts.  The 12% annual growth of chenical
products imports coincided with a rapid growth in banana cultivation and
a lower rate (7%) is expected in the future. Other imports are expected
to increase in line with the general growth of the economy which is expected
to be 5i% a year, the same as the average growth rate of the economy between
1961 and 1968. Other general cargo imports through Puerto Cortes are expected
to grow at a slightly higher rate of 7% as its hinterland contains the
fastest growing industrial area (San Pedro Sula). Traffic generated by the
new facilities at Henecan will total about 15,00Q tons of general cargo in
1978. In view of the large reduction in transport costs following port
construction at Henecan, and the impetus which will be given to development
in the area, the estimate of generated traffic is considered to be oonseamtive.-
Oil
In 1967 Texaco built a refinery at Puerto Cortes with a capacity
of some 14i,000 bbls (approximately 2,000 tons) a day. In 1970 production
was reduced because tanker rates made it cheaper to produce elsewhere.
It is expected that the Texaco refinery will return to full capacity in
1972 and expand capacity thereafter in relation to Honduras' domestic
requirements. These are expected to grow at *9g a year, the same rate as
GMP. Exports of petroleum products, consisting mainly of fuel oil, are
expected to increase at the same rate.
B. Economic Analysis
Puerto Cortes - Productivity
Before evaluating the benefits of the project, the extent to which
present port productivity will be improved without new investments was
assessed. The handling rate for wheat is being increased by the acquisition
of new equipment. The general cargo handling rates increased throughout
1970 and are expected to increase further as port workers become more skilled
and better trained in the use of modern cargo-handling equipment. However,
improvement in this rate will be limited as wharf congestion increases with
traffic growth. It will improve further as such congestion is relieved
when the project is completed. The lumber handling rate will increase by
speedier movement of rail flat cars from the new shunting yard. New equip-
ment will improve the loading rate for bananas.

Benefits - Puerto Cortes
The project is designed to increase the capacity and improve
the cargo-handling rates by better rail access and equipment.  The principal
benefits will be:
(i)  reduction in anticipated ship-waiting tine which will rise
sharply if port capacity is not increased;
(ii)  avoidance  of diversion of cargo to other ports by reducing
port congestion;
(iii)  faster turnaround time for ships by increased cargo-handling
rates;
(iv)  lower cargo-handLing costs; and
(v) reduction in wharf damage by purchasing a tug to assist in
docking and undocking operations.
The extent of future ship-waiting time, as a function of existing
and proposed capacity and expected traffic growth has been evaluated with
the use of a mathematical model developed in the Bank.  According to this
model ship-waiting time increases exponentially as berth occupancy rates
approach 90% of existing capacity. Beyond 90% occupancy it was assumed
that cargo would be diverted from Puerto Cortes to other Caribbean ports,
most probably Tela or Puerto Barrios (Guatemala). The additional costs
of diversion are estimated to average about $5 a ton.
Savings from faster ship turnaround were calculated using cargo-
handling rates shown above and the following values for a ship day: banana
ships $3,000, general cargo ships $1,800, bulk cargo ships $1,500 and lumber



AiiEXx 4
Page 5
ships $1,000. These values are cons-dered to be realistic. The share of
total ship-waiting time for each class of ship was based on the shares of
total ship-waiting time which actually occurred in 1969 when the port was
highly congested. Finally, cargo-handling cost reductions will be achieved
for bananas, lumber and general cargo.
Based on these savings, the internal economic return on the
investment, excluding the tug, is estimated to be 40%.
The saving in reduced wharf damage by acquiring a tug are expected
to amount to at least US$60,000 a year. The internal economic return on
this investment will amount to about 13%.
Benefits - Henecan
The project is designed to replace lighterage at El Muerto by
a wharf handling operation at Henecan. Its principal benefits will be:
(i) Lower Cargo-Handling Costs
The consultants' (INEDEC0) estimates of the cost of handling
goods between ships and San Lorenzo and Bank Staff's estimates
of handling them at the proposed facility in Henecan are as
follows:

ANNEX 4
PageO
(ii)  Reduced Ship Service Time
At present ships calling at Amapala-El Muerto discharge/load
on the average 300 tons per day. At the Henecan wharf cargo-
handling rates are expected to amount to 567 tons a day for
lumber and 480 tons a day for general cargo and cotton. Ships
calling at Henecan will average about 6,000 dwt for which
the value of a ship day is about $2,250. Benefits were cal-
culated only for ships handled alongside the newl wharf at
Henecan.
(iii)  Reductions in Damage
Lighterage of cargo involving multiple handling operations
results in damage to cargo, especially to general cargo. It
is estimated that reduction in damage to such cargo resulting
from the project would amount to one-half of one per cent of
its value or $2.50 a ton. The total benefits are as follows:

an internal economic return of 33%.

REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND PORT PROJECT
Forecast Income Accounts 1971-78
Operating Revenue
1.        Revenue was estimated applying the present Puerto Cortes tariff
(from 1975 at Henecan) and forecast traffic (Tables 8 and 9). Tug rentals
were calculated from a cost-based tariff which was estimated for the tug
to be acquired in the project.
Operating Expenditure
1. Otaff Costs
(a) Puerto Cortes
Allowances were made for increases in 1971 in wage rates and
employee benefits at present under negotiation with the unions in Puerto
Cortes and thereafter at rates consonant with past experience. Increases
were estimated in cargo-handling staff costs for greater throughput; staff
costs in other categories (warehousing, dockage, superintendence and
administration and accounting) were considered fixed costs. No improvement
in producitivty was allowed for although some small increases in cargo-
handling rates may be expected, particularly after completion of the project.
(b) Henecan
Staff costs were estimated from a personnel roster planned for
Henecan by ENP using the same pay rates as for equivalent posts in Puerto
Cortes. Cargo-handling personnel costs were based on handling rates
estimated by the consultants (NEDECO).
2. M4aterials and Supplies
Allowance was made for expected increases in prices (5% per annum)
and where appropriate for increases in quantities related to increased
traffic.
3. Maintenance and Repairs
L 100,000 was allowed a year in 1971 and in 1972 to repair damage
done and expected at the Government Wharves in Puerto Cortes until a tug
is acquired (expected by beginning 1973) to assist ships in docking and
undocking operations.  This will reduce or eliminate such damage.  Other



Notes on
TAELE 12
Page 2
mainten0loe costs are expected to increase in proportion to the value of
the investment in fixed assets in use.
4. Administrative and Other Expenses
Allowance was made for administrative costs at Henecan including
additional insurance to cover marine, personal accident and commercial
risks at the port.
Depreciation of Fixed Assets
Depreciation is calculated on the original cost of fixed assets
at ENP rates, which are reasonable.
Other
Interest income was estimated at 5% a year on the average
balance invested each year in short-term investments. Rates on such
investments held by ENP at the end of 1970 earned rates of 5% to 7% a year.
