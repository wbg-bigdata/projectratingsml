INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND D-VEIOPEIET
REPORT AND RZCO21ENDATTON OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVEi DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOANT TO ENPRESA NACIONAL PORTUARIA
WITH THE GUARMTTEY OF HONDURAS FOR
A SECOND PORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Bank loan of $6.0 million to the anpresa Nacional Portuaria (ENP) with
the guarantee of the Republic of Honduras. This would be the second loan
for a port project to Honduras; it would have a 20-year term, including
four years of grace, with interest at 71 percent.   It would be used to
help finance port expansion and improvement in Puerto Cortes on the
Atlantic coast, and construction of a deep-water facility at Henecan on
the Pacific.
2.        A summary of previous loans and credits to Honduras is at
Annex I.  The last economic report on Honduras (WH-.193a) was distributed
to the Ececutive Directors in September 1969. An appraisal report on
the proposed project is being distributed separately. Country data and
a loan and project summary are contained in Annexes II and III.
PART I - HISTORICAL
3.        Honduras has received nine Bank loans totalling $52.1 million
and five IDA credits for $24.0 million, both net of cancellations. Al-
most one-half of this lending has been for highways and more than one-
third for power. The only other operations have been a loan for ports
(1966), similar to the one now under consideration, and a credit for
livestock development (1970).   The last loan and credit, for power, were
signed in June 1970. The proposed loan is the only operation to be
presented to the Executive Directors during the current fiscal year.
Another loan, possibly of about $8 million, for a power project, should
be ready for consideration in the next fiscal year, and preparatory work
is also proceeding on another road project.
4.        The execution of Bank assisted projects in Honduras has been
fairly satisfactory in spite of an acute shortage of slklled personnel,
which has resulted in heavy reliance on foreign consultants. The undis-
bursed balance of effective loans/credits on April 30, 1971, was $19.6
million. WNhile three Bank-financed road projects have been satisfactorily
completed, serious delays have occurred on the North Road project, which
is being jointly financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and
the Bank Group (Credit 71-HO and Loan 400-HO made in 1965).   These delays
were mainly due to changes in alignment at the beginning and later on to
the unusually heavy rains in 1968 and 1969, and the border conflict with
El Salvador in July 1969. The project is now expected to show a cost over-
run of about $1.5 million (about 7 percent of total appraised cost), main-
ly because of damage resulting from severe weather conditions; the overrun
will be covered by the Government. The credit is fully disbursed, and



disbursements of the loan are now proceeding normally, but it has been
necessary to extend the closing date as a first step by six months (to
June 30, 1971), and a further extension will be required. Disbursements
on the livestock credit (Credit 179-HO) have been slow because of delay
in appointing the project director.  However, sub-loans are now being
processed, and disbursements are expected to pick up shortly. The first
port project was completed on schedule in 1970. The Rio Lindo power
project (Credit 116-HO and Loan 541-HO) was inaugurated in May of this
year, and the loan and credit should be completely disbursed before the
closing date of December 31, 1971.
5.        IFC has participated in two projects in Honduras.  A total of
about $0.4 million was invested in a leather tanning project in 1964
and 1966. The more important operation, in terms of its potential con-
tribution to Honduras' long-term economic development, is a pilot pro-
ject for a pulp and paper industry to utilize the wood resources of the
Olancho Reserve. Capital required for the total project could be in
the neighborhood of $150 million, including some $50 million for infra-
structure. A pilot company, Compania Pino Celulosa de Centro America
S.A. (COPIiTO), was established in June 1968, under the leadership of
International Paper Company (IPCO), to investigate and possibly carry
out the project. IFC authorized a share capital investment in COPINO
of $0.05 million in September 1968 and another $0.05 million in Febru-
ary 1970. For reasons in part extraneous to the project, IPCO discon-
tinued its participation in COPIliO in Ilarch 1971, but at the request of
the Honduran Government IFC has agreed to search for new partners. Major
questions affecting the project, such as responsibility for infrastructure,
forest administration, delimitation of the concession area and fiscal
treatment, remain to be resolved in negotiation with the Honduran Government.
PART II - THE ECONl'Oi4Y
6.      - Although Honduras has been demonstrating a good development
effort in recent years, it is still one of the poorest countries in the
Western Hemisphere, with per capita GNP well below $300 and great defi-
ciencies in economic and social infrastructure. Economic growth has
been export-oriented and concentrated on bananas, with consequent vul-
nerability to world market conditions, climatic hazards and decisions
of foreign companies. Income distribution is probably less uneven than
in the surrounding countries, but standards of education, health and
housing are extremely low. The Government, aware for some time of the
urgent need to modernize and diversify the economy and to provide bet-
ter living conditions for the population, is trying to step up public
investment to overcome the existing infrastructure deficiencies. An
Aid Coordination Group, which held its inaugural meeting in Tegucigalpa
in March 1970, was organized at the Government's initiative with Bank
support in order to mobilize external assistance for the development
program. A decision on the future of this Group will be made after the
impending change of Administration. Presidential elections held in
March have given a narrow edge to the ruling party, and a new President,



- 3 -
Dr. Ramon Ernesto Cruz, was inaugurated on June 6. An understanding be-
twieen the two main parties had been reached before the March elections
to the effect that the opposition party would share in cabinet and other
posts of authority. General understanding wJas also reached on broad in-
vestment policy, and no major shift in government economic policies is to
be expected.
7.        The economic situation has deteriorated quite sharply during
the past two years. The war with mL Salvador, the resulting disruption
of foreign trade and severe hurricane damage in 1969 have slowed down
economic growth, undermined investors' confidence, reduced public savings
and depleted reserves of foreign exchange. Real GINP increased by about
4 percent in 1969 and 3 percent in 1970 (compared to an average of just
over 5 percent in the 1960's). With population believed to be growing
at around 31 percent a year, this means that per capita income has re-
mained stationary since 1968. The value of comnmodity exports fell by
5 percent in 1969, as a result of the effect of the hurricane on banana
output, and increased only marginally in 1970, while imports, stimulated
by domestic credit and fiscal policies, increased substantially in 1970.
In contrast with the sizeable accumulation of reserves during the 1960's,
net international reserves fell by $4 million in 1969 and $14 million in
1970 to a level equivalent to only 15 days imports.
8.        The economic difficulties have been aggravated by the crisis
in the Central American Common Market (CACI4), the establishment of which
had allowed rapid industrialization and growth in Central America during
the 1960's. Since the war, there has been no trade between Honduras
and Z1 Salvador, and intraregional trade which formerly moved by road
through Honduras now has to be ferried across the Gulf of Fonseca. The
difficulties in the CACI4 have origins which precede the Honduras-ZL
Salvador war. For some time before that there had been mounting crit-
icism by the poorer countries of the common market of what they regarded
as the inequitable distribution of integration benefits. Honduras, in
particular, complained that because of its trade deficit in the market it
was transferring its banana earnings to its CAal partners in exchange for
inferior industrial products on which it could not levy import taxes,
thus eroding the tax base.
9.        In January 1971 Honduras imposed duties on imports from CACM
countries because of the failure to reach agreement on a "modus operandi"
designed to revitalize the market and bring about a different distribu-
tion of integration benefits. The other countries retaliated with trade
restrictions against Honduran exports. Although Honduras and El Salvador
have recently agreed to resume discussion of bilateral issues, the solu-
tion of which should facilitate the restructuring of the CACM, the pre-
sent difficulties are unlikely to be overcome quickly.



- 4 -
10.       One major issue which must be tackled immediately by the new
Administration is the sharp increase in the budget deficit of the Central
Government (see Annex II) and the associated heavy use of Central Bank
financing. The main reason for the rise in the budget deficit and the
decline in public savings was a sharp rise in current expenditures
stimulated by the war. Military expenditures, though relatively modest
by international standards (an estimated 3 percent of GDP in 1970), have
remained above the pre-war level; in addition, there has also been a
substantial increase in current expenditures related to development.
As public investment has climbed steadily from 2.5 percent of GDP in
1965 to over 6 percent in 1970, the domestic financing gap has widened
substantially, in spite of a substantial increase in net external bor-
rowing. The overall domestic credit expansion, both to the public and
private sectors, was faster than the growth in banking system resources
and substantially faster than GDP in the last two years (26.5 percent
and 4.5 percent respectively), thus contributing to the reserve loss and
to mild upward pressure on prices.
11.       In considering the justification for the proposed Bank loan to
ENP, account must be taken of the exceptional difficulties which the
Honduran economy has encountered over the past two years as a result of
the conflict with El Salvador, the 1969 hurricane and the CACM crisis.
Some decline in public savings was inevitable in these circumstances,
and with elections impending the Government was in a weak position to
introduce new tax measures. The Bank and the IMF have for some months
been discussing with the Government the need for revenue and expenditure
measures to reestablish equilibrium. The IMF has recently approved a
stand-by credit of $15 million, which calls for ceilings on central bank
credit and foreign indebtedness and looks for a small recovery of inter-
national reserves. A Bank economic mission will be visiting Honduras in
October and will review the fiscal situation with the new Administration.
Continued financial assistance from the external lending agencies is a
vital factor in maintaining a vigorous public investment effort. The
proposed port project moreover will not impose any additional strain on
the Central Government budget, since local costs would be financed
entirely from revenues generated by the port authority itself.
12.       The external public debt of Honduras is still quite low,
although it has doubled during the past five years. Most of the ex-
ternal borrowing in recent years has taken place on concessional terms,
including some assistance from IDA. Service on the external public
debt absorbed only 3 percent of external earnings on current account in
1970 (Annex II). Assuming that the average terms of external borrow-
ing are more or less the same as in the past, and assuming that 40 per-
cent of public investment is financed in future from external sources
(compared with 33 percent in 1968 and 35 percent in 1970), Honduras
should be able to carry through a development program of the approximate
magnitude envisaged by the 1969 Bank economic mission without increasing
its external debt ratio above a moderate level of 7 percent in 1976.
Honduras is therefore considered creditworthy for the proposed loan.



PART III - DEVELOPMNT PRIORITIES
13.       Hondaras' long-run development hinges on its ability to improve
and transform the economic structure, since prospects for traditional
exports are not encouraging. Banana sales, which still account for over
40 percent of export earnings, are expected to be buoyant in the short
term as rehabilitation and ongoing expansion plans are completed, but
their expansion should level off at about 3.5 percent per annum after
1972, in line with limited world market possibilities. The past develop-
ment of non-traditional exports, e.g. basic grains, wood products, manu-
factured goods, has been based on the CACM. Provided that its present
problems are resolved, the CACM will continue to be an important outlet
for non-traditional exports, but Honduras also needs to make every effort
to exploit its comparative advantages (e.g. for pulp and paper and other
forestry products) in other markets. This requires that the present
effort to modernize and diversify the economy be vigorously continued.
The public investment program worked out in close consultation with
the Bank and the Aid Coordination Group is an important element in such
an effort.
14.       Basic deficiencies in economic infrastructure, particularly
transport, are one of the main reasons for Honduras' slow economic
development. The North Road Project, to which reference was made in
paragraph h above, will provide the country with its first all-weather
modern surface transport link between the capital, Tegucigalpa, and the
principal agricultural and industrial zone centered on San Pedro Sula.
Completion of this road will greatly reduce internal transport costs
and should do much to stimulate domestic and foreign trade. Additional
port facilities on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts will also be
needed to support the expansion of an economy so heavily dependent on
foreign trade. A study made by Bank staff of ports in the CACM region
suggests that at the present stage of development there are few realistic
possibilities for regional integration in this sector, and Honduras must
therefore provide adequate facilities for its own trade. A better port
on the Pacific coast is particularly important for the development of
irrigated agriculture and forestry.
15.       While assistance from the World Bank Group in the foreseeable
future is likely to remain heavily concentrated in the power and trans-
port sectors, the next Bank economic mission will look into other pos-
sible sectors the development of which would contribute to the goal of
diversifying the economy. The Central American Bank for Economic
Integration will continue to finance transport infrait-ructure.  USAID
is mainly active in roads, land settlement and family planning, while
IDB is assisting the Government in financing projects in transport,
agriculture, health and housing. There is no higher priority for econ-
omic development than education, and although USAID and IDB are both
active in this sector, the Government has indicated an interest in
obtaining assistance also from the World Bank Group. A UNESCO mission
under the Cooperatdive Piogram will undertake a review of the sector during
the summer.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
16.       Situated on the Caribbean, Puerto Cortes is the leading national
port: it handled over 72 percent of total cargo in 1970, including
877,000 tons of dry cargo and 1,143,000 tons of petroleum. It is owned
and operated by ENP and its existing modern facilities, including two
wharves for general cargo and lumber, were constructed with assistance
from Loan 463-HO. In addition, there is an old banana wharf and a
privately-owned petroleum pier. Water depths are 12 meters or more in
the approach area.
17.       At present no deep-water port exists on the Hondaran Pacific
coast. Goods have to betransshipped through lighterage facilities based
on San Lorenzo and El PMuerto in the Gulf of Fonseca, iwith customs clear-
ance for imports at the island of Anapala (see map at end). The operation
is slow, and port facilities are inadequate to handle traffic which is
steadily growing in line with expanding economic activity in the hinter-
land. Some 10 percent of the country's total dry cargo trade now passes
through Amapala-El Niuerto-San Lorenzo. Following a feasibility study,
financed under Loan 463-HO, a suitable site for the development of a
deep-water port was found at Henecan, about 3 km from San Lorenzo.
18.       The project would provide improvements at Puerto Cortes, the
construction of a new port at Henecan and technical services. At Puerto
Cortes, where traffic has grown much faster than expected, the port is
operating at mnaximum capacity. The expansion at this port would entail
construction of two deep-water berths, a roll-on/roll-off ramp and a
railroad yard, together with provision of a belt conveyor system for
banana loading, a tug and other supporting facilities. The develop-
ment at Henecan would consist of construction of two deep-water berths
capable of handling ships with a draught of up to 7 meters, a transit
shed and other facilities.
19.       The pulp and paper project mentioned in paragraph 5 is likely
to require special port facilities. Part of the funds provided under
the proposed loan for consulting services might be used, with the approval
of the Bank, to finance a study of the location of such facilities.
20.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $9.8 million,
with the Bank loan financing the estimated foreign exchange component
of $6.o mi1lion. No disbursements are expected for expenditures incurred
before the loan is signed. The local cost of $3.8 million would be met
by ENP from its own resources. Procurement of goods and services to
be financed by the loan would be through international competitive bid-
ding. In estimating the foreign exchange component, it has been assumed
that the main civil works contract would be won by a foreign contractor,
since there are no Honduran firms specializing in this type of work.
Construction of the project is likely to employ about 650 people when
the work is at its peak, and continuing employment for about 500 people
would be provided on completion of the project.



- 7 -
21.       ENP, with the help of consultants,will be responsible for
project execution. ENP is an autonomous institution established with
Bank assistance in December 1965. It has so far been responsible only
for Puerto Cortes, but the Government has undertaken to extend its
authority to Henecan before the Henecan construction contract is signed.
ENP is well managed and its financial position is strong. On the basis
of present tariffs the financial rate of return on its net fixed assets
would be expected to reach 11.7 percent in 1975 and to rise to 18.2
percent in 1978. ENP has agreed to consult with the Bank on the scope
for a possible reduction in tariffs upon completion of the project.
22.       Traffic forecasts at Puerto Cortes indicate an increase in
total traffic from 2 million tons in 1970 to 3.5 million tons in 1980,
with dry cargo rising from 0.9 million to 1.7 million tons. The new
facilities would result in savings in ship-waiting time, avoidance of
diversion, faster ship turnaround time, lower handling costs and other
savings, achieving an internal economic rate of return estimated at
about 40 percent. Traffic in the present lighterage complex on the
Pacific totalled 177,000 tons in 1970, all dry cargo. With the new
port at Henecan, this should rise to 372,000 tons in 1980. Lower cargo
handling costs and ship-service time, and the reduction in cargo damage
presently incurred by multiple handling, result in an estimated internal
rate of return of 33 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUEENTS AIND AUTHORITY
23.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and ENP, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Honduras and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii),
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Agreements contain provisions substantially
similar to those in the Agreements for the first port loan.
24.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMNDATION
25.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
