APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUHMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project in the Philippines for:  con-
struction and improvement in Mindanao of the 160 km road between Cotabato
and Digos; consulting services to the Bureau of Public Highways (BPH) for
detailed engineering of several roads and construction supervision of the
above road; feasibility studies of about 1,000 km of roads; and technical
assistance to improve the administration and operations of the BPH. This
would be the second transportation loan to the Philippines; the first hav-
ing been for harbor dredging in 1961.
ii.       The Philippine islands have historically depended on the sea and
until recently, transport development was oriented toward island and over-
seas trading. The difficult terrain, heavy rainfall, and poor soil condi-
tions have tended to discourage cheap land transport. During World War II,
most land transport infrastructure then in existence was destroyed. Reha-
bilitation of the land transport system has been slow, and economic growth
has made increasing demands on the inadequate system. For this reason,
the Government of the Philippines and the United Nations Development Pro-
gramme (UNDP) undertook in 1968 an overall Transport Survey for which the
Bank acted as Executing Agency. Following the Survey's recommendations,
the Government now places highest priority on highway network improvements
and intends to improve about 13,000 km during the next 5 years.
iii.      The 160 km Cotabato-Digos Road, which was given high priority in
the Transport Survey, is the only overland link between eastern and western
Mindanao, the second largest Philippine island. This road serves large
corn and rice-producing regions rich in agricultural potential. Although
it is heavily trafficked, most of the road is unpaved and is nearly impas-
sable during the monsoon season. Improvement to a two-lane paved standard
is, therefore, of high priority and should yield a rate of return of 18Z
from savings in vehicle operating costs. Detailed engineering of this
road and of two other roads in Luzon (Lucena-Legaspi and Cabanatuan-
Tuguegurao) is included in the project for retroactive financing (about
US$750,000 equivalent). The two latter roads, totalling 765 km, will be
improved with bilateral assistance from Japan, which supplied equipment
for this purpose.
iv.       The project also includes feasibility studies to determine priori-
ties for improvement of a further 1,000 km of roads, together with technical
assistance to help the Government increase the efficiency of the BPH. The
Government has requested financial assistance from the UNDP for both feasi-
bility studies and technical assistance, with the Bank as the Executing
Agency. Consulting services also will be provided under the project for
subsequent detailed engineering of roads identified by the feasibility
studies as being of highest priority.



- ii -
v.        The total project cost, including contingencies and interest
during construction, is estimated at US$15.8 million equivalent.  The
foreign exchange costs, corresponding to 63% of, project costs, would be
about US$9.9 million; of that amount the Government is requesting a Bank
loan of US$8.0 million for construction costs and consulting services,
and UNDP finance of US$1.9 million for studies and technical assistance.
Local costs will be met by the Government. The construction eontracts
will be awarded after international competitive bidding; construction
supervision and other expert services will be carried out by consultants.
The BPH will be responsible for project execution.
vi.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$.O million equiva-
lent.  Based on the economic life of the project, an approptiate term of
the proposed loan is 24 years including four years of grace.



PHILIPPINES
APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Governmen. of the Philippines has asked the Bank to help
finance a highway project consisting of:
(a) construction and improvement of about 160 km of primary
road between Cotabato and Digos;
(b) consulting services to the Bureau of Public Highways
(BPH) for detailed engineering of a number of roads and
for construction supervision of the above road;
(c) feasibility studies of other high priority roads; and
(d) technical assistance to the BPH.
The project cost is about US$15.8 million equivalent. The proposed loan of
US$8.0 million equivalent is for the foreign exchange costs of items (a)
and (b) and for interest during construction. The Government has requested
US$1.9 million from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for
items (c) and (d).
1.02      This would be the second Bank loan in the Philippines for trans-
portation. The first loan (290-PH, June 1961) was US$8.5 million equivalent
for harbor dredging. Performance for that project was only fair and the
undisbursed balance of about US$1.1 million was cancelled on the closing
date. Groundwork for this current project was laid in 1967 when the Bank
assisted the Government in requesting UNDP finance for a Transport Survey.
The Survey was carried out in 1968/69 by METRA International of Prance in
association with SAUTI of Italy; the Bank acted as the Executing Agency.
The current project is based on the findings of the Survey.
1.03      This report was written by Messrs. M. W. Dickerson (Engineer) and
H. Hansen (Economist), who appraised the project in July 1970, and was
edited by Mrs. P. Valad. Mr. A. Imperatrice (Consultant) participated in
the appraisal mission to deal with organizational matters.



II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      The Republic of the Philippines lies in the North'Pacific Ocean
off the southeast coast of Asia and consists of some 7,000 islands with
a land area of about 300,000 km2 (roughly the same size as. Italy).  Luzon,
which includes the capital city of Manila, and Mindanao'are=the two largest
islands and make up about two-thirds of the area. They also account'for
three-quarters of the 36.6 million population. The annual population
growth rate of about 3.1% is among the highest in the world.
2.02      Agriculture is the basis of the economry.  It geherates about 35%
of the Net Domestic Product (NDP), accounts for about 70% of export
earnings (coconut, forestry products, and sugar), and employs about 55%
of the labor force.  About 28% of the areA is cultivated (primarily rice
and corn) and about 33% is commercial forests. Manufacturing accounts for
about 17% of the NDP, considerably more than in nearby Malaysia, Thailand,
and Indonesia. The Philippines has abundant natural resources, with par-
ticular potential for tropical agriculture, forestry, and mineral develop-
ment (copper, gold, iron, chrome, and nickel). Economic growth in i970
was 4.4%. Gross National Product per capita is about US$160.
2.03      Economic development in the Philippines depends on access to
the various geographical regions.  h'ith its many islands, trade has prin-
cipally been by water. On the larger islands, however, the difficult
terrain, heavy rainfall, and poor soil conditions have tehided to dis8-
courage cheap land transport. As a result, the Philippines is cur'rently
served by both a fairly extensive maritime network linking scattered iS-
lands and an inadequate system of land transport within the islands. In-
dustrial and agricultural activity is, as a result, concentrated in the
coastal areas. Table 1 shows domestic trAnsport volumes by mode.
B. Transportation
(a)  General
2.04      During World War II, most of the transport infrastructure was
destroyed.  Since the War, funds for transport infrastructure have been
limited and reconstruction has been slow. There have also been deficien-
cies in transport administration and organization. Emphasis has been
placed on short-term requirements rather than on long-term needs. Rmc-
ognizing these deficiencies and the importance of economic plannihg in
the transport sector, the Government in 1968 requested UN P finance for
a Transport Survey (para. 1.02). This Survey reviewed the existing
transport system and recommended improvements, based on a ten-year trans-
port investment program (FY 1971-1980). Recoimenlations for organiza-
tional changes were also included in the Strvey. Feasibility studies
of high priority highways were carried out under the Survey.



2.05      The Government also, in 1968, created a Commission on Reorgani-
zation which reviewed overall Government structure, including transport
coordination, and is recommending steps for improvement. These recommend-
ations will be submitted for Congressional action in May 1971 (para. 2.17).
2.06      The new Five-Year Infrastructure Program (FY 1971-1975) reflects
the high priority given to improvement of the transport system. Approximately
45% of the Program has been allocated to transportation with 70% of this in-
vestment going to highways (Table 2).
(b) Highways
2.07      The highway network (Table 3), consisting of about 13,000 ka of
paved roads and about 51,000 km of unpaved roads, is concentrated on the
islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao. Past highway planning, main-
tenance, and construction have been inadequate. Vehicle overloading, fre-
quent wash-outs of bridges, and an inadequate feeder road network have
resulted in pbor quality service and high road transport costs. The high-
way system is discussed further in Chapter III.
(c) Railways
2.08      There are two Government-owned railways:  the Philippine National
Railways (PNR) and the Philippine Railroad Company (PRC). PNR is the most
important, with 1,028 km ot single-line track on Luzon; PRC plays an insig-
nificant role, with only about 117 km of line on the islands of Panay and
Cebu. A number of other lines in Luzon are privately owned, mainly by
sugar and logging companies, but they are not significant in the overall
transport picture. Traffic on PNR in FY 1969 was about 1,200 million
passenger-km and 150 million freight ton-km. While passenger traffic has
recently increased moderately, freight traffic has been constant.
2.09      The Transport Survey concluded that, with rehabilitation, the
railroad could play a useful role in the Philippine's transport system.
The Survey's proposals for PNR included a phased rehabilitation program
for track and rolling stock. Changes in administration, operations, and
financing were also proposed, and recommendations were made for increased
freight rates and passenger fares. No improvement program was considered
necessary for PRC at this time.
2.10      Although the Government agrees with the general conclusions
of the Transport Survey and has included rehabilitation funds in the
Infrastructure Program (Table 2), it is still reviewing specific proposals
for rehabilitation of the PNR.
(d) Ports and ShippS n8
2.11      For both foreign trade and domestic transport, ports and shipping
have been important to the economy. There are now about 80 national and
390 municipal ports, as well as numerous private piers and wharves. Although
most ports are well located and naturally sheltered, many require continuous



-4-
dredging and lack adequate sheds and cargo handling equipment.  The Bank
is presently assisting the Government in defining the scope and consulting
services required for feasibility studies of four ports to whose improve-
ment the Government has given high priority based on the Transport Survey.
These studies are expected to be financed by the UND? and will be the basis
of a subsequent project to be submitted to the Bank for consideration.
2.12      Ports in the Philippines are run by both the national and municipal
governments. National ports are operated by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) in
the Ministry of Finance; design, construction, maintenance, and dredging,
on the other hand, are the responsibility of the Bureau of Public Works
(BPW) in the Department of Public Works and Communications (DPWC). Coordi-
nation has been inadequate between BOC and BPW, and thus port works have
not always been related to needs; improvements are expected under proposed
Government reorganization plans (para. 2.17). Municipal ports are owned,
operated, and maintained by municipalities.
2.13      The Philippine merchant fleet totals about 1.2 million Gross
Register Tons (GRT), including about 0.7 million GRT of ocean-going vessels
and 0.3 million GRT of inter-island vessels. Also many small craft carry
local traffic. Inter-island shipping, particularly passenger transport,
has increased in recent years, and this service is adequate except to
some smaller outlying islands.
(e) Aviation
2.14      Manila, the only international airport in the Philippines, is
served by a number of the world's major airlines, as well as the Philippine
Air Lines (PAL), which operateh both internationally and within the coun-
try. An extensive network of domestic airports is served by three domestic
carriers.  In addition, ten air taxi operators serve outlying areas with
small traffic volumes. Domestic passenger transport has been increasing
rapidly (about 17Z p.a.), with PAL, which the Government partly owns, carry-
ing about three-quarters of the traffic.  Air freight is still insignificant.
2.15      The Transport Survey concluded that airport infrastructure has
not kept pace with increased traffic and that a pressing need exists for
better runways, navigational aids, and terminal facilities. It recommeaded
revision of the existing tariff policy because airlines are losing money
on domestic traffic. The Government has accepted the Transport Survey's
recommendations. It has allocated funds in the Infrastructure Program
for the suggested improvements, and is considering requests from the air-
lines for increased domestic air fares. The United States Federal Aviation
Administration will assist the Philippines in preparing development plans
for local airports.
C. Transport Planninu and Coordination
2.16      Immediate economic and social problems, resulting from a large
and rapidly expanding population with consequent high uneamployment, have
in the past received overriding attention, while long range problems such



-5
as transport coordinati3n and planning have been handled inadequately on
a piece-meal basis. In the present administrative framework, coordina-
tion has been difficult as responsibilities have been diffused between a
large number of offices and agencies. Responsibility for design, construc-
tion, and maintenance relating to ports, highways, and aviation lies with
the DPWC, in which the Land Transport Commission, BPW, BPH, and Civil
Aviation Administration are subordinate agencies. The railways are ac-
countable to the Office of Economic Coordination, while the Civil Aviation
Board (CAB) and the Bureau for Maritime Affairs report to the Department
of Commerce and Industry. Road transport regulations with respect to op-
erating permits, route allocations, and rates are the responsibility of
the Public Service Commission. The CAB performs this function for air-
lines, but scheduled domestic airline franchises are awarded by Congress.
Railway rates are supervised perfunctorily by the Office of Economic Co-
ordination.
2.17      The Transport Survey and the Commission on Reorganization gen-
erally reached the same conclusions about the transport situation. Both
cited the confusion in transportation planning and coordination, and con-
cluded that all transportation matters should be brought under the DPWC's
authority and that the DPWC itself should be reorganized and strengthened.
The Commission's proposals for overall Government reorganization are due
to be presented by the President to Congress in May 1971; the proposals
will be presented as a package, to be either accepted or rejected by Con-
gress. If accepted, the proposals would be implemented during 1971-73.
During the loan negotiations, the Bank discussed with the Government
representatives these proposals insofar as they affect transportation.
The proposals incorporate a number of the Bank's comments and suggestions
made during and subsequent to appraisal and, if accepted and implemented,
would result in some operational improvements in the transport sector.
There ia, however, some uncertainty on how effective and efficient the
proposed new DPWC organization will be in transport planning and coordina-
tion and this is a matter which will be reviewed and discussed further
with the Government during thie execution of this project. Assurances
were obtained during loan negotiations that the Government will furnish
the Bank a copy of the final proposals as submitted to Congress and will
keep the Bank informed of the progress of the Bill and any subsequent
implementation. For additional assurances regarding BPH reorganization
see para. 3.09.
III. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. Highwy Network
3.01      The main highway network extends from north to south over the
four islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao (Map). The principal
artery of the country is the 2,000 km long Pan-Philippine Highway, which
extends from Aparri in North Luzoni to Davao in southern Mindanao. The



- 6 -
two major inter-island crossings on this highway are served by ferries.
Minor highway networks exist on some of the other 7,000 islands, but
they are small in relation to the main network.
3.02      The existing network consists of about 64,000 km, of which about
13,000 km are paved. The system is divided into five classes: express-
way, primary, secondary, municipal, and feeder (Table 3). Expressways,
primary roads, and about one-third of the secondary roads comprise the
national system under the authority of the central Government. Provin-
cial or city governments are responsible for the remainder of the second-
ary roads, with municipal authorities looking after municipal and some
feeder roads. Many feeder roads, constructed under political pressure,
are without an authority responsible for their maintenance. The ratio
of 1 km of road to 600 people in the Philippines is better than that of
similar insular countries (the ratio for Indonesia being 1 km to 1,400
people), but most roads are badly aligLned and in poor condition.
3.03      While the Government has been aware of deficiencies in the highi-
way network, it has been hampered by lack of planning and a critical short-
age of funds. However, from FY 1971-1975, it intends to improve about
13,000 km of the network, including 1,300 km of the Pan-Philippine High-
way which will be constructed with Japanese assistance (primarily equip-
ment). Inter-island vehicular ferry services will also be improved.
B. Highway Traffic
3.04      The motor vehicle fleet at the end of 1969 was about 447,000
units as compared with 199,000 in 1962, reflecting an average increase
of 12% p.a. (Table 4). Of the total, about 80% are registered in Luzon
(about half of which are in greater Manila), 10% in Nlindanao, and 10% in
the other islands. Gasoline consumption for the same period increased by
about 10% p.a. (Table 5). There are about 110 inhabitants per vehicle
(compared to about 300 in Korea, 120 in Thailand, anid 50 in ilalaysia).
3.05      Trucking is carried out on an own-account basis (about 90%) and
by general haulers (about 10%). Although there are no restrictions on
entry into road haulage, the trucking rates which have been set by law
are low and discourage the growth of the general haulers. Wider general
trucking operations would be encouraged by the improvement of the road
network and by greater flexibility in trucking rates. The latter could
follow the review of transport policies which would be made after re-
organization proposals have passed into law.
3.06      Traffic counts have recently been carried out on all primary and
secondary highways through a system of control and coverage stations. At
control stations, about 200 km apart, traffic counts are taken 68 times a
year and at coverage stations, about 20 km apart, twice a year. Although a
significant amount of traffic information is consaquently available, it is
not yet fully used for highway planning and maintanance programming. During
loan negotiations, assurances were obtained that traffic counts would be
continued and that the processing and retrieval of traffic data would be
improved.



- 7 -
3.07      Motor vehicle reFulations are generally satisfactory.  The legal
vehicular load is 8,000 kg on a single axle and 14,500 kg on tandem axles.
Patrols of the Land Transport Commission and the national and local police
are responsible for enforcing regulations. As there are no permanent weigh-
ing stations and this commission owns only a few portable units, overload-
ing is widespread. Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that
effective axle load control measures would be introduced and enforced.
C. Highway Administration
3.08      The Bureau of Public Highways (BP3) is responsible for the national
road network. This Bureau, which is part of the Department of Public Works
and Communications (DPWC), is headed by a Commissioner (a political appointee)
and administered by a Deputy Commissioner and a Chief Engineer. Proliferation
of technical and administrative divisions abounds at headquarters (Chart) and
considerable overstaffing exists both at headquarters and in the field.
Though there has been only a minor increase in the road network, the number
of districts has doubled from 54 to 110 since 1954.  These new districts
appear to have been created to coincide with local political spheres of
influence. Consequently, improvement programs are fragmented, overhead
costs have increased, and financial control has suffered. Field operations,
carried out by district engineers, are not effectively controlled by BPH
headquarters in 'Manila due to the remoteness of the areas served and the
poor communications.
3.09      Certain proposals by the Commission on Reorganization for improve-
ments in the BPH do not require legLslative action. These will be imple-
mented under this project, together with other measures proposed by the Bank
to improve BPH operations.  Basically, tthese interinm measuires (detailed in
tihe Annex) are:  reductioni of utaff, "pparaLion or admLnimtrative a3nd- tuch-
nical fucticLonn, dLvIsioni of constructLoLl anid mainiteanace reaponsibiliLies,
and revitalization of regional office functionss.  During negotiations the
Government confirmed that these measures were corisistent witlh the Commisq-
sion's overall proposal.s.  Also during negotlatlons, the Governlment gave
Assurances tlhnt it would implemenit thtese interim measures with the asist-
ance of consultants over a period of two years.
D. Highway Planning and Fin ancing
3.10      Highway planning begins at the local level with requests from
mayors and other officials. District engineers draw up preliminary plans
and cost estimates wiich are then checked and consolidated by BPH head-
quarters. The overall program is next reviewed by the National Economic
Council and then by the Presidential Economic Staff and the Budget Commis-
sion. The resulting program is the Five-Year Infrastructure Program. An-
nual budget requests based on this Program are presented to Congress for
approval.
3.11      Most road works have involved short sections on existing pre-
World War II alignments and little economic planning or analysis has
been undertaken. The Government has now adopted the investment program



suggested in the Transport Survey as the basis for its Five-Year Infrastruc-
ture Program. Feasibility studies and detailed engineering will precede
construction of major projects, although political considerations may con-
tinue to influence selection of smaller works.
3.12      Funds for highway construction, maintenance, and a. -inistration
now come mainly from the Highway Special Fund (HSF), which w2s set up by
legislation in 1953 (Table 6). HSF revenue is from motor fuel taxes and
vehicle registration fees; additional highway revenue comes from general
budget allocations and bond sales, making a total of P 400 million (about
US$65 million) available for highways in FY 1970 (Table 7). Over the next
few years, funds will also be available from the recently imposed Export
Tax, 25% of which will be used toward the local currency costs of inter-
nationally financed projects. By law, HSF funds are distributed 44.5%
each to maintenance and construction, with the riaaniniig 11% being allocat-
ed to administration and emergencies.  Of the maintenance allocation, about
one-third is distributed equally between provinces and cities; the remainder
is distributed on the basis of road length, population, and vehicle registra-
tion. Two toll roads exist, with the construction contractors collecting
tolls to pay for their construction and operation. In FY 1969, HSF's rev-
enue covered the cost of highway administration and maintenance, as well
as about 50% of construction costs. If non-earmarked customs duties on
motor vehicles were added, total road user revenue would roughly equal
highway expenditures.
3.13      The Government's previous Four-Year Highway Plan (FY 1967-1970)
called for a total expenditure of about P 1,000 million (about US$170
million equivalent) and this target was substantially achieved. The
currently proposed Five-Year Infrastructure Program requires expenditure
of about P 2,300 million (about US$370 million equivalent); of this, the
Government hopes to obtain about P 500 million of external financing.
The plan is ambitious and,some slippage may be expected into FY 1976.
E. Highway Design and Construction
3.14      At BPH headquarters, roads and bridges are designed by two
separate divisions: Hlighway Location and Design, and Bridge Design.
As most recent projects have been small, a large part of the design
work has been undertaken by Regional and District Offices and checked
by headquarters. Although design staff are able, their offices could
be better equipped and organized. These shortcomings will be reviewed
by the technical assistance team (para. 4.08). Field Offices base
their design on guidelines prepared by BPH headquarters. Highway and
bridge design standards are generally satisfactory. Although SAUTI
(para. 1.02) is now the only foreign consultant employed by the BPH, some
major bridge projects have been bid on a design and construct basis with
overseas consultants employed by the bidders.
3.15      Until recently, highway construction was uadertaken by both force
account (two-thirds) and contract (one-third), with the headquarters Con-
struction Division acting as a clearing house and coordinating agency for



- 9 -
district and regional proposals. To maintain better control of funds and
to promote the local contracting industry, the Government recently put a
P 75,000 (about US$12,500 equivalent) ceiling on individual force account
projects. This is expected to reduce considerably the amount of force
account work.
3.16      Government contracts are awarded on a competitive basis with par-
ticipation normally limited to local firms. In November 1970, a new law
(Republic Act 6142) was enacted allowing the President to waive existing
laws which prohibit bidding by foreign firms for works partially financed
from external sources. International competitive bidding procedures can
therefore be employed for such works.
3.17      Recently awarded road contracts for sections of the Pan-Philippine
Highway have greatly increased the amount of work being undertaken by the
domestic road contracting industry. A few major contractors (some working
with United States firms) have already gained roadworks experience both on
United States military base projects and on smaller Government and city
works. Domestic road contractors readily form joint ventures to com?ete
for larger works.
F. Highway Maintenance
3.18      Road maintenance is poor, with routine maintenance almost non-
existent and periodic maintenance confined to reconstruction of small,
isolated sections of pavement. At any time, therefore, the network con-
sists of only short sections of new pavement interspersed with rapidly
deteriorating longer stretches.
3.19      Road maintenance is the responsibility of district and city
engineers, and their work should be inspected by the Maintenance Divisions
at Bureau headquarters and at regional level. In fact, this inspection
does not occur. Consequently, the district engineers' tendency to favor
minor improvement works prevails at the expense of essential routine main-
tenance. Similarly, failure to allocate equipment specifically for main-
tenance has contributed to further deterioration of the road network.
3.20      Road maintenance programming is non-existent; district main-
tenance allocations are at the discretion of the district engineer.
Maintenance funds (averaging about US$500/km p.a., excluding equipment
depreciation) appear at first sight to be adequate, but chronic over-
staffing and diversion of funds to improvements have left little for
routine maintenance. Furthermore, a sizeable portion of both maintenance
and construction funds is spent on emergency work, particularly typhoon
damage (14 occurrences from 1968 to date).
3.21      The Government is aware that road maintenance must be improved
and that reorganization of the BPH is an essential step.  Technical as-
sistance to help with reorganization and to assist BPH staff in improving
road maintenance methods (para. 4.08) is provided under this project.
Preliminary recommendations by the technical assistance team are expected



- 10 -
to be available six months after work begins. During loan negotiations,
assurances were obtained that on the basis of the above recommendations
the Government would: (a) formulate a program satisfactory to the Bank
for provision of adequate maintenance funds for the road network; and (b)
take the necessary steps thereafter to improve road maintenance operations
in accordance with the agreed program.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   General
4.01      The project consists of the following:
(a) construction and improvement of the 160 km Cotabato-
Digos Road;
(b)  consulting services to BPH for detailed engineering
(the 160 km project road, 765 km of Japanese-financed
Pan-Philippine Highway, and about 700 km resulting from
(c) below) and construction supervision of (a) above;
(c) feasibility studies of about 1,000 km of roads; and
(d) technical assistance to the BPH for administrative and
operational improvements.
The Government has asked the Bank to finance the foreign exchange costs of
items (a) and (b) above and has requested financial assistance from the
UNDP for items tc) and (d) above.
B.   Construction and Improvement
4.02      The 160 km road to be constructed and improved runs from Cotabato
on the west coast of Mindanao to Digos on the east coast. Improvement of
this road was given high priority in the Transport Survey (para. 1.02) and
was confirmed in a detailed feasibility study.
4.03      Short stretches of the present road, totalling 50 km, have been
paved recently, but the remainder is poorly aligned with unsurfaced stretches
which are virtually impassable in the monsoon season. Under the project,
these unimproved sections will be upgraded and paved to two-lane standard
(Table 8); the proposed design standards are acceptable to the Bank. In
addition, shoulder construction and minor drainage works will be carried
out where necessary on the recently paved sections.

C.   Consulting Services for Detailed Engineering and Construction
Supervision
(a) Current Detailed Engineering
4.04      The Government in 1969 retained the services of SAUTI to under-
take the detailed engineering of the Cotabato-Digos project road, as well
as that of the Lucena-Legaspi and Cabanatuan-Tuguegurao Roads on Luzon,
totaling about 925 km (Map). The contract arrangements were satisfactory
and the Bank agreed to consider the inclusion of the foreign exchange costs
of these services (about US$750,000) in the proposed loan for retroactive
financing. The Government indicated that construction of the latter two
roads would be part of the proposed Bank project, but subsequently informed
the Bank that these roads would be constructed under bilateral assistance
from Japan. Design work commenced in February 1970 and was completed by
the end of that year. Maximum use of BPH staff was made in the work.
(b) Construction Supervision
4.05      SAUTI will also undertake construction supervision of the
Cotabato-Digos Road. BPH staff will again fill as many appropriate posts
as possible in the consultants' supervision organization. This arrange-
ment is satisfactory and the staffing arrangements were agreed during
negotiations.
(c) Further Detailed Engineering
4.06      It is expected that the feasibility studies (para 4.07) will
identify about 700 km of high priority roads, for which detailed engineer-
ing would be justified and which could be the basis of further Bank lending
for highway construction. Detailed engineering by a firm of consultants,
therefore, is included under this project.
D.   Feasibility Studies
4.07      Feasibility studies under the project will cover about 1,000 km
of existing primary and secondary roads on Luzon (Table 9 and Map), as
recommended in the Transport Survey. These studies will be undertaken by
a firm of consultants, and will include comprehensive economic evaluations
and identification of alternative solutions for improving the roads, to-
gether with plans for implementation of the optimum solutions. The Govern-
ment has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance similar studies
for roads in Samar and Mindanao, and close liaison will be kept with ADB.
E.   Technical Assistance to BPH
4.08      The Government wants to improve BPH operations and has agreed
that technical assistance be included in the project for this purpose.
The assistance will be provided by about 11 experts (including a transport
economist) from a consulting firm. During a two-year period, the team will



- 12 -
review and assist in implementing the interim BPH reorganization, as dis-
cussed in the Annex, and will advise on Overall road maint6iance, workshop
operations, and road planning.  Training  t otocal staff will be provided
both at headquarters and in the field. The team will test revised main-
tenance techniques in a selected number of pilot distrtits for subsequent
implementation on a country-wide basis. Duritig loan negotiations, techni-
cal assistance details rere agreed and an assurance was obtained that,
prior to completion of the team's two-year assignment and in consultation
with the Bank, the Government would review thle progress And aAsess the need
for further technical assistance.

structed with Japanese bilateral assistance.
/b   Cost of completed detailed engineering for the 925 km was lower than
normal as most of the field survey and soils exploration work was
completed by BPH staff prior to commencement of consultants' assign-
ment.



- 14 -
4.10      SAUTI has made cost estimates for road construction and improve-
ments based on the quantities derived from detailed engineering and the
local costs of labor, equipment operation, materials and overheads, as well
as comparable costs for work elsewhere. Feasibility study cost estimates
are based on those of similar studies in the Philippines and other coun-
tries. Cost estimates for detailed engineering are taken from the contract
between the Government and SAUTI. Construction supervision estimates are
based on a schedule of staffing requirements and SAUTI's man-month rates
(para. 4.05). Estimates of costs for further detailed engineering, result-
ing from the feasibility studies, and the costs for technical assistance,
are based on comparable assignments elsewhere in Southeast Asia. A 10l
contingency allowance for quantity overruns is believed to be adequate for
construction and consulting services. The 11% price contingency for con-
struction is based on 5% p.a. increase in the foreign component and 6% p.a.
increase in the local component from the date of cost estimates (December
1970) to completion of construction (about mid-1974). During loan nego-
tiations, final cost estimates were agreed.
4.11      Foreign exchange components of the various items are determined
by different factors. For road construction, if all work were done by foreign
contractors the foreign exchange component would be 60% (US$3,6 million equi-
valent); if all work were undertaken by local contractors the foreign ex-
change component would be 44% (US$2.6 million equivalent). However, most
local firms interested in the project have indicated their intention to
form joint ventures with foreign firms (a 50-50 joint venture would result
in a foreign exchange component of 52%). On the basis that contracts will
be won by joint ventures or a foreign firm (also likely to employ local
sub-contractors) a 55% foreign exchange component Las been used in the
cost estimates. These foreign exchange estimates were made by SAUTI and
are considered satisfactory. For feasibility studies, the foreign exchange
component is based on the cost of foreign experts' salaries and equipment.
The component of detailed engineering is lower than found in other coun-
tries due to maximum use of BPH staff (on Government salaries); while
construction supervision and technical assistance reflect the rel4tively
high input of foreign personnel with foreign exchange components of 65%
and 85% respectively.
G.  Project Financing and Execution
4.12      The proposed loan to the Government will finance the foreign ex-
change component of the construction and detailed engineering elements of
the project together with interest and other charges during construction,
with the feasibility studies and technical assistance to be financed by
the UNDP. 1/ Local cost financing will be made available through an Ex-
port Tax (para. 3.12) and no undue difficulties are expected.
1/   The Government has submitted an application to the UNDP for the fi-
nancing of these elements. UNDP management has indicated that the
necessary funds will be included in the progrEm to be submitted to
the Governing Council in June 1971.



- 15 -
4.13      The BPH will be responsible for executing the project, assisted
by qualified consultants under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank. During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Govern-
ment will promptly retain consultants for construction supervision and,
subsequently, for detailed engineering (para. 4.06).
4.14      To encourage the domestic contracting industry to bid for the
road works, the total contract will be advertised in two sections of about
equal value with contractors bidding for one or both sections. Contracts
will be based on unit prices. The Government has requested and the Bank
has agreed that contract documents require alternative bids for different
types of pavement construction using asphalt or cement concrete. Contracts
will be awarded on the basis of the lowest evaluated bids.
4.15      The Government has agreed to amend its present contract bidding
and award procedures in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines on Procure-
ment". Amendments permitting foreign firms to compete on an equal basis
for contracts of this nature are embodied in Republic Act 6142 which was
enacted in November 1970 (para. 3.16). Other major amendments, such as
bidding periods and bid evaluation necessary to ensure compliance with
bidding procedures satisfactory to the Bank have been made at Departmental
level.
4.16      The potential of the project construction for relieving unemploy-
ment in the Philippines has been considered. Total unemployment in the
country is currently estimated at about 8%, but the unemployed are found
primarily on the island of Luzon and in the larger urban areas (particu-
larly Mlanila). In Iindanao, where the project is located, there is no
serious unemployment problem and the population is principally engaged in
year-round farming of the rich agriculture land, particularly along the
project road (para. 5.03). The possibility of moving unemployed labor
1,200 km from the island of Luzon to Mindanao is impractical because of
ethnic differinces, the long arduous journey required, and a reluctance
on the part of the urban unemployed to move away from potential city op-
portunities. The construction of the project road using labor intensive
methods is therefore considered impractical.
4.17      Construction contracts will probably be awarded in the third
quarter of 1971, and the works should be completed towards the middle of
1974. Feasibility studies will cormmence mid-1971 with completion ex-
pected in the first quarter of 1972, to be followed by detailed engineer-
ing (para. 4.06). The technical assistance team would be retained from
mid-1971 until mid-1973. The timing of project execution was agreed
during loan negotiations.
R.   Disbursements
4.18      Disbursements from the loan account would be on the basis of 55%
of the cost of road construction; the actual foreign exchange cost of con-
sultants' services; and the actual loan interest and other charges during
construction. Surplus funds in the loan account on project completion will
b2 cancelled. The schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Table 10.

V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
5.01      The Philippines has traditionally provided for its highway improve-
ment needs on a short-term basis for small road sections rather than by long-
term, comprehensive planning of construction and maintenance for the entire
road network. Although this has resulted in a considerable amount of recent
improvement tworks, a logical plan for future development is essential. The
Government has accepted the priorities recommended by the Transport Survey
as a basis for future planning. Road works included in the current project
are given high priority in the Survey.
5.02      The objectives of the project are to:
(a) reduce transport costs on the most i.nportant primary
highway in Mlindanao;
(b) establish the technical and economic feasibility, and
provide the detailed engineering, of other roads
identified as being of high priority in the Transport
Survey; and
(c) imuprove the BPH organization and its operations,
particularly for road maintenance.
Benefits from feasibility studies and technical assistance to BPH, (b) and
(c) above, have not been quantified. Although no detailed economic eva-
luation was made of the two roads Lucena-Legaspi and Cabanatuan-Tuguegurao
as they will be constructed with bilateral assistance from Japan, they are
expected to yield an acceptable rate of return based on the findings of the
Transport Survey and the feasibility studies.
B.   Cotabato-Digos Road
5.03      The Cotabato-Digos Road is the only east-west link in central
Mindanao. It connects the two main cities and administrative centers,
Cotabato and Davao, and it serves an agricultural area including the main
corn and one of the main rice-producing regions in the Philippines. Future
agricultural growth potential in this area is among the highest in the
country. 1/
1/   Southwest Mindanao is one of the rice andC corn priority areas, accord-
ing to the National Food and Agriculture Council. It is expected to
benefit from the recently approved Bank financed Rice Processing Proj-
ect (Loan Na. 720-PH) and an ADB irrigatlon project.



- 17 -
5.04      Average daily traffic in 1968 on the Cotabato-Digos Road was
about 550 vehicles, of which about 65% were trucks and buses. Traffic
volumes were somewhat higher at the two ends than in the middle. Past
traffic growth information is limited and variations occur between counting
stations. However, based on available information, passenger car and jeep-
ney 1/ traffic recently grew by about 24% p.a. and 16% p.a., respectively,
with truck traffic growing by about 8% p.a. and bus traffic remaining more
or less constant. Table 11 shows present and expected traffic on sections
of the road. Forecasts are based on past traffic trends and on projections
by the UNDP consultants of the total production of goods and services and
of per capita income in the influence zones. The forecasts used for
passenger cars and buses are somewhat lower than those used by the UNDP
consultants for the feasibility study and assume that the traffic growth
rate will decline from about 11% p.a. through 1972 to about 6% by 1983.
Growth rates are considered reasonable.
5.05      Reduction in vehicle operating costs (VOC) due to improved run-
ning surfaces is the readily quantifiable benefit used in the economic
evaluation. Benefits from the project are, however, somewhat underestimated
because savings of passenger time and reduction in road maintenance costs
and accidents have not been considered.  Moreover, savings include only
the difference between present and expected operating cost levels and do
not take into account the future increases in operating costs that would
take place if the project is not carried out.
5.06      Conditions of terrain, cost, traffic, and other features are
generally consistent throughout the length of the road, and its justifi-
cation has, therefore, been evaluated as a single entity. Based on savings
in VOC (Table 12) and the estimated traffic growth over 20 years, the in-
vestment in the road would yield a rate of return of 18%. The sensitivity
of this result was tested on the basis of a plus or minus 10% change in
construction costs, 20% change in traffic growth rates, and 20% change
in VOC savings. This resulted in a range of 11-25% as the minimum and
maximum possible returns. Returns on the various combinations are given
in Table 13. The project is, therefore, justified.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During loan negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Gov-
ernment that it would:
(a)  implement the interim BPH reorganization measures with
the assistance of consultants over a period of two years
in accordance with the Annex (para. 3.09);
1/ Jeep-type vehicles converted for fare-paying passengers and widely
used for short distance travel in the Philippines.



- 18 -
(b) with the assistance of consultants, formulate a program
satisfactory to the Bank to provide adequate maintenance
funds for the road network within one year of the date
of the Loan Agreement and take necessary steps thereafter
to improve road maintenance operations in accordance with
the agreed program (para. 3.21); and
(c) review the progress and assess the need for further tech-
nical assistance, in consultation with the Bank, prior to
completion of the two-year assignment of the technical
assistance team (para. 4.08).
6.02      The project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$8.0 million equivalent with a term of 24 years including a four-year
grace period.

HIGHWAY PROJECT
Interim Measures for Reorganization of the
Bureau of Public Highways
Introduction
In connection with the proposed highway project, certain interim
measures to improve the efficiency and operations of the BPH are to be
undertaken; these do not require legislation for implementation. The mea-
sures are consistent with the Commission on Reorganization's proposals for
all Government Departments, particularly with those for the DPWC and its
sub-agencies (including BPH). Implementation of the measures will require
outside technical assistance, which is part of the proposed highway project.
Headquarters Organization,_(Page 4)
(a) Establish the Post of Chief Administrator: To separate
clearly technical and administrative functions, the Administrator should be
responsible for all administrative divisions within the BPE. He should be
on the same level as the Chief Engineer and should report directly to the
Deputy Commissioner or the Commissioner.
(b) Detach Internal Audit and Legal Services: These should
become staff offices reporting directly to the Deputy Commissioner or
Commissioner and should not continue to operate as two of many administra-
tive and technical divisions.
(c) Reduce the Present Number of Administrative Divisions: The
present six administrative divisions should be consolidated into two or
three divisions with the following functions:
(i) Administrative;
(ii) Accounting and Finance; and
(iii) Personnel.
(d) Reduce the Present Number of Technical Divisions: The
present nine technical divisions should be consolidated into six with the
following functions:
(i) Programming and Planning;
(ii)  Design;
(iii) Construction;
(iv)  Maintenance;
(v) Materials and Research; and
(vi)  Equipment and Workshops.



ANNEX
Page 2
Field Ormanization
(a)  nReorgaize Regional Offices:  These offices (presently
named divisions) should have six sections:
(i)  Administration;
(ii) Design;
(iii) Construction;
(iv) Maintenance;
(v)  Materials; and
(vi) Equipment and Workshops.
Thes,e sectioas should be staffed and equipped to cater to expected workload
in different regions. In this respect, design activities should be con-
centrated At regional level and not within districts, as at present. To
allow Regional Offices to function efficiently, their authority and respon-
sibility should be extended to the maximum presently allowed (Administrative
Order No. 2, 1954).
(b) Establish Regional Workshops: Only four of seven regional
workshops in the ten BPH regions are not operative.  Workshops should be
established in each region with staff and facilities commensurate with
expected regional workload.
(a) Refrain from Creating New Highway Districts: The Commission
proposes to rcduce the number of districts from 110 to equal the number of
provinces (68); however, as this requires legislation, the Government first
should refrain from creating new districts.
(d) Separate Highwa Construction and Miaintenance Functions
within the Districts: Because construction (including betterments and
rehabilitation) has in the past been carried out at the expense of main-
tenance, these two activities should be separated at district level. Sec-
tions should be created for each and equipment permanently assigned for
maintenance.
(a) Establish District Workshops: These will carry out normal
servicing of equipment, together with minor repairs. M4ajor repairs will
be made at reglonal level.
(f)  Introduce Highway Mlaintenance Planning:  Planning of all
maintenance activities should be undertaken, based upon expected traffic
volumes, surface type, etc. This skftld be underzaken at all levels
(headquarters, regional and distriat) and should form the basis for future
allocation of funds. Maintenance tedhniques also should be reviewed and,
where possible, improved.

(g) Define Lines of Command: Present procedures neither en-
courage efficient field operations, nor clearly define authority and re-
sponsibility, and it is necessary to establish clear lines of command from
specialist divisions at headquarters through the appropriate regional sec-
tions to the district level.
(h)  Reduce Staff and Improve Staff Training Facilities:  Refrain
from engaging additional head office staff except specialists required to
implement the interim measures; generally staff should be reduced to equate
with actual requirements. In the field, positions should be reduced to a
minimum. Institute at regional level training facilities for district
staff, including instruction (both theory and practice) to supervisors,
foremen, and artisans.
Timiing and Execution
It is proposed t[hat the above measures will be implemented with
the assistance of a technical assistance team. The team's assignment will
be in the following two phases:
(a) Phase 1 (5 men for 6 months):
(i) review the Commission on Reorganization's latest pro-
posals for the BPR and also the BPH's own recommenda-
tions;
(ii) prepare a program. for the reduction and merging of
the administrative and teclhnical divisions;
(iii)  review the requirements of individual Regional Offices
and prepare a program for setting up (or reducing) the
internal sections;
(iv) estimate the equipment workshop needs for each region
and the necessary facilities to be provided; and
(v) review, similarly, the overall highway maintenance
needs of the country and prepare a plan for estimating
district needs and implementing the proposed improve-
ments in operations.
(b)  Phase 2 (11 men for 18 months):  This phase will consist of
implementation of the program prepared with the assistance of the Phase 1
team.  Emphasis will be placed on improving organizational procedures and
operations at field level and it is expected that three districts will be
chosen for pilot schemes.
