                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A restructuring paper and an amendment to the loan has been approved by the Country Director on December 17, 2010. The modifications encompassed (i) transfer of the Project
                         implementation responsibility to a new agency; (ii) redefinition of the Project description to reflect the removal of some activities; (iii) modification of the results indicators to reflect the
                         changed activities; (iv) reallocation of loan proceeds between categories and change in the percentage of eligible expenditures to be financed; (v) addition of "Pregão Eletrônico" to
                         the applicable procurement methods; and (vi) extension of the implementation schedule for selected counterpart-funded activities, which calls for an extension of the schedule for
                         preparation of the Project's Implementation Completion Report (ICR).

                         A request for an extension of closing date until December 31, 2011 has been received by the Bank. The Bank will wait for the Guarantor's approval to evaluate it.
