MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATI1NAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE ERTAN HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the People's Republic of China to help finance the Ertan Hydroelectric Protect
is submitted for approval. The loan for $380 million would have a term of 20
years, including nine years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate.
2.        Background.  The shortage of electricity has become a major con-
straint to China's economic growth and improving the living standards of the
population. For example, in the project's area, customer demand exceeds the
available electricity supply by about 20 percent, and this shortage is likely
to continue until the end of this decade. The Government of China (GOC) has
given high priority to electric power and its strategy is to accelerate the
pace of hydropower development, construct large-scale and high efficiency
coal-fired thermal power plants, interconnect power systems through extens4on
of transmission networks, and replace obsolete generating plante. These -sea-
sures will improve energy efficiency and conservation. Moreover, the conser-
vation effect, fuel diversification and better scale of plants (which can
support more effective combustion controls) will all alleviate the environmen-
tal impact of electric power growth.
3.        To strengthen the institutions in the power industry, GOC has initi-
ated a number of actions to introduce modern energy technologies and methods,
increase the autonomy of power supply entities, and rationalize power pricing
policy. Particularly, GOC's 'new plant, new price, policy guarantees debt
servicing for power investments with the result that by mid-1990s the average
price of electricity will exceec thb long-run marginal cost of power genera-
tion. In the meantime, the problems associated with the existing dual price
system (state allocation prices and free market prices) and the antiquated
structure of tariffs, which do not always reflect the differences in cost of
service due to time of use and distribution at various voltage levels, would
be eliminated. Under a number of previous Bank projects and with the assis-
tance of Bank staff, the Chinese have done considerable work to evaluate the
economic costs of electric power with a view to refining the ongoing reform of
the overall tariff level and structure.
4.        Rationale for Bank's Involvement.  The Bank's strategy in the energy
sector, and specifically the electric power subsector, is to support national
energy development and technology transfer, energy efficiency and conserva-
tion, and improved environmental management. Through both project and sector
work, the Bank seeks to encourage policies which provide appropriate incen-
tives for sustainable energy development and efficiency of use. The Bank also
seeks to promote modern management, and greater enterprise autonomy and
accountability.
5.        The Bank is already closely associated with the formulation of the
Five-Year Plan for the power subsector in Sichuan Province through work under



-2-
the Planning Support and Special Studies Project (Credit 1835-CHA), which will
be completed in September 1991. Bank participation in the large and complex
Ertdn Hydroelectric Project, with a number of unique technical features, will
particularly contribute to the optimal development and use of hydropower
resources in China; it also will support needed fuel diversification and the
related reduction of atmospheric pollution. The project will encourage devel-
opment of an efficient power system and modern utility management; it will
contribute to the introduction of state-of-the art power system planning,
transfer of modern technologies and application of advanced construction meth-
ods, and extension of technical assistance and staff trainl.ng.
6.        Institution building will be another major objective for Bank's
participation in this project as the beneficiary, Ertan Hydroelectric Develop-
ment Corporation (EHDC), needs assistance in setting up its organization and
developing operational/financial capabilities. The Bank has been instrumental
in directing the Government's attention to the need for a sound capital struc-
ture of EHDC, a newly created entity specialized in development of hydroelec-
tric resources. The Bank's support also has impacts beyond the project
itself, such as the promotion of economic power pricing in Sichuan. An action
plan for power pricing in Sichuan will be implemented under the project. This
plan also includes for the first time in China the formulation of specific
power tariffs in a system with a predominance of hydroelectric generation.
The Bank's contribution, during project preparation and design, included sup-
port for a Special Board of Consultants (SBC), comprising international
experts, and technical advice on reducing project cost and construction lead
time.
7.        Proiect Obiectives.  The main objectives of the proposed project are
tos (i) provide additional generation capacity to the power system in Sichuan
Province (3,300 HW and 17 Thh a year) to eliminate acute power shortages in an
environmentally and economically sound manner; (ii) assist in transferring
modern technologies and in introducing efficient dam construction methods to
reduce the prevailing long gestation periods of hydropower projects;
(iii) contribute to further improvements in the analysis of environmental and
ecological impacts of hydroelectric resource development; (iv) enhance insti-
tutional development of EHDC by strengthening its organization through modern
management training and introducing principles of economic efficiency and
pricing; and (v) provide technical assistance in project design and implemen-
tation, and for the promotion of optimal operation of the power system, pru-
dent financial management, and manpower development.
8.        Project Description.  The proposed project would include#  fi) pre-
paratory works; (ii) construction of a parabolic, double-curvature aLAn dam
(240 m high) across the Yalong river together with an underground powerhouse
complex, a log conveyance syscem, and appurtenant works and structures;
(iii) provision and installation of six 550-MW generating units and associated
equipment; (iv) resettlement of about 30,000 people; (v) development of an
environmental management program and science station; (vi) construction man-
agement and engineering services; (vii) studies of power pricing and optimiza-
tion of plant and reservoir operation, and preparation of future projects; and
(viii) strengthening EHDC's organization, technical assistance and staff
training, together with related equipment and accessories. The project feasi-
bility study and design reports were prepared by one of the most experienced
Chinese hydroelectric investigation and design institutes, Chengdu Hydro



-3-
Investigsation and Design Institute (CHIDI), in 1984. In addition to the
review and approval by the Chinese authorities, these documents were also
reviewed in 1986 by SBC, which confirmed that the design of the project met
the highest standards and was entirely satisfactory in its overall concept.
9.        A comprehensive eavironmental impact assessment and a detailed
resettlement program have been prepared by the Chinese in accordance with
long-standing GOC environmental procedures for hydro projects. They have been
reviewed by the Bank and consultants and were found fully satisfactory. Expe-
rienced foreign engineering consultants (financed under TCC) assisted in the
prequalification of contractors and the preparation of bidding documents for
main civil works. The prequalification and procurement of the main civil
works have been carried out in accordance with the Bank's procurement guide-
lines. Five out of six prequalified international joint ventures had submit-
ted their bids, which were opened in public on October 25, 1989. Bid evalua-
tion was carried out by EHDC and its consultants, and the signing of the
contracts with the lowest evaluated responsive bidders is expected to take
place in July 1991. A number of contracts for preparatory works have been
awarded following local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank.
These works are expected to be completed by September 1991, when the main
civil works contractors are scheduled to move to the project site.
10.       Proiect Cost and Financing.  The total cost of the project is esti-
mated at $1,885.5 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
$896.4 million (48 percent). Total financial requirements, including interest
during construction, amount to $2,487.1 million. GOC has requested Bank
financing of the proposed project in two phases as in the case of the Shuikou
Hydroelectric Project (Loan 2775-CHA). The proposed loan would help finance
the first phase of project construction (1991 to mid-1995). GOC has also
requested that the second phase of the project would be included in the Bank's
proposed pipeline of future projects. The phased financing approach for this
very large project, with nine-year implementation period, would avoid tying up
financial resources which could be used for other projects with more immediate
needs.  The overall project completion date would be September 30, 2000, but
the closing date of this proposed loan would be December 31, 1996. Retroac-
tive financing in an aggregate amount of $38 million would be provided under
the loan to cover payments made for expenditures incurred before the date of
loan, but after September 1, 1990. The US Exim Bar made a commitment in the
amount of $O million, and Norway offered a grant of $5 million equivalent, to
cofinance engineering services of the project. Even if the second Bank loan
fails to materialize, the Bank would assist EHDC in seeking financing for the
second phase of the project.
11.       The beneficiary would not have internal cash generation until after
commissioning the first generating units in 1998. The project circumstances
therefore justify the extension of the loan grace period from five years,
which is the standard period for China, to nine years and the substitution of
level repayments of principal for annuity payments. A detailed breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The amounts and methods
of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A time-
table of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations
in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps are also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8470-CRA, dated June 11, 1991, is
being distributed separately.

12.       Agreed Actions.  Assurances were obtained from GOC that it would:
(i) onlend the proceeds of the loan through Sichuan Province to ENDC on the
same terms as the Bank loant (ii) enable the Sichuan Electric Power Adminis-
tration (SCEPA) to enter into the contract with EHDC for the bulk sale of
project's output based on principles that would allow for EHDC's financial
viability and maximize the economic value of the energy output; (iii) make Jr
cause to be made arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for securing the com-
pletion of the transmission network connecting the project to the Sichuan
power system; (iv) carry out a resettlement program satisfactory to the Bank;
(v) provide the necessary equity to allow EHDC to achieve the agreed debtl
equity ratio; and (vi) provide the funding for any cost overruns under the
project.
13.       Assurances also were obtained from EHDC that it would:  (i) enter
into the sales contract with SCEPA not later than June 30, 1996 in accordance
with principles satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) maintain during the project
implementation period the project management unit with such responsibilities,
resources, and staff as shall be satisfactory to the Bank; (iii) employ SBC to
assist in resolving particular project problems and in verifying proposed
solutions and specific designs: (iv) employ prior to the contract award for
the main civil works consulta .s for construction management whose qualifica-
tions, experience, and terms and conditions of emplcyment shall be satisfac-
tory to the Bank; (v) regularly inspect project hydroworks and facilities,
including the dam, in accordance with sound engineiering practices; (vi) carry
out studies of power pricing and optimal power plant and reservoir operation
in accordance with the terms of reference and timing acceptable to the Bank;
(vii) implement managenent development and staff training programs in accor-
dance with the timetable agreed with the Bank; (v`ii) carry out an environmen-
tal management program satisfactory to the Bank; ix) take all measures,
including but not limited to tariff adjustment.   o ensure that its internal
cash generation is sufficient to maintain a se_ $inancing ratio of no less
than 20 percent in 1999, 25 percent in 2000, anu 35 percent thereafter;
(x) maintain a debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.3 times in 1999,
and no less than 1.5 timfes thereafter; and (xi) .:sintain a debt/equity ratio
of no more than 82/18 from 1991-97, 80/20 in 1998/99, and 70/30 thereafter.
14.       ProJect Benefits.  This very large project, based on renewable,
nonpolluting and cost effective hydropower, will greatly increase the generat-
ing capability of the Sichuan power system. Accordlng to the economic analy-
sis, the project is about 40 percent less costly than its best hydro/thermal
alternative in meeting future power demand. Use of hydropower instead of
thermal power would avoid burning some 10 million tons of raw coal a year, the
mining and utilization of which would have severe adverse impact on the envi-
ronment.   The development of the project will also enhance industrial and
agricultural production in its nearby undeveloped areas. Furthermore, the
project will address the subsector's institutional development, system opera-
tions, and management and staffing. The internal economic rate of return,
based on the covenanted tariff, is estimated at 15 percent. However, if this
rate of return is based on the willingness to pay, it would increase to
18 percent.
15.       Risks.  Constructioi risks are within reasonable limits and should
be manageable with the continuous supervision arrangements, involving foreign
and Chinese consultants. Consultants are already involved in reviewing possi-



-5-
ble physical risks and proposing means ar.d procedures for their avoidance and
mitigation. To minimize potential risks associated with implementation of the
resettlement program, assurances were obtained from the Government to ensure
the availability of sufficient funds and to establish and maintain effective
resettlement management during implementation. No major environmental prob-
lems are expected under this project and the implementation of the proposed
environmental management program (including a monitoring process) should
enhance the environmental quality in the project area.
16.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

(a)  As credits are denomiated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the SDR.
In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater than the
original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
(b) Credit fully disbursed.
(c) Not yet effective.
