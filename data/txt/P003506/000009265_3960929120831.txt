STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Loan and Project Summary
Borro-wer:             People's Republic of China
Beneficiaryt           Ertan Hydroelectric Development Corporation (EHDC)
Amount:                $380.0 million
Terms:                 20 years, including a nine-year grace period, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate. The proceeds
of the loan would be onlent from the Government through
Sichuan Province to EHDC under subsidiary loan agree-
ments with a 20-year term, including nine years grace
and the standard variable interest rate for Bank loans.
The foreign exchange risk and commitment charges would
be .,orne by EHDC.
Project Objectives:   The main objectives of the project are tot  (i) provide
additional generation capacity to the power system in
Sichuan Province (3,300 HW and 17 TWh a year) in order
to alleviate an acute shortage of electricity;
(ii) assist in the transfer of modern power technology
and in the introduction of efficient dam construction
methods to reduce the prevailing long gestation periods
of hydropower projects; (iii) contribute to further
improvements in the analysis of environmental and eco-
logical impacts of hydroelectric resource development;
(iv) enhance the institutional development of EHDC by
strengthening its organization through a modern manage-
ment training program and introducing principles of
economic efficiency and pricing; and (v) provide tech-
nical assistance in project design and implementation,
and for the promotion of the optimal operation of the
power system, prudent financial management, and man-
power development.
Project Description:  The proposed project would include:  (i) preparatory
works; (ii) construction of a parabolic, double-curva-
ture arch dam (240 m high) across the Yalong River
together with an underground powerhouse complex, a log
conveyance system, and appurtenant works and struc-
tures; (iii) provision and installation of six 550-MW
generating units and associated equipment; (iv) reset-
tlement of about 30,000 people; (v) an environmental
management program and science station; (vi) consul-
tant's services for engineering, procurement, manage-
of thek offlWduties. ts contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World ank authotization.

ment of construction, and preparation of future power
projects; (vii) studies of power pricing and power
plant and reservoir operation; and (viii) strengthening
EIKDC's organization, technical assistance and staff
training, together with related equipment and accesso-
ries.
Benefits:              This very large project, based on renewable and nonpol-
luting cost-effective hydropower, would greatly
increase the generating capability of the Sichuan power
system. According to economic analyses, the project is
40 percent less expensive than its best hydrolthermal
alternatives in meeting future power demand. The
development of :he project also would enhance indus-
trial and agricultural production in nearby undeveloped
areas. The project would help to improve the subsec-
tor's institutional development, system operations, and
management and staffing. Purthermore, the project will
avoid mining, transporting, and burning of some ten
million tons of raw coal a year in Sichuan Province
vhich has the highest atmospheric pollution in China.
The internal economic rate of return based on the cove-
nanted tariff is about 15 percent. However, if based
on the willingness to pay, this return would increase
to 18 percent.
Risks:                 Construction risks are within reasonable limits and
would be manageable with the continuous supervision
arrangements by foreign and Chinese consultants who
have been retained for the construction phase. The
consultants are already involved in reviewing possible
physical risks and proposing means and procedures for
their avoidance and mitigation. To minimize potential
risks associated with the execution of the project and
its resettlement program, assurances were obtained from
the Government that it would ensure an adequate and
timely flow of funds, and establish and maintain effec-
tive project implementation management. No major envi-
ronmental problems are expected under this project and
the implementation of the proposed environmental man-
agement program (including a monitoting process) would
enhance the environmental quality in the project area.

ERTAN HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Overview
1.1       China has made remarkable progress in developing its energy
resources over the last four decades and became the third largest producer of
commercial energy in the world. In that period, the output of coal has
increased at an average annual rate of 9.1 percent, crude oil production at
19.3 percent, and electricity generation at 13.1 percent. In 1989, the coun-
try's primary commercial energy supply amounted to 710 million tons of oil
equivalent (toe). Coal is the most important source of commercial energy,
accounting for about 74 percent of the total. Oil accounts for 19 percent of
the total and provides about 7 percent of the country's export earnings.
Hydroelectric power (4.3 percent), natural gas (2 percent), and small quanti-
ties of shale oil and geothermal power make up the balance. Noncommercial
energy, equivalent to about one-third of commercial energy production, is very
important in rural China.
1.2       In 1989, China's final consumption of com*ercial energy was esti-
mated to be about 680 million toe. The largest consumer of commercial energy
is the industrial sector (62 percent), followed by households (24 percent),
services (9 percent), and agriculture (5 percent). About 20 percent of oil
and 2 percent of coal production currently are exported. Coal and its by-
products meet 70 percent of the fuel requirements for industry and power gen-
eration, provide 60 percent of the raw materials for chemicals, and satisfy
80 percent of the commercial energy needs of households.  The country also is
the third largest consumer of commercial energy =n the world. Still, energy
consumption per capita is low--about 0.6 toe, or one-third of the world aver-
age.
Energy Resources
1.3       Coal.  China has large coal deposits with recoverable reserves of
about 900 billion tons, of which 30 percent are proven. There are now twelve
provinces and autonomous regions with more than 10 billion tons of coal
reserves; Shanxi and Inner Mongolia each have reserves of over 200 billion
tons. In 1990, the country produced 1.1 billion tons of raw coal, of which it
exported only 16 million tons. By the year 2000, China aims to produce 1.4
billion tons of coal a year. While coal is produced in many provinces, the
amount and quality vary; for example, in Sichuan--where the proposed project
is located--much of the local coal has a very high sulphur content (para.
4.2). The best quality coals are found in North China, which is also the
region with the largest coal surplus. However, insufficient transport capa-
city makes it extremely difficult to move coal from mines in North China to
the large consuming centers in Southeast, Central, and East China. The safety
and environmental problems associated with coal mining and utilization also
are serious (paras. 1.17 and 1.19).



1.4       Hydzoelectric Potential.  China is rich in water resources and has a
long tradition of harnessing them for energy and other uses. The country's
hydroelettric potential is estimated at 1,900 TWh a yeair, but only about
9 percent of it has been developed. Most of the potential is located in four
major river basins in the Southwest (70 percent) and No-thwest (12 percent).
about 1.500 km away from the main demand centers. The long gestation perlod
for hydroelectric proiects also has inhibited the more rapid development and
utilization of hydroe!ectric resources.
1.5       Crude Oil.  China's ultimately recoverable reserves of crude oil
have been estimated at some 80 billion tons, of which 16 percent are proven.
The country produced 138 million tons of crude oil in 1990, and the target
output for the year 2000 is 230 million tons. In view of the natural decline
in production from existing aging fields, it seems unlii.sely that this produc-
tion target can be met. China's refining capacity is the sixth largest in the
world and allows it to produce a relatively high share of high and medium
distillates.
1.6       Natural Gas.  Chins's natural gas resources are estimated at 33 tri-
llion Mi, of which 2.6 percent are proven. About 50 percent of the gas pro-
duced is nonassociated gas. In 1990, China produced 15 billion cubic meters
of natural gas.   The target output for the year 2000 is 25 billion mi. Most
of the gas is used as feedstock for fertilizers and petrochemicals.
1.7       Biomass.  Firewood and crop stalks account for 57 percent of the 224
million toe of rural energy supplies. About 70 percent of all fuelwood is
used for cooking. Some areas of the country have been suffering from serious
deforestation, stemming primarily from fuelwood collection and land clearing
for various purposes.  The estimated offtake of fuelvood is 230 million tons
(91 Mtoe), or 2.6 times the sustainable amount. The Government is taking
various measures to address this problem, such as encouraging more efficient
use of wood, planting trees, improving management of natural forests and wood
lands, making greater use of charcoal, and substituting coal for wood. China
also produces many agricultural residues which are used as fuel.
1.8       Nuclear Rnergy.  Known uranium reserves in China are sufficient to
sustain 15,000 MS of nuclear power capacity for 30 years. In 1991, China
plans to commission Qinshan nuclear power plant (300 MM), located near
Shanghai. In 1992193, Daya Bay nuclear power plant (2x900 MW) should be com-
missioned; 70 percent of its output is intended for nearby Hong Kong. The
construction of a few additional plants is planned before the year 2000, pri-
marily in regions which lack coal and hydroelectric resources.
1.9       Other Energy Resources.  Other energy resources play a small role in
energy supply and are used mostly in remote areas. Geothermal energy has been
found in more than 3,000 locations covering nearly all provinces and autono-
mous regions. The Yangbajing geothermal power plant, located in Tibet, sup-
plies about 50 GWh a year, or about 20 percent of the electricity consumption
in Lhasa's power system. Although wind and solar energy have promising pros-
pects (e.g., wind in Inner Mongolia), they are not expected to affect the
overall supply of energy significantly during the next two decades. Unoffi-
cial estimates of oil shale suggest that deposits are large, but little is
exploited because of lack of technology.

Institutions of the Ener8g Sector
1.10      In 1988, the Ministry of Energy (MOE) was established to manage and
develop the energy sector. Its formation was intended to reduce the duplica-
tion and overlapping responsibilities of the former ministries in charge of
coal, petroleum, and nuclear power. MOE also was given responsibility for
electric power, formerly held by the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric
Power (tMWREP). The new ministry has primary responsibility for planning and
establishing policies and regulations to promote the rational development and
use of energy resources. Under MOE arc various companies and administrations
responsible for operations in individual energy industries. Chart 1 shows the
organization of MOE.
1.11      The State Energy Investment Corporation (SEIC) was established dur-
ing the same peri&od to handle project financing in the coal and electricity
industries. SEIC is responsible for onlending funds for projects of national
importance and representing the Government in the joint finanacing of projects
with other parties; it is expected to operate as a revenue earning entity.
Petroleum and nuclear power investments are covered under separate corpora-
tions. Both MOE and SEIC operate under the purview of the State Planning
C-ommission (SPC), which has ultimate authority for project approval, budget
allocations, and financing arrangements.
Energy Investments
1.12      Most investments in energy supply go to support projects with long
gestation periods. Energy investments for the 1980s were planned based on an
expected economic growth rate of 7.5 percent a year. Actual economic gzowth
rates exceeded this target by an average of 2.5 percent a year, (4.5 percent
in peak years). Also, indu-trial growth far exceeded what had been planned.
The discrepancy between projected and actual growth rates has exacerbated the
energy shortages that already existed at the start of the decade. China faces
an additional difficulty in developing its relatively abundant energy
resources, as many of the resources are located far from consumption areas and
must be transported over long distances at high cost. In recent years, the
Government has thus given priority to shifting resources into bottleneck sec-
tors such as energ} and transport.
1.13      In 1989, China dedicated 3.4 percent and 1.3 percent of its Gross
National Product (GNP), respectively, to develop infrastructure for energy
production and transportation. It invested a total of Y 44.6 billion ($12
billion) in energy supply, representing 29 percent of state capital construc-
tion. In the early 1980s, energy supply investments accounted for 21 percent
of state capital construction. The shares of power and petroleum investmente'
have increased since 1988 to 62 percent and 22 percent, respectively. State
coal investment has declined (to 16 percent) but this decline has been offset
by an increase in ii vestment by coal collectives. About 20 percent of the
investment requirements of the Chinese energy sector are met by foreign loans
and direct investments. Direct foreign investment has financed most offshore
petroleum exploration to date, although recent trends indicate a decline in
direct investment for this purpose. On the other hand, there has been an
increase in suppliers credit and bilateral lending for the petrochemical and
power industries.

B. Energy Sector Issues
1.14      In addition to the already noted energy shortages, the main energy
sector issues are: (i) the high energy intensity of the Chinese economy;
(ii) the dominance of coal use and associated environmental problemss
(iii) the need to improve scale and technology in energy industries; (iv) the
inadequacy of energy pricing policies; and (v) the weak investment funding
system.
Intensity of Energy Use
1.15      In 1980, China's co.ssumption of commercial energy was estimated at
1.5 toe per $1,000 of GNP. That high a level of energy intensity was due to
the emphasis placed on heavy industry, the small sca'e of industrial units,
and the raw materials and technologies employed. In the late 19709, the Gov-
ernment began to address the inefficiencies in the economy by instituting
regulations on energy use, establishing conservation centers to provide tech-
nical assistance, and allocating a larger share of investment funds for indus-
trial modernization, particularly for projects which contributed to energy
conservation. The elasticity of energy consumption with respect to GNP
growth, which averaged 1.74 from 1952 to 1977, was reduced to 0.5 in the
1980s. In 1989, the country's energy intensity was 1.1 toe, a 27 percent
reduction from the 1980 level. It is estimated that technical and operational
improvements and the closure of some inefficient small-scale plants are
responr M1e for about 70 percent of the energy savings, and the shift in the
output mix of the economy for the other 30 percent. The efficiency gains have
been evenly spread over heavy and light industry. Despite these improvements,
China's energy intensity is still high. A target of the Eighth Five-Year Plan
(1991-95) is to reduce it further by 10 percent. More energy could be saved
by increasing the scale of operations, employing P-ore efficient operating
practices, and using more modern technologies in energy intensive industries.
The Dominance of Coal and Related Environmental Problems
1.16      Unlike the situation in most countries, the electric power nubsector
is not the largest consumer of coal in China. Industrial use of coal is much
greater. The growth of coal consumption in the household sector also has been
strong, due to urban population growth and the increasing use of coal in rural
areas. Moreover, there is considerable latent energy demand in the residen-
tial sector, primarily for space 'leating, as present heating arrangements meet
only miniasal needs.
1.17      Many of the environmental problems in China are related to the coun-
try's heavy use of coal and the dispersed, small scale application of coal in
industry and households. Environmental problems occur at every stage of the
coal chains mining and disposal of mine waste, coal washing, transport and
handling, processing and combustion, and ultiLately ash disposal. Water pol-
lution occurs both in mining regions and in dense urban areas, caused by prob-
lems in disposing of coal mining and processing wastes and the coal ash
remaining after combustion. In many large cities, ambient concentrations of
particulates and sulfur dioxide are very high. The concentration of particul-
ates is the most serious proLlem; it is largely related to the extensive use
of coals, their h.lgh ash content (20-30 percent), and the often incomplete
combustion due to poor matching of coal qualities to boilers used. The aver-



- 5 -
age sulfur content of the coal is relatively low (in the range of 1.2-1.7 per-
cent), but because coal is used so extensively sulfur emissions are increas-
ing. Moreover, some provinces, such as Sichuan, use coal which has a very
high sulfur content.
1.18      The environmental implications of continued increases in coal use
are sobering. They highlight the need for stronger regulatory enforcement and
more resources devoted to investments to conserve coal and mitigate its envi-
ronmental effects. In addition, v.ore resources should go to the exploration
and development of cleaner fuels. In many industrialized countries, oil and
natural gas have replaced coal in households. At the present time, however,
China has limited scope for substituting cleaner and often more cost effective
fuels in industrial and residential applications. The country has insuffi-
cient confirmed natural gas resources; its production of oil is increasingly
absorbed by transport and petrochemicals; and its large hydropower resources
are located far away from major consuming centers.
Scale and Technology in Energy Industries
1.19      Coal Subsector.  Over half of the coal produced in China comes from
small-scale mining operations which use traditional technologies such as hand
hewing or drilling and blasting. A major problem common to coal mines is
worker safety. China has considerable potential for developing medium-size
mines capable of supporting investments in semimechanized or mechanized sys-
tems, safety equipment, storage and handling systems, and washery plants,
reducing safety and environmental problems while improving the quantity and
quality of output. In the larger centrally-controlled mines, productivity and
safety could be increased by making greater use of mechanized long wall sys-
tems and employing more economic designs for mines and washeries.
1.20      Electric Power Subsector.  Large-scale power development in China is
beneficial from the standpoint of both energy conservation and environmental
protection.  Modern power plants, with unit capacities of 300 KW and 600 MW,
are about 10 percent more efficient than smaller plants and consume about 150
grams of coal less per kWh. This means that the faster the pace of electric
power development in China, the sooner the country will be able to reduce its
consumption of coal to meet energy demand. The boilers of the modern utili-
ties also support better pollution control equipment, raising the efficiency
of particulate removal.
1.21      Petroleum Subsector.  In the petroleum subsector, there is a need to
employ more modern equipment and technology at all stages of exploration and
development; seismic survey and related data processing, exploratory drilling,
and enhanced oil recovery in order to increase production from aging fields.
Improvements in operating and maintenance practices also are needed to
increase the efficiency of the subsector. Moreover, better management of the
oil and gas reservoirs would help to maximize ultimate recovery rates.
Energy Pricing
1.22      Average energy prices have been rising in recent years because of
the broadening of the free market. Coal prices have increased rapidly during
the last five years, largely because the market has expanded to as much as 40-
50 percent of sales, depending on location. Indeed, free market prices for



- 6 -
coal in East China are at or above the level of international prices. The
administered price of coal, alth-.gh it has been raised in recent years, is
still below domestic supply costs; just as importantly, the price structure
does not fully reflect differences in quality, such as calorific value ane ash
content. The dual pricing system (para. 1.25) creates various distortions;
some high calorific value coals are still underpriced and may not be directed
to their most economic uses.
1.23      While the average price levels of some light petroleum products are
close to international prices, average prices of crude oil and heavy fuel oil
are substantially lover. The pace of domestic oil price adjustments have
remained slow, while extraction costs have risen sharply. Producer prices for
natural gas are also distorted and should be adjusted to provide an incentive
to find and develop more resources.
1.24      Electricity prices are largely based on tariffs set in 1976.  Nei-
ther the level nor the structure of tariffs reflects the differential cost of
service arising from consumption during peak load periods anid power distribu-
tion at various voltage levels. In 1987/88, revenue enhancements were intro-
duced in order to improve funding of power development. In particular, a new
plant, new price, policy guarantees that power prices will be sufficient to
allow the power entities to fully service the debt on newly commissioned proj-
ects. As a result of this policy, electricity prices are expected to rise
subsfantially. Already a multitiered price system is emerging in some prov-
inces- while most consumers are charged just a fraction of the long-run mar-
ginal cost (LRMC) of supply, some industrial users are charged prices, at the
margin, that are well above the LRMC (para. 2.13).
1.25      The recent increases in the price of coal and electricity and the
initiation of energy rationing are helping to promote conservation and should
positively influence investment and operating decisions in the sector. How-
ever, the full benefits of these actions will not be realized as long as a
dual pricing system for energy is not abandoned. Under this system, one set
of prices applies to goods allocated under the plan and another set of prices
applies to goods distributed by the market. Because allocated prices tend to
be significantly lower than free market prices, the system encourages consum-
ers to use fuels covered by allocated prices regardless of their suitability.
Similarly, the system encourages energy suppliers to focus on markets offering
free market prices and to neglect the economically legitimate requirements of
other markets which offer allocated prices. For example, the low prices for
town gas inhibit investments for supplying gas in forms suitable for household
energy (natural gas, coal-based gas, and process gas) in an environmentally
sound manner. The existing price structure still does not provide all neces-
sary incentives for investment to improve coal quality and for electricity
consumers to shift their demand to off-peak hours or to be connected to higher
voltage.
1.26      China needs strong price incentives and rigorous enforcement stan-
dards to encourage consumers to conserve energy. It must continue its program
to raise energy prices, close the gap between administered and free market
prices for coal, and begin to correct the most serious distortions in the
pricing structures for coal, gas, and electricity. Energy price reform based
on full recovery of supply costs also will help to remove anomalies in the
funding of energy investments. The Government remains committed to its over-



- 7 -
all price reform program. For example, in the last several months, the Gov-
ernment hae implemented significant price increases and reduced the subsidies
in a number of basic commodities, such as grains, cement, and steel. It also
indicated its readiness to abandon dual pricing in coal and electricity.
Investment Fundin& System
1.27      China has taken decisive steps recently in energy conservation,
environmental protection, and fuel diversification. Improvements in the scale
and technology of energy supply systems have multiplied in recent years, and
the share of funds channeled into the energy sector is now approaching accept-
able levels. However, the funding of investments has suffered as a result of
distorted pricing policies that led to a haphazard and compartmentalized mobi-
lization of resources, and an inefficient development of energy sources. To
reduce financial pressures on the central government, responsibility for fund-
ing of energy investments gradually has been shifting to the provinces, with
mixed results. In the coal subsector, local production now exceeds state
production but is not operating at the scale required to achieve higher effi-
ciency or improve safety. Because of insufficient electric power supplies,
some local enterprises are making their own investments in power plants. The
investment approval system actually biases local investment in favor of less
efficient small-scale plants, as these plants do not require clearance or any
financial contribution by the central government.
C. Energy Sector Strategy
1.28      The Government is working to eliminate energy shortages in an envi-
ronment of rapid economic growth. The Government's principal objectives in
the energy sector are to: (a) accelerate the expansion of electric power and
oil/gas production; (b) expand and improve the scale of coal production;
(c) increase the efficiency and change the forms of coal utilization;
(d) minimize the environmental impact of energy use; (e) rationalize energy
prices and investment funding; and (f) encourage the transfer of modern know-
how and technology in energy industries.
1.29      Allowing the power subsector a larger share in final energy consump-
tion will help to modernize the Chinese economy, reduce overall energy inten-
sities, and curtail pollution through the harnessing of hydropower, more effi-
cient technologies, and larger-scale plants. The same holds true for the oil
and natural gas subsectors, both of which yield cleaner, more efficient fuels
than coal. The continued development of coal mining is an inescapable neces-
sity but it must occur under conditions of higher efficiency, safety, and
environmental acceptability.
D. Bank Role in the Energy Sector
1.30      The Bank has supported seven projects in electric power, five in
petroleum (including one gas project), and one in coal. In all three subsec-
tore, the objectives have been to support technology transfer, modern manage-
ment practices, and the development of efficient, large-scale energy produc-
tion. Through its sector work and project-related technical assistance, the
Bank has assisted in studies to enhance improvements in energy pricing and
investment policies. The power-specific aspects of the Government's strategy
and the role of the Bank are covered in paras. 2.17-2.18.



1.31      With the Bank's assistance, the Chinese have done a good work in
evaluating the economic costs of electric power and coal and in suggesting
approaches for gradual price reform. With regard to electricity. LRMC and
target tariffs were established for East China in 1988. Since then, the Bank
has sponsored the formulation of action plans and adapted them to the specific
conditions of each regional power grid, with the objective of promoting their
execution under repeater projects. An action plan for power pricing reform in
Sichuan is included under the proposed project (para. 5.29). For coal, the
Chinese have set pricing guidelines for various types of coal nationwide, but
the recent surge in inflation has prevented the Government from moving deci-
sively along these lines. However, plans for a large increase in administered
coal prices are still alive and the Bank will continue to promote the formula-
tion and execution of a plan to rationalize the level and structure of coal
prices, with special attention to the most sensitive coal users.
1.32      A Coal Transport Study, being conducted jointly by the Bank and
various Chinese institutes, will develop a model to identify optimal invest-
ments in infrastructure to move coal more efficiently, taking into consider-
ation quality requirements and the impact of more efficient utilization in
major consuming areas. A Coal Utilization Study has evaluated options to
improve coal use and reduce its environmental impact both in industry and
households. In regard to the petroleum subsector, two seminars have been
organized in China over the past five years--one on gas utilization and ano-
ther on petroleum subsector management. Improving the planniig of investments
and operations for the power subsector has been the focus of many Bank-spon-
sored activities (paras. 2.11 and 2.19).
1.33      Future Bank operations in the energy sector will continue to support
rational energy development and technology transfer, energy efficiency and
conservation, and improved environmental management. Through both project and
sector work, the Bank continues to encourage policies which provide the proper
incentives for sustainable energy development and conservation. Finally, the
Bank will cor.tinue to promote modern enterprise management, greater autonomy
and accountability, as well as improvements in the regulatory framework of the
sector.

1I. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
A. Background
2.1       Since the 1950s, China has grown to become the fourth largest pro-
ducer of electricity in the world. In 1990, the country had a total installed
capacity of 135.0 GW, 74 percent based on thermal power and 26 percent based
on hydropower. That same year it generated 618 TWh of electricity, of which
126 TWh was from hydropower. Plant use and network losses accounted for 6.9
and 8.0 percent of generation, respectively. Fuel consumption in thermal
plants has been reduced to about 400 gram of standard coal per kWh. These
levels of electricity generation, losses, and fuel corsumption are close to
those in industrialized countries. Power is mostly distributed through 16
major grids, 13 of which exceed 1 GW in capacity and account for about 90
percent of total capacity. By the end of 1989, the total length of the extra
high voltage transmission lines reached 7,302 km and the capacity of substa
tions amounted to 18.8 GVA.
2.2       The Government's rural electrification policy emphasizes the devel-
opment of local energy resources. Therefore, as much as possible, mini hydro-
power development is encouraged in isolated areas. In 1989, mini-hydro, small
thermal, and diesel generating sets had a total installed capacity of 19 GW.
Mini-hydro plants alone had a capacity of 12.4 GW and an annual generation of
34.3 TWh. The networks in rural areas are made up of 1,990,000 km of 110 kV
lines, and 4,020,000 km of low-voltage lines (35 kV and below). These net-
works have a transformer capacity of 85.9 GVA at high voltage and 142.5 GVA at
low voltage. Approximately 94 percent of townships and 85 percent of villages
are electrified.
2.3       The growth of installed capacity, electricity generation, and sales
since '949 is depicted in Annex 2.1. Annex 2.2 shows the historical trend of
electricity generation, primary energy demand, and the GNP. The target of
quadrupling the GNP between 1980 and the year 2000 should result in average
growth of 7.0 percent a year for power demand. On this basis, the Seventh
Five-Year Plan (1986-90) called for an increase in generating capacity of
about 35 GW (8 GW from hydropower) with an additional 120 GW planned between
1990 and 2000. Power generation capacity expansion during the period 1986-90
met the plan objectives for hydropower and surpassed those for thermal power
by 80 percent. Various steps are being taken to satisfy power demand. Large
thermal power stations are being constructed mainly near ports and major coal
mines in Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Henan, Shaanxi, and Shandong. Major hydroelec-
tric stations are planned at the middle and upper reaches of the valleys of
the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Hongshui River. Two nuclear power plants
are being constructed in Guangdong and Zhejiang Provinces (para 1.8). A
500 kV transmission network is being built to integrate regional grids. The
first high-voltage direct-current transmission link was commissioned in 1989
to transfer hydropower from Gezhouba in Hubei Province to Shanghai.
2.4       In 1990, China consumed 535 TWh of electricity; 80 percent was con-
sumed by industry, 7.8 percent by agriculture, 6.2 percent by household, 2.0
percent by transportation/communications, and 4 percent by other services.
Details of electricity consumption by sectors are given in Annex 2.3. Average



- 10 -
per capita consumption in 1990 reached nearly 500 kWh; household use was about
85 kWh in cities and 20 kWh in rural areas.
2.5       Between 1986 and 1990, electricity demand increased faster than
generating capacity. As a result, power shortages reached about 20 percent of
industrial electricity requirements, which translated into the idling of
indue's ial capacity for one or two days a week. Electricity is still allo-
cated through quotas based on priorities set by local and central authorities
and demands for new connections are closely screened; still, power cuts are
frequent. The rapid growth of demand can be attributed both to the very high
economic growth and to the increasing share of electricity in coimercial
energy requirements: 13 percent in 1970, 18 percent in 1980, possibly 27
percent by the year 2000. Since 1986, residential, manufacturing, and trans-
portation showed the highest growth rates: 20 percent for residential uses
due to income growth and 19 percent for transportation due to railway electri-
fication. The manufacturing sector is already a large electricity consumer
and is expected to maintain its share in the future. Notwithstanding con-
certed efforts at energy conservation, the growth of power supply should not
be allowed to fall behind GNP growth. As economic growth is only targeted at
6 percent a year under the Eighth and Ninth Five-Year Plans, the power output
is planned to grow at the commensurate rate of 5.8 percent a year to 1,100 TWh
in the year 2000; however, such a figure may prove to be too conservative.
Indeed, a faster pace of power system development would be justified in order
to accelerate the retirement of the less efficient and more polluting small
coal-fired plants.
B. Institutions, Planning, and Technology Transfer
2.6       Institutions.  HOE oversees all strategic aspects of power develop-
ment (para. 1.10), includug six regional power administrations which coordi-
nate the operations of the power systems and prepare long-term development
programs for the approval of MOE. There are 22 provincial and municipal power
bureaus under the regional administrations operating as part of the regional
power systems and eight other bureaus which operate in isolation. A number of
investigation and design institutions are affiliated with MOE, as are the 16
construction companies involved primarily in building power projects. Several
universities, colleges, and research and training centers also fall under the
auspices of MOE.
2.7       The Huaneng International Power Development Corporation (HIPDC) was
created in 1985 as a financing arm of the former MWREP. It was designed to
attract foreign capital and technology for power generating plants located
mainly in the open cities of the coast. Unlike the provincial power bureaus
(the beneficiaries of multilateral financing), HIPDC has a mandate to raise
funds directly from the international financial market. The HIPDC has been
active in tapping bilateral and suppliers' credits, and a few commercial bank
loans. As a result, the power subsector in China has claimed a significant
share of the country's external financing in recent years (Annex 2.4).
2.8       Separate corporations also have been created for developing major
hydroelectric schemes as is the case with the proposed project. These new
institutional arrangements are beneficial because such corporations are
allowed to maximize their efficiency through specialization and economies of
scale and to reinvest their earnings into future power development. However,



- 11 -
in order to achieve maximum efficiency, this division of labor creates a need
for coordination of investments and operations among the various power enti-
ties in the eame region, including transfer pricing arrangements.
2.9       The power industry in China employs about 1.8 million people.  Of
these employees, fewer than 302 have received formal education beyond the
junior secondary level. As a result, there is a shortage of trained manpower.
particularly trained technical and administrative staff. MOE has initiated a
long-term program to upgrade the skills of the staff at all levels. The pro-
gram is carried out primarily by the provincial power bureaus and regional
power administrations. The training component of the proposed project is
designed to support the MOE program and assist in developing manpower to meet
the project's human resource needs (para. 3.5).
2.10      Power System Planning.  Power system planning in China is the
responsibility of the Planning Department of MOE, which reviews the plans
proposed by the regional power administrations and bureaus. For the expansion
of thermal power plants and transmission networks, the research, planning and
designs are carried out by the regional electric power design institutes. For
major hydroelectric projects, the research, planning, and design are carried
out by the regional hydroelectric investigation an design institutes and the
MOE's Water Resources and Hydropower Planning Institute.
2.11      As planning for China's power development becomes increasingly com-
plex, there is a compelling need for Chinese planners to adopt state-of-the-
art system planning techniques. These techniques are particularly important
for evaluating large-scale projects which have long lead times and for making
decisions about generation mix, power plant locatiun, and grid configuration.
Least-cost generation planning techniques were first introduced for thermal
generation in East China through technical assistance from the International
Atomic Energy Agency.l/ Under the Planning Support and Special Studies Proj-
ect (Credit 1835-CHA), least cost planning techniques are being introduced for
hydroelectric generation and transm'-sion network expansion plans for the
Sichuan and East China power systems. Training in the use of these techniques
is being provided to staff of the concerned power bureaus and the Water
Resources and Electric Power Economic Research Institute (WREPERI). These
staff, in turn, will be able to assist other power bureaus and regional power
administrations.
2.12      Modern Technology Transfer.  For China to achieve its ambitious
goals for increasing power production, the development and transfer of appro-
priate modern technologies will be crucial. Technology transfer is very
important for thermal power plants, where increases in the steam parameters
and size of units can reduce net fuel consumption. Since thermal generation
from coal-fired units is expected to provide about three quarters of total
generation until the end of the century, reducing the amount of fuel consumed
for power generation would reduce pressures on both the supply and transport
of coal, as well as on the environment. The Bank is helping to provide state-
of-the-art t2chnology for the construction and operation of large coal-fired
units (300 MW and 600 MW), including environmental assessments and impact
mitigation. Technology transfer is also needed for large hydroelectric proj-
1/ Under the Bank's Second Power Project (Loan 2493-CHA).



- 12 -
ects, particularly in connection with thq interpretation of geological data,
the design of sophisticated structures and large underground works, the selec-
tion of equipment, efficient construction management, and envlronmental
assessments. Assistance in technology transfer is being provided under ongo-
ing projects and will be continued under the proposed project Qara. 5.23).
C. Power Pricing
2.13      The average official price of electricity has remained constant
since the 1960s at around 7 to 10 fen/kWh. The basic tariff structure adopted
in 1976, which is still largely in use, includes five categories of tariffs;
one each for small industry and commerce, large industry, agriculture, bulk
sales, and lighting. Lighting is metered separately for all consumers. Only
the large industry category features a capacity charge (per kW) levied on the
consumer's peak demand (or installed transformer capacity). The tariff does
not reflect the higher cost of service associated with lower voltage levels
and consumption during peak hours. In fact, the 1988 study for East China
(para. 1.31) found rates to be 20 to 50 percent below the LRKC of supply. In
1987/88, following rulings by the State Council, revenue enhancements were
superimposed on the basic tariff structure, as followst (a) across-the-board
energy surcharges to industrial and commercial users for plants financed by
provincial governments; and (b) higher prices for power purchased from new
plants. Customer levies also are being used to finance an increasing share oi
the distribution network. In several provinces, time-of-day tariffs have been
recently introduced. Overall, the new pricing arrangements reflect a wide
spread commitment to conserving electric power and to promoting the financial
viability of power entities.
2.14      The price of electricity from plants commissioned after 1988 is 60
percent to 160 percent above the "old electricity' price. With the present
growth rate of the subsector, this means that new plants will represent more
than half of the total capacity by 1995, and at that time the average price
may exceed the LRMC of power generation. Already some large industries with
high growth rates end up paying, at the margin, prices higher than the LRMC of
supply. However, the current pricing arrangements lack transparency and often
create additional distortions in the price structure which encourage ineffi-
ciencies and unfair treatment of customers. They also are so complicated as
to slow down the introduction of effective structure improvements, such as
time-of-day tariffs. MOE recently has begun to address these issues by intro-
ducing a standard formula for applying the 'new plant, new price' policy.
This formula not only will guarantee the debt servicing of new plants but also
will "dilute' the new price into the retail sales tariff in order to avoid the
problems of multitier pricing for final consumers. The average national
electricity rates in the period 1973-89 are shown in Annex 2.5.
2.15      The Bank is engaged in a very active dialogue with the Government on
the topic of power pricing. The financial covenants under Bank-financed proj-
ects have long supported improvements in power price levels, and collaborative
work on tariffs is now reinforcing the corrective actions already taken by MOE
to adjust prices (para. 2.14). In a specific effort to support a systematic
overhaul of power prices by the Government, the Bank financed a study covering
East China under the Beilungang Thermal Power Project (Loan 2706-CHA). The
primary recommendations of this study--to bring tariffs more in line with the
LIMC--are gaining broad acceptance and will be used in formulating specific



- 13 -
pricing reforms for power systems with predominantly coal-fired generation.
However, this prototype study cannot be applied to grids with a predominance
of hydroelectric generation such as in Sichuan. This is because in systems
dominated by hydropower, the energy LRMC may vary according to the season and
the fact that the peaking capacity cost is lower than in systems primarily
fueled by coal. Therefore, a specific power pricing study is included in this
project (para. 5.29). This study will be carried out within the next two
years in two separate but related parts. Part A will serve to design a con-
tract for the sale of the project output which the Government has agreed to
structure on the basis of the LRMC of generation (para. 3.12). Part B will
serve to formulate a plan for the reform of bulk purchase tariffs from small
producers and tariffs for retail sales to final users. The terms of reference
for the study are presented in Annex 5.8.
D. Subsector Issues and Strategy
2.16      China faces the following major issues in the power subsector:
(i) acute power shortages; (ii) inadequate power pricing and investment fund-
ing; (iii) protracted implementation periods for large projects; (iv) environ-
mental impacts of power supply; (v) weak interconnection within regional power
systems; (vi) scarcity of skilled manpower; and (vii) outdated methods for
planning, operation, and financial management.
2.17      The Government's basic policy for the power subsector is to modern-
ize it, expand it, and increase its efficiency at a rate sufficient to meet
the requirements of industrial development and improve the living conditions
of the population. This policy translates into the following objectives:
(a) expand coal-fired thermal capacity at mine-mouths or near ports and load
centers in order to reduce the rail transportation requirements and use of
lower grade coal in urban centers; (b) replace small- and medium-size thermal
units with larger, less polluting, and more efficient units; (c) accelerate
the pace of hydroelectric development; (d) construct extra high-voltage trans-
mission lines; (e) introduce a more rational pricing system; and (f) adopt
modern techniques in project design, environmental impact mitigation, and
system planning.
E. Role of the Bank in the Power Subsector
2.18      The Bank's participation in the power subsector in China has partic-
ularly focused on institution building and the transfer of appropriate modern
technology. The Bank has supported the Government's sectoral strategy through
sector work, policy dialogue, and a series of lending operations in associa-
tion with the regional power bureaus. The Bank has helped to introduce state-
of-the-art system planning methodologies which identify cost-effective, sus-
tainable development policies for the power subsector and, presently, it is
participating in the formulation of the Five-Year Plans in Sichuan and East
China (para. 2.11). Repeater projects allow the Bank to assist the Government
in applying power tariff reforms based on the findings of earlier pricing
studies (para. 2.15). Through the Second Beilungang Thermal Power Project
(Loan 2955-CHA), the Bank is extending its policy dialogue to cover the reor-
ganization, management, and regulation of power bureaus.
2.19      Since China has become a member of the World Bank Group, the Bank
has helped to finance six large power generation projects (600 MW -



- 14 -
1,400 MW)--three thermal and three hydro operations--and one high-voltage
transmission project. Through these operations, the Bank has successfully (i)
introduced international competitive bidding (ICB) for civil works and equip-
ment; (ii) supported the transfer of modern technology in project construction
and management; (iii) helped to improve the efficiency of pollution abatement
equipment; (iv) promoted the integration of a "egional power system in East
China; (v) supported the development of master plans for modern distribution
networks; and (vi) promoted operational efficiency and prudent financial man-
agement. Under the Technical Cooperation Credit (TCC), the Bank assis,'ed in
supervising and reviewing a feasibility study for the Three Gorges Prolect.
2.20      Most of the ongoing power proj3cts financed by the Bank are being
implemented in a satisfactory manner, on schedule, and within budget. The
first power-operation, Lubuge Hydroelectric (Loan 2382-CHA), is about to be
completed. The second power operation, the? 500 kV Xuzhou-Shanghai Transmis-
sion Project (Loan 2493-CHA), was put into service, as scheduled. The Yantan
Hydroelectric Project (Loan 2737-CHA) is also progressing satisfactorily.
Several problems were encountered early in the implementation of the Shuikou
Hydroelectric Project (Loan 2775-CIA): project management was weak, and the
original Government allocation was too low to cover large cost increases asso-
ciated with the resettlement component. Among measures to resolve these prob..
lems, the Bank agreed to revise the loan allocation and finance the importa-
tion of materials needed for resettlement; project management is also being
strengthened. The project is now back on schedule. Furthermore, the Bank is
involved in financing three thermal power projects--Beilungang (Loan 2706-
C5A), Wujing (Loan 2852-CIA), and Beilungang Extension (Loan 2955-CHA). The
Beilungang project encountered delays early on due to procurement problems and
poor coordination among the suppliers of various islands. These problems have
now been resolved, and construction is almost back on schedule. To minimize
problems of coordination among suppliers for the Wujing project, procurement
was carried out using a single responsibility contract.
2.21      The lessons learned from the previous power projects in China have
been taken into account in preparing the proposed project. These lessons
include: (i) proper assessment of resettlement costs; (ii) tightening techni-
cal and financial criteria for the prequalification of bidders; (iMi) improv-
ing procurement and contractual arrangements; and (iv) enhancing the role of
project management and the use of engiriering consultants. Particular atten-
tion was given to the satisfactory results achieved and lessons learned in
connection with the resettlement of the population during the implementation
of the first two Bank-financed hydroelectric projects in China--Lubuge and
Yantan.

III. THE BENEFICIARY
Introduction
3.1       The beneficiary of the proposed loan would be the Ertan Hydroelec-
tric Development Corporation (EHDC), an enterprise created in 1988 with the
aim to accelerate the construction of large and economical hydroelectric proj-
ects in Southwest China. EHDC is responsible for the development of hydro-
electric resources of the Yalong, Jinsha, and Dadu rivers in Sichuan Province;
the first of such schemes being the proposed project. EHDC is a separate
legal and accounting entity under the jurisdiction of MOE with sole responsi-
bility for procurement. A charter of EHDC acceptable to the Bank has been
issued.
3.2       Prior to the creation of EHDC, project preparation activities were
handled by the Sichuan Electric Power Administration (SCEPA). SCEPA is a
state-owned enterprise which owns and operates a major portion of the genera-
tion and transmission power system in Sichuan (para. 4.5). SCEPA will con-
tinue to be responsible for the integrated operatior.s of the system; it will
assist EHDC in implementation, and later operation, of the Ertan project. All
the power generated by EHDC will be sold in bulk to SCEPA (para 3.12).
Organization and Management
3.3       EHDC is governed by a Board of Directors whose members are appointed
by the SEIC (2 members), Sichuan provincial authorities (3 members), MOE (1
member), SCEPA (1 member), and EHDC (2 members). EHDC is headed by a General
Manager appointed by MOE and assisted by three Deputy General Managers. The
organizational structure of EHDC is shown in Chart 2. Satisfactory results
have been achieved in establishing EHDC and recruiting its management and
staff. The organization of EHDC is suitable for managing major hydroelectric
projects and appears to be appropriate for the current institutional setup in
China. EHDC has a capable and experienced engineering staff. However, fur-
ther enhancements are needed in managing EHDC's affairs and developing staff
skills. Therefore, EHDC managerial staff will need to broaden and acquire the
modern management knowledge and experience necessary for carrying out large
and complex hydroelectric projects in an effective and timely manner. To this
end, systematic management and staff training will be provided, in addition to
seminars with foreign specialists and study tours abroad (para. 5.31).
Staffing and Training
3.4       At present, EHDC has a total staff of about 200.  For project site
construction management, EHDC has created the Ertan Engineering Corporation
(EEC) headed by the EHDC's Deputy General Manager and Chief Engineer (para.
5.22). EEC will have a staff of about 300 people. Many of the parsonnel are
experienced staff transferred from other power agencies, including (a) Lubuge
Project Construction Management Bureau; (b) Chengdu Hydroelectric Investiga-
tion and Design Institute (CHIDI); (c) various hydroelectric construction
bureaus in China; and (d) other electricity supply bureaus. Some 56 percent
of the total staff are engineers and technicians. Details of EHDC and EEC
staffing are shown in Annex 3.1.



- 16 -
3.5       EHDC does not yet have facilities to train its staff and until these
facilities are available, it is dependent upon the training and education
department of SCEPA. This department administers five schools and ten train-
ing centers for technicians and skilled wrrkers. Many of the staff needed for
Ertan can be trained in these schools and centers which specialize in welding,
hoisting, metal processing, machine tooling, and maintenance of hydropower
plants. In addition, some employees would be tra'ned by other training insti-
tutions. The training component included in the proposed project is designed
to meet EHDC staff development needs (para. 5.31).
Planning, Budgeting, and Control
3.6       The power bureaus are responsible for developing annual and five-
year production and investment plans which are integrated into the national
plans and are approved, through HOE's auspices, by SPC. These plans have
emphasized quantities of inputs and outputs. Financial planning was confined
to attaching monetary values, predetermined by MOE, to the quantities being
planned. A power bureau's plan might be revised to reflect changes in inputs
or outputs arising from changed or unforesern circumstances; however, the
plans would ordinarily not be revised merely to reflect differences between
the prices assumed for planning purposes and those actually paid by a particu-
lar power bureau. Further, under the present finanrial system in China, heavy
emphasis is placed on the annual budget as a contx.L.ling tool and financial
planning beyord one year is generally not undertaken.
3.7       The above planning system functioned satisfactorily in a highly
centralized economy whereby controlled prices kept inflation rate negligible
and investments were financed almost exclusively by grants. However, as part
of the recently initiated economic reform, prices have begun to escalate, and
government grants have been largely replaced by loans. In addition, the
institutional framework is moving toward a reduction in centralized control
with corresponding increase in financial autonomy and responsibility for deci-
sion-making at the power bureau level. In earlier Bank-financed power proj-
ects, the Bank had initiated significant steps toward strengthening financial
management at the various project entities. The measures adopted include the
extension of the financisl planning horizon and training in modern financial
management, focusing in particular on modern techniques of cost and debt man-
agement. This training is cer.trally managed by MOEISEIC in order to promote
coordination and interaction among the various bureaus. A number of training
seminars in China and overseas training were carried out and future training
activities will build on these experiences. MOE/SEIC are in the process of
designing a financial management training program over the next three years in
consultation with the Bank. An oatline of this program is presented in Annex
3.2.
3.8       The proposed project will continue the process of strengthening
financial management at the power entities. During preparation of the proj-
ect, the Bank method of long-term financial forecasting was introduced to
EHDC. An assurance was obtained from EHDC that it will furnish a rolling
long-term financial plan to the Bank containing projected income statements,
sources and uses of funds, and balance bheets for the project implementation
period plus no less than five years of project operation period. The first
rolling long-term financial Plan will be furnished to the Bank no later than
April 30, 1992. Further, to help prepare EHDC for their increasing responsi-



- 17 -
bility for the construction and subsequent operation of large and complex
projects, including Ertan, a seminar focusing on project financial management
(financed under TCC) was held in Chengdu. This was the first of a series of
financial training activities managed by MOE/SEIC.
Accounting
3.9       As in the case of all state enterprises in China, the power bureauq
follow a unlfied Chinese accounting system in their financial reporting to the
Government. The Chinese accounting system has largely been satisfactory in
the context of a highly centralized and closed economy. However, while the
recent economic reforms in the country have resulted in changes in the finan-
cial system, corresponding changes in accounting practices are apparently
lagging. For example, present Chinese practice uses historical rather than
prevailing foreign exchange rates in reporting foreign loans. Hence, the
impact of exchange rate fluctuations is not reflected in the enterprises'
financial statements. With a view to promoting prudent financial management,
including foreign debt management, a training seminar on selected aspects of
international accounting practices was held in China. The financial training
program for Bank-financed power bureaus is also attacted in Annex 3.2.
3.10      In accorcance with Chinese accounting practices, the power bureaus
maintain two separate sets of accounts--one set for capital construction and
the other for operation. Since these two sets of accounts are not being con-
solidated, the balance sheet for operation does not include construction work-
in-progress and the related financing. As in the case of earlier Bank-
financed projects, EHDC would consolidate the capital cu.struction account
with the operation accounts (if any) for the audited financial statements and
rolling financial plans to be furnished to the Bank.
Audit
3.11      As with other Bank-financed projects in China, the Foreign Invest-
ment Audit Bureau of the State Audit Administration (SAA) will have overall
responsibility for auditing EHDC's accounts. Under SAA's supervision, the
actual auditing work will be conducted by the Audit Bureau of Sichuan Prov-
ince. This arrangement is satisfactor;. However, mainly due to the special
features of Chinese accounting, agreement was reached with SAA that for most
Bank-financed projects, including power operations, there would be improved
disclosure of accounting policies and supplementary financial information in
order to provide an adequate illustration of the financial performance and
status of projects/entities. Technical assistance for SAM and the provincial
auditing bureaus will continue to be financed under IDA credits. An assurance
was obtained from EHDC that it would maintain separate accounts for the prol-
ect and that the audited proiect accounts and financial statements of EHDC
would be furnished to the Bank within six months after the end of each fiscal
ear.
Power Sales to SCEPA
3.12      As noted above (para. 3.2), the Ertan Hydroelectric Project is being
built by EHDC to exclusively serve the Sichuan power market through the net-
work owned by SCEPA. The planned project output will provide 20-30 percent of
SCEPA's sales to consumers over the years 2000-2010. A formal sales contract



- 18 -
between EHDC and SCEPA will need to be entered into shortly before the Ertan
plant begins operations in 1998. EHDC's future role and performance depends
heavily on its ability to recover the cost to build and operate the plant.
SCEPA's investment and operating policies would also be significantly affected
by this contract agreement. There are understandings in this regard on the
quantities and pricing principles that will govern the contract. Agreements
have been reached with the Government regarding the following four principles:
(a) the revenue generated by EHDC's sales would ensure its financial
viability, as measured by the agreed financial performance indica-
tors (para. 6.4);
(b) the project's output must be fully dispatchable under the instruc-
tions of SCEPA's control centers;
(c) charges should be levied separately on a functional basis for peak-
ing capability (kW) and energy output (kWh); and
(d) the above cherges should not exceed SCEPA's avoided costs defined as
the fuel and capacity costs that SCEPA would have to incur in the
long run if the project output was not available.
3.13      An assurance was obtained from the Government that a contract sat-
isfactory to the Bank would be entered into between EHDC and SCEPA not later
than June 30, 1996 and that the Government would take the necessary steps to
enable SCEPA to implement the above agreement. Principles of the said con-
tract were discussed and agreed upon during negotiations.
Billing and Collection
3.14      All the power generated by EHDC would be sold in bulk to SCEPA.  The
collection procedure would be simple and expeditious. Insofar as the grid is
concet.ed, meter recording, billing, and collection activities are conducted
by the t arteen power supply bureaus of SCEPA. All the major industrial con-
sumers are charged in advance 2 to 5 times each month according to their
planned consumption. At the end of the month, meters are read and adjustments
to reflect actual usage are included in the first bill for the following
month. Domestic consumers are charged once a month according to meter
readings. SCEPA's electricity tariffs are given in Annex 3.3.
3.15      Consumers render payments to SCEPA's district offices usually within
3-5 days after the receipt of their bills. Fines are imposed on overdue pay-
ments, which rarely happen. These arrangements have established a reliable
cash flow from sales and maintained SCEPA's accounts receivable from owner
sales at unusually low levels. During the past five years, they averaged less
than 1 percent of SCEPA's annual sales.
Insurance
3.16      EHDC will take necessary measures to insure all of its assets ade-
quately against normal levels of risk. This would include both self-insurance
and the purchase of commercial insurance. Contractors for the main construc-
tion works will obtain insurance from insurance companies acceptable to EHDC.
The related insurance arrangements for these works have been reviewed and



- 19 -
found satisfactory. Agreements have been reached with M=DC that satisfactory
insurance arrangements would be maintained.

IV. THE POWER MARKET AND THE PROGRAM
Background
4.1       In 1990, the population of Sichuan approached 110 million for an
area of about 600,000 km2. Services, agriculture, light and heavy industries
each represent about 25 percent of the provincial economic output; from 1980
to 1990, economic growth has exceeded 10 percent a year on average.  The Gov-
ernment's target is to double the GNP between now and the year 2000, and to
increase real income per capita by 4.5 percent to 6.4 percent a year.
4.2       The province is endowed with abundant hydroelectric potential (para.
1.4) and natural gas (para. 1.6), both of which are underdeveloped. By con-
trast, the recoverable coal deposits amount to only 8 billion tons (1.1 per-
cent of the country's total). By 1990, 45 percent of it was exploited; coal
production was about 70 million tons in chat year, however, this coal has a
high content of sulfur (5 percent) and ashes (30 percent). The reserves of
crude oil (about 10 million tons) are too small to be developed economically.
4.3       Sichuan has more than 19 million hectares (ha) of forestable land
accounting for about one-third of the whole area of the province. Forests
cover about 7 million ha (about 13 percent of the province). Sichuan has an
estimated 1.13 million cubic meters of woods and produces 18 million tons of
wood fuel a year. In order to actively develop the province's fuel forests,
effective measures and the proper balance of energy resources have been
instituted to eliminate energy shortages, particularly in its rural areas.
Sichuan is also rich in raw materials for making biomass fuels and can produce
about 600 million cubic meters of biomass fuels a year, from its more than
1,500 large- and medium-size biomass plants and about 1.5 million small pro-
ducing units. At present, biomass fuels are mainly used in households for
lighting and cooking.
4.4       In Sichuan, the consumption of commercial energy in 1990 was about
40 million toe, of which coal products amounted to 60 percent, electric power
22 percent, natural gas 12 percent, and petroleum products 5 percent. The
province imports coal, petroleum products and electric power. Details of the
energy balance for Sichuan Province in 1990 are given in Annex 4.1.
The Sichuan Power System
4.5       By the end of 1990, the total installed capacity in Sichuan Province
was 7,100 MW, of which hydro power amounted to 3,062 MW. The SCEPA power
system represented about 65 percent of the total capacity, consisting of
1,463 HW of hydro and 3,339 HW of thermal generating plant; 28 percent of the
installed capacity belongs to the Sichuan Water Conservancy Electric Power
Bureau (SWCEPB) and 7 percent to self-producers. Most of the hydroelectric
power stations belonging to SWCEPB (about 1,250 MW) are small and of the run-
of-river type with little firm output in the dry season. These stations are
scattered throughout the province; some are connected to the SCEPA network and
supply about 1 TWh a year. Tle self-producer thermal power plants are also
small (less than 12 MW each), outdated and inefficient.



- 21 -
4.6       SCEPA's electricity generation in 1990 amounted to about 21 TVh, or
73 percent of the total generation in the province. Further details on
SCEPA's generating capacities are given in Annex 4.2. SCEPA's hydropower
plants have small reservoir storages and their dry season firm output is
30 percent of the annual average. Most of the thermal power plants use coal
and a few use natural gas, but their fuel supply is very limited. Units of
50 MW or less represent about 50 percent of installed thermal power capacity.
As a result, coal consumption exceeds 550 g/kAh and plant use represents
10 percent of generation. The annual availability of thermal power plants is
about 6,000 hours, which indicates proper maintenance and operatins practices.
4.7       The SCEPA's transmission network services about half of the 210
counties of the province. As of end of 1990, the 220 kV grid extended over
4,044 km, with a transformer capacity of 8,570 MVA; and the 110 kV grid
5,908 km with 6,718 WVA. Details of the transmission facilities are shown in
Annex 4.2 and on Hap 21308R IBRD. The Power Dispatching Center of SCEPA is
responsible for the unified operation of the system. Netvork losses are about
8 percent of generation.
4.8       Statistics on annual electricity consumption in the province are
given in Annex 4.3. In the 19809, electricity intensity has decreased at the
annual rate of 4 percent. It is now about 0.14 kWh per yuan of output value.
Installed capacity has risen by about 3.8 percent a year, while electricity
consumption, through an increase in power plant capacity factors, has grown by
about 5.5 percent a year. This rate is lower than that for China as a whole
(para. 2.3). The composition of power consumption in 1990 vas as follows:
industry--83 percent, commercial and public services--7 percent, agriculture--
5 percent, transport--2 percent, and others--3 percent.
4.9       The value of the industrial output foregone because of planned power
outages has been estimated at Y 1 to Y 5lkVh. This value is 50 percent higher
for unplanned blackouts or brown-outi. Finally, it is worth noting that new
industrial investments are not approved unless electricity requirements can be
met which is a serious impediment to economic growth.
Demand Forecast
4.10      Demand forecasts for the Sichuan Province were prepared by applying
statistical and analytical methods for each important consumer category. The
demand forecasts presented in Annex 4.4 are based on the objective to quadru-
ple industrial and agricultural production between the years 1980 and 2000.
After having eliminated the most critical power shortages, this target could
be obtained with an annual growth rate of 5.2 percent for the traditional
electricity intensive industries (chemicals, metallurgy, energy), 3 percent
for agriculture, 12.5 percent for the tertiary and residential sectors, and
8.5 percent for less electricity-intensive industries. Electricity intensi-
ties are expected to stabilize or decrease. On this basis, industrial and
agricultural output would increase at a rate of 6.8 percent a year, and elec-
tricity demand at 6.6 percent a year between 1991 and 2000. System losses are
planned to decrease with the introduction of larger, more efficient facili-
ties. Residential consumption would reach 90 kWh per capita. The energy
demand forecast is considered conservative, in view of the demographics, the
relatively low level of residential consumption, and the potential for indus-
trial sector development. For the same reasons, electric energy demand in the



- 22 -
19909, and to a lesser extent the peak load forecasts, are considered to be
relatively insensitive to the increases in power prices that would be required
to fully reflect the cost of supply in the retail sales tariff.
Development Program
4.11      On the basis of the existing commitments for power subsector devel-
opment, it would not be possible to eliminate electricity shortages before
1999. The capacity expansion should be accelerated in order to do this.
Therefore, about 8,200 MW of generating capacity must be commissioned by that
date, and about 450 MW of outdated thermal capacity should be retired. Table
4.1 shows the demand and supply forecast for the Sichuan Province grid
(details are presented in Annex 4.4). The development programs for generation
capacity are presented in Annex 4.5. The peaking capacity and firm energy
requirements in a dry year will constitute the most difficult bottlenecks to
be met. All planned hydro projects are part of the core development program
that is obtained when overall expansion costs are minimized in a broad range
of assumptions about load growth and coal prices. The amount of coal-fired
capacity should be the first affected if actual load growth deviates from
expectations.

/a Defined as the difference between peak demand and peaking capability.
4.12      The role of coal-fired capacity will be limited by physical and
economic factors: low availability and quality of local coal, crippling
transport costs, and bottlenecks for coal from the Shanxi province 1,400 km
away. It is anticipated that, by the year 2000, provincial coal requirements
outside the power sector will reach the 80 million tons of raw coal that can



- 23 -
be locally mined. The remainder will severely strain the railways capacity
available for coal imports which is planned to expand from 3 to 15 million
tons/year. Transport costs will raise the cost of Shanxi coal from about
Y 100/ton of standard coal at minehead to just about the Lost of mining local
coal (Y 210/ton). If fewer hydro projects were built, transport requirements
would exceed feasible targets in the medium term and would be uneconomical in
the longer run.
4.13      Hydropower for Sichuan Province, on the other hand, is inexpensive
and has relativel7 benign impacts on the environment when compared to its
thermal alternative or to hydropower in other parts of China. The least-cost
expansion program under the base case calls for a sevenfold increase in hydro-
electric capacity by the year 2005; at that date, hydroelectric generation
would meet 75 percent of the provincial grid requirements as against 35 per-
cent in 1988. Fuel requirements would peak at about 14 million tons of raw
coal a year and thereafter fall below the 10 million tons as consumed by SCEPA
in 1988.
4.14      The beneficiary of the proposed project, RHDC, would play a key role
in developing hydro resources under the above plan. In addition to Ertan
(3,300 KW), EHDC would also build Tongzilin (400 HW) and Pubugou (3,300  0W);
construction of both projects would start by the mid-1990s to be commissioned
from the year 2001 to 2005. A fourth project, Jin Ping (6,000 4W), would be
started before the year 2000 and its first phase (1,600 MW) commissioned after
Pubugou.
4.15      The expansion of the transmission network will be marked by the
introduction of 500 kV technology. Six 500 kV substations will be built, with
a total capacity of about 8.5 GVA. About 3,675 km of 500 kV transmission
lines also will be constructed. Details on the construction program for the
transmission network are given in Annex 4.6.

V. THE PROJECT
Prolect Objectives and Rationale for Bank Involvement
5.1       The main objectives of the proposed project are tot
(a)  provide additional generating capacity to the power system in
Sichuan Province (3,300 KW and 17 TWh a year) in order to alleviate
acute electricity shortages;
(b)  assist in the transfer of modern technology and in the introduction
of efficient construction methods in order to reduce the cost and
prevailing long gestation periods of large hydroelectric projects in
China;
(c)  contribute to further improvements in the analysis of environmental
and ecological impacts of hydroelectric resource development and in
the design of related mitigation measures;
(d)  enhance the institutional development of EHDC by strengthening its
organization through a modern management training program and intro-
ducing of economic efficiency and pricing principles; and
(e)  provide technical assistance in project design and implementation,
and for the promotion of optimal operation of the power system,
prudent financial management, and manpower development.
5.2       The project objectives comply with the country's regional and sec-
toral objectives and with the Bank's lending strategy. In particular, the
proposed project is well-coordinated.with the policy of the Government to
accelerate the development of the large and economic hydroelectric potential
as well as to help achieve the Bank's specific goals regarding transfer of
appropriate modern technology, staff training, least-cost investment planning,
and modern utility practices. Large hydroelectric projects in China have had
gestation periods of up to 15 years. Originally the proposed project was
expected to require 12 years to complete. With encouragement from the Bank,
the Chinese are actively working to reduce its gestation period to nine years
by applying modern construction means and methods, critical path scheduling,
involvement of competent engineering consultants, and accelerating preparatory
activities. This project allows the Bank for the first time to assist in the
start-up of one of the most important power development corporations and to
further its sectoral objectives, including reduction in air pollution, the
formulation of policies to improve electricity pricing, and training staff in
modern utility management and financial planning. The Government fully sup-
ports the project objectives as they would have a major effect on future power
development and economic growth in Southwest China.
Project Description
5.3       The proposed project consists of the following componentst



- 25 -
(a) preparatory works, including access roads and bridges, water and
electricity supply, communication links, and various construction
plant and site facilitiest
(b) construction of a parabolic, double-curvature arch dam (240 m high
with a crest 775 m long) across the Yalong River together with an
underground powerhouse complex, log conveyance system, and appurte-
nant works and structures;
(c)  provision and installation of six 550-MW generating units and asso-
ciated electrical equipment, including a 500 kV step-up substation;
(d) resettlement of about 30,000 people affected by the project;
(e)  an environmental management program and creation of a science sta-
tion for environmental monitoring and studies;
(f) consulting services for engineering, procurement, management of
construction, ant preparation of future power projects;
(g) studies of (i) power pricing for Sichuan Province and optimal opera-
tion of the power plant and reservoir, and (ii) investigations and
tests related to safety of structures, monitoring of energy dissipa-
tion facilities, and powerhouse ventilation; and
(h) management and staff training, computers and application software,
and accessories.
5.4       The Ertan hydroelectric project would constitute the first step in
the long-term development of the hydroelectric potential of the Yalong River,
one of the major tributaries of the Yangtze River in China. The Yalong River
is 1,500 km long and has the potential to provide about 25,000 MW generating
capacity. It represents one of the ten principal hydroelectric basins in
China. A log-passing facility would be built to allow the passage of logs
from the reservoir to the downstream river with capacity of 1.1 million mi of
logs a year. The development of the project also would enhance industrial and
agricultural production in the nearby underdeveloped Dukou(Panzhihua)-Xichang
area. With a normal pool level at the dam site of 1,200 m above sea level,
the Ertan reservoir will extend 145 km upstream. The active storage of the
reservoir will be 3.4 km8, or about 6.4 percent of the average annual runoff.
The regulating effect of the reservoir would be useful to downstream hydro-
electric projects, particularly in increasing their firm output of electric
energy. The upstream Jin Ping hydroelectric project (6,000 MW, 39 TWh a year),
when constructed, will significantly increase the output of the Ertan project
(para. 7.4). A detailed description of the project components is given in
Annex 5.1.
5.5       The transmission network for connecting the Ertan hydroelectric
station to the existing grid would require about 2,500 km of 500 kV transmis-
sion lines. This network would be constructed by SCEPA as a part of its
500 kV transmission network development program before the project is commis-
sioned. The Bank is actively involved in the study work that would assist
SCEPA in determining the optimal configuration of the 500 kV transmission
network in Sichuan and its implementation schedule. An assurance was obtained



- 26 -
from the Government to (i) provide the Bank with an implementation schedule
and a financing plan for the 500 kV transmission network connecting the Ertan
hydroelectric station with the power system in Sichuan Province not later than
June 30, 1993; and (ii) make or cause to be made arrangements satisfactory to
the Bank to secure completion by SCEPA of this network not later than June 30,
1998.
Project Origin and Investigations
5.6       The idea of developing the water resources of the Yalong River and
constructing the Ertan dam and power plant originated in the early 1950s.
Since 1973, intensive site investigations and geological explorations have
been carried out. These include more than 500 exploratory drill holes
(30,000 m in total length) and 40 exploratory adits (8,000 m in length). Such
level of exploration is considered to be satisfactory in relation to the type
and size of the project. The feasibility study for the project was completed
in 1984 by the CHIDI (para. 5.23). In January 1985, this study and the pre-
liminary design report were reviewed and approved by MWREP. The documents
also were reviewed in March 1986 by the Special Board of Consultants (SBC),
consisting of eminent international experts from Canada, France, Switzerland
and the United States. SBC concluded that the design of the proposed project
would adequately meet the conditions for development and was entirely satis-
factory in its overall concept. Geologically, the Ertan site is considered to
be ideally suited for the construction of the proposed parabolic, double-
curvature arch dam and ancillary underground powerhouse complex. Neverthe-
less, a number of recommendations for improving the project design, and for
the accelerating its construction have been made and agreed with CHIDI, EHDC
and SCEPA. These recommendations include, inter alia, the relocation of the
axis of the dam, the decrease of the depth of excavation, a revised spillway
concept, an increase in unit sizes from 500 MW to 550 MW, and an accelerated
construction schedule.
5.7       In December 1986, at the request of SPC, the China International
Engineering Consulting Corporation organized an appraisal of the proposed
project with the participation of engineering specialists and various authori-
ties. Finally, in July 1987, the State Council approved the construction of
the project. Harza (USA) and Advisory Group of Norway (AGN) consultants have
been appointed to assist EHDC, SWEPA, and CHIDI with procurement, preparation
of cost estimates, scheduling, construction, and specific engineering aspects
of the project. The services of these coniultants are being partially funded
by the TCC (Cr. 1664-CHA).
ProJect Cost Estimate
5.8       The total costs of the project are estimated to be $1,885.5 million
equivalent, of which $896.4 million (48 percent) represents the foreign
exchange component. Annex 5.2 contains, in detail, the estimated costs of the
project, which are summarized in Table 5.1.
5.9       The project base costs are in early-1991 prices and are estimated as
follows. The costs of preparatory works are based on the actual construction
costs for works completed to date, and on contract prices for the remaining
works, which are expected to be completed before the end of 1991. Land acqui-
sition costs are based on the actual cost of land purchased at the construc-

tion site. The arch dam and powerhouse costs are based on the lowest evalu-
ated responsive bids for each lot. The costs of electrical and mechanical
equipment, transformers and gates are based on recent quotations from manufac-
turers and suppliers for similar equipment and materials involved. The costs
of the remaining items are based on the consulting engineers' data for similar
morks.  Accordingly, the exchange rates that were applicable at respective
points of transaction have been used. Physical contingencies are assumed as
followss 20 percent for the underground powerhouse, 15 percent for the reset-
tlement program, 10 percent for the remaining preparatory works, arch dam,
engineering, contract administration, technical assistance, environmental
management, studies and training, and 7 percent for the electromechanical
equipment. These percentages are considered to be reasonable in view of the
site features, the stage of design, and the status of contracts let to date.
The price escalation for costs expressed in foreign exchange (US dollars) has
been calculated in accordance with the anticipated international price escala-
tion of 3.4 percent a year in the period 1991-2000. The price escalation for
costs expressed in local currency is calculated according to the projected
local inflation rates, 10 percent in 1991, 8 percent in 1992, 5 percent a year
thereafter. EHDC has requested the exemption from taxes and duties as has all
previous Bank projects in China. The total project costs also include actual
expenditures incurred before 1991 (about $95 million) which are related to the
preparatory works, resettle. ent, land acquisition, and engineering services.

5.10      The breakdown of the project costs into foreign and local components
reflects the borrower's decision to hire foreign construction firms and to
import appropriate modern construction equipment and technology, and to apply
effective management methods so as to ensure efficiency in project construc-
tion. Foreign exchange components would covers (a) the main civil works;
(b) electromechanical equipment; and (c) the foreign expenses associated with
engineering, technical assistance, environmental management, training, and
studies.
Financing Plan
5.11      Early on in the project preparation, the Government of China (GOC)
indicated its preference for seeking Bank financing in two stages as it was
done for the Shuikou Hydroelectric Project (Loan 2775-CHA). Since Ertan is a
large project with a long gestation period (9-10 years), a phased financing
approach would avoid tying up financial resources that could be used for other
projects with more immediate needs. No problem is envisaged for the GOC in
raising foreign exchange financing for the second phase of the project at a
later date. In view of the foregoing, it was agreed that the proposed loan
would be used to finance the first phase of project construction (1991 to mid-
1995). However, this would not prevent the GOC from seeking additional assis-
tance from the Bank for this project. The GOC requested, and it has been
agreed, that the second phase of the project would be included in the Bank's
proposed pipeline of future projects. In addition, the Bank would assist EHDC
to seek cofinancing for electromechanic:al equipment. To enable timely and
effective implementation of the project. it is necessary to ensure an adequate
flow of local funds, as shown in Annex 5.3. During negotiations, GOC's obli-
gation to provide funding for the entire project, along with the yearly budget
and details of local financing for the first phase of project implementation,
was reconfirmed.
5.12      The financing plan for the project would be as shown in Table 5.2.

(IDC) of $601.6 million, amount to $2,487.1 million. SEIC and Energy and



- 29 -
Transport Investment Corporation of Sichuan Province (ETIC) would share the
financing in equal amounts for the followings (a) 100 percent of local costs,
including taxes ($1,014.6 million equivalent); (b) IDC on their loans ($342.9
million equivalent); and (c) Bank loan interest and principal repayments dur-
ing the project construction period ($258.7 million). Of the total local
financing, 40 percent will be in the form of equity. The balance (60 percent)
will be in the form of loans, the terms of which are as follows: (a) 50 per-
cent of the loans will have an interest rate of 3.6 percent a year, 15 years
maturity; and (b) the balance (50 percent) of the loans will have an interest
rate of 15.42 percent a year, 10 years maturity. The weighted average inter-
est rate x suld amount to about 9.6 percent a year. This is in line with the
prevailing interest rate for key national projects in China.
5.14      The US Exim Bank made a preliminary commitment in the amount of $30
million to cofinance the project for services of Harza Engineering Company
(USA), which was selected to assist EHDC in managing project construction.
Furthermore, Norway offered a grant to help finance the project in the amount
of Norwegian Krone 35 million ($5 million equivalent), of which a major por-
tion would be used to cofinance engineering services by AGN for the project.
5.15      The proposed Bank loan of $380 million would meet about 40 percent
of the total financing requirements during the first phase period. Given the
long implementation period noted above and the fact that EBDC would not be
generating cash internally until after project commissioning (para. 6.8), the
project circumstances justify extending the grace period of the Bank loan from
five years (which is the standard period for China) to nine years, and substi-
tuting level repayments of principal for annuity payments. The loan would be
made to the GOC at the Bank's standard variable interest rate for a 20-year
term including nine years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent
from the GOC through Sichuan Province to EHDC with the same terms as the Bank
loan. An assurance was obtained from the GOC that it would onlend the pro-
ceeds of the Bank loan to EHDC, through Sichuan Province, under subsidiary
lo-an sareements with a 20-year term, including nine lears grace and the stan-
dard variable interest rate for Bank loans. EHDC would bear the commitment
charges and foreign exchange risk. The execution of subsidiary loan agree-
ments between the GOC, Sichuan Province, and EHDC, satisfactore to the Bank,
would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
Procurement
5.16      The main items to be procured are:  (a) preparatory works; (b) the
main civil works; (c) electrical and mechanical equipment; and (d) engineering
and consulting services. Contracts for preparatory works, totalling about
$100 million equivalent, have been awarded so far, following local competitive
bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank. These contracts would be financed
by local funds. The procurement of the main civil works, through ICB, has
been divided into two lots, one for the dam and the other for the underground
powerhouse and tunnels. These contracts would be partially financed by the
proposed Bank loan. Bidding documents for the main civil works were reviewed
and endorsed by the Bank, and prequalification of bidders for these works also
was carried out in consultation with the Bank. Applications for prequalifica-
tion were received in 1988 from 14 contractors (mostly joint ventures of for-
eign and local firms), six of which were prequalified. Five out of six nrequ-
alified joint ventures submitted their bids which were opened in public on



- 30 -
October 25, 1989. Bid evaluation was carried out by EHDC, MOE, and their
consultants. The signing of the contracts with the lowest evaluated bidders
for the main civil works is expected to take place in July 1991. Certain
innovative contracting procedures have been adopted for procurement of the
main civil works, such as a Disputes Review Board (DRB) to be set up to help
in prompt resolution of disputes.
5.17      The proposed Bank loan also would partly finance advance payments
for the supply of the 550-MW generating units and associated equipment,
including switchgear, cables, and instrumentation and control, which would be
procured through ICB in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines.
Qualified domestic manufacturers would be eligible for a 15 percent preference
in bid evaluations or import duties, whichever is lower. Items or groups of
items estimated to cost less than the equivalent of $200,000 per contract, up
to an aggregate amount of $2 million may be purchased on the basis of at least
three quotations from qualified suppliers eligible under the Bank's procure-
ment guidelines. All contract packages for works and goods financed by the
Bank and estimated to cost $5 million equivalent or more would be subject to
the Bank's prior review (about 98 percent of the loan). Consultants financed
under the loan would be selected in accordance with principles and procedures
satisfactory to the Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of Con-
sultants by World Bank Borrowers." The procurement arrangements for the pro-
posed project are summarized in Table 5.3.
Disbursements
5.18      The Bank loan would be disbursed against:  (a) 100 percent of for-
eign expenditures for the main civil works; (b) 100 percent of foreign expen-
ditures or 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) of goods pro-
cured through ICB; and (c) 100 percent for consulting services, studies and
training. Furthermore, the proceeds.of the Bank loan will be used to finance
100 percent of foreign expenditures for advanced payments for the purchase of
electromechanical equipment procured through ICB. For expenditures relating
to training, and contracts for works, goods and services each costing less
than $200,000 equivalent, reimbursements would be made on the basis of State-
ments of Expenditure (SOEs). Documentation supporting the SOEs would be
retained by EHDC and made a&.ailable for review by Bank supervision missions.
To facilitate disbursements for some categorles under the project, a Special
Account in US dollars, with an authorized allocation of $20 million, will be
established in a bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Applications for replenishment would be submitted monthly or when the amounts
withdrawn are equal to 50 percent of the authorized allocation, whichever
occurs sooner. Retroactive financing in an aggregate amount of $38 million
would be provided under the loan to cover payments made for expenditures of
urgently needed civil construction works, consultant services, and training
incurred before the date of loan, but after September 1, 1990.
5.19      The disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan is given in
Annex 5.5. The disbursement period covers the first phase of the construction
period. Because of the phased financing arrangements for this project (para.
5.11), it is not possible to compare its disbursement with that of other proj-
ects, except to some extent for the Shuikou Hydroelectric Project. The dis-
bursement schedule is based on the detailed project implementation program and

Pro ect Implementation
5.20      The construction of preparatory works for the project began in July
1987 and is progressing well. These works include access roads, bridges over
the Yalong River, power supply lines, water supply, communication links, con-
struction camps, and health service facilities. Land acquisition for con-
struction purposes (about 1,000 ha) has been completed and about 1,200 inhab-
itants have been successfully relocated.



- 32 -
5.21      Bids for the construction of the arch dam and the powerhouse have
been received and the evaluation of the bids was completed (para. 5.16) so as
to enable the signing of the contr&.ct with the surcessful bidders immediately
after the loan has been approved. The construction of the main civil works is
scheduled to begin in September 1991, the diversion of the river for dam con-
struction in December 1993, and the commercial operation of the first generat-
ing unit in 1998. The remaining generating units would be completed in
sequence with the last sixth unit installed in March 2000, and all remaining
work completed by September 2000. Thus, the project completion date would be
September 30, 2000. The proposed schedule is considered to be reasonable and
attainable. Details on project implementation are shown in Annex 5.4 and
Chart 4, and a more complete implementation schedule, including CPM networks,
is available in the Project Files. With the two-phased financing of the proj-
ect (para. 5.11), the closing date of this loan would be December 31, 1996.
5.22      Particular attention was given to the establishment and proper
staffing of the project site unit and for this purpose EHDC has created EEC
(para. 3.4), which will manage construction of the project. EEC, with the
support from EHDC and MOE and assistance from consultants (para. 5.26), will
have the capability needed to manage a large power project. The organization
of EEC is shown in Chart 3. The project management would be encouraged to
visit similar works in other countries and to exchange information with pro-
fessional institutions and power utilities building and operating similar
projects. An assurance was obtained from EHDC that, during the project imple-
mentation period, it would maintain the project management unit with such
responsibilities, resources and staff as shall be satisfactory to the Bank,
along with adequate authority for resolving project problems.
Engineering. Technical Assistance, and Supervision of Construction
5.23      CHIDI has been retained by EHDC to assist in designing and imple-
menting the project. It is one of the most experienced design institutes in
China, and in recent years it has Completed the design of several large hydro-
electric projects. CHIDI has over 2,000 professional staff and is equipped
with modern facilities and laboratories. Nevertheless, EHDC recognizes the
very complex and delicate nature of the construction activities of this proj-
ect, and therefore will continue to use foreign consultants during the imple-
mentation of the project, as discussed in the succeeding paragraphs. Interna-
tional engineering consultants have also been actively involved in reviewing
project design and resolving specific technical matters related to the dam,
powerhouse, electromechanical equipment, and log passing facilities. A number
of technical delegations and prominent hydropower experts visited the project
site, offered valuable suggestions, and shared their experience with the
Chinese in building large and complex projects.
5.24      EHDC has set up SBC (para. 5.6) to assist in resolving particular
project problems and in advising on major design and construction issues. SBC
has been very active and effective in supporting the project preparation and
procurement of the main civil works. The services of these consultants have
been partially funded by the TCC (para. 5.7). SBC meetings would be regular,
averaging twice a year. An assurance was obtained from EHDC that it would
continue to employ SBC, independent of the designers of the project, for
reviewing designs, technical specifications, and advising on unforeseen prob-
lems that arise during project implementation.



- 33 -
5.25      The TCC also was used to cover the cost of consultants to assist
EHDC with the preparation of cost estimates, scheduling, and the bid documents
for the arch dam and the underground powerhouse. It will continue to be used
for two groups of consultants to assist in the preparation of additional bid
documents; one for the main generating units, and the other for the remaining
electrical equipment.
5.26      Due to the magnitude and complexity of the project and the use of
foreign construction contractors and equipment suppliers, as well as foreign
financing sources, EHDC will appoint experienced and qualified international
consultants who would play a key role in assisting EHDC in managing project
construction. The scope of work for the consultants will include contract
administration, cost control, scheduling, construction inspection and quality
assurance, design engineering services, and construction site administration
during the entire implementation period. A terms of reference for these ser-
vices and details of the expected collaboration with EHDC/eEC and CHIDI are
given in Annex 5.6. An assurance was obtained from EHDC that it would employ,
prior to the award of the contract for the main civil works, construction
management consultants whose qualifications, experience, and terms and condi-
tions of employment shall be satisfactory to the Bank. The total cost of
engineering services and technical assistance is estimated to be about
$52 million, of which $21 million is in foreign exchange. These costs include
about 1.000 staff-months of foreign consultants' services at the cost of about
$20,000 per staff-month, which is considered reasonable for this kind of
highly specialized services. A tabulation indicating the areas of expertise
that will be covered, and the staff-months to be expended each year, are pre-
sented in Annex 5.7.
5.27      In addition to the foregoing consulting services, there will be two
other groups of specialists that will assist EHDC for a successful completion
of the Ertan projectz (i) DRB (para. 5.16) and (ii) the Environmental Panel
(EP). DRB will be set up for the two civil works contracts to enable prompt
resolution of contract disputes and thereby enhance international competition,
reduce bid prices, and expedite construction of the works at lowest cost. One
member uf !hZZ will be appointed by EHDC, one by a contractor, and a third
member will be selected by these two. The decision to create DRB alone is
believed to have reduced bid prices for the main civil works possibly by as
much as $100 million. EP will be made up of foreign and Chinese experts and
is a response to the new Bank directive requiring establishment of such a
panel. Although the EP is not mandatory in this project, EHDC recognizes the
importance of the environment and will apply the Bank's new requirement to the
Ertan project.
5.28      The procedures for inspecting, maintaining, and monitoring the
safety of hydro works and high dams in China generally follow international
practices and are considered to be appropriate for the proposed project.
Nevertheless, in order to ensure the safety of the dam and other hydraulic
structures, an assurance was obtained from EHDC that it would prepare, prior
to completion of the dam, a satisfactory program of maintenance for the proj-
ect works, and that it would undertake regular inspection of the dam and asso-
ciated works and structures in accordance with sound engineetring practices.

Studies
5.29      To complement efforts currently being undertaken under the Bank's
Planning Support and Special Studies Project (para. 2.11), EHDC will carry out
studies of power pricing, operation of the Ertan hydroelectric station and its
reservoir, and preparation of future power projects. The basic objectives of
these studies are as followss
(a) Power Pricing Study. The purpose of this study is tot (i) deter-
mine the cost of electricity generation in the Sichuan power system;
(ii) design a contract for the sale of power and energy from EHDC to
SCEPA; and (iii) formulate an action plan for the reform of tariffs
to the ultimate consumer. The terms of reference for the study are
given in Annex 5.8.
(b)  Optimization of Reservoir Operations.  The object of this study is
to determine how Ertan, with its large reservoir and ability to
operate as a peaking plant, can be best integrated into the existing
system containing many thermal and run-of-river hydro plants. The
terms of reference for the study are presented in Annex 5.9.
(c)  Preparation of Future Power Projects.  The aim of this project com-
ponent is to help prepare EHDC's future power projects, including
the resolution of specific engineering problems in related feasibil-
ity studies. The scope of this work will be established in consul-
tation with the Bank.
The above studies are expected to be completed prior to the start of the sec-
ond-phase. An assu.ance was obtained from EHDC that it would carry out the
studies of power pricing and plant and reservoir operation by not later than
June 30, 1993, in accordance with the terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank.
5.30      To assist in establishing rules and criteria for project structures
and facilities, EHDC will also undertake the following engineering investiga-
tions and testst
(a)  Safety of Structures.  This study work and related tests would
establish rules and regulations for plant operations in order to
comply with the assumptions used in the design of the structures and
works. Inter alia, it will include establishing of survey monuments
and recording devices so that any movement in the structures may be
detected.
(b)  Monitoring of Energy Dissipation Facilities.  This investigation
will help to establish criteria for observing of any deterioration
in the spillways and plunge pool downstream of the spillway, which
may endanger the dam.
(c) Powerhouse Ventilation System. Electrical losses may cause the air
temperature to rise to w'acceptable levels in the underground power-
house. Therefore, this Livestigation will help to establish crite-
ria for designing suitable facilities which would allow operating
personnel to work in comfort.



- 35 -
Most of the work in the foregoing engineering investigations and tests will. b'a
carried out by CHIDI with help from other Chinese consulting experts, together
with specific and special advice from foreign experts, who may not only con-
tribute to the studies, but also review the findings. Details of the scope
and content of the above investigations and tests have been agreed with EHDC.
Management Development and Ttaining
5.31      The newly formed EHDC does not have training facilities of its own,
and to date has been dependant on the recruitment of qualified staff from
other organizations.   With the expectation of the need of a great increase in
technical personnel, EHDC plans to establish its own training facilities, and
a component of the proposed project will assist it in this regard. Foreign
funds have been included to cover the cost of the followings 80 staff-months
of training abroad, including visits to similar projects; 20 staff-months of
foreign lecturers to various classifications of personnel; 120 staff-months of
training in high schools and technical schools; and 106 staff-months of prac-
tical training in similar power plants in China. Details on the EHDC training
program are presented in Annex 3.2. The program also will include training
for financial management and planning staff. To enhance its training capabil-
ities, EHDC will purchase critical training equipment, including a hydropower
station operation simulator, microcomputers, a closed-system television for
student training, linguistic laboratories, and various essential equipment for
high voltage and hydraulic laboratories. It should be noted that all the
international contractors and consultants will have the obligation and duty to
train EHDC engineers and administrators as a part of their services. An
assurance was obtained from EHDC that it would carry out the training program
in accordance with the timetable agreed with the Bank.
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Program
5.32      A comprehensive resettlement plan and program have been prepared by
EHDC and local government authorities who will be responsible for its imple-
mentation. A complete description of the contents and costs of the plan is
presented in Annex 5.10. The objective of the resettlement plan is to rees-
tablish affected people to a better standard of living than before the proj-
ect.
5.33      Approximately 30,000 people will be affected by inundation of the
Ertan reservoir. Resettlement planning has been carried out by EHDC, CHIDI,
the Government of Sichuan Provincial Land Bureau, and the County Land Bureaus,
and City and County Construction Bureaus. Officials as well as private citi-
zens from all affected areas have helped select the new sites and have
inspected them, and development plans for the selected sites have been formu-
lated in collaboration with authorities and representatives of the affected
population.
5.34      The resettlement areas are of three types (see IBRD Map 22093R1).
First, agricultural people in villages where all or most of the arable land
will be inundated and who wish to continue in farming would be relocated to
reclaimed farmlands at Hongge Receiving Area or Pinshan Receiving Area; other
agricultural people would become coal miners at the Hongni Coal Mine. Second,
agricultural people in villages where a few homes and small amounts of arable
lands will be inundated would move to higher elevations away from the reser-



- 36 -
voir in the same village, and arable lands would be reallocated and small land
reclamation works would be undertaken to provide agricultural plots to them.
Third, residents of Yanbian Town will move to the new townsite near Mishiqing
where their places of employment (government offices, factories, businesses,
etc.) will be relocated. Detailed development plans and layouts have been
formulated for Hongge and Pinshan areas and are in progress for the other
receiving areas, and these are described in greater detail in Annex 5.10.
5.35      The resettlement operation will begin with the reclamation, level-
ing, and preparation of land in the new sites. The County Land Bureaus, local
authorities and representatives, and the settlers themselves will collaborate
in this work. The construction of houses and installation of public infra-
structure, including irrigation works, schools, clinics, factories, and no
forth, will follow the land preparation activities. During the construction
of the new settlements the settler families will continue deriving their live-
lihood from the old farms or jobs, and family members working on development
of the new sites will receive a salary. It is expected that income during
this transition period will be adequate. Regarding development opportunities
over the long run, development plans were examined carefully and reviewed
thoroughly with local officials and representatives of the settlers. With
timely implementation, the plans indicate that settlers' livelihoods will be
improved to above preproject levels within a period of two to five years fol-
lowing resettlement.
5.36      EHDC has developed a staff development program for officials respon-
sible for resettlement. Senior officials will participate in workshops and
study tours of other resettlement operations in China and abroad, and then
prepare short courses and workshops for delivery to County and local govern-
ment officials who have responsibilities in the resettlement process. Imple-
mentation of the resettlement program and the achievement of physical targets
will be carefully monitored by EHDC and the Provincial Land Bureau, and the
resultant reports will be discussed with the Bank supervision missions. In
addition, EHDC will subcontract with an independent academic research institu-
tion for monitoring and evaluation of the socioeconomic outcomes of the reset-
tlement operations in the receiving areas. The latter reports will be
reviewed with the Bank annually throughout the life of the project. An assur-
ance was obtained from the Government that it would implement or cause to be
implemented the agreed resettlement program.
Environmental Management Program
5.37      Like all hydroelectric projects planned for Sichuan, the Ertan proj-
ect has relatively benign environmental impacts when compared to thermal
alternatives or to hydropower elsewhere in China; siltation problems are
highly manageable and resettlement requirements are low. The project
displaces about 2,000 people per 1 TWh of output as against 10,000 to 15,000
in Central and East China. Other comparative advantages relate to the avoid-
ance of mining and use of some ten million tons a year of raw coal. First
aspect of such 'avoidance" is the land use associated with coal mining (up to
1,000 ha/year) and second, the land use for thermal power plant estimated at
600 to 2,700 ha excluding the sludge ponds for solid wastes. Lastly, the
project will avoid annually at least 260,000 tons of gaseous and particle
emissions, 1.9 million tons of solid waste and 0.5 million tons of water con-
sumption. If lower quality local coal was used instead of Shanxi coal, sulfur



- 37 -
emissions could be three times as severe and would need to be cut through flue
gas desulfurization costing an additional $500 million (Annex 7.3).
5.38      An Environmental Impact Assessment has been completed for the proj-
ect. Annex 5.11 contains greater detail on the work accomplished to date and
what which has been agreed for the future. The key issues investigated by the
environmental impact assessmbnt include environmental health, catchment area
land use trends and reservoir sedimentation, reservoir water quality and pol-
lution, downstream effects, and impacts on fish and wildlife. Impacts identi-
fied in these areas will either be mitigated through the application of exist-
ing technologies (for example, pollution control measures at the Miyi Sugar
Refinery which will affect water quality in the reservoir) or monitored
closely during project implementation; chances of environmental risks are
considered minimal. For example, schistosomiasis has been eradicated from the
region, but will be systematically monitored by the environmental monitoring
station to be financed under the project.
5.39      The key provision of the environmental management program is the
establishment of the environmental monitoring station. This station will be
charged with monitoring the reservoir and catchment areas including meteoro-
logical, hydrological, water quality, sedimentation, biotic, sanitary and
human health conditions. The EP (para. 5.27) overseeing the program will
annually review the results of the work of the environmental monitoring sta-
tion. An assurance was obtained from EHDC that it would carry out the envi-
ronmental management program in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
Project Risks
5.40      Construction of the proposed project will be a very complex job due
to the geological, hydrological, and physical features of the project and its
location. The project is sited in a narrow gorge with steep slopes, highly
jointed and faulted rock, and occasional landslides. Nevertheless, project
construction risks are within reasonable limits and would be manageable given
the continuous supervision arrangements, involving foreign and Chinese consul-
tants, that have been put in place for the construction process. SBC (para.
5.24) is already involved in reviewing possible physical risks, and it is
proposing means and procedures to mitigate or avoid them. The economic riske,
if any, would be minimal (para. 7.10). Other potential risks could include
the continuity of goods supply, funding shortages, contract management diffi-
culties, and effective implementation of the resettlement program. To mini-
mize these risks and enable timely and effective implementation of the reset-
tlement program, assurances have been received from the Government that it
would ensure an adequate flows of funds, and establish and maintain effective
management of project execution. No major environmental problems are expected
under this project, and the implementation of the proposed environmental man-
agement program (including a monitoring process) would enhance the quality of
the environment in the nearby areas.
Monitoring and ReportinR
5.41      Satisfactory procedures for monitoring, evaluating, and reporting on
the project have been agreed by EHDC. The Bank would be furnished with quar-
terly project progress reports. A Project Completion Report would be submit-
ted to the Bank no later than six months after the completion of the project.



- 38 -
The timely implementation of the project is critical and depends on adequate
financial resources being made available when needed. For this reason, the
project progress reports would include, inter alia, EHDC's proposals regarding
project costs and annual financing plan for the following year as well as the
Government's approved budget allocation for the project. The scope and con-
tent of the project progress reports have also been agreed. A framework for
project monitoring and reporting is presented in Annex 5.12.

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
BackAround
6.1       EHDC is a newly created corporation.  In the foreseeable future, its
activities would be dominated by the construction and subsequent operation of
the proposed project. EHDC's operation and finances are interrelated with
those of SCEPA; all the power generated by SHDC would be sold in bulk to
SCEPA, accounting for about 30 percent of the grid's sales by the year 2000.
As state-owned enterprises, EHDC and SCEPA are bound by the financial regula-
tions established by the Government. Within this framework, the future
finances of EHDC and its sole customer, SCEPA, are forecast to be satisfac-
tory.
6.2       SCEPA, as in the case of most power bureaus in China, follows a
highly centralized financial system (Annex 6.1). As part of the ongoing eco-
nomic reforms, the Government is reassessing the present fiscal system, with
particular focus on tax reform issues and options. Since details of such
reforms are still being formulate3d, there are considerable uncertainties
relating to the specific parame ers affecting the bureaus' future finances.
Nevertheless, in keeping with nie spirit of the recently enacted Enterprise
Law, the integrated measures b the economic reform would be directed at
enhancing rather than impeding the commercial orientation of the state enter-
prises. As a first step toward this direction, EHDC is allowed to retain its
surplus funds to finance its future investments and build up the corporation's
equity base.
6.3       One of the Government's sectoral objectives is to strengthen the
enterprises' financial management so that the power bureaus could perform
their increased fipancial role efficiently and effectively. Toward this end,
the proposed project would continue the process of institutional building
already initiated under previous Bank-financed projects, including (i) the
extension of EHDC's financial planning horizon (para. 3.8); (ii) training in
financial management for EHDC (para. 3.7); and (iii) agreements with EHDC on
financial performance targets which would provide a framework for financial
discipline (para. 6.4).
EHDC's Finances
Financial Performance Targets
6.4       Traditional indicators (such as rate of return on assets and self-
financing ratio) have thus far had limited significance in measuring the per-
formance of power entities operating in a highly centralized financial system.
In particular, their surplus funds are largely remitted to the Government in
the form of Adjustment Tax. Therefore, self-financing ratios have been
largely "notional, for most of the power bureaus in China. On the other hand,
EHDC's surplus funds would not be subject to Adjustment Tax and self-financing
ratio is thus a meaningful indicator of its financial performance. With a
view to promoting prudent financial management, assurances have been obtained
from EHDC regarding-the following financial performance tarietst



- 40 -
(a)  it would take all measures, including but not limited to tariff
adjustments, to ensure that its internal cash generation is suffi-
cient to maintain a self-financing ratio of no less than 20 percent
in 1999,  25 percent in 2000, and 35 percent thereafter;
(b)  it would maintain a debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.3
times in 1999, and no less than 1.5 times thereafter; and
(c)  it would maintain a debtlequity ratio of no more than 82/18 in
1991-97, 80/20 in 1998-99, and 70/30 thereafter.
Future Finances
6.5       As noted above (para. 3.12), agreements have been reached with the
Government regarding the principles of transfer pricing and operating arrange-
ments for the sales contract between MMDC and SCEPA, including allowance for
financial viability of EHDC. Based on the assumptions detailed in Annex 6.2,
including electricity tariff setting which would allow MMDG to achieve the
above financial performance targets, projections of lHDC's finances for the
period 1991-2002 are presented in Annexes 6.3-6.5. Salient features of EHDC's
future finances are highlighted below.

(a)  Revenue Position
6.6       The first two units of the project are scheduled to be commissioned
in 1998, and the remaining four units would become fully operational by the
year 2000. In order to ensure the competitiveness of Ertan power, the finan-
cial forecast has assumed that EHDC's tariff would be about 25 fen/kWh in 1998
(16 fen in end-1990 prices) which approximates the estimate of SCEPA's avoided
cost of power generation; the consequent cash generation is projected to cover
some 90 percent of the debt service requirements. During the first five years
of its operations, the average tariff which would allow EHDC to achieve the



- 41 -
agreed financial performance targets are estimated at 29 fen/kWh in current
terms; this would allow Ertan power to remain competitive.
6.7       As is typical of hydro projects, Ertan hydropower plant is expected
to have relatively low operating expenses. Thus, EHDC is expected to have a
robust revenue position, with a low operating ratio estimated to be no more
than 22 percent during its first five years of operation (1998-2002). Its
average rate of return on net fixed assets is projected to be 20 percent a
year during the same period, which is satisfactory. However, debt service
requirements would be substantial. Specifically, debt service is forecast to
account for an average of about 60 percent of EHDC's minimum revenue
requirements during its first five years of operations.
(b)   Funds Flow
6.8       During the project implementation period (1991-2000), EHDC's finan-
cing plan would be dominated by the proposed project. After commissioning of
the project, EHDC is expected to generate substantial internal cash. This is
attributable not only to its highly profitable position, but also its cost
structure which is dominated by depreciation, a noncash expense and a major
source of Special Funds retention. As SCEPA would be the sole customer and is
expected to maintain a sound liquidity position (para. 6.11), no problem is
envisaged rqgarding -,ollection of payments. However as noted above, the cor-
poration would have a heavy debt service burden; debt service requirements are
forecast to account for some 45 percent of its total uses of funds during its
first five years of operation. Indeed, the projected minimum tariff require-
ments are determined more by the agreed debt service coverage ratios than the
self-financing ratios for future investments.
(c)   Capital Structure
6.9       During project implementation period, compliance with the agreed
debt/equity ratio target would be achieved through Government equity contribu-
tions. An assurance has been obtained from the Government that it would pro-
vide. in a timely manner, the necessary equity to enable EHDC to achieve the
agreed debt/equity ratios during project implementation. Within the first
five years of project operations, EHDC is expected to improve its capital
structure considerably through retention of after-tax profits, special funds
and loan repayments. During the financial forecast period (1991-2002), its
debt/equity ratio is forecast to be reduced from a peak of 81/19 in 1997 to
57/43 in the year 2002.
SCEPA's Finances
Past Finances and Current Financial Position
6.10      SCEPA's income statements and balance sheets for the five-year
period 1986-90 are set out in Annexes 6.6-6.7. During this period, SCEPA's
average sales growth and tariff adjustment were both 7 percent a year. The
sales revenues, which increased by an average of 15 percent a year, were out-
paced by the increases of operating costs of (20 percent a year). As a
result, its rate of return on assets decreased from 10 percent in 1986 to
6.4 percent in 1990. During the same period, SCEPA's capital structure
changed considerably as a result of sharp increases in debt-financed invest-



- 42 -
ments. The company's debt/equity ratio increased from 11189 in 1986 to 59/41
in 1990. Its liquidity position 18 comfortable, as indicated by a current
ratio of about 4 times in end-1990.
Future Finances
6.11      Based on the assumptions detailed in Annex 6.0, including electric-
ity tariff adjustments which would allow SCEPA to achieve similar debt-service
coverage ratios (1.3-1.5 times) as EHDC, projections of SCEPA's finances for
the period 1991-2000 are presented in Annexes 6.9-0.11.  During this period,
SCEPA's operating cost increases (averaging 7 percent a year) would continue
to outpace the growth of electricity sales (6 percent a year). This is mainly
due to sharp increases in both the quantity and costs of purchased powor from
new and more costly thermal plants. Furthermore, its debt service require-
ments would increase rapidly as debt-financed projects commence operations.
In order to achieve the financial performance targets noted above, SCEPA's
average tariff is projected to increase from 10.6 fenlkiWh in 1990 to about
36 fen/kWh in the year 2000, representing an average increase of 12 percent a
year (or 4 percent a year in real terms). With a view to rationalizing both
the levels and structures of electricity tariffs, the pricing study provided
under this project would form the basis for electricity reform in Sichuan
(para. 2.15). SCEPA's liquidity position is expected to remain sound, as
indicated by its current ratio which is forecast to be no less than 4.4 times.

VII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
7.1       The Ertan hydroelectric project ia an important element of the core
expansion program for the power generating system of Sichuan (para. 4.11).
Its size and timing are economically justified. The capacity expansion is
also justified on the basis of the economic benefits associated with the elim-
ination of power shortages and the increase in demand over the period 1998-
2000 when the project will be commissioned and its output used.
7.2       In this chapter, it will be first established that the project is
superior to alternatives, and that its size and timing reasonably maximize
economic benefits. Second, an estimate of the economic rate of return for the
project will be provided. Benefits and costs are evaluated using constant
end-1990 economic prices, net of taxes and subsidies. Tradable commodities
are valued at border prices with a shadow exchange rate of Y 5.5 per US$.
Project as a Least-Cost Generating Alternative
7.3       Least-cost expansion sequences have been planned by SCEPA for the
period 1990-2020 with the help of CHIDI and WREPERI (Beijing). The Ertan
project has been shown to be a part of these sequences under a broad range of
adverse assumptions. increase of discount rate from 10 percent to 12 percent,
20 percent increase in project cost, and load growth reduced from 8.3 percent
to 6.6 percent a year. A base case sequence is presented in Annex 4.5 and
discussed in Chapter IV.  In order to highlight and analyze the project's
comparative advantages, an alternative least-cost expansion sequence has been
optimized without Ertan. This alternative includes both hydroelectric plants
and thermal units using Shanxi coal to substitute for Ertan but less transmis-
sion investments because more generation is located close to load centers than
in the base case. Discounted at 10 percent as of 1998, the date of the proj-
ect's first commercial operation, the present value of costs for this alterna-
tive without the project exceeds that of the base case by about Y 5 billion.
The project comparative advantage corresponds to a net return of 35 US cents
per dollar investeds after inclusion of operating costs, the project unit
cost is 11.6 fen/kWh as compared with about 16 fen/kWh for the alternative.
Details about this avoided cost are given in Annex 7.1 and in the Project
Files.
7.4       Ertan displaces mostly other hydropower projects and those projects
displaced by Ertan in turn allow the postponement of thermal power. By the
year 2000, the project average output of 14.6 TWh will avoid burning annually
some e million tons of raw coal, and 10 million tons when the full project
output of 17 TWh is obtained. The environmental impacts of this substitution
are discussed under para. 5.37. The contribution of Ertan to the firm power
of the Sichuan system is 2,760 MW in the rainy season and 1,000 MW in the dry
season (November to May); the peaking capability is about 3,000 MW in the
rainy season, and 2,400 KW in the dry season. The average annual energy and
firm energy of the project will increase by 20-30 percent when other dams are
built upstream to regulate the strong seasonal variations of the Yalong river.



- 44 -
Prolect Size and Timing
7.5       The project size has been economically optimized:  the design head
has been increased from 150 m in earlier designs to 165 m; as a result, the
rated output has increased from 3,000 MW to 3,300 MW and an additional 840 GMh
can be generated. This change, which costs about Y 50 million will bring
about Y 500 million of fuel savings a year on the Sichuan power grid. Raising
the water head further would not be economically attractive for two reasons:
the reservoir backwater level would rise too high for the next upstream dam to
be built and the number of people to be resettled would greatly increase.
7.6       The project schedule calls for the commissioning of all six units
ovor the period 1998-2000. By themselves, units no. 1 to 3 will deliver all
of the firm power and 10,000 GWh of average output. In present value, the
corresponding supply cost savings amount to about 80 percent of the total, the
costs till this partial commissioning amount to 90 percent of the total; putt-
ing these three units on stream at the earliest possible time entails a net
savings of about 25 US cents per dollar invested.
7.7       Units no. 4 to 6 will generate an additional 4,500 GWh and increase
the peaking capability of the project by 1,200 MW. A postponement of these
units would save lesii than Y 300 million a year in turbogenerators and trans-
mission facilities, but it would translate into additional fuel costs of the
same magnitude elsewhere on the grid; thus even if load growth was to fall
well below expectations and additional peaking capacity was not immediately
needed, the installation of the last three units would still be economically
justified on the basis of fuel savings alone.
Project Benefits
7.8       In appraising power projects, it is customary to value the project
output on the basis vZ the consumer's minimum willingness to pay, as evidenced
by existing or covenanted power tariff levels. However, this approximation
generally underestimates the value of electricity because, for many customers,
power demand is rather inelastic to prices. This is particularly the case in
China; one manifestation of which is the economic cost of power rationing,
which is imposed daily to industries in Sichuan, at an average level of about
150 fenlkWh. There are otherwise few power tariffs at the generating plant
level to provide a benchmark of this willingness to pay. The tariff levels
covenanted under this project result in an internal economic rate of return
(IERR) of 14.9 percent. 'When project costs are not shadow pticed, the IERR is
15.4 percent.
7.9       A more representative measure of the project IERR can be obtained
from the price level recently elicited by new thermal plants which were built
as part of a special effort to alleviate power shortages in Sichuan. Such
prices are a better reflection of the willingness to pay. This is the case of
Jiangyou (660 MW) and Luohuang (720 MW) which in 1991 will start selling power
in bulk at 21 fen/kWh (at early 1991 prices). On that basis, the project IERR
is 17.5 percent. If the inputs are not shadow-priced, the IERR approaches
18 percent. Details of the calculations are given in Annex 7.2.



- 45 -
Sensitivity Analysis
7.10      The major economic risks associated with the project can be based on
either one of the following causess (a) the project suffers serious cost
overruns; (b) commissioning of the first units is delayed significantly; and
(c) some of the expected growth in power demand fails to materialize. The
possible change in power demand has been shown not to affect the timing of all
98.x units, let alone the viability of the project. A one-year delay would
postpone the project benefits, but also, some project costs. Assuming that
this delay is combined with cost overruns equal to the 12 percent physical
contingencies provisioned for the project as a whole, the IERR is reduced by
one percentage point. The likelihood of further cost overruns is minimized by
the advanced stage and selected method of procurement, and by the low share of
resettlement in the total cost. If a 20 percent cost increase was to occur,
the IERR would again be reduced by one percentage point.

enhance EHDC's managerial, technical, and financial capabilities. EHDC is
still in a formative stage, recruiting its staff from other entities, such as
the Lubuge Project Construction Kanagement, Yangtze Valley Planning Office
(Three Gorges Project), CHIDI, construction companies experienced in large
high dams, and research institutions. Ertan is a very challenging and attrac-
tive project and no problems have been experienced so far in employing high
caliber managerial and technical staff. The main objectives of the program
ares
(a) to enable EMDC to function as an autonomous specialized entity in
the efficient and accelerated development of hydropower resources In

E. Financial Management Training
Background
5.        As state-owned enterprises, the power entities are bound by the
financial regulations established by GOC and the financial system has thus far
been highly centralized. Until the recent economic reform, these enterprises
were essentially operating arms of the government and financial responsibili-
ties/autonomy were very limited; investments were largely funded by government
grants and the entities' surplus funds were mostly remitted to the government.
Indeed, the function of finance at these enterprises essentially has been
confined to financial reporting; managerial orientation and modern treasury
tunctions (such as cash and debt management) are lacking. Further, under the
present Chinese system, heavy emphasis ls placed on the annual budget as a
controlling tool, but financial planning generally is not undertaken beyond
one year.  Within the present institutional framework, the power bureaus have
performed satisfactorlly.

Page 4
S.        Under the ongoing economic and enterprise management reforms in
China, the institutional framewore  is becoming less centralized with corre-
sponding Increases In financial autonomy and responsibility for decision-mak-
ing at the state enterprise level. Reforms of the funding arrangements
between GOC and the state enterprises continue to evolve. As a first major
step, investments are being financed more by debt (mainly domestic loans) than
by government grants. For most of the Bank-financed power entities, the Bank
loan represents their first foreign borrowings; it is also novel for ','at of
these entities to bear the related foreign exchange risks.  Sepsratr ly, ini-
tiatives are being taken to improve financial management and control. These
initiatives include introducing computer applications and establishing an
internal auditing function. However, these initiatives are at an initial
stage o' implementation and are limited in secope. In order to perform their
A'qcroased role efficiently and effectively, power bureaus will need to
strengthen their financial management, particularly with respect to planning,
cost control and debt management. Under the various Bank-financed power oper-
ations in China, provisions have been made for training in financial manage-
ment. These training activities are centrally managed by M0E/SEIC. Recently
a training seminar conducted by Price Waterhouse (US and Hong gong) was held
in Chengdu. In addition, overseas training was conducted by Electricite de
France. Finally, the Bank recently organized a seminar in Hangzhou to provide
an overview on corporate planning and financial management information sys-
tems.
Objectives
7.        The main participants in the financial management training would be
officials from the finance/accounting and planning departments of the various
Bank-financed power entities. The training activities are designed to famil-
iarize these officials with selected topics in the modern financial management
of power utilities, covering both operation and project construction. This
objective would be achieved through a series of training seminars in China,
overseas training and study tours. Initial training activities would aim at
providing a general overview of the selected topics. Subsequent training
activities would build on the earlier experiences and provide in-depth discus-
sions of the topics which are of particular importance and interest to the
participants.
Scove
8.        Two related and complex subjects, tariff design and system planning,
are being covered separately under Bank Group-financed studies. The major
topics of financial management training are outlined below.
I. Financial Control, Monitoring, and Evaluation
9.        For (i) operation; and (ii) project construction:
-   budgeting units and organization of responsibility centers;
-   transfer pricing, joint cost allocation;
-   perrormance indicators for monitoring and control;



-9                          ANNEX 3.2
Page 5
- methodology and procedure for cost management, including cost
accountingt cost of service analyses which could in turn provide the
basis for tariff design; budget preparation and control; assessment
of potential cost savings as well as stock management; and
- organization and procedures for internal controls, including inter-
nal auditing and operationallmanagement audit.
II. Long-Term Financial Planning
-   methodology of long-term financial forecasting;
-   project financial evaluation;
- coordination with investment planning and reiteration with capital
budgeting;
-   project financing, including various instruments of financing, debt/
equity structuring, foreign debt management--including evaluation of
different financing terms (covering different currencies, interest
rates, maturities, grace periods, etc.), strategies and instruments
to minimize foreign exchange risks.
1II. State-of-the-art in Financial Management Techni_qes
-   including computer applications for billing and stock management,
financial reporting, budgeting, long-term financial planning, con-
trol and management information system.
IV. International Accouuting Standards
Selected topics which are of particular relevance and interest to
the power bureaus, including for examplet
(a)   consolidated financial statements--Chinese accounting practice is
not to consolidate capital construction accounts with production
accounts. However, in order to provide an overall view of the
power bureau's financial position, agreements have been reached
with the various Bank-financed power bureaus that the financial
statements furnished to the Bank would consolidate the capital
construction accounts with production accounts;
(b)   cash flow statements or statement of changes in financial posi-
tion--they are not required for financial reporting in China. To
facilitate financial analysis and management by the power bureaus,
agreements have been reached with the Bank-financed power bureaus
that such statements would be prepared and furnished to the Bank.
(c)   accounting for construction contracts;
(d)   information reflecting the effects of changing prices--this would
become increasingly significant as inflation recently has esca-
lated sharply in China; and

ANNE$ 3.2

(e)   accounting for the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates--
current Chinese accounting practice is an anomaly in this respect.
V. Contract Manapement
-   commercial aspects of bidding documents, contract terms including
financial claims.

ERTAN HYDROELECTRIC PMOJECT
Project Description
1.        The proposed project consists of the Ertan Hydroelectric Station,
resettlement of about 30,000 people, an environmental management program and a
science station, technical assistance and consulting services, studies and
staff training, with an objective to provide a reliable supply of electric
power to consumers in Southwest China.
Ertan Hydroelectric Station
2.        The Ertan hydroelectric power station will be a major project in a
series of power stations to be built on the Yalong river. With an installed
capacity of 3,300 MW and an annual production of 17 TVh, the main purpose of
the project is power generation. The power station will include a 240 m high
concrete arch dam, two tunnel spillways, an overflow spillway, mid- and low-
level outlet works, a plunge pool and a tunnel for conveying logs around the
dam. The underground power complex consists of an intake structure, water
conductors, a power chamber, a transformer chamber, a tailrace surge chamber,
and two tail race tunnels. Power will be transmitted through four 500 kV
transmission lines to the Sichuan provincial grid.
3.        Project Location and Geology.  The project is located in the south
west of Sichuan Province, 33 km upstream from the river mouth near Panzhlhua
City, an important iron and steel industrial base. The damsite is 730 km by
railroad south of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan. The Tonguilin railroad
station on the Chengdu-Kunming railway is 28 km downstream from the damaite.
In an area of high mountains and deep canyons, the Ertan gorge is composed of
Permian basalt with large intrusions of syenite, a granite-like rock. The
dameite is formed by a deep, narrow gorge with the mountains on both sides
rising to heights of 300 to 400 meters. The Yalong River has a width of 80 to
100 meters during the dry season. Overburden in the river bed at the dameite
is generally 20 to 30 m thick. Local geologic mapping started in 1972. A
large amount of geologic exploration and investigation was accomplished with
571 boreholes totaling 30,450 m, and 8,130 X of adits with four shafts adding
another 200 meters. Numerous tests have been conducted to determine rock
mechanics parameters for design and stability analyses. The site is in an
area with an earthquake potential of 7 MM.
4.        Climate and Hydrology.  The climate of the river basin shows dis-
tinct dry and wet seasons. It is dry from November to April. From May to
October, the southwest monsoon prevails and the weather is warm and humid.
Temperatures range from OOC to 40.8C, with an average of 19.70C. River water
temperatures vary from 6.0 to 22.50C with a mean of 14.60C. The Yalong River
has a length of 1,500 km with a drainage area of 130,000 kmt. Over its down
stream length of 350 km, the river has a hydraulic head of 990 m and an esti-
mated exploitable potential of 11,000 HW, making it one of China's ten princi-
pal hydro power bases. Ettan will be the firet project for the initial stage

of development on this stretch of the river. A gaging network was established
in 1953. The closest station near Ertan at Xiaodeshi, 12 km downstream from
the dameite, has collected streamflow data continuously since 1953. The long-
term average streamflow at the damaite is 1,570 in/s and the mean annual run-
off there amounts to 52.7 billion ms. The reservoir has a total capacity of
5.8 billion ma and an effective capacity of 3.37 billion mi. With a normal
pool level at the dam at El. 1,200 the reservoir will extend 145 km upstream.
Based on the available data it is considered that the reservoir will be
secure and safe from leakages and disruptive land slides. The maximum flood
recorded at the damsite was 11,100 m9/s on August 1, 1965. The minimum flow
of 353 m8/s occurred on March 15, 1984. The design flood (1,000 year) has
been established at 20,500 m5/I, check flood (5,000 year) at 23,850 m Is.
Since the 1970s, the sediment load in the river has 'ncreased due to defores-
tation for land reclamation and road construction. Mean annual suspended load
at Xiaodeshi is 28.4 million tons.
5.        Arch Dem. The double-curvature arch dam will have a maximum height
of 240 m, a crest length of 775 m, and a concrete volume of 4.20 million ma.
Maximum thickness at the base of the crown is 55.7 m, base thickness to height
ratio is 0.23, and the span to height ratio is 2.82. The static analysis of
the arch dam was carried out with a trial-load type program and its results
were verified by finite element analysis and structural model tests. Dynamic
analyses were also carried out by the trial-load method. Stresses were com-
puted for normal, unusual, and extreme loading conditions. Normal Loading
(N.L.) is normal reservoir elevation plus dead load, design temperature drop,
and silt loading. Unusual Loading (U.L.) is normal load with maximum reser-
voir level due to flood p;ssing. Extreme Loading (E.L.) is normal loading
plus seismic loading. The maximum stresses are shown below:

These streoses were obtained using the trial load method. The results of the
finite element analysis show a similar stress distribution for both static and
dynamic loading conditions. Local stress concentrations occur in the vicinity
of the openings, but the overall stress distribution and the structural behav-
lor of the dam are not affected.   The dead weight stresses during construc-
tion are vithin the allowable stresses.

6.        Concrete Placement.  In view of the location of the dam in a narrow
valley, concrete placement will be achieved by means of two sets of high-speed
cableways located at different levels. These cableways will also handle the
heavy parts of the metal structures for gates and outlet works. Concrete in
the dam will be placed in 1.5 and 3 m lifts in 39 blocks separated by contrac-
tion joints spaced at about 30 m. There is no longitudinal joint. Extensive
tests have been performed to determine concrete properties. Three zones of
concrete strength will be used. A large number of instruments will be embed-
ded in the concrete of the dam, including direct and Inverted plumb lines. A
network of observation posts and targets for geodetic measurements surround
the damsite. Instruments will mcnitor temperatures duriaig construction and
check the structural behavior oi Coe arch dam during and after construction.
7.        Dam Foundation.  Parametric analyses were performed to evaluate the
stability of the abutments of the dam against sliding failures of rock wedges.
Detailed investigations were carried out for the two most critical wedges on
both abutments. The results of the analyses indicate that joint sets with low
dips downstream and towards the river are the critical planes for stability.
The semi-radial foundation of the arch dam will be excavated generally to
slightly weathered rock. Lightly to moderately weathered rock will be ade-
quate after consolidation grouting. A grout curtain and a drainage curtain
are provided to minimize and control seepage flow around and underneath the
dam. On the left abutment, this curtain is continuous with a similar curtain
upstream of the powerhouse chamber. Drainage adits and drainage curtains are
arranged downstream of the main curtain at a distance of about 10 meters.
Foundation galleries in the dam, and grouting and drainage adits in the abut-
ments are provided to facilitate drilling and grouting operations. These
will serve also if remedial work in the future is necessary.
8.        Energy Dissipation.  Because of the relatively small size of the
reservoir, limited flood storage capacity, and a narrow gorge downstream,
floods have to be released frequently and energy dissipation problems are
potentially serious. In order to provide a safe spillway operation, an
arrangement with three spillways was adopted. This will enable discharge of
floods up to about 13,000 ma/s (30-year flood) over two spillways in the event
the third is not available. The three impact zones are senarate, and each
spillway can operate independently of the other two. The overflow spillway on
the dam coneists of seven 11 m-wide openings controlled by radial gates
(11 x 11.5 m). The openings are provided with differential flip buckets and
dental sills to spread the impact pattern and reduce impact pressures on the
base slab of the 300 m-long plunge pool. The thickness of the slab varies
from five meters at the upstream end to three meters over most of its length
to the downstream auxiliary dam.
9.        The tunnel spillway in the right abutment consists of an intake
structure and two concrete lined tunnels 887.0, and 1,150.8 m-long with a
modified horseshoe section. The intake structure contains two operating
radial gates (13 x 15 m) and two emergency closure gates (13 x 17 m).  The
flow velocities reach a maximum value of about 45 mWs at the exit. Aeration
grooves are provided to mitigate against cavitation damage. The flip buckets
are designed to spread the Impact zone in the river. The mid-level outlets
consist of six steel-lined openings through the dam, controlled by 6 x 5 m
radial gates at the downstream face. Different exit angles spread the area of

ANNEX 5.1
Page 4
impact in the plunge pool. The emergency gates at the upstream face are nor-
mally closed and will be opened only during the flood releasing periods. Four
low-level outlet works with inverts at El. 1,080 are provided for lowering the
reservoir. The steel-lined openings are controlled by 3.0 x 5.0 m slide gates
and hydraulic hoists at the downstream end. The gates are designed for opera-
tion with a head of 80 m. Each opening also has a 3.0 x 8.5 m emergency wheel
gate at the upstream end, which is normally closed.
10.       Undergtround Powerhouse.  The power complex, located some 200 to
350 m underground, in the left abutment, consists of three large chambers for
power generation, transformers and tailrace surge action. The six 550 MW
turbine generators are each fed by separate 9.00 m internal diameter concrete
lined water conduits. The 85 m-high intake structure will be provided with a
set of trashracks, 7 x 9 m slide gates with hydraulic cylinder hoists, and
7.32 x 9.30 m bulkhead gates operated by a gantry crane. The water conduits
are steel lined along the lower elbows and the lower horizontal section imme-
diately upstream of the power chamber. The excavated dimensions of the power
chamber are 191.9 m-long, 25.5 m-wide and 65.0 m-high.  The total length of
power chamber plus erection and service bays will be 280.29 m. The axis of
the power chamber is oriented to bisect the angle with the two predominant
sets of joints, which facilitates efficient layout of all hydraulic features
of the power generation system. The rock in the area of the three underground
chambers is mainly syenite with some altered basalt. The compressive strength
ranges from 1,500-2,600 kg/cm2. A maximum insitu stress of 200-300 kg/cm2 has
been measured. Two- and three-dimensional finite element analyses have been
performed to study stresses due to construction. These demonstrated that the
rock is stable with appropriate measures of rock bolting and shotcreting dur-
ing construction. Prestressed rock anchors will be provided for permanent
stability of the high walls in the power chamber.
11.       Transformer Chamber.  The six main transformers and the SF6 equip-
ment are located in the transformer chamber, which is 214.9 m-long, 18.3 m-
wide and 19.5 m-high. The power chamber and transformer chamber are connected
by six bushbar galleries and both are connected to the access road on the left
abutment by a 1,340 m-long access tunnel, 10 m-wide and 8 m-high.  Service and
emergency access to the power chamber are also provided by means of an eleva-
tor in the service bay which connects with the access road to the crest of the
dam. A bus tunnel leads from the transformer chamber to the outgoing trans
mission line yard near the top of the left abutment of the arch dam.
12.       Surge Chamber.  The tailrace surge chamber is downstream of the
transformer chamber at a distance of 30 meters. This chamber has a length of
203.0 m, a vidth of 19.8 m, and varies in height from 71.3 m to 66.0 m. Below
El. 1,027, the surge chamber is divided into two parts by means of a concrete
wall. Draft tube gates are provided for each unit and are operated from a
mevable hoist in the surge chamber.
13.       Log-Passing Facilities.  The Yalong River Basin is rich in forest
reserves which are economically important to Sichuan Province. Every year
from June to September a large number of logs drift down the river from the
felling area to Panzhihua and downstream cities on the Yangtze. The log-pass-
ing facility will have a design capacity of 1.1 million cubic meters of timber
during a three-month period. The overall length of the system will be 2,394 m

Page 5
and will include a tunnel section 819 m-long, with a height of 7.0 and a width
of 15.0 m.
14.       River Diversion.  The diversion scheme consists of one concrete-
lined tunnel on each abutment 17 m-wide and 23 m-high.  Intake and outlet
structures are provided for each, with closure gates at each intake. The
downstream portion of the left bank tunnel will be utilized as the downstream
part of tailrace tunnel No. 2. Non-overflow, fill-type cofferdams complete
the diversion scheme. The design capacity of the scheme is 13,500 m'Is for a
30-year flood. A risk-based optimization study was carried out to determine
the height of the upstream cofferdam. This included identification of events
that led to overtopping and an evaluation of their likelihood of occurrence,
followed by a determinatiot of the consequences of overtopping, calculation of
risk costs and, finally a comparison of these costs with the cost of construc-
tion to determine the least overall project cost. Four 4 x 8 m temporary
sluice ways, equipped with closure gates and hoists, will be provided In the
lower central portion of the arch dam to be used after closure of the diver-
sion tunnel. The openings will be sized for a waximum dry season discharge of
1,500 m8as during the period from mid-November to the end of May.

Transmission Lines
16.       The 500 kV transmission lines to carry power from the generating
station to the Sichuan system are not part of the project, and will be con-
structed by SCEPA. China has over ten years of experience using this voltage
and its introduction here is needed not only for Ertan but has been dictated
by system requirements. As a result, the 500 kV line from Zigong to
Chengjiaqiao is scheduled for completion in 1992, and the Baozhusi-Longwang
line in 1993. Power from the generating station will be transported from the
underground gas insulated switchgear (CIS) station via 500 kV dry type cable
to a small switchyard on the surface, and thence to the first transmission
line tower.   The first 2,000 KW is destined for Chongging and two routes are
being considered (see map). In the first stage, two circuits on the northern
route are confirmed. One assumption is to use four circuits on this route,
and the other is to use the southern route for the two additional circuits.
This southern route does not rise to the high altitudes of the northern route
where the line would be subject to severe icing conditions. However, the
southern route is about 100 km longer. SCEPA will finalize its studies by
June 1991, and expects to receive approval by December 1991. The cross-sec-
tions of the transmission conductors will be 4 x 240 mm2/phase, and each cir-
cuit will be mounted on separate towers. The development program for the
500 kV network is presented in Annex 4.6.
Environmental Impact and Human Resettlement
17.       The Report on the Environmental Impact of the Ertan Hydroelectric
Station has been prepared and approved by the relevant Chinese authorities.
Necessary measures will be taken to protect the environment, prevent excessive
felling of forest trees, soil erosion and pollution during the construction
and resettlement of the population and existing factories and mines. It is
estimated that about 30,000 people will be affected by the power station con-
struction and its reservoir creation. The aim of fair indemnification is to
provide a former owner with the same or a better economic situation than he or
she had prior to flooding or influencing his or her property. EHDC with the
assistance of provincial authorities has started solving resettlement matters.
Details of the environmental impact and human resettlement are given in
Annexes 5.10 and 5.11. An Environmental Science Station will be created to
conduct environmental monitoring studies throughout the life of the project.
Engineering Services
18.       A new company, the Ertan Engineering Corporation (EEC) has been
formed under the overall direction of EHDC has been formed to be the Engineer
on the project. EEC's responsibility is the overall management of the project
with the objective to construct a quality project at a reasonable price, and
to complete the project on or ahead of schedule. The Manager and Chief Engi-
neer of the Corporation will also be the Deputy General Manager of EHDC. He
will be assisted by project managers responsible for the following: dam and
surface works, underground works, mechanical and electrical equipment, techni-
cal administration, purchasing, and administration. The basic engineering
services are being provided by the CHIDI which is well organized and competent
in the design of hydroelectric power projects. CHIDI is also assisted by
other Chinese institutions associated with MOE. In the initial stages, for-

eipn consultants provided assistance as well as a Special Board of Consultants
(SBC)l they will continue to do so during the project. EHDC also retained the
services of consultants to assist in the preparation of the civil bid docu-
ments, and the project cost estimate. These consultants also will assist in
the analysis and evaluation of the bids. Also, consultants will be hired to
assist in preparing bid documents for the generating equipment and the special
electrical equipment. EHDC and its Engineer (EEC) lack experience in interna-
tional contract management, and will engage foreign consultants to assist them
in the construction management of the project. The activities and scope of
the construction management activities are presented in Arnex 5.6. In addi-
tion two more groups of consultants will be retained. One, the Disputes
Review Board, has the potential to promptly resolve disputes and claims, and
the other, an Environmental Panel, will ensure that the agreements reached on
environmental matters will be properly carried out during the project.
Management Development and Training
19.       Although the training of staff will concentrate on the technical
subjects, personnel in all departments including finance and personnel will
also receive appropriate training, so as to prepare EHDC for the efficient
operation of its facilities. SCEPA staff also would be included where appro-
priate.  The program would include overseas training, lectures by foreign
experts, local high and technical school courses, and a supply of training
aids. These would involve about 200 people trained locally and abroad and 50
expatriate instructors. Funds earmarked for training could be used for sup-
porting attendance at various international professional conferences and pro-
moting local research and development activities related to improvements in
the power system.
Studies
20.       Power Pricing Study.  This study would be carried out in two parts:
(a) to determine the cost of generation in the Sichuan System in order to
design a contract between EHPC and SCEPA, and (b) to analyze trans mission and
distribution costs in order to calculate new tariff rates to the ultimate
consumer. It has been agreed between GOC and the two parties that the follow-
ing principles would applys
(a)  the price level would ensure financial success of EHDC;
(b) all Ertan energy would be fully dispatchable by SCEPA;
(c) the price of Ertan energy would be competitive with SCEPA energy, if
it were to develop its own facilities; and
(d)  the pricing will reflect Ertan's ability to provide peaking capacity
as well as secondary energy.
21.       The Terms of Reference (TOR) for this study are presented in
Annex 5.8. The study will be carried out by Chinese experts and will take
about two years to complete. Therefore, a start should be made immediately so
that the results are available before the appraisal of the possible second
Ertan loan and the transmission network.

Page 10
22.       Optimal Power Plant and Reservoir Operation.  When Ertan begins
operation, the Sichuan system will increase from about 15,000 KW to 18,000 MV
in generation capability--a jump of about 22?. Therefore, it is important to
study the effect of Ertan's peaking capability and large reservoir, on the
existing system made up of many thermal and run-of-river hydro plants. Opera-
tional rules and utilization policies of the storage reservoir need to be
established in order to take full advantage of the facility and to operate it
at the highest efficiency level. The TOR for the study are given in
Annex 5.9.
23.       Preparation of Future Power Projects.  Studies and investigations
related to the preparation of the future EHOC's power project would be carried
out as requested by the Chinese authorities. These would be done mostly by
the Chinese institutions supported, where necessary, by the qualified profes-
sional foreign consultants.
24.       Safety of Structures.  EHDC intends to set up a Hydraulic Structures
Branch to record all construction details, including the effect on each 1e-
ment of the facility during the filling of the reservoir. This study will
form tl'e basis for all records and recordings taken during the life of the
power complex. Rules and regulations for plant operation will be established
on the basis of observed readings, and will be adjusted whenever circumstances
require. In this regard, the Bank has been given China's criteria for the
monitoring of dame, which have been based on the recommendations of the Inter-
national Congress on Large Dams. The SBC will be asked for its opinion on
China's criteria for dam safety inspection.
25.       Monitoring of Energy Dissipation Facilities.  This study work is
intended to form the basis for monitoring the energy dissipation facilities
downstream of the spillways so that any deterioration may be immediately
noticed and appropriate action taken.
26.       Optimization of Underground Powerhouse Ventilation.  China has lim-
ited experience in designing of ventilating systems for underground power-
houses. This specific investigation therefore is designed to ensure the com-
fort and safety of personnel operating the underground powerhouse.

URTAN HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
CONSTRUCTION MANAGEHENT SnRVICES
Draft Terms cf Reference
A. Description of Project
1.        The multipurpose Ertan Hydroelectric Project is one of a series of
power stations on the Yalong River and it will be developed mainly for power
generation with a total installed capacity of 3,300 MM. The dam site is
located on the lower reaches of the Yalong River at a distance approximately
46 km from Panzhihua City. The dam site is accessible by highway from
Panthihua via Tong:ilin which is 17 km downstream from the da  site.
Tongsilin is a railway s'stion on the Chengdu-Kunaing Railway 727 km from
Chengdu and 373 km from Kunming. The closer airports to the project site are
Chengdu airport and Kunming airport. Regular direct flights to and from
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong are available at both the aforesaid
airports. The detailed description of the project will be made available to
the selected consultant.
B. General
2.        The overall responsibility for the development and construction of
the Ertan Hydroelectric Project has been assigned to the Ertan Hydroelectric
Development Corporation (EHDC) and its engineering branch the Ertan Engineer-
ing Corporation (EEC), who is the designated project engineer.
3.        Due to the magnitude and complexity of the project and because of
the intended use of foreign construction contractors and foreign equipment
suppliers, international type contractual arrangements, and foreign financing
sources, EHDC would appoint an international consultant to assist in construc-
tion management and work closely with EEC and Chengdu Hydroelectric Investiga-
tion and Design Institute (CHIDI).
4.        These draft terms of reference have been prepared as an outline of
the scope of work required. The consultant should elaborate on his proposed
scope of work and may modify the required activities based on his own find-
ings, specifying any reasons for the modifications. The TORe should be
amended before sending them to the consultants to specify clearly responsibil-
ities and roles of foreign and local consultants, as well as consultants who
will be selected to assist in the finalization of bidding documents for elec-
tromechanical equipment. The scope of work will include the following basic
tasks:
(a) Management Requirements During Construction;
(b) Contract Administration;



- 104 -                          AUNN  5.6
Page 2
(c) Construction Inspection and Quality Assurance
(d) Design Engineering Services; and
(e) Construction Site Administration.
These above tasks are described in more detail in the ensuing paragraphs.
C. Management Requirements During Construction
S.        The consultant and EEC will form an organization for managing and
coordinating all aspects of the design and construction of the works. This
organization will be designated as the Construction Manager (CM) which will
report to EHDC. However, the CM should be independent in its professional
activities. The foreign consultant will be the lead firm and as such will be
responsible for carrying out the policies established by EEDC, and for the
*day to day* running of the project. The goal of the CM will .e to build a
safe, reliable project on schedule and within the planned budget.
6.        The principal management responsibilities of the CM organization
are:
Contract administration, including control of costs, schedule
monitoring and coordination, change control, communication and
document control, and the establishment of corresponding proce-
dures.
*     Construction inspection and quality assurance, including site
survey, construction inspection, and inspection in manufacturers'
facilities to confirm the compliance with the drawings and speci-
fications.
v     Design engineering services, including preparation of material and
equipment specifications, construction drawings, incorporation of
design changes, review of contractor and manufacturer submittals,
record drawings and review board support.
e     Site administration services, including safety, camp management,
inventory control, office services, project services, etc.
ESDC will arrange for land acquisition, reservoir clearance, relocations and
resettlement and power transmission.
D. Contract Administration
7.        Timely completion of construction of the Ertan Hydroelectric Project
will require the satisfactory performance and completion of each part of the
works by a number of contractors and suppliers. It will be the responsibility
of the CM to coordinate and administer the work of each of these parties to
bring about successful completion of the works. The CM organization will
therefore be structured to enable a safe and reliable project to be con-
structed within budget and on schedule. This is the primary aim of the orga-
nization for project construction. Checke and safeguards will be set up to



-105 -                         ANNE  5.6
Page 9
monitor the technical adequacy, quality, costs and progress of each contrac-
tor, and te provide management with information for early corrective action if
required.
8.        The main responsibilities of CM in the area of Contract Administra-
tion include the followtitg
(a)   Control of Costs.  Under the various contracts, the CM is respon-
sible for measuring and certifyiug the works for the purpose of
making interim and final payments to the contractors and suppli-
ers. Inspection, testing, and approval of the contractor's mate-
rials and workmanship will be required prior to certification.
At the construction site, the physical dimensions of the various
parts of the structures will be measured or verified by the CM
inspection staff as part of their routine checks for compliance
with the designs and specifications. Reports of concrete place-
ment, reinforcement steel and form= rk check-outs for each place-
ment, and other construction items must be compiled daily by the
inspectors in the field. This daily information must be made
accessible to the con tract administrators in order for them to
check the interim accounts submitted by the construction contrac-
tors, to agree with contractors on interim measurements, and to
issue interim payment certificates.
Computation for the final measurement of excavation, structure or
section will be undertaken by staff on site as soon as all the
necessary information is available. Each contractor will almost
certainly undertake his own independent measurements, and the CM
contract administrators must investigate and reconcile any dis-
crepancies and arrive at an agreed final measurement. Progress
payments for the various supply contracts will be certified after
the CM confirms the percentage of each unit completed by the manu-
facturer, or on the basis of defined milestones in the manufactur-
ing or testing program.
Completion, maintenance and final payment certificates will be
required for the various contracts. Rigorous tests will be under
taken before final acceptance certificates are issued for mechani-
cal and electrical plants, and each final payment will not be
certified until the CM is satisfied that the contractor has met
his obligations. These obligations include completion of all
tasks such as cercification, record drawings, reports and data
submittals.
(b)   Schedule Monitoring and Coordination.  Once a contract has been
awarded for any of the construction or supply contracts, the con-
tractor will prepare a detailed construction schedule. Each con-
tract will have defined dates by which the various critical stages
of the project must be completed, and each contractor will have
the freedom to prepare his own schedule for approval within these
defined dates. This schedule may or may not be the construction
schedule that has been used for pre-tender planning purposes, or



-106 -                          ANNEX 5.6
Page 4
the construction schedule submitted with the contractor's tender.
However, once this schedule is reviewed and approved by the CM, it
will form the basis on which the contractor's performance will be
monitored.
The CM also will be responsible for ensuring that the schedule for
each part of the work performed by each contractor meshes with the
schedule for other parts of the work performed by other contrac-
tors. Each contractor's incentive to keep on schedule may be
affected by interference and delays which the contractor may con-
sider attributable to others. The management role of the CM
therefore will include checking of all interfaces between the
various contractors and monitoring the progress of each of the
contracts very closely.
The key to managing the schedule of a fast moving construction
project is to have accurate and up-to-date information in a form
that will enable any factors that could delay progress to be iden-
tified early, so that measures can be taken to avoid or overcome
the delays.
(c)   Change Control.  The organization must be equipped to facilitate
settlement of disputes and claims within the terms of the con-
tract, since the contractors will inevitably argue that in a num-
ber of instances extra payment or an extension of time for comple-
tion is justified. A detailed analysis must be made for every
such claim that is formally submitted which evaluates its merits
in accordance with the Contract; this analysis must be made avail-
able to the Disputes Review Board.
(d)   Communication ano Document Control.  Crucial to effective contract
administration will be the flow and control of correspondence to
and from the contractors. This correspondence will include cer-
tifications, schedules, material deliveribs, submittals and con-
tractual correspondence. Computers will be used to record and
process all the data rapidly so that it can be used for daily
planning and for rapid evaluation of disputes with the contrac-
tors.
(e)   Corresponding Establishment of Procedures.  The performance of
these duties will require a set of procedures to be established to
effectively exercise control of the project without introducing
avoidable costs or delays. These procedures will encompass all
aspects of contract administration including measurement and pay-
ment, schedule control, cost control, certifications, management
of correspondence, preparation and issuance of change orders,
inspection, testing, information for decision making, site admin-
istration services, compliance with drawings and specifications,
and handling of claims formally submitted by the contractors.

E. Construction Inspection and Quality Assurance
9.        The CM organization will be responsible for developing and executing
the inspection and testing program to ensure that each item which forms a part
of the permanent works has been constructed in accordance with the design and
construction specifications. This program should include inspection of mate
rials and equipment produced off-site in various suppliers' shops as well as
inspection of on-site work.
(a) Site Surveys. The CM will provide survey teams to check the con-
tractors' basic layouts and to establish and maintain a permanent
network of monuments and markers for precise measirement of defor-
mations. The survey teams will also spot check local survey con-
trols established by the contractors for setting formwork, etc.
(b)   Construction Inspection.  At the construction site, inspection
services must be maintained whenever work is in progress. For
much of the constru'tion period, full coverage will be required
for 24 hours per day and six days per week.
Backfills will be controlled by moisture content and density
tests, and concrete by aggregate gradation, slump, air content,
temperature and compression tests. These laboratory procedures
will be supplemented by field procedures such as nuclear density
gauges and Swi8s Hlamer tests as well as inspections of the place-
ment of reinforcing steel, embedments, and form location and accu-
racy. In addition, welds will be inspected and tested with the
latest radiographic equipment and techniques. This program should
be based upon routine quality control measurements which, after
processing, will provide a record of trends and enable early
adjustments and corrections to be made if necessary. The program
wist measure and record what is done and process this data so that
the design parameters can be checked and usable records developed
for future safety appraisals.
(c)   Inspection in Manufacturers' Facilities.  The quality assurance
pro gram will also incorporate audits of manufacturers' facilities
to confirm compliance with national and international standards
with respect to design, manufacture and testing. The inspection
engineers will visit manufacturers' facilities not only to audit
the facilities but also to check the various stages of the manu-
facturing progress, to examine materials and test certificates, to
witness tests and, if appropriate, to arrange for independent
tests. Manufacturing may be undertaken in a number of widely
separated locations within and out side China and the CM will
arrange for routine inspection visits to be made by a local resi-
dent staff of an approved inspection agency. In other cases, the
CM will arrange for inspecting engineers to temporarily reside at
the manufacturers' shops when this is justified by the inspection
work load.
An additional important function of inspection visits to the vari-
ous manufacturers' facilities will be to check on progress in



-108 -                           ANNEX 5.6
Page 6
manufacture, testing and preparation for shipment.  With the tight
construction schedule planned for this project and its remote
location, it is imperative that all the employer-furnished plant
and equipment is delivered on time and in good condition. Thus,
the inspection staff must monitor all stages of the manufacture of
the equipment from award of contract to delivery, and recommend to
management any measures needed to expedite matters.
(d)   Start-up and Commissioning of the Works.  The start-up and testing
of large hydroelectric units requires a team approach. This team
will be composed of personnel from the CM, the construction and
installation contractors, and the equipment manufacturers, each
entity being responsible for fulfilling its contractual obliga-
tions during the equipment check-outs, start-ups and testing. A
team leader, experienced in start-up procedures, will be assigned
by the CM to direct the day-to-day activities of the start-up
team.
Start-up and test procedures are complex and exacting, and inevi-
tably, the results of the tests form the basis for recommendations
which may modify the future operating procedures and which the CM
must incorporate in the project operation and maintenance proce-
dures manual.
The objectives of the CM in the area of start-up and commissioning
are as follows:
e     To coordinate the performance of tests with the various
mAnufacturers' engineers and other entities involved in the
commissioning and start-up.
*     To assist with the development of accurate ard safe start-up
and test procedures.
*     To assist In performing tests and evaluating test results.
e     To coordinate the preparation of final start-up and test
reports and formulate recommendations for future operating
procedures and manuals.
F. DesiLn Engineering Services
10.       The CM will utilize the services of the CHIDI as the nominated proj-
ect designer for the preparation of specifications, final designs and con-
struction drawings. During the construction period the CM will be responsible
for the following activities:
e     Preparing specifications and control documents for Employer-sup-
plied permanent materials and equipment.
*     Preparing detailed construction drawings which incorporate final
design computations, results of tests and studies which continue



-109 -                         AM        S.6
Page 7
into the construction period, and details of mechanical and elec-
trical equipment.
*     Incorporating design changes to meet unanticipated conditions
encountered during constructSon.
*     Ensuring the designs and drawings prepared by the construction con
tractors are completed in accordance with the requirements of the
contract documents.
e     Ensuring that the design and drawings prepared by the equipment
sup pliers are completed in accordance with the requirements of
the con tract documwnts and are compatible with the other designs.
o     Producing permanent record drawings showing actual dimensions and
details of the finished work.
9     Providing support for meetings with review boards.
These duties are explained more fully in the follorAing sections:
(a)   Permanent Material/Equipment Specifications.  It will be the
responsibility of the CM (utilizing CHIDI) to produce technical
specifications and related special contract conditions (testing
and warranty clauses, etc.) for all permanent equipment and mate-
rials. For equipment and materials purchased from international
sources, this work will include a technical analysis of bids
received.
(b)   Construction Drawies.  During the construction process, the CM
(utilizing CHIDI) will continue to amplify the details of the
tender drawings, to provide fV al verification of design computa-
tions, to make revisions to final design taking into account the
results of the tests and studies that will continue into the con-
struction period, and to prepare details when the manufacturers'
designs for mechanical av.d electrical equipment are available.
The CM, with assistance from CHIDI, will supply the following
information to the contractor on supplementary drawings approved
for constructions
The exact locations for major structures such as the power-
house, intake structure, spillways and log-passing tunnel.
Detailed dimensions of all member outlines, openings, pro-
jections, pads and locations of embedments (such as anchor
bolts and welding pads), waterstops, construction joints and
control joints.
Reinforcement showing location, size, and spacing of all
rein forcing bars.
Details of miscellaneous metalwork.



- 1X0 -                          ANNEX S.6
Page a
*    Mechanical construction details showing the general equip-
ment layout as well as the size and approximate physical
location of pipes, ducts, valves and other piping compo-
nents. The drawings should include generic componeut desig-
nations which will be used to identify additional require-
ments contained in the specifications such as material type,
rating, etc. Detailed information on Employer furnished
equipment will need to be provided to the contractor in
order for it to be incorporated as necessary on the contrac-
tors' drawings.
e     Schematic and interconnection diagrams for electric power
and control cables.
e     Layouts of power and control cable routes, conduits, and
trays and location of grounding cables and grounding
inserts.
0     Lighting fixture layouts and circuiting information.
o     Schedules for conduits and cables required.
This information must be provided to the contractor in a timely
manner as required by the construction plan and schedule.
(c)   Desi8n Changes.  Although thorough investigations have been under
taken at the site over a number of years, and the subsurface con-
ditions can be predicted with a fair degree of confidence, it is
inevitable that the major excavations will reveal foundation con-
ditions in some locations that are not the same as those pre-
viously inferred. The differences may not be significant, but it
is possible that in some areas it will be necessary to modify the
designs. In this regard, the flow of information and data from
the site should enable timely design modifications to meet unan-
ticipated conditions with the minimum delay and cost.
The CM must, however, take care to avoid introducting of design
modifications to effect marginal changes if there is any risk that
such changes could disrupt the contractor's construction plan and
schedule. However, modifications should be made when necessary
for project safety, and when it is judged that substantial
improvements or savings will result for the project as a whole.
(d) Design Checks (Construction Contractor Drawings). The construc-
tion contractors will have their own design offices on site to
design temporary works, formwork and reinforcing details, and to
prepare concrete lift or other placement drawings. These designs
and drawings must be checked by the CM to ensure that they are in
accordance with the requirements of the contract documents.
(e)   Design Checks (Manufacturers' Drawings).  The manufrcturers of
mechanical and electrical equipment will prepare and submit
designs and drawings to the CM for review and approval. All such



- 111 -                        ANNEX 5.6
Page 9
designs and drawings must be checked to ensure that they meet the
contract requirements and are compatible with the other designs.
This may necessitate several revisions of the drawings, but it is
an important part of coordinating the design and must be carried
out expeditiously if manufacturing delays are to be avoided. Such
delays might affect the overall project schedule.
(f)   Permanent Records.  Many of the permanent records of the project
will be in the form of drawings including construction drawings,
the con tractors' lift and reinforcement drawings, manufacturers'
shop drawings, geological maps of foundations and survey plots.
It is the respousibility of the CM to compile a complete set of
these permanent records. A final design report will be prepared
by the CM which will document the final design as modified during
construction.
The CM will also compile a set of "Record" drawings which record
actual measurements of all features of the project. The data on
which these drawings are developed will be compiled by the inspec-
tion staff, and once a stucture is completed, the CM will incor-
porate this data in the construction drawings to provide a perma-
nent record of actual construction of each project feature.
(g) Review Board Support. EHDC will continue to employ the Special
Board of Consultants (comprising both national and international
experts) to review all maj3r questions regarding design and the
Impact of construction methods and field conditions on the design
shown on the drawings. This Board will meet at periodic int^rvals
throughout the construction period. Therefore, the CM will have
the responsibility for preparing materials for these meetings and
implementing the decisions made during these meetings which will
be a continuing process throughout the construction period and the
first filling of the reservoir.
G. Site Administration
11.       The CM organization will be responsible for all matters pertaining
to administration of site services and project lands, as followst
e     Safety, including monitoring of the contractors' safety programs.
o     Inventory control including purchasing and warehouse management.
*     Project services including accounting and auditing.
H. Construction Manaaer Organization
12.       The following are guidelines to be used in preparing the proposed CM
organizations
(a)   The international con6ultant will be required to enter into an
agreement with EEC for performing the construction management



112 -                       ANN   5.6
Page 10
services. The CM will be responsible for the ^day-to-day' manage-
ment and administration of the project.
(b) The international consultant will be designated as thie lead firm
of the CM organization.
(c)   The construction contractors and equipment sapply contractors will
be officially advised by BUDC of the role of the GM.
(d)   The CM will be a fully Integrated team of personnel from both TIC
and the consultant.
(e)   The consultant will develop a functicnal organization chart
clearly indicating his proposed concepts for managing the project.
The consultant will also present his proposed staffing require-
ments for the duration of the proj tct together with an organiza-
tion chart.
(f)   All positions assigned to the consultant staff will have an SEC
counterpart who will be trained to assume that position at the
earliest practical opportunity.
(g)   CHIDI, who prepared the basic project tender documents and draw-
ings, will be retained by the CM as the nominated project designer
for services related to the final detailed design and construction
drawings. CHIDI will be fully responsible for this work. How-
ever, it is intended that CM will appoint several design engineers
to CUIDI to coordinate and monitor design activities.

ERTAN HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Power Pricing Study
Terms of Reference
A. Background
1.        As of December 1990, the capacity of the Sichuan interconned power
grid was about 4,800 MW, of which 1,460 HW was seasonal hydropower and most of
the rest small and medium size coal-fired units; the transmission network
voltages werc 220 kV and 110 kV.
2.        By the year 2000, installed capacity is expected to approach
13,000 MW with the project and other hydroelectric plants totalling 6,000 MS.
A 500 kV network will be developed. With the exception of the project owned
by the Ertan Hydroelectric Development Corporatiok. ;EHDC), the major power
facilities will be controlled by the Sichuan Electric Power Administration
(SCEPA) which is the entity responsible for the dispatch and sales of energy
to the consumers.
3.        It is plausible that, with the completion of the already committed
expansion investments, power shortages could be eliminated with the commis-
sioning of the project in 1998-2000. The growth in daytime load and in sea-
sonal uses of electricity could then be ve-y rapid; the provision of adequate
price signals to consumers and producers is an important policy instrument to
rationalize demand patterns and the utilization of power supply facilities.
4.        The pricing of the electricity generated by EHDC and sold to SCEPA
must ensure not only the financial viability of the parties but also that the
project is optimally inserted into the operation of the grid and the economic
value of its output to that system is maximized.   The principles of this
pricing were agreed and their application to the design of a contract between
EHDC and SCEPA must be coordinated with the setting of provincial electricity
prices.
B. Objectives of the Study
5.        A power pricing study will be carried out with the following objec-
tives:
(a)   to transfer to SCEPA and EHDC modern methods of power tariff
design based on criteria of economic efficiency, financial ade-
quacy and fairness;
(b)   to look into the problems raised by the transition from the exist-
ing pricing arrangements to more desirable ones and to propose a
medium team action plan;



- 115 -                             11ANN   S.8
Page 2
tc)   to provide guidelines for the design of the long tern sales con-
tract for the output of the Ertan project.
C. Scope of Works
6.        The lricing study will consider the desipn of power tariff and
structure; it will cover sales at hiah, medium and low voltage as well as
purchase contracts with bulk energy suppliers. The study should evaluate and
highlight the relative meritsldemerits of the proposed approach in comparison
to the ones adopted in China so far and to purely financial approaches.
7.        Part As  Proiect Output Pricing
(a)   Analyzing financial and marginal economic costs of generation for
SCEPA and EHDC by functional categories (peak power, firm and
secondary energy);
(b)   Designing candidate tariff structures for the sale of the project
output taking into account the value of this output to SCEPA;
Xc)   Analysing the financial soundness of the proposed rates from
EHDC's and SCEPA's viewpoints;
(d)   Recoumending a tariff structure and level for thls sale;
4e)   Reviewing international practice and advising on the design of key
technical and legal clauses of the contract.
8.        Part B:  Gtid Power Pricing
(a) Analyzing system load and individual demand patterns by voltage
level;
(b) Analyzing financial and marginal economic costs of power transmis-
sion and distribution;
(c) Calculating marginal costs of service and comparing them with cur-
rent revenue levels for typical consumers;
(d) Designing candidate rate structures for small bulk purchases and
sales to consumers;
(e) Analyzing the financial soundness of the proposed rates;
(f) Selecting a target tariff structure and level;
(g) Designing an implementation strategy for the target tariff, includ-
ing improvements in metering and billing systems;
(h)  Recomending a medium term action plan.

D. Method and Organization
9.        The study will draw on the method, materials and experience gathered
from the East China Power Pricing Study which was completed under the
BeLlungang Thermal Power Project. It will make ample use of the expertise
available from the Water Resources and Electric Power Economic Research Insti-
tute in Beijing.  However, the large share of hydropower and the important
EHDC power sales contract are very novel and specific features of the study;
foreign consultancy services and a mid-course overseas study trip are needed
to assist on these aspects and review the practical steps recommended for
tariff improvements.
10.       The transfer of know-how will also take place through on-the-job
training and three workshops organized at tl"e inception stage and to review
the interim and final study reports.
11.       The study will be carried out jointly by EHDC and SCEPA for Part A
and SCEPA for Part B under the auspices of the Ministry of Energy. It will be
managed by u Steering Committee representing the parties and coordinated by a
Principal Investigator. The Committee will exchange views with the Bank on
the progress and findings of the study.
12.       The pricing study will make use of the output from the systems plan-
ning studies being carried out under the Special Studies and Planning Support
Project financed by the Bank. Sample load measurements and analyses should be
started as soon as possible. Key dates in the timetable for the study are
planned as follows:
Startup                             March 1992
Interim report                   December 1992
Final Report                         June 1993

ERTAN HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plan
Project Area
1.        The inundation of the Ertan Reservoir on the Yalong River will
entail the resettlement of approximately 30,000 people living in 31 villages
and one town in five counties in Sichuan Province. The affected area is in
Miyi and Yanbian Counties of Panzhihua Municipality, and Yanyuan, Dechang, and
Xichang Counties of Liangshan Autonomous Prefecture of the Yi National Minor-
ity. No Yi national ethnic minority people will be displaced by the project.
The banks of the Yalong River, as well as tributaries Akeni, Tengqiao, Shuwa
and Pingchuan Rivers, are steep slopes with sparse vegetation, scattered cul-
tivated plots, and widely dispersed populations. The banks of the tributary
Ganiyu River are relatively gentl qlo'es with a more concentrated population,
including Yanbian town and cult.       lands.  The physical assets to be sub-
merged by the Ertan Reservoir a         Aated in Table 1.
2.        The surface area of tk.    An Reservoir will be 101 km2, or about
five times the area of the existin, river bed.  The reservoir will inundate
1,656 ha of cultivated land, 2,440 ha of grass hillside, 1,978 ha of fuelvood
forest, 1,042 ha of timber forest, 838 ha of paddy field, 818 ha of dry land
and 692,000 economic trees and other land and assets that in comprehensive
1983 surveys included 961,000 m2 of houses, 146,000 m2 of other buildings, 16
small hydropower stations (2.3 MW), 358 km of highways, 397 km of communica-
tion lines, 648 km of transmission and distribution lines, 819 km of broadcast
lines and 12 factories. Samples of large livestock suggest reservoir-area
cattle and pig populations of about 7,000 and 30,000 head respectively. Proj-
ect construction sites will require an additional 14 km2 of land that has
mined ownership and uses. The three major resettlement sites at Hongge,
Pinshan and Moshiqing will require 29.4 km2 of land that consists entirely of
abandoned plantations and wasteland. The property affected by the project is
identified in Table 1.
Affected Population
3.        At the time of project appraisal the estimated number of persons
that would be directly affected by the project was about 30,000. This total
includes 1,200 persons to be displaced from the 14 km2 construction sites;
13,900 persons of farm families living within the 101 km2 reservoir area;
2,950 persons of farm families living above the reservoir areas but having
land in the reservoir area; 5,015 urban dwellers living in Yanbian Town; and
1,645 urban dwellers living in other parts of the reservoir area. The base-
line total (24,710) has been adjusted by an increase in population (2,197
persons) due to urban migration between the end of the survey year, 1983, and
1995 (3 percent of the 1983 population compounded annually for 11 years) and
natural population growth (3,050 persons) in the reservoir area (I percent of
the 1983 population compounded annually for 11 years), plus rounding of num-

Resettlement Planning and Organization
4.        Planning of resettlement and rehabilitation of the population to be
displaced by the Ertan Leservoir began in 1984. At that time a preliminary
survey of the assets affected was carried out by the Bureau of City and County
Construction, Land Bureau and Environment Protection Bureau of the Government
of Sichuan Province (GSP), with the help of Chengdu Hydroelectric Investiga-
tion and Design Institute (CHIDI) of MWREP. The County Land Bureaus and City
and Country Construction Bureaus, which will be key implementing organizations
at the County level, have cooperated in detailed, site-specific development
planning, also assisted by CHIDI. The GSP will be responsible for implement-
ing of the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Plan through the line agencies of
the county governments, as indicated in Figure 1. The governments at all
levels are responsible for land acquisition and overall resettlement and reha-
bilitation policies. The migration offices at each level are responsible for
resettlement planning and implementation work, including construction, trans-

S.        A resettlement plan itemizes the location, schedule, and quantities
of work of the respective schemes. Reservoir area resettlers have been aware
of the project and the need to move since 1983.  Construction site resettlers
have been informed around 1987. Government representatives and at least sev-
eral dozen private citizens of villages that will move to the fongge,
Moshiqing or Pinshan receiving areas have visited these areas and participated
actively in the reeettlement planning process. In accordance with the plat,
204 families have already been moved from construction sites to nearby areas
and the remaining 1,000 inhabitants of the sites and base camps will be moved
before June 1991 to Pinehan. In Yanbian County, farmers will be resettled by

moving to higher elevations in their present village at the reservoir margin
(2,000 persons), by moving to the Hongge Receiving Area (7,600 persons), and
by becoming miners (4,600 persons) at the Hongni Coal Mine. Nonfanmers
(7,800) will move to Moshiqing, including government offices and small indus-
tries. Residents of the Yumen and Ganyu rural area towns (210 persons) will
move to higher elevations in their present villages. In Miyi County, 3,100
farmers will be resettled at the Pinshan Receiving Area, 180 others will be
resettled by moving to higher elevations in their present village. Approxi-
mately 900 persons associated with the Ertan Clay Mine will be moved to higher
ele-rations with the mine. Farmers in Liangshan Prefecture (1,500 persons)
will be resettled by moving to higher elevations in their present village.
6.        Annual requirements and plans for agricultural development, trans-
portation of portable assets, and acquisition of steel, cemezit and wood for
construction have been itemized and presented in a series of tabular supple-
ments to the September 1989 documents prepared for project appraisal.l/ The
provincial office that is responsible for implementing this plan has assigned
five of its 22 existing staff members to the Ertan Project. City, prefecture
and county resettlement institutions that are responsible for implementing the
plan currently employ 54 persons and plan to add 11 more by 1992 for handling
the Ertan Project resettlement. Panzhihua City has created an "Office of
Supporting Ertan Power Station Construction' and has assigned the Vice-Mayor
of Panzhihua City to supervise its progress. EHDC will establish a resettle-
ment office that will regularly inspect and report on physical progress and
subcontract independent studies on the socioeconomic conditions of resettlers
and hosts. The monitoring of physical progress and socioeconomic conditions
will regularly address the physical progress of the resettlement operation.
Resettlement Principles and Guidelines
7.        Compensation and resettlement of the affected population will be
based on the "Land Administration Regulations" and "Statute for Land Requisi-
tion for Construction Use by the State" issued by the PRC State Council, the
'Design Norms of Reservoir Submersion for Water Resources Projects' issued by
MWREP, and the 'Provisional Regulations for Land Management of Sichuan Prov-
ince" promulgated by GSP. These documents and the present administrative
practice of GSP provide the following basic principles for resettlement and
rehabilitation:
(a)  Compensation for dwelling is based on a 1-in-20-year flood level;
(b)  Compensation for agricultural land is based on a 1-in-5-year flood
level;
(c)  Displaced persons and facilities will be reestablished in the near-
est available sites within their respective counties and, if possi-
ble, within their original townships;
(d)  To the extent possible, displaced people should be enabled to con-
tinue in their prior occupations;
11 In Project File.



-123 -                         ANN=  S.10
Page 5
(e) Resettlement should be arranged so that physical and human resources
can continue to be at least as productive and living conditions at
least as convenient as they were before the move;
(f) Plot sizes for resettled farmers should meet minim=m standards so as
to allow the farmers to continue making a living on the land;
(g) Durtng the transition period, the provincial government will supple-
ment the agricultural production of farmers with grain, fuel, and
fodder as required;
(h)  Public facilities will be reconstructed to at least preexisting
standards;
(i) Supply of construction materials (steel, lumber and cement) for the
reconstruction of dwellings, buildings, and other facilities will be
given priority;
(j) Compensation for dwellings, houseplots, lost wages and moving
expenses will be paid to heads of households shortly before the
move. Compensation for productive assets and infrastructure will be
paid to the local (village) government having jurisdiction;
(k) While local governments have assisted in planning resettlement and
rehabilitation from the beginning, the affected population will be
informed and involved as participants in finalizing the project
formulation;
(1) To the extent possible, the integrity of neighborhoods and hamlets
will be maintained in the resettlement process;
(m) Resettled persons will be allowed to return to the reservoir area to
plant and harvest crops and salvage materials until their lands are
flooded; and
(n) To the extent possible, individual households will be given a range
of choice in regard to:
(i) the design of their dwellings;
(ii) the availability of construction materials at official prices;
(iii) opportunity for buying additional construction materials at
market prices;
(iv) the quality of their dwellings;
(v) the building contractors used; and
(vi) the disposal of materials from their old homes.

Hongge and Pinshan Receiving Areas and Optimization of Agricultural Productiv-
ity
8.        Together these two sites are designed to accommodate 11,000 rural
resettlers. Their productive bases will be developed by reclaiming wasteland
and abandoned plantation land to produce food and cash crops. This will be
achieved through the uoe of gravity irrigation systems supplied by river water
that is pumped to ponds created at higher elevations. The Hongge Receiving
Area has a land area of 1,862 ha and is owned by the State, which has the
right to use the land according to relevant regulations. Approximately 408 ha
of this area currently is used without contract by nearby farmers on a rota-
tion and single-crop-per-yeai basis. T1"'t'ffset the lss of this use, the
project will allocate 78 ha of irrigated land to nearby farmers (hosts) and
include this land and the costs of preparation and irrigation in the overall
Hongge resettlement program. A similar arrangement will be made at the
Pinshan Receiving Area. Detailed cropping patterns and schedules for its
development (including pumping and irrigation requirements and systems) have
been prepared and evaluated to the feasibility level of detail, with the
involvement of local authorities who will construct the systems. Arrangements
for the distribution of water and the control of quotas, inputs, cropping
patterns, marketing, and operation and maintenance will be handled by existing
institutions in each area. Fuel and fodder requirements have been considered
but may need further attention since they will be met in part by controlled
lopping of branches from trees in off-site areas. Electricity to provide
irrigation before Ertan begins to generate revenue will be paid for by the
Sichuan Province Resettlement Office, with resettlement fund revenues from
other hydro projects which are already in operation. In calculating the net
benefits of resettlement, an allocation of 1.5 mu (15 mu - 1 ha) of irrigated
land per capita, an electricity price of Y 0.04/kWh, a gravity irrigation
system, and a dry year with a 1 in 5 year return period were assumed. The net
benefit from resettlement is Y 939/personlyear as compared to a present income
of about Y 450/person/year. Research to support optimal cropping patterns and
to reduce water requirements through shifts to more efficient types of irriga-
tion will begin during the construction stage.
Drawdown Agriculture
9.        Shoreline landslides and unstable areas have been identified and
mapped by geologists who traversed the entire reservoir margin on foot. The
population affected in such areas will move houses to higher elevations in the
same village. They will either continue to plant lands which are unaffected
or will be allocated new agricultural lands in the same village if their farm-
lands are also affected.  In addition, much land will be exposed annually
during the dry season when the reservoir is drawn down for power generation,
and some of this with very slight slope will be suitable for one crop each
year.  But the timing, duration and extent of this drawdown zone in any one
year is difficult to predict or rely upon without the benefit of actual expe-
rience with the reservoir operation over time.  For this reason, no families
will be made dependent upon drawdown agriculture; instead, drawdown lands are
considered a bonus on top of replacement land allocations to be allocated by
local government.

10.       Coal Mining.  Displaced people changing occupations to coal mining
at the expanded Hongi Coal Mine (expansion from 0.45 million tons to 1.05
million tons 1991-96) are expected to earn a minimum Y 2,000/personlyear.
This is considerably better than families continuing in agriculture. Many
families actively seek to place one of their members in coal mining employ-
ment, so difficulties in recruiting displaced people to this work are not
anticipated.
11.       Yanbian Town. Small industries and government offices in Yanbian
Town presently will be relocated to the new site and most townspeople will
continue employment in their present occupations. Due to transport and commu-
nication rdvantages of the new site, the existing small industries and many
new ones a..e expected to do well, in comparison with limited opportunities for
growth in the former more remote location.
Subsistence Allowance During the Transition Period
12.       The income of resettlers will be sustained during the transition
period by an arrangement that will allow some family members to be hired by
the project to develop the receiving areas, and others to remain behind to
cultivate land in the villages to be inundated. Incomes will be regularly
evaluated by the socioeconomic monitoring program.
13.       Resettlement Monitoring.  The monitoring of progress in the reset-
tlement and rehabilitation program will be subcontracted by EHDC to an inde-
pendent socioeconomic research institution. The Terms of Reference for this
work require, inter alia, that: (i) the monitoring be conducted annually
beginning in 1991 through such time as program objectives are achieved;
(ii) monitoring will cover samplez drawn from all major sites and will utilize
standard survey, participant-observation and case study methods; and (iii) in
addition to indicators of progress in physical works (e.g., land, housing,
infrastructure, fuel, etc.), indicators selected for monitorivg shall include
standard demographic, socioeconomic and health variables designed to measure
the well-being of the resettled population.
Training and Staff Development
14.       EHDC has designed a staff development program including domestic and
overseas seminars, workshops, short courses, study tours and literature for
strengthening the capability of resettlement staff at all levels of govern-
ment.
Cost Estimate
15.       The cost estimate is based on the resettlement plan and is detailed
and comprehensive. It incorporates lessons learned from other projects and
takes into account feasibility-level designs for the major receiving areas
(see Table 3). Members of the resettlement planning team have visited the
Shuikou Hydroelectric Project to obtain first-hand information on the problems
that were encountered there and have integrated this information with the cost
estimation and materials planning for the Ert&a Hydroelectric Project. The
cost estimate has been updated to early 1991 unit costs. Annual quantities of
work and materials have been identified (Table 2). A 15 percent physical



126 -                         ANNEX 5.10
Page 8
contingency has been included in the estimate.  Price contingencies have been
included that are based on the same assumptions that were used for the con-
struction cost estimate. The base cost of Y 429.38 million and the total cost
of Y 608.69 million have been included in the overall project cost estimate
(Table 3).
Financing Plan
16.       Annual budget requests will be initiated in August of each year by
each county resettlement office. These requests will be passed upward through
the city or prefecture resettlement offices to the Sichuan Province Resettle-
ment Office and finally to ENDO. EHDC will incorporate these requests into
its overall budget request for the following year and then submit 50 percent
of this request to the State Energy Investment Corporation and 50 percent to
the Sichuan Energy and Communications Investment Corporation. Each of these
investment corporations will release funds to EHDC, 40 percent of which will
be issued as grants that EHDC is not required to pay back, and 60 percent of
which will be issued as loans that EHDC must pay back with interest. The
total cost estimate is considered adequate to resettle all affected persons so
that they are at least as well off after resettlement as they were before
resettlement.
Reporting and Supervision
17.       EHDC has agreed that its resettlement monitoring cell will report
physical progress on resettlement to the Bank on a quarterly basis, in the
same manner as EHDC reports progress on the main works. Also, EHDC has agreed
to include resettlement in the terms of reference for the international Envi-
ronmental Panel (EP). This arrangement will be adequate to insure that reset-
tlement is implemented as planned. The members of the EP will receive all the
quarterly reports of the EHDC monitoring team and of their subcontractor, who
will conduct socioeconomic evaluations on the same schedule as the quarterly
reports on the mAin works are submitted to the Bank. The EP will be required
to give a formal reaction to each report for the first two years after the
start of construction. Members of the Panel will visit the project once every
six months for the first two years and more often if problems occur.

CHINA
ERTAN HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Environmental Management Plan
IMact Assessment
1.        Environmental impact assessment studies of the Ertan Project have
been carried out since 1980 by CHIDI, which has invested 3,510 staff-days by
29 specialists in Environmental Assessment (EA). Environmental studies to
date have covered meteorology and hydrology, sedimentation, water tempera-
turelquality, geology, soils, terrestrial ecology, aquatic ecology, human
health, tourist resources, and timber floating. In addition, 3,241 staff-days
have been spent by 48 outside specialists subcontracted by EHDC and CuIDI for
studies of human health and water quality, radioactivity, terrestrial ecology,
aquatic ecclogy, environmental geology, soils, archeology, and timber float-
ing. The completed EA also contains a classification of impacts according to
the matrix method recommended by the International Commission on Large Dams
(ICOLD). These research works have been examined and approved, along with
other project investigations, by 19 experts from the Chinese Academy of Sci-
ences, headed by the Vice President of Qinghua University and Deputy Director
of the Technical Services Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Environmental Health
2.        Risks of schistosomiasis, malaria, and other diseases that could be
affected by project construction and operation are recognized by project and
local health authorities. Disease vectors are routinely monitored by public
health authorities. Health authorities do not believe that construction
activities will threaten the health of Yi people who inhabit mountains around
the project area, because these peoplt have interacted with the Han majority
in lowland towns and markets for many decades. Public health screening of
incoming workers and monitoring and treatment measures have been planned and
will be carried out by health authorities, augmented by financial support from
EHDC. By the time of appraisal, 4,000 workers were already on site for prepa-
ratory works, and health measures were in operation.
Catchment Area Land Use Trends and Reservoir Sedimentation
3.        Information on current land use and on trends in forest cover over
the last three decades in the Ertan catchment area has been estimated from
Sichuan Land Department and Sichuan Forestry Department data which cover
95.6 percent of the catchment area. At present 52 percent of the area is
classified as grazing land, 34 percent as forestry land, and 2 percent as
cultivated land. Actual forest cover (canopy closure, excluding shrubs, as a
percentage of total land area in the catchment) was estimated to be 12.3 per-
cent in the 1980s, 13.0 percent in the 1970s, and 12.3 percent in the 19609.
The period of record for sedimentation measurements near the dam site extends
over 30 years and provides a good basis for computing the sediment deposition
in the reservoir. At present there are seven gauging stations operating



-131-                        ANNEX 5.11
Page 2
within the Ertan catcbment area that make regular sedimentation measurements.
The policy on forest cutting and water conservation in the catchnent area is
based on the objective of sustainable yields. Conditions in the catchment
area will be monitored by the environmental monitoring station described below
(para. 8).
Downstream Effects
4.        Because of the relatively small size of the live storage (3.37 bil-
lion mi) in relation to the annual discharge of the river at the dam site
(52.6 billion m8) and in downstream areas (1 trillion ma at the estuary),
downstream effects--except in areas iumediately downstream of the dam--are
considered to be insignificant. Effects in the areas immediately downstream
of the dam have been studied in detail and includes (a) daily fluctuations in
water levels that range from about 8 m near the powerhouse tailrace and 4.5 m
12 km downstream; (b) minor changes in water temperature and water quality,
including occasional nitrogen supersaturation; and (c) minor channel erosion.
Channel erosion is not expected to adversely affect any existing structures or
activities. Because the population is sparse and river use--except for log
transport--is uncommon in areas immediately downstream of the dam, and,
because a regulating dam is planned for sometime in the future, the project
does not include an electronic warning system for these areas. Downstream
effects will be monitored regularly by the environmental monitoring station
described below.
Impacts on Fish and Wildlife
5.        The project will convert 20 km2 of river into 101 km2 of reservoir,
and alter the topography and biota of 14 kim of construction sites. In so
doing, it will displace terrestrial plants and animals and will cause changes
in the species composition of aquatic life in the stretches of the reservoir
that will :e inundated and that will be immediately downstream of the dam.
The aforementioned studies have identified some rare plants and animals in the
project area, but concluded that impacts on these species will not be signifi-
cant because the project area is only a small part of the large ranges of
these species. Also, the studies have concluded that there are no species of
fish that have major migrations in the vicinity of the dam or reservoir.
Aquatic weeds are not expected to be a serious problem. Environmental moni-
toring will address changes in the species composition and population size of
fish in the reservoir and of wildlife such as waterfowl that may use the res-
ervoir.
Water Pollution
6.        Concerns that existing industrial pollution or discharges from the
proposed expansion of the coal mine near Hongni could interact with the proj-
ect to cause or worsen adverse impacts have been addressed. The Light Indus-
trial Department of Sichuan Province issued Document SLP (1989) No. 044 on
April 12, 1989 which specified a schedule for pollution control at a number of
existing industrial facilities, beginning in 1989. The Miyi Sugar Refinery on
the Anning River, upstream of its confluence with the Yalong River was among
these facilities and is scheduled to be cleaned up by end-1991. During
appraisal discussions, evidence was presented that another sugar refinery had



132 -                       ANNEX 5.11
Page 3
already installed pollution equipment as scheduled in 1989.  At the Hongni
coal mine, it was revealed that most of the coal reserves are above or remote
from the reservoir. Results of laboratory analyses of coal, coal mine drain-
age, and river water were presented which indicate that the coal has a low
sulfur content (0.5 percent), the mine drainage is not acidic, and the concen-
trations of other substances are not notable. At a paper mill in Yanbian
County work is underway to install pollution equipment in 1991/92, even though
the mill will not be relocated until 1994. Water quality of the reservoir and
of areas immediately downstream of the dam will be monitored as planned.
Environmental Monitoring Station
7.        Establishment of a permanent 75-man environmental monitoring station
will be financed by the project. It is expected that 38 of the staff will be
recruited and trained by 1992 and that the remainder will be added between
1992 and 1997. This station will monitor meteorological, hydrological, water
quality, sedimentation, sanitary and biotic aspects of the project on the
environment. The plans include an organization structure, a preliminary
schedule, a list of required instruments and equipment, task descriptions, a
staff training schedule and a cost estimate. The status of this monitoring
station will be reviewed and reported on regularly.
Training and Staff Development
8.        EHDC has submitted a program to be financed under the project for
domestic and overseas seminars, workshops, short courses and degree programs
to strengthen the capability of the staff of the environmental monitoring
station and others involved in environmental management for the Ertan project.
Cost Estimate
9.        An environmental cost estimate and disbursement schedule has been
prepared (Table 1). This estimate yields a 1991 local currency base cost of
Y 14.04 million for staff training and equipment, including a 10 percent phys-
ical contingency and price contingencies based on the same assumptions that
were used for the project cost estimate. This estimate covers all environmen-
tal work and environmental protection associated with transmission lines and
project construction (waste disposal, site reclamation, etc.).
Financing Plan
10.       EHDC has assured the mission that the budgeting and financing of
environmental work will be treated in the same manner as the budgeting and
financing of the construction of the main works of the project.
Reporting and Supervision
11.       The Environmental Monitoring Station as described above (para. 7),
together with the review and reportinr functions of the EP (para. 5.27) pro-
vide an arrangement that will be adequ;:'te to ensure that environmental manage-
ment is implemented as planned. The following agreements were reached regard-
ing environmental management operations under the project. First, at least
four environmental subjects will be addressed in each quarterly report of EHDC



- 133 -                        ANNEX 5.11
Page 4
to the Banks (i) progress in establishing the aforementioned station;
(ii) environmental health of the labor force; (iii) progress in controlling
pollution discharges at existing industrial facilities in the project region;
and (iv) progress in environmental training. Second, when the station begins
monitoring, it will issue reports on at least an annual basis and more fre-
quently if deviations or unexpected impacts emerge. Third, members of the SP
will receive all reports of the station, all environmental sections of the
quarterly reports noted above, and all reports on resettlement. The SP will
be required to give a formal reaction to the BlDC sections on environment and
to each report of the station for at least the first three years after the
start of construction. Fourth, the first visit of the EP to the project area
should include a trip to logged and reforested parts of the catchment area of
the project during the first year of construction. Subsequent visits to the
project should occur at least at one-year intervals. Fifth, the adequacy of
the environmental cost estimate should be critically reviewed at least annu-
ally throughout the construction stage in response to findings of the environ-
mental monitoring station. Details of costs for environmental protection at
the Ertan Hydroelectric Project are shown in Table 1.

Financial System Followed by Chinese Power Bureaus
1.        Power companies may accumulate capital from three separate and dis-
tinct sources. These include funds for fixed assets, funds for working capi-
tal, and a number of special funds.
(a) Funds for Fixed Assets. These funds are obtained from the State in
large enough amounts to permit implementation of approved projects
according to agreed schedules. Until 1980, these funds were pro-
vided almost entirely as grants; since then, the Government has
decided to make these funds available as loans obtained from the
banking system or from official sources. The funds under this cate-
gory are used exclusively to finance works classified as capital
expenditures. The funds are released monthly, in accordance with
plan provisions, in amounts needed to cover actually incurred expen-
ditures. The power bureaus are not expected to finance significant
portions of capital expenditure from operations; rather, they are
expected to remit most of their surplus income to the government
through payment of taxes;
(b)  Funds for Working Capital.  These funds are also received from the
State. They are based on a fixed amount established by regulation
and are subject to review at intervals of about ten years. These
funds make up only a minor part of the power bureaus' capital and,
because most of the bureaus have drawn their entire allocations
since the last review, these funds have been used only as a minor
source of capital in recent power projects proposed for Bank finan-
cing. Because current obligations both to and from the power
bureaus are settled almost as accrued, the working capital funds
have been used primarily to finance operating inventory; and
(c)  Special Funds.  These funds are earmarked for distinct purposes and
are funded from net operating revenues or cash receipts in amounts
established according to regulations. The power bureaus' accounts
contain four separate categories of special funds, including those
for: (i) maintenance; (ii) renovations; (iii) employee benefits;
and (iv) distribution improvements. The special funds for mainte-
nance are financed by allocations charged as operating expenses in
determining net operating income before Income Tax. The special
funds for renovations are financed by charges against Government
Funds (the balance sheet account showing the Government's equity
investment in a power bureau) equal to the portion of depreciation
provisions not used for debt repayment. The special funds for
employee benefits are financed using distributions from Net Income
after Income Tax but prior to the Adjustment Tax. Receipts and
withdrawals from the special funds associated with distribution
improvements are passed through the Flow of Funds statement and are



-137 --                       ANX 6.1
Page 2
specifically excluded from the Income Statement. All other alloca-
tions to the special funds appear or are reflected on the Income
Statement as though they are operating costs or distributions from
earnings, regardless of whether corresponding cash expenditures have
been incurred. Under more traditional accounting systems, expendi-
tures under the special funds would largely be classified as oper-
ating costs or working capital. However, items charged to the Spe-
cial Funds for both renovations and distribution improvements would
be capitalized as fixed assets once the underlying work were com-
pleted. Thus, when the renovations or distribution improvements are
completed, their value is deducted from the special funds balance
and added to the Government Funds account. The power bureaus have
only one way to channel tariff revenues into cash since all operat-
ing revenues must either be expensed; distributed to cover cash out-
flows, debt service or taxes; invested in renovations or distribu-
tion improvements; or retained for future expenditure chargeable to
the special funds. The bureaus channel revenues into cash by using
the excess of special fund allocations over the sum of (a) Special
Fund Expenditures; (b) cor)leted renovations and distribution
improvements; and (c) inc eases in Special Fund Assets. In turn,
cash generated through t' Special Funds may be interchanged with
other operating cash; huaever, allocations to particular special
funds create an ultimate obligation for a power bureau to use the
accumulated cash only for certain categories of expenditures.
2.        Until 1983, the power bureaus paid remittances to MOE equal to oper-
ating revenues less the sum of cash expenditures charged directly to opera-
tions, all allocations to special funds, and debt service.  Since 1983, the
power bureaus pay HOP an Income Tax, assessed at 55 percent of operating reve-
nues less the sum of costs (including depreciation) charged directly to opera-
tions, all allocations to special funds that are treated as expenses, and debt
service in excess of the portion of depreciation provisions specifically allo-
cated for debt repayment. From the residual after Income Tax, the power
bureaus must cover the special fund allocations that are treated as distribu-
tions from earnings and the amount of debt repayment and capitalized interest
during construction to be met from net income, and remit the remainder to MOE
as an Adjustment Tax.l/ MOE has some flexibility in controlling the power
bureaus' liquidity. It can do this either by changing their allocations to
the special funds, making grants for allocation to the special funds, or
relieving the power bureaus of a portion of the Adjustment Tax. The power
bureaus appear to have adequate liquidity and MOE has not shown any inclina-
tion to adjust the procedures that affect their liquidity.
3.        Under the existing financial system, the Government does not intend
for the power bureaus to retain a surplus. However, tariff revenues must meet
debt service requirements and repayment per se does not represent a charge
against earnings. Regulations provide that certain stipulated amounts of
repayment shall be met from cash that has been generated by depreciation;
however, the remainder of the cash Senerated by depreciation must be added to
F Prom an accounting point of view, the Adjustment Tax is treated in a
manner similar to a dividend.



- 138 -                      ANNEX 6.1
Page 3
a bureau's operating cash and a corresponding allocation must be made to the
Special Funds for renovations. As a result, the remainder of repaymenit, which
must be met from an earmarked increment of tariff revenues, creates an accumu-
lation of equity in the form of a corresponding undistributed earnings.
4.        Most power bureaus have units which engage in construction manage-
ment and subsidiaries which function as contractors. As a rtule, the accounts
of the construction management units are consolidated with those of the power
bureau's operating units; however, the accounts of subsidiaries acting as
construction contractors are, as a rule, not consolidated with those of the
operating units. As a result, when investments have been financed through
grants, the power bureau's consolidated accounts may have routinely under-
stated gross fixed assets and certainly did not reflect adequately construc-
tion in progress. Also, in the past, only about 85 percent of the value of
government grants used to finance new fixed assets was transferred from the
books of the construction subsidiaries functioning as contractors to the power
bureau's consolidated accounts. The residual was considered to have been
expended in purchasing moving assets, which remained with those construction
subsidiaries upon the completion of construction. The change to using loans
rather than grants to finance power sector investments has caused investment
funds to be channeled from the Government through the power bureaus for pay-
ment to construction units acting as contractors.  Thus, in the future, the
consolidated accounts of the power bureaus should more accurately reflect the
value of gross fixed assets and construction in progress.
5.        Given the existing financial system, the power bureaus have little
financial incentive to increase tariffs at the present time. Once a power
bureau has sufficient revenues to meet the costs charged directly to opera-
tions and all special fund allocations and debt service, any additional reve-
nues are remitted to the State through income or adjustment taxes. Thus, once
expenses and required distributions have been met, ever. a large tariff
increase would not increase a power bureau's financial viability, except to
improve debt service coverage. Therefore, the familiar indicators of finan-
cial performance such as rate of return and self-financing ratio have very
limited application to a financial analysis of the Chinese power bureaus.
6.        Nevertheless, the relationships between pricing, operating costs,
and size of the investment program are becoming increasingly important to
MOE/SEIC. In their role as nationwide managers of the sector, MOE/SEIC have
to arrange financing for the large and rapidly expanding investment program of
the regional power bureaus. As a result, they have become acutely conscious
of the need to mobilize appropriate resources from the consumers. To further
their efforts at resource mobilization, recent Bank-financed power projects in
mainland China have provided for financial covenants with specific targets for
a "notional self-financing ratio." For purposes of these agreements, the
Adjustment Tax would not be considered a reduction in earned cash because it
is a remittance of a residual and not a tax built into the cost structure and
the proceeds are generally recycled into investments in the power subsector.

Assumptions to EHDC's Financial Projections
Income Statement
1.        Tariffs are assumed to be adjusted so that the average revenues
would be adequate for achieving the financial performance targets (para. 6.4).
After the year 2000, the average tarift is assumed to remain constant in
current terms even though the minimum average tariff requirements are
projected to decrease from the year 2000 onwards.
(a) Under the self-financing ratio covenant (1999 and thereafter),
earned surplus cash available for financing future investments has
been defined as total cash (including income from the sale of elec-
tricity and other receipts, if any) less the aggregate of (i) cash
operating expenses; (ii) operational interest; (iii) income taxes;
(iv) required increases in working capital; (v) net increases in
Special Fund assets; (vi) loan repayments; and (vii) Special Fund
expenditures for maintenance and employee benefits. Separately, the
average annual investment program has been defined as the average of
the previous year's actual capital expenditures, the current year's
planned capital expenditures, and the next year's projected capital
expenditures.
(b)  For pur,oses of calculating the debt service coverage covenant,
internal cash generation has been defined as net income (after
income taxes) plus operational interest and loan repayment from
depreciation.
2.        Material costs are assumed to escalate with local inflation rates.
3.       WFaes are assumed to escalate with local inflation rates.
4.        Depreciation is assumed to remain constant at an average composite
rate of 2.4 percent of gross fixed assets in operation.
5.        Allocation to the Maintenance Special Fund is calculated at 1 per-
cent of gross fixed assets in operation.
6.        Other operating costs are assumed to escalate with local inflation
rates.
7.        Income tax is assumed to be 55 percent of net operating income less
interest expense and loan repayments.
Balance Sheet
8.        Capital construction accounts are consolidated with operation
accounts.

Page 2
9.        The average collection period of accounts receivable is assumed to
be five days (which is the same as that of SCEPA).
10.       Accounts payable is assumed to increase with energy sales.
11.       Due to government is assumed to increase with income taxes.
Funds Flow Statement
12.       Future investments -- In addition to the proposed Ertan Project, it
has been assumed that EHDC would be responsible for the following futuret proj-
ects:
Projects                      Total project costs          Implementation period
(in- current Y million)
(a) Tongzilin                      1.579                1995-2002; first unit to
be commnissioned in 2001,
the rest (3 unit) in
2002.
(b) Pubugou                        8,589                1994-2005; first unit to
be commissioned in 2004.
(c) Jingping                       4,864                1999-2008; first unit to
be commissioned in 2006.
13.       Assumptions of project financing--Tongzilin has been assumed to be
100 percent financed by central and local governments; the above local financ-
ing has been assumed to be the same as that for Ertan viz SEIC and ETIC would
contribute equal shares of financing, of which 60 percent in the form of loans
and 40 percent in the form of equity. As to Pubugou and Jingping, it has been
assumed to be 100 percent local debt financing, with interest rates at
9.36 percent per annum, 15 years maturity, including grace period during proj-
ect construction period.
14.       Energy and transport fund would be remitted to the Government, it
would be derived from 15 percent of depreciation and 15 percent of enterprise
retained profits for employee benefits.
15.       Loan repayment would be covered by the following sources of funds:
(i) depreciation fund--90 percent of depreciation less energy and transport
fund during the first 3 years of operation, and 50 percent thereafter; and
(ii) net income.
16.       Renovation Special Fund allocation is derived from depreciation less
energy and transport fund and loan repayment from depreciation.

Economic Justification of the ProJect
as a Least-Cost Alternative
1.        The least-cost expansion sequence (Plan A) including the Ertan
Project is detailed in Annex 4.5. An alternative least-cost sequence (Plan B)
without Ertan is described in the Project File 1/ and suvmarized below. It
is worth noting that this sequence has more severe environmental impacts that
are described separately (Annex 7.3), but not accounted for in the least-cost
analysis presented here.

2.        The cash flows of investment and operating costs for this alterna-
tive sequence and the sequence with Ertan have been calculated for the period
1991-2017 and discounted to January 1998 at a 10 percent discount rate. The
resulting present values (PV) are shown in Table 1 (page 3) along with the
factors utilized to convert financial prices into economic prices. Table 1
also shows an update of these costs discounted to January 1998 at financial
and economic prices of 1990 with a shadow exchange rate of Y 5.5 per US
dollar. The key unit prices used in the evaluation are summarized below3
11   "Economic Analysis of Ertan Hydropower Power Plant Based on the Optimiza-
tion of the Sichuan System," Beijing Economic Research Institute of Water
Resources and Electric Power, September 1988. All commissioning dates in
the study are postponed two years to reflect the situation prevailing at
end-1990.

3.        At economic prices and before project costs are added, the sequence
with Ertan has a PV of Y 56,547 million before project costs, that without
Ertan a PV of Y 75,466 million, hence a supply cost savings of Y 18,918. The
PV of Ertan investment and O&M costs is Y 14,050. The net savings,
Y 4,868 million, are 35 percent of the investment.
4.        Levelized figures in fen/kWh are obtained by dividing the above by
the PV of the project output (121,093 GWh). The project unit cost is
11.6 fen/kWh as against an alternative "avoided" cost of 15.6 fen/kWh. This
"avoided" cost is analyzed and broken down into capacity and energy components
as followst
Concept                                          fen/kWh                        1

Average energy value                               7.6                          48
Total                                        15.6                        100
5.        At full commissioning, the project contribution to the firm power of
the grid is 1,000 MW (dry season) and the peaking capability is 2,760 MW.
Firm power is valued at the annualized price of base coal-fired capacity net
of outages (Y 650/kWj and the peaking capability in excess of firm power is
valued at the price of incremental peak power at other hydro sites (Y 250/kW).
The balance of the avoided cost is the alternative fuel cost. This
alternative fuel cost corresponds to a price of Y 180/ton of standard coal.
The alternative would break even with the Ertan project only if the
alternative fuel cost corresponded to a coal price of Y 84/ton. Details of
this analysis are presented in Table 2 (page 4).
