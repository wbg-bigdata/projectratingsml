Madagascar                                                                         Third Social Fund Project
Block 1: Project Description
1. The Project Development Objectives and key performance indicators
The Project Development Objectives and key performance indicators (See annex 1) (PDO) are similar to those of the on-
going Social Fund II Project (Cr. 2778-MAG) which has been highly successful in supporting Madagascar's rural population
since 1994. The mid-term review of the on-going project concluded that FID II met or surpassed its development objectives in
parallel with disbursements being about a year ahead of schedule, and concluding that FID will now focus on testing
approaches involving greater community participation.
In this context, Project Development Objectives (PDO) will include: (1) improved access of poor rural population to social
and economic infrastructure, (2) on a pilot basis, empowerment of poor rural communities and/or conununes to identify,
organize, manage funds and implement sub-projects responsive to community needs in order to achieve decentralized social
and economic development; (3) employment creation; and (4) improved capacity of private sector local small contractors and
consultants, artisans, skilled labor, and NGOs.
Key indicators for development, by type of sub-projects financed by theFonds d'Intervention pour le Developpement (FID)
under the project are shown in Annex 1 and in Table 3 of Annex 4. Those figures are only estimates since FID is demand-
driven. They will be subject to change according to the requests that the rural conmnunities/comunues themselves submit to
FITD during project implementation. The 350 communal infrastmcture projects to be rehabilitated or constructed will benefit
about 260,000 people; about 188 permanent jobs and 1,600,000 person/days of temporary employment will be created. Under
the 30 capacity building sub-projects to be implemented, about 200 rural communities and communes, 150 micro-enterprises,
75 consultants, 50 artisans and 20 NGOs will be trained.
2. Project components:

3. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project
The project supports the Government's poverty agenda which is summarized in a Letter of Sector Policy dated July 28, 1995.
4. Benefits and target population
FID's target population will continue to be poor rural communities. The types of sub-projects to be implemented will: (a)
have a direct impact on the well-being of the population while using a participatory community approach to the delivery of
basic social services; (b) pilot mechanisms for rural community groups (especially women) and/or communes to identify, plan,
and implement sub-projects responsive to community needs (details in Annex 2 para. 14); (c) support the development of rural
communities, communes, small contractors, consultants, artisans, and NGOs; and (d) provide temporary and permanent
employment opportumities. FID will finance projects only in rural areas where 80 percent of the population is considered poor
in Madagascar. SinceFID's operating costs under the on-going project have been less than 15 percent, the assumption is that
poor rural communities will benefit directly or indirectty from at least 85 percent of the proceeds of this project.

5. Institutional and implementation arrangements
Implementation period: 2 years
Executing agencies: Fonds d 'Intervention pour le Developpement (ED)
Project coordination: Project coordination will be the primary responsibility of the Director General of FlD in collaboration
with FID's 6 Regional Directors (1 for each province). FID has made a big effort to abide by thesectoral policies put in place
by the various Ministres, and therefore, is in regular contact with all concerned ministries (Health, Education, Public Works,
Energy and Mines, and Agriculture). In addition, in the case of the Ministries of Health and Education, there have been
formal agreements which have been signed between those ministries and FID which explicitly specify the role and
responsibility of FID. At the regional level, FID's Regional Directorates closely follow FID's Manual of Procedures which
clearly stipulates that individual FID sub-projects must be approved by the Regional Directorate of the concerned Mnistry
prior to the start-up of any field activity.
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.): The project will continue to be implemented by the FID which is a non-profit
association forpublic service (une association a but non-lucratifreconnue d'interet public). FU operates in accordance with
the provisions of its Articles of Agreement, by-laws, and Manual of Procedures and the Framework Agreement(Convention)
between FID and the government. The FID Association operates under a six person Board of Directors. The Board includes
one representative each from the Prime Minister, the donor community, NGOs, and socio-professional organizations, in
addition to two Directors elected by members of the "Association FID".
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: At the central level, a Financial and Administrative Director
oversee FID's accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements (which are also clearly defined inFID's Operating
Manual). The Financial and Administrative Director's responsibility is to oversee FD's entire accounting, auditing, and
financial reporting system which has been decentralized in the 6 regional directorates since 1994. Each of theFID's 6
respective regional directorates has an accountant who is responsible for accounting forFID's transactions in each of the
regional offices. He/she is also responsible for providing all justification of transactions on a monthly basis to the Centml
Level which reviews them and replenishes regional project accounts on the basis of proper accounting documentation.
FID has a computerized accounting/financial management system which is being used by all the regional offices and data
transmission from FID's regional offices to the central level is done electronically. Therefore, FID can now provide up to date
accounting and financial information for each regional office. Given the extensive reliance on the Bank' s 90-day Special
Account advance procedures and SOEs, special attention will be paid by the Financial Management Specialist in the resident
mission in verifying SOE reliability, and to the internal procedures and controls involved in SOE preparation and the flow of
funds from the Central Special Account and the decentralized (regional) accounts. Given the relatively short implementation
period, it is not envisaged that LACI type disbursements will be introduced. An assessment of FID's financial management
system is in the project files.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Monitoring is an integral part of each sub-project implemented. FID has about
1,500 sub-projects which have been completed or which are on-going. FID is hi the process of expanding its data base
capabilities to maintain detailed information on each sub-project (stage of the sub-project, total cost, beneficiary contribution,
cost per square meter or other unit cost, training issues and modalities, maintenance aspects, in the case of schools enrollment
rate information, in the case of health centers attendance figures, impact on women, etc.). This data base has been
decentralized to FID's regional offices which will be responsible for entering detailed information on each individual sub-
project which in turn will be transmitted electronically from the regional offices and compiled by the central level.
Approximately 30 percent of monitoring and evaluation resources will be directed towards the pilot activities which this
operation will finance directly through conmnunes/community groups to gather data and information as to how best to design
the larger community development social fund (FY00).
FID will also continue to undertake detailed evaluations of selected sub-projects semi-annually (at the time of the technical
audit and at the time of the annual review with the Bank). In addition, FID will transmit updated information on a quarterly
basis to its Board of Directors and to the Bank. It is envisaged that FID will make the effort to also sharesectoral information
with concerned line ministries at the central, regional as well as local levels. As a result of FD piloting sub-projects through
communes and community groups, FID's monitoring and evaluation system will have to monitor the community, communal
aspect as well as selected individual households. Supervision missions will use this information as one of the bases for
discussions.

Block 2: Project Rationale
1. CAS objective(s) supported by the project: Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: Report No. 16249-
MAG, discussed by the Board in February 1997. The project is consistent
with the Bank Group CAS discussed by the Executive Directors on February
18, 1997
The CAS main objectives are poverty reduction through high rates of broad-based economic growth, and human capital
Development (focused on primary education, basic health care and rural infrastructure). To ensure that the poor will indeed be
better off, the CAS proposes activities that would improve rural transport, education and health, including nutrition and access
to clean water. A key focus of the CAS is also to assist in the empowerment of local communities to tackle their
development challenges. The proposed project will address all of those objectives.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy
Poverty has become entrenched in Madagascar's social fabric. In 1993, Seven out of 10 Malagasy were considered to be poor
(i.e., they cannot purchase a minimum 2100-calorie food basket and essential non-food items); six out of 10 are extremely poor
(i.e. they cannot purchase even the food basket). Based on Govermment estimates in 1997, it appears that only 3 out of 10
Malagasy are now considered to be extremely poor. Govermuent data also indicates that theGini coefficient has increased from
44% in 1993 to 48% in 1997. Over 85 percent of the poor live in rural areas, where poverty is also deeper. About 18 percent of
poor households are headed by women, engaged mostly in farming. Poor households have around 5 members, compared to 4
for non-poor households, and are more likely to: be illiterate; not send children to school; have malnourished children; use
wood as main source of fuel; and rely on lakes/ponds/rivers for drinking water. It is clear that rural poverty, which has as its
main cause the poor productivity and competitiveness of the agricultural sector, has been exacerbated by the lack of productive
and social infrastructure and other services, and an over centralized decision-making process for the allocation of resources.
The Government's central objective is to steadily reduce the incidence of poverty by half from about 70 percent in 1996 to 35
percent in 2015. This target can only be realized by achieving very ambitious economic growth rates, while reversing
environmental degradation and improving the assets of the poor. Pro-poor growth will call for inter alia: improved sector
policies promoting rural development; more efficient public investment and restructuring of public expenditures; and
encouragement of local initiatives.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices
Sector issues to be addressed by the project are the widespread incidence of poverty (particularly in rural areas), the failure of
the state to deliver basic social services to the population, the lack of access to markets and the lack of facilities for productive
activities. By increasing the availability in rural areas of economically-efficient and beneficiary-driven productive and social
infrastructure, the project will contribute to the modernization of the rural economy and enhance rural well-being. The project
will explore concrete options of supporting the decentralization process in Madagascar by working directly with communes and
other decentralized organizations. It will be one of the main instruments which will have a positive impact on poverty
reduction in rural areas by empowering beneficiaries to become key actors in the rural development process--this scenario
should ensure that beneficiaries who have had a say in the communal development process (and have also made financial
contributions) will also follow-up to ensure that investments made are properly maintained and therefore sustainable.
4. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
The Government and Madagascar's rural population perceive FID as the main donor financed instrument which has been able to
finance a large array of community development projects nationwide. The alternative to this Social Fund mechanism would be
to work directly with line ministries. However, FID's comparative advantage is its ability to directly reach out to the
population by giving them an opporbtmity to voice their opinions in terms of prioritization of community development
activities. FID has also been able to identify a niche for itself by becoming complementary to efforts of line ministries and
other IDA and donor financed projects. Therefore, the first step in the identification and preliminary design of the project has
been a series of meetings with line ministries and other donors to establish clearly the areas where FID interventions would be
needed and welcome, and would be consistent with the sectoral priorities and policies of the Govermment. For example, there is
plenty of room for FID sub-projects for water supply in rural areas, and the rehabilitation of micro irrigated perimeters is well

suited for FID interventions, as opposed to that of small irrigated perimeters taken care of by other projects. Similarly, the
financing of schools by FID complement what will be done under the IDA financed Education project CRESED II and by other
donors, and FID's interventions in the health sector are most likely to be limited to health posts (postes de sante') which are not
covered by other sources.

6. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
The project builds on the experience of on-going FID, other IDA financed social funds in Africa and in other parts of the world.
Lessons learned show that Communities no matter how poor, are generally willing to contribute a share of the costs of a sub-
project in kind or in cash, if they are convinced that the subproject will be implemented and will contribute to their well-being.
Continued monitoring of project impact is necessary to learn from operational experience and modify the approach and
procedures accordingly.
Lessons learned from FID (and other on-going projects in Madagascar) are that in order to be successful a social fund needs:
(i) political support from high level Government officials who do not interfere with the project's day-to-day management;
(ii) consensus as to the goals and integrity of the social fund; (iii) a qualified and decently-paid staff; (iv) the existence of well
defined and transparent management and accounting procedures; and (v) regular and' frequent financial, managerial and
technical audits. FID's mid-term review in October 1998 concluded that FID is now the key rural development project in
Madagascar which will be complemented by the Transport Sector and Micro-finance Projects and other operations.
It is clearly perceived as the mechanism which has actually come through and supported rural communes/communities by
financing over 1500 conmnunity development sub-projects nationwide. As a result, FID has created a momentum which this
project will maintain. One of the main conclusions of this review was that in light of the on-going decentralization process
which has given financial as well as managerial autonomy to the communes, FID would pilot sub-projects to support directly

poor rural communes to identify, organize, manage funds and implement sub-projects responsive to their needs. FID would in
essence channel these funds directly to the communes/communities who would in tum take on the leadership role and defme,
plan, initiate and follow-up on the bidding process, supervise construction and maintain their sub-projects. This new approach
would give comnunes/communities full responsibility as the key decision makers and operators in the community development
process. Beneficiary contributions will also be increased to a minimum of 10 percent (20 percent for communal sub-projects) to
ensure a higher degree of ownership (Annex 2para. 14). It is anticipated that by the time this project closes, over 50 percent of
sub-projects will be implemented by communes/communities.
This project should be considered as a "bridge loan" to the larger FID IV Project which will fully support
communallcommunity development initiatives on a large scale basis. Lessons leamed from communal/community involvement
will be fully integrated into the larger FID project to ensure that communes/communities are the leaders in terms of
development activities which will benefit their communities. This is in line with the decentralization process where communes
will have financial, administrative, and managerial autonomy to decide how best to proceed in terms of overall community
development.
7. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership
From the beginning, the Governnent has been very supportive of FID's objectives and operations. Over the years, Government
has given FID the necessary counterpart funds. The Prime Minister's Office has exercised general oversight of FIT) activities,
but has not interfered in FID's staffmg and day-to-day operations. From recent meetings with all technical ministries working
directly or indirectly with FID, it is clear that FITD is perceived as a Malagasy project which supports Govenrnent'ssectoral
investment plans. Also, FID is now fully accepted by the population at-large, whose confidence has not been eroded by the fact
that FID has not been able to respond favorably to all requests (although by the mid-term review, about 1,500 sub-projects had
been completed or were under implementation under the ongoing Social Fund II Project, FITD had been able to address only 20
percent of the requests received).
8. Value added of Bank support
The Bank has acquired a significant amount of knowledge during the past decade on the design and implementation of social
funds as mechanisms to quickly and efficiently channel funds to the most vulnerable groups and to empower rural communities
to take care of their own development This is exactly what has happened with FID, as community groups are becoming full-
fledged actors in the development process. In addition, the Bank has "fine-tuned " most of the social funds documents, such as
manual of procedures, including guidelines for simplified procurement and disbursement for community-based investments,
and therefore the cost and time required for preparation are minimized. The Bank's involvement in the ongoing Social Fund II
Project has shown that the Bank can play a key role in efforts that combine poverty alleviation and development. The proposed
project complements the Bank efforts in Madagascar in rural development, education, health, infrastructure and private sector
development.

Block 3: Summary Project Assessments
1. Economic Assessment  [   Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$         [  Cost Effectiveness  [x]  Other
million; ERR=    %                       Analysis:              See annex IV
Given the multi-sectoral nature of the sub-projects, a range of benefits is expected, many of which are not quantifiable. Since
the project is demand driven it is difficult to determine a priori the composition of FID's portfolio, and an overall NPV or
ERR has not been estimated. The economic benefits include improved standard of living in beneficiary areas due to retmns
from sub-project investments in social and economic infrastructure, the creation of income earning opportunities through
employment creation, and increased productivity and sustainability through increased ownership by conununes/communities
of created conmnunal assets. There are also indirect increases in incomes in beneficiary areas through multiplier effects. The
expected social benefits include enhanced community organizational capacity to undertake conmnunity-prioritized projects, as
well as improved collaboration between communal leaders, associations' representatives and local sector officials in carrying
out a process of cross-sectoral planning coordinated at the local level. Simple screening procedures will be applied to ensure
targeting of benefits to poorer and more vulnerable groups and to establish the economic justification of sub-projects. For
revenues earning sub-projects, a mmiimum economic or financial rate of return will be required. Non-revenue earning sub-
projects will be subject to cost-effectiveness analysis.
2. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5). This being a Social Fund Project, there are no major financial issues.
3. Technical Assessment
The design and standards of sub-projects will be consistent with the norms and standards of the technical ministries involved,
and will be based on the use of simple, appropriate and environmentally sound technologies, corresponding to the needs and
capabilities (for construction, as well as operation and maintenance) of the population. Labor intensive works will be
preferred whenever proven as technically and economically efficient and insofar as they generate employment opportunities
that the local population can take advantage of.
4. Institutional Assessment
a Executing agencies: The project will continue to be implemented by the FID which is a non-profit association for public
service (une associafion a but non-lucratif reconnue d'interet public). FID operates in accordance with the provisions of its
Articles of Agreement, by-laws, and Manual of Procedures and of the Framework Agreement (Convention) between FID and
the Government. The Association FID operates under a six-person Board of Directors. The Board includes a representative
each of the Prime Minister's Office (who is Chairman of the Board), the donor community,NGOs, and socio-professional
organizations, in addition to two Directors elected by the members of the Association FID.
b. Project management: FID is managed by a General Manager (DirecteurGen6ral) who was recruited based on a
competitive recruitment process in 1995. His performance has been satisfactory since he has been able to increase
substantially the pace of project implementation. His other strength has been the fact that he has been able to coordinate with
all technical ministries concerned who perceive FID as an "ally" who is helping them implement their sectoral policies.
The mammum amount of FID financing or grant for an infastructure project is US$50,000 equivalent, with the exception of
transport infrastructure project such as communal roads for which the ceiling is US$100,000. The modalities for
implementation vary, depending on the type and cost of sub-projects. FID has a Manual of Procedures which clearly defines
identification, preparation, appraisal, selection and implementation modalities for each type of sub-project In order not to
block smaller scale sub-projects, regional directors can approve projects of up to US$20,000 fnancing per project, the
General Manager up to US$45,000 (or US$90,000 for transport infrastructure projects) and anything above requires the
approval of FID's Board of Directors (for an estimated 10% of sub-projects). In any case, beneficiaries are expected to
contribute a mninimum of 10 percent of the cost of each sub-project in cash or in-kind (except for feeder roads where the
beneficiary contribution will be 5 percent). Sub-projects presented by communities willing to provide higher contnbutions
are given a higher priority for implementation due to the fact that they lead to higher sustainability. Beneficiary assessments
are in the process of being launched to determine minimum beneficiary contributions per type of sub-project. All pilot
conununity/conununal sub-projects will require a minimum 20 percent contribution.

5. Social Assessment
Special attention will be paid to the involvement of women in the decision-making process, particularly to give priority to sub-
projects which reduce their household tasks (rural water supply, and improved access to local markets and health centers),
increase their income (construction of markets) or improve their living conditions (rural health centers and sanitation). Women
will also be represented in the users' associations. The construction/rehabilitation of schools will ensure that girls continue to
have access to education (female enrollment is not a problem, since girls account for close to 50 percent of enrollments).
6. Environmental Assessment          Environmental Category  []  A     [x]  B       [ i   C
Justification/Rationale for category rating: The project could have a limited environmental impact for certain types of sub-
projects. As a result, an environmental assessment has been undertaken prior to board presentation to: (a) provide an overview
of potential environmental issues for selected types of sub-projects; (b) assess any necessary capacity building within the
project unit to examine and evaluate projects which could have a negative environmental impact; and (c) draft the
"enviromnental checklist" for sub-projects to be financed by FID to be inserted into the Manual of Procedures. Eligible sub-
projects will continue to include reforestation and erosion control. Prior to final project approval, all FID sub-projects will be
subject to the environmental checklist.

8. Sustainability
The sustainability of FID's sub-projects will be achieved by ensuring maximum community involvement in the identification,
preparation, appraisal, selection and implementation of a sub-project. In addition, FID has to ensure that the target
beneficiaries (and not political figures) are actually making the in-cash or in-kind contributions. Experience also shows that
the more substantial the beneficiary contnbutions, the better chance that the sub-project will be properly and efficiently utilized
by the community and the better chances that the proper funds are allocated towards maintenance. During the last year, FID
has made a substantial effort in creating awareness among the various communities who have benefited from sub-projects as to
the need for maintenance and is allocating funds to train community members in proper maintenance techniques. Cost
recovery mechanisms have been put in place for a large number of PID sub-projects mainly in the areas of health where health
posts are now charging user fees, certain feeder roads which are charging tolls, etc. In addition, in the cases of primary schools
and health posts, agreement has to be reached with the sectoral ministry (prior to the start of the works) that the appropriate
personnel (teachers in the case of school and nurse/mid-wife in the case of health post) will be transferred to that facility.
All projects financing rural development activities, including FID will have to coordinate cost recovery policies in
coordination with concerned line ministries to ensure coherence from one project to another. Lastly, FID has explicitly
requested that a maintenance clause be inserted in all civil works contracts which basically stipulates that contractors are also
responsible for training community groups in maintenance activities. Regarding rural roads, FID and other concerned parties
will have to make a strong case to budget resources from the road fund for road maintenance activities as communal budgets
alone will not be able to finance road maintenance activities. This is coherent with the new "CharteRoutiere" in Madagascar
which breaks down roads into three different types (primary, secondary, and tertiary). On this basis, the road fund should
provide an estimated $300/km per year for the maintenance of teriary roads to be rehabilitated by FID and the other $300
matched by the communes. This is also coherent with the "Charte Routiere" and other legislation pertaining to decentralization
whereby tertiary roads are "owned" by communes and therefore have to be maintained by them.

Third Social Fund Project
Detailed Project Description
Project Objectives
1.   The Project Development Objectives (PDO) are: (1) improved access of poor rural population to
social and economic infrastructure; (2) on a pilot basis, empowerment of poor rural communities and/or
communes to identify, organize, manage funds and implement sub-projects responsive to community
needs in order to achieve decentralized social and economic development; (3) employment creation; and
(4) improved capacity of private sector: local small contractors and consultants, artisans, skilled labor,
and NGOs. Detailed monitoring targets by type of sub-projects financed by FID under the project are
shown in Annex 1 and in Table 3 of Annex 4. Those figures are only estimates since FID is demand-
driven. They will be subject to change according to the requests that the rural communities/communes
themselves submit to FID during project implementation. The 350 communal infrastructures to be
rehabilitated or constructed will benefit about 260,000 people; about 188 permanent jobs and 1,600,000
person/days of temporary employment will be created. With the 30 capacity building sub-projects to be
implemented, about 300 rural communities and communes, 150 micro-enterprises, 75 consultants, 50
artisans and 20 NGOs will be trained.
2.   The strategy is to address the incidence of poverty amongst the country's poorer communities
through the replenishment of a social fund designed to support demand-driven initiatives developed by
such communities and, in doing so, to create employment and improve access to basic social services.
The proposed project will support community development initiatives which appear to be the most
responsive to the population's needs. FID will address the widespread incidence of poverty in rural areas
of all the six provinces of Madagascar, and the primary beneficiaries will be mainly poor rural
communities. The proposed project will continue the experiment successfully begun under the first two
projects of a participatory approach for decentralized development. The types of sub-projects to be
implemented will: (a) have a direct impact on the well being of the population by supporting innovative
approaches to the delivery of basic community social services; (b) provide temporary and permanent
employment opportunities; (c) provide a mechanism for rural communities to identify and participate in
the implementation of sub-projects responsive to community needs; and (d) support the development of
small local contractors, consulting firms, NGOs, artisans and skilled labor. Once the sub-projects are
completed, communities will be expected to finance their operation and maintenance.
Project implementation
3.   The proposed project is well prepared and ready for implementation, since it is for the most part a
continuation of activities that are carried out satisfactorily under the ongoing project. The only exception
is the experiments that FID is about to launch under the ongoing project and will expand under the
proposed project to test various options for financing infrastructure sub-projects that will be managed and
implemented by the rural communities and/or communes themselves. A preliminary design exists for
those experiments, but it is likely to evolve over time as FID draws the lessons of experience.
4.   The proposed project will finance the construction and rehabilitation of basic infrastructure and
capacity building. FID's procedures are clearly defined in a Manual of Procedures, which is part of the
Project Implementation Plan. The Manual of procedures recalls the fundamental objectives of the FID,
and establishes: (a) the types of sub-projects, and the selection and evaluation criteria; (b) the
beneficiaries; (c) the terms and conditions of financing; (d) the procedures whereby FID receives and



Annex 2
Page 2 of 5
processes requests from beneficiaries, including who has the authority to approve sub-projects and grants;
(e) sub-project implementation and
supervision, including model contracts between the FID and beneficiaries; (f) the procurement
procedures, including sample bidding documents and model contracts for sub-project engineering,
execution and supervision; (g) the disbursement and accounting procedures, and the requirements for
audit by independent external auditors; (h) the financial management procedures; and (i) the monitoring
and evaluation procedures, and the nature and periodicity of reporting by the FID.
5.   The Government will continue to provide IDA funds to FID on a grant basis. The maximum
amount of FID financing or grant for a sub-project is US$50,000 equivalent, with the exception of
transport infrastructure (rural roads, bridges, etc.) for which the maximum is US$100,000 equivalent per
sub-project. The criteria for sub-project selection vary by type of sub-project. In all cases, sub-project
selection procedures include: (i) formation of an association of beneficiaries responsible for the
identification of the sub-project, the provision of the community contribution and the subsequent
maintenance of the completed sub-project; (ii) in order to ensure ownership, assurances that the
community's contribution would not be less than 5 to 10 percent of the total cost of each sub-project; (iii)
an assessment of cost effectiveness as reflected in the cost per beneficiary or other indicator - sub-projects
are subject to economic analysis wherever appropriate; (iv) an assessment of environmental impact
wherever appropriate; (v) consistency with the sector strategies and programs, and adherence to norms
established by the technical ministries; (vi) costs of sub-projects which are within the capacity of the
population to pay its share; and (vii) provision for maintenance of infrastructure and sustainability of sub-
project operation beyond the project period, including recovery of operating costs where appropriate. To
this end, FID will require that communities provide evidence of their ability and willingness to ensure
appropriate maintenance of the sub-project beyond the period of FID financing as one of the criteria of
sub-project selection. FID does not finance recurrent activities or sub-projects that: are of an emergency
nature; already receive funding from other sources; have been eliminated from government or local
authorities' investment programs; may have a negative impact on the environment; and are too
sophisticated or heavily mechanized. Also, the FID will not finance sub-projects in any community
where the beneficiaries of previous FID sub-projects have not complied with their commitments
regarding the implementation, management and maintenance of those previous sub-projects.
Project Description
Total project cost: US$ 17.7 million (IDA credit: US$ 15.0 million, Government contribution: US$1.6
million, and beneficiary contributions US$ 1.1 million).
6.   The types of sub-projects to be financed will basically be the same as those financed under the
ongoing project, since communities want more of the same. However, as FID does not intend to become
a financial institution, the proposed project will not include any income-generating activities. More
emphasis will be given to training activities to build the capacity of not only consultants and contractors,
but also of local associations of beneficiaries and communes. As part of project preparation, there has
been a series of meetings with line ministries and other donors to establish clearly the areas where FID
interventions are needed and welcome, and are consistent with the sectoral priorities and policies of the
Government.



Annex 2
Page 3 of 5
7.   It is estimated that, under the proposed project, FID will finance a total of 380 sub-projects: 350
communal infrastructure sub-projects and 30 capacity building sub-projects. A tentative distribution by
type of sub-project is given in Annex 1 and in Table 3 of Annex 4. Those figures are indicative only; they
are subject to change based on the requests made by the communities themselves.
Project Component 1: Rehabilitation/construction of Communal Infrastructure - Total estimated
cost: US$ 15.0 million (IDA credit: US$12.4 million; Government contribution: US$ 1.4 million, and
beneficiary contributions: US$ 1.1 million).
Context
8.   The contribution of community organizations in assessing local needs and capabilities forms an
important part of social policy, and community organizations may be best placed to implement certain
activities. In particular, the contribution of community groups can be critical to the development of
education and health institutions at a local level. After contributing their ideas and financial resources to
the construction / rehabilitation of a school or a health post for example, community groups can play a
crucial role in the sustainability of the institution by organizing and maintaining a system for operation
and maintenance. This is even more true for water supply, micro irrigated perimeters and markets, where
proper operation and maintenance of the facilities that have been built is critical to ensure their
sustainability.
Description
9.   Communal infrastructure activities are designed to complement sectoral development strategies.
The sub-projects to be financed under this component will be the rehabilitation of essential community
services (primary schools, community water supply and health posts), but will also include the
rehabilitation of rural roads, bridges, markets, and micro irrigated perimeters. Labor intensive works will
be preferred whenever proven as technically and economically efficient and insofar as they generate
employment opportunities which the rural poor can take advantage of.
10.  It is estimated that, under the proposed project, FID will finance a total of 350 communal
infrastructure sub-projects: 130 schools, 30 community water supply, 40 health centers, 35 micro irrigated
perimeters, 40 markets, 50 feeder roads, and 25 bridges and other transport infrastructure sub-projects.
As mentioned above, those figures are indicative only since the FID is demand-driven. One of the
mechanisms with which FID will track poverty incidence will be the use of the 1998 Anthropometric
Survey as a Baseline since nutritional status is an excellent proxy for poverty.
Implementation arrangements
11.  The FID is a financing entity that provides grants to finance sub-projects identified and prepared by
the beneficiaries themselves. The FID carries out promotion activities, appraises sub-projects, supervises
their implementation, and monitors and evaluates their impact on the target groups. The role of FID in
implementation varies depending on the amount of the grant for, and therefore on the size of, the sub-
project.
12.  For small infrastructure sub-projects (requiring a grant of less than US$7,500 equivalent), local
grass-root groups and communities are responsible for implementation and, if required, enter into
contracts with consultants, artisans and skilled labor, small contractors and suppliers. Their rights and



Annex 2
Page 4 of 5
responsibilities (including counterpart contribution, procurement procedures and disbursement schedules)
are defined in their contract with FID. For those types of sub-projects, FID has a financing and
monitoring role.
13.  Al other infrastiucture sub-projects are implemented by FID  under delegated contract
management. As 'Maitre d'Ouvrage Delegu", or the entity authorized to act on behalf of the
owners/beneficiaries of the infrastructure, FID enters into contracts with: (i) consultants for the design
and supervision of the works; and (ii) small local contractors for the execution of the works. The Manual
of Procedures of FID specifies clearly the procedures that FID must follow for procurement and
disbursement. It also includes a number of provisions to ensure that beneficiaries are fully involved in the
design of the sub-project, participate in its implementation (their contribution in cash or in kind must be
made before construction actually starts, with the exception of their contribution in the form of labor), and
are informed of the requirements for maintenance and receive some initial assistance to help them to carry
out their responsibility for maintenance.
14.  In line with the Government policy of decentralization, FID intends to progressively transfer more
responsibility for the implementation of sub-projects to rural communities and communes. Under the
ongoing project, FID is about to start 12 to 20 pilot sub-projects of different types and sizes to test various
alternative arrangements for the management and implementation of infrastructure by the beneficiaries
themselves. Those experiments will be continued and expanded under the proposed project. According
to the preliminary design for those experiments, transport infrastructure sub-projects (essentialy bridges
at this stage) will be managed and implemented by communes, and other infrastructure sub-projects by
associations/communities. The contribution of beneficiaries to the construction costs will be at least 20
percent. FID will enter into a financing agreement with the association/community and/or commune
spelling out the rights and obligations of each party. As required, the association/community or commune
will recruit a consultant for design and supervision. FID will approve the design. Construction will be
either by the beneficiaries themselves with the assistance of artisans and skilled labor, or by contracts
with small contractors, or by a combination of both. Very simplified bidding documents wil be used for
contracting. FID financing will be transferred to the bank account of the association or commune, with
the first payment after beneficiaries have provided their own contribution and subsequent payments
linked to the progress of construction. FID will supervise those pilot sub-projects with its own personnel,
paying close attention to monitoring and evaluation. Based on the lessons from those experiments, other
arrangements may also be tested.
Project Component 2: Capacity building - Total estimated cost: US$ 0.6 million (to be financed by
the IDA credit).
Context
15.  Under the ongoing project, there has been an emergence of local contractors and consultants which
is attributable to FID's increased work program and, therefore, to the increasing number of contracts for
consultancies and civil works. The works to be financed under the proposed project will create even more
business opportunities for contractors and consultants. Both contractors and consultants have weaknesses
which could have a negative impact on the quality of the works financed by FID, and jeopardize their
subsequent maintenance. Also, local associations of beneficiaries and rural communities/communes need
to be strengthened to be able to play a more active role in the identification, design, implementation and
maintenance of the sub-projects. In particular, some rural communities / local associations and
communes will need to be trained to be able to manage and implement satisfactorily the pilot



Annex 2
Page 5 of 5
infrastructure sub-projects included in the proposed project, and participate in a meaningful manner in the
monitoring and evaluation of those experiments.
Description
16.  The objective of this component is to promote an increased participation of beneficiaries and rural
communities/communes in the development of communal infrastructure and to ensure better quality and
maintenance of the infrastructure sub-projects. The capacity building sub-projects will assist FID's
partners (communes, rural communities, local associations, NGOs, small contractors and consultants) to
improve their effectiveness in identifying, preparing and implementing sub-projects. This will be done
through training programs tailored to the needs of the participants.
17. For local contractors and consultants, the training will be similar to the one done under the ongoing
project. It will be both theoretical and practical, and mostly technical in nature, dealing with the use of
labor-intensive techniques, the preparation of cost estimates, the preparation of bidding documents, bid
evaluation, and the management and supervision of works. It will also cover the management of the firms
themselves, including accounting and financial management.
18.  For rural communities/local associations and communes, the training will cover project
preparation, evaluation, selection of consultants, procurement (including the purchase of local materials
and the recruitment of small local contractors and artisans), management of works and contract
administration, simplified accounting, and the monitoring of some basic implementation indicators.
19.  Itis estimated that, underthe proposed project, FID will finance atotal of 30 capacity building sub-
projects for rural communities, local associations, communes, local contractors, consultants, artisans and
NGOs. Under the 30 capacity building sub-projects to be implemented, about 300 rural communities and
communes, 150 micro-enterprises, 75 consultants, 50 artisans and 20 NGOs will be trained. As
mentioned above, those figures are indicative only since the FID is demand-driven. The IDA credit will
finance up to 100 percent of the tuition costs for the training and, where necessary, a percentage (to be
determined) of the transportation and subsistence costs of participants.
Implementation arrangements
20.  For this component, the FID will be essentially a financing organization, since it does not have
(and should not attempt to acquire) the capability to conduct training. FID will be involved in the
selection of the participants and the preparation of the training curriculum in order to ensure that it is fully
responsive to the needs of the participants as identified by FID in its operations and that it will make those
participants better partners of FID. The training itself, however, will be contracted to consultants or
training organizations, including those financed by the Bank and other donors, in Madagascar or in
neighboring countries.
Note: A Project Implementation Manual, which includes the Manual of Procedures of FID, can be found
in the project file. These documents will be used as a basis for field supervision during the project
implementation phase.

Economic Justification
I. Introduction
1.   The FID is an instrument to address infrastructure needs of poor segments of the population. The
FID relies on community participation (at least 5 percent contribution to costs) to assign ownership of
investments to beneficiaries and create incentives at the ground level for rapid project implementation and
subsequent maintenance. Sub-projects support government policies in those sectors.
2.   The social fund FID will assist poor communities to finance a wide range of investments: school
construction! rehabilitation, health posts, markets, rural roads, potable water supply, and micro irrigated
perimeters. Since the FID is demand-driven, it is difficult to determinea priort the composition of the
FID's portfolio. Based on experience with FID I and FID II, communities have highest demand for
construction/rehabilitation of schools (35 percent of sub-projects), followed by rural roads (15 percent of
sub-projects), health centers (13 percent of sub-projects), micro irrigated perimeters - MPI (11 percent of
sub-projects), markets (9 percent of sub-projects) and water supply (8 percent of sub-projects).
3.   After a presentation of FID's achievements to date and the performance targets for the proposed
project, the analysis is organized in the following sections: (a) the section onpoverty characteristics,
targeting and monitoring identifies those with greatest need to ensure funds are appropriately directed; (b)
the section on project benefits presents the benefits that can be expected from the project; and (c) the
section on sustainability and fiscal impact discusses the relevant factors at the community and central
government levels.
II. FID Achievements to Date and Key Performance Indicators for the Proposed Project
4.   FID has achieved significant results. Table 1 shows the number of sub-projects completed or under
execution through June 1998, and Table 2 shows the key performance indicators for FID II. Regarding
the proposed project, Tables 3 and 4 below shows a range of indicators which will be used to guide FID
during project implementation. These have been developed based on the experience of the on-going
project. However, it should be mentioned once again that FID is demand driven and therefore these
figures are subject to change as the political, social, and economic context changes and communities
request different types of support.

Ill. Characteristics of Poverty, Targeting of Activities and Performance Monitoring
Poverty
5.   The key finding of the poverty assessment of June 1996 is that the majority of Madagascar's 13.5
million people live in a state of significant deprivation. The country is one among few experiencing
declines in education, nutrition and life expectancy, with health and nutrition indicators at or below highly
unsatisfactory averages for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Lack of access to safe water, poor sanitation and
low nutritional standards are the leading causes of illness and death. Few seek health care; public
facilities are ill-equipped, and private health care is too costly. Schools are poorly managed, with under-
paid, ill-trained teachers. Public spending on health and education has been falling in real terms and does
not benefit the poorest layers of the population. Also eroding living standards are problems of security in
rural areas and isolation, combined with the lack of physical access to social services, financial services
and agricultural markets and the lack of facilities for the development of productive activities. Finally,
slash-and-bum agriculture continues to cause extensive deforestation and loss of topsoil, threatening
biological diversity and the agrarian economy
6.   Poverty has become entrenched in Madagascar's social fabric. Seven out of 10 Malagasy are poor
(e.g., they cannot purchase a minimum 2100-calorie food basket and essential non-food items); six out of
10 are extremely poor (e.g., they cannot purchase even the food basket). 1997 Government data indicate
that the situation has improved with only 3 out of 10 persons considered to be extremely poor. Over 85
percent of the poor live in rural areas, where poverty is also deeper; the remaining 15 percent poor are
urban, accounting for nearly half that population. Regionally, poverty incidence is highest in Toliara.
Farmers are the poorest: 80 percent of poor households are headed by farmers, herders and fishermen. In
contrast, wage-earners fare best (only 14 percent of poor households). About 18 percent of poor
households are headed by women, engaged mostly in farming. Poor households have around 5 members,
compared to 4 for non-poor households, and are more likely to: be illiterate; not send children to school;
have malnourished children; use wood as main source of fuel; and rely on lakes/ponds/rivers for drinking
water. It is clear that rural poverty, which has as its main cause the poor productivity and competitiveness
of the agricultural sector, has been exacerbated by the lack of productive and social infrastructure and
other services, and an overcentralized decision-making process for the allocation of resources.
7.   The Government's central objective is to steadily reduce the incidence of poverty by half from
about 70 percent in 1996 to 35 percent in 2015. This target can only be realized by achieving very
ambitious economic growth rates, while reversing environmental degradation and improving the assets of
the poor. Pro-poor growth will call forinter alia: improved sector policies promoting rural development;
more efficient public investment and restructuring of public expenditures; and encouragement of local
initiatives.
Targeting
8.   The overarching objective of the project is to alleviate poverty. The vast majority of beneficiaries
are expected to be from the population below the poverty line. Since the Madagascar poverty assessment
has recommended a rural based strategy for poverty reduction, the proposed project will target primarily
rural areas where more than 85 percent of the poor live. Sub-project proposals must demonstrate clearly
that they will lead to a reduction in poverty or vulnerability of the community. The impact of the project
on the incomes and living standards of the poor will be assessed through beneficiary surveys and studies
of socio-economic impact, as is being done for the ongoing project.



Annex 4
Page 5 of 10
Monitoring
9.   Monitoring of implementation progress has been robust under FID I and II. An elaborate system
has been developed and is being implemented which keeps track of the type and location of sub-projects,
investment cost, community contribution, and number of beneficiaries. The existing capacity would serve
the proposed project quite well. A beneficiary assessment of activities under FID I has been undertaken;
it has been used for the final design of the FID II and will also serve as a checkpoint for the
implementation of the proposed project. Monitoring of targeting effectiveness would be aided by the fact
that FID interventions are mainly in rural areas, where the vast majority of the poor live.
10.  Monitoring of outcomes is an area where the proposed project could make progress over FID I and
II. The costs associated with monitoring are not that critical, given the size of FID operations. It remains
important to obtain some objective measures, in addition to the favorable comments circulating by word
of mouth in Madagascar, about the impact that individual sub-projects have on the communities that
requested the investment. The FID is undertaking a study of the socio-economic impact of its sub-
projects, adopting a sampling approach and monitoring a small pool of each type of sub-projects. For
education sub-projects, enrollment at the village level, examination performance, or wages in subsequent
years, are suitable outcomes to measure. For health posts, number of visits, number of patients, and
medications purchased or distributed are reasonable indicators of impact. Finally, for water sub-projects,
agricultural output for irrigation perimeters, or reduced incidence of illness for potable water supply will
be considered. Since the objective is always to ascertain the marginal impact or benefit individual sub-
projects have on the community, some data gathering is required before a sub-project is undertaken.
IV. Project Benefits
11.  Given the multi-sectoral nature of the sub-projects, a range of benefits is expected, many of which
are not quantifiable. In any event, since the project is demand driven it is difficult to determini priori
the composition of FID's portfolio which will depend on communities' priorities, and an overall NPV or
ERR has not been estimated. Reduced poverty of poorer communities is expected to be achieved through
a mixture of economic and social benefits.
12.  The proposed project aims at alleviating poverty while building local community capacity for
development. Specifically, it is expected that the project will: (a) develop communities infrastructure
such as schools, health centers, markets, rural roads and irrigation systems; (b) finance 350 contracts with
micro-, small- and medium-enterprises and 175 contracts with consulting firms, as well as another 20
contracts with NGOs and 50 with artisans and skilled workers, and create about 3 millions person-days of
temporary employment on infrastructure sub-projects, and about 300 permanent jobs; and (c) train about
300 rural communities/communes, 150 contractors, 75 consultants, 20 NGOs, and 50 artisans.
Economic benefits
13.  The economic benefits include improved standard of living in beneficiary areas dueto returns from
sub-project investments in social and economic infrastructure, the creation of income-earning
opportunities through employment, and increased productivity and sustainability of created communal
assets with improved in-service delivery. There are also indirect increases in incomes in beneficiary areas
through multiplier effects.
14.  Simple screening procedures, using data on average cost per beneficiary for example, are applied to
establish the economic justification of sub-projects. Technically non-viable sub-projects are not eligible
for financing. Also, community contributions as a share of sub-project cost are taken as an indicator of



Annex 4
Page 60flO
community ownership and commitment to maintain the productive life of the assets.  Prudent
management dictates that sub-projects with a low chance of sustainability not be undertaken and
communities with poor track records of sustainability be denied financing for additional sub-projects.
This is indeed reflected in the manual of procedures of FID. FID sub-projects are subject to economic
analysis wherever appropriate. Economic internal rates of return are usually high because most of the
sub-projects consist of the rehabilitation/reconstruction of existing infrastructure and include substantial
sunk costs. In the case of rural roads, the potential traffic volume is used to justify the investment and to
assess whether the design is appropriate. In the case of micro irrigated perimeters, the expected increase
in agricultural production is taken into account.
15. Social infrastructure sub-projects are not required to meet a rate of return test. In any event, school
and health post sub-projects consist mainly of the replacement or rehabilitation of existing structures; the
underlying rate of return is expected to be quite high for these sub-projects even though not explicitly
calculated.
16.  A case can be made that for education and health sector sub-projects financed under a social fund
which are in support of a well-prepared governmental master plan for each sector, economic analysis on a
sub-project basis for the social fund may not be necessary. This assumes that an optimal strategy for each
sector has been worked out and economic analysis has been done at the national level when the strategy
was conceived and within it, all investments were shown to have positive economic NPVs.
17.  Complete economic and financial benefits to education are often difficult to capture because a
substantial portion of the benefits to education are extemalities - they are benefits to society above those
that accrue to individuals from their own education. Empirical studies for Madagascar are currently
unavailable, but based on discussions with education and community officials or experiences in other
countries, three types of benefits have been identified for this category of sub-project. First, better
facilities contribute to a drop in repeater rates for the school. The second source of benefits is the
expected increase in farmer income as a result of receiving better schooling. Finally, in some cases
students are expected to save time by attending school in their own community, rather than undertaking a
long commute to a nearby village. Regarding costs, communities bear part of the construction cost, with
the remainder born by Government through FID. The distributional impact of the investment (between
the local economy, imports and taxes) also vary. Recurrent costs to the sub-project are born jointly by the
community and the Government. The community is responsible for upkeep of the school building and the
Government for providing a teacher for the school. Generally, studies done in other countries show that
the benefits accruing to society as a whole are rather small, relative to the cost of the investment. Usually,
the largest benefit comes from incremental income gained by individuals who were not previously
participating in the school system. Several reasons can be given for the relatively low return to this
investment. First, failure to consider broader benefits and externalities of education (such as better health
for girls, etc.), due to lack of data; second, absence of data on earnings differentials between literate and
illiterate heads of households. Finally, the pay-off from education may be low due to the lack of
economic opportunities. If jobs valuing education are few, then the return to education is low. In this
case, the high demand for education can only be seen as having some sort of utility rather than market
value, if parents believe that education is necessary, but not sufficient to guarantee, higher future income.
18.  Similar analyses on health infrastructure suggest that their financing and operation may be tenuous
because several sources of financing must come together for the infrastructure to be operational and
sustainable. A high level of coordination may be required on the part of bilateral and multilateral donors,
government and NGOs for a sub-project to meet its objectives. In health, the proposed project is expected
to finance the construction of primary level infrastructure (rural health posts), which tend to carry out



Annex 4
Page 7 of 10
interventions in the higher end of the cost effectiveness spectrum (EPI, re-hydration therapy, malaria
treatment, TBA ante-natal and delivery care, etc.). Such interventions, which are nornally carried out at
the primary level of care, tend to favor primarily women and children and are expected to yield
substantial gains in life-years saved.
19.  As all the sub-projects are small in size (a maximum FID financing of US$100,000 for transport
infrastructure sub-projects and US$50,000 for other sub-projects), shadow prices are not used in the
analysis. However, in view of the fact that these projects are highly labor intensive and in view of the
high unemployment/ underemployment rate in the country, it is likely that the rates of return would be
higher if shadow pricing were to be used. For those sub-projects requiring an economic internal rate of
return justification, a very simple sensitivity analysis is used.
Social benefits
20.  The expected social benefits include enhanced community organizational capacity to undertake
community-prioritized projects, as well as improved collaboration between communal leaders,
associations' representatives and local sector officials in carrying out a process of cross-sectoral planning
coordinated at the local level. FID is helping communities to take charge of their destiny and
empowering them. By doing so, FID is helping to accelerate the process of effective decentralization,
which is a major objective of the Govemnment.
21.  On the institutional side, the proposed project provides additional financing for an ongoing social
fund which has been successful. FID has a very strong management which is to a large extent politically
insulated. Some problems, particularly regarding the active role that beneficiary associations should play
and the capacity of FID partners to perform satisfactorily, have been identified and measures have been
taken to correct them. These include training for contractors and consultants, as well as associations of
beneficiaries to ensure adequate maintenance of sub-projects.
IV. Sustainability and Fiscal Impact
Sustainability
22.  Regarding the institutional sustainability, a social fund itself is generally not sustainable in the long
run without external financing. The proposed project is an additional phase of FID requested by
Government, proving that an autonomous institution such as the FID remains the best option to
implement small-scale sub-projects at community level. In the future, financial assistance is also likely to
be forthcoming from other donors. It is worth noting that FID does support the sustainable development
of communities, in particular by helping build local capacity to prepare and execute development sub-
projects, for example, at the community and micro-enterprises level.
23.  For the Government, FID is considered an integral part of Madagascar's rural development strategy
and is an essential instrument to strengthen the capacity of the communes and rural communities to
maintain their assets and, therefore, ensure the sustainability of the sub-projects. The sustainability of
FID's sub-projects will be achieved by ensuring maximum community involvement in the identification,
preparation, appraisal, selection and implementation of a sub-project. In addition to contributing a share
of sub-project costs, as a condition of sub-project approval communities will be requested to submit a
plan for the maintenance of the completed asset. This plan will show responsibilities and financial
contributions to be made by community members or users. Sub-project proposals are also reviewed to
ensure that sectoral ministries will provide for recurrent expenditures generated by the sub-project and for



Annex 4
Page 8 of 10
which the sector is responsible. FID will ensure that the target beneficiaries (and not political figures) are
actually making the in-cash or in-kind contributions. Experience shows that the more substantial the
beneficiary contributions, the better the chance that the sub-project will be properly and efficiently
utilized by the community and the better the chance that adequate funds will be allocated towards
maintenance. Even under the ongoing Social Fund II Project, FID is exploring ways to increase those
beneficiary contributions. Recently, FID has made substantial efforts to create awareness among the
various communities who have benefited from sub-projects as to the pros of maintenance and is allocating
funds to train community members in proper maintenance techniques and organizational matters. A
maintenance clause inserted in all civil works contracts stipulates that the contractor is also responsible
for training a few persons designated by the community in maintenance activities. Regarding rural roads,
FID has been working with decentralized public officials such as mayors to ensure that the necessary
funds are budgeted and made available for maintenance activities.
24.  Although empirical studies of community financing in Madagascar do not exist, FID experience
and field visits have revealed the ability of communities to gather financial resources for priority projects.
Overall, the financing requirements that sub-projects place on communities, for both capital and recurrent
expenditures, are considered reasonable and moderate.
Fiscal impact
25. The project is part of an overall package meant to help the poorer sections of the country's
population survive the current difficult period until sustained economic growth reduces poverty.
Nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, beneficiary contributions are required for all sub-projects to ensure
ownership and sustainability. The government contribution is expected to be about US$ 2.0 million,
almost all of it to cover taxes on civil works contracts and consultancies, since those will not be exempt
from domestic taxes; so that the net Government contribution will be negligible. On the other hand, in
the case of infrastructures built by contractors, government gains revenues from taxes paid by those
contractors on all the items that they import. Tax revenues from anticipated higher income streams to
sub-project beneficiaries are not considered as part of the fiscal impact, because those benefits are
expected to accrue to rural communities that, based on reality in Madagascar today, are outside the
Government's tax base.
Financialpredicament
26.  In recent years, the Government has had difficulty meeting its obligations for education and health;
for those two sectors, the budgetary allocations have decreased in real terms, and have been insufficient to
meet their requirements. This situation almost "reverses" the question of fiscal impact of the social fund;
rather than draw government resources, the social fimd often complements government expenditure, and
sometimes serves as a substitute when communities assume responsibility for some basic social services.
Capacity and financial constraints of the Govermuent have led to a demise of basic social services to the
poor. Herein lies, in good part, the justification for designing Bank assistance in the form of a social
fund.
27.  Comparisons with other countries in the region and of similar size and income are revealing (Table
5). Although comparable budgetary expenditures for countries of similar size are not readily available,
some outcome comparisons can be made. They indicate that Madagascar lags behind or is barely better
off than the lower income groups, and is much worse off than the next highest income group.

V. Conclusion
28.  Madagascar is among the poorest countries in the world. Despite repeated efforts, the Government
continues to face enormous challenges in providing basic social services to the population. In this
environment, FID can be an effective instrument for delivery of social infrastructure to the poor when
they are ready to assume part of the responsibility for investments. All sub-projects support sectoral
plans, and in doing so alleviate some fiscal pressure on the central government.
29.  Given the multi-sectoral nature of the sub-projects, a range of benefits is expected, many of which
are not quantifiable. In any event, since the project is demand driven it is difficult to determinea priori
the composition of FID's portfolio which will depend on communities' priorities, and an overall NPV or
ERR has not been estimated.
30. The economic benefits include improved standard of living in beneficiary areas due to returns from
sub-project investments in social and economic infrastructure, the creation of income-earning
opportunities through employment, and increased productivity and sustainability of created communal
assets. There are also indirect increases in incomes in beneficiary areas through multiplier effects. The
expected social benefits include enhanced community organizational capacity to undertake community-
prioritized projects, as well as improved collaboration between communal leaders, associations'
representatives and local sector officials in carrying out a process of cross-sectoral planning coordinated
at the local level.
31.  Simple screening procedures will be appliedto ensure targeting of benefits to poorer and more
vulnerable groups and to establish the economic justification of sub-projects. Despite the merits of the
social fund as an instrument of choice, there remains a need for selectivity and stringent evaluation on the
part of FID for individual sub-projects so that in every case the social fund is the best instrument to meet
communities' objectives and sustainability of the sub-project can be assured.

THIRD SOCIAL FUND PROJECT
Procurement Disbursement and Financial Management Arrangements
1.    Procurement of goods and works required for the project and to be financed out of the proceeds
of the credit shall be govemed by the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credit"
published by the Bank in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and
January 1999. Procurement of consultants' services shall be governed by the "Guidelines for the Selection
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" published by the Bank in January 1997 and
revised in September 1997. The following paragraphs describe the procurement arrangements under the
project.
Capacity Assessment of FID for Procurement
2.    FID which will be the executing agency for this project has been operating since 1993 under the
Food Security and Nutrition Project (Cr. 2474-MAG) and the on-going Second Social Fund Project (Cr.
2778-MAG). It is fully experienced in procurement, in particular procedures applicable to small contracts
for communal infrastructure. During those projects, technical audits took place in 1996, 1997 and 1998
and selected sub-projects were thoroughly reviewed including the procurement procedures--no major
discrepancies were discovered in particular with the provisions of FID's Manual of Procedures. Most of
the procurement under the project relates to the sub-projects financed by FID. The Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) for the project states that all procurement for those sub-projects shall be done in
accordance with the Manual of Procedures of FID. The Manual of Procedures of FID is acceptable to
IDA, and any amendment to such manual will have to be also acceptable to IDA.
1. Procurement Methods for Goods and Works (see Table A)
3.    Civil works and goods contracts for infrastructure sub-projects involving the construction,
repair, and rehabilitation of community infrastructure including primary schools, health posts, community
water supply, feeder roads, rural markets, etc. and the purchase of school desks and similar type furniture
for other types of sub-projects costing more than US$7,500 but less than US$60,000 (US$120,000 for
rural road sub-projects) per contract up to an aggregate amount of $5.0 million would be procured
through NCB procedures described in the Manual of Procedures of FID. Civil works and goods contracts
for sub-projects costing less than US$7,500 per contract up to an aggregate amount of US$ 2.5 million
would be procured through obtaining at least three bids from small local contractors (civil works) and
through local shopping procedures (goods), as described in the Manual of Procedures. Smaller works and
goods contracts involving full community participation for an aggregate amount of US$ 5.0 million
would be carried out in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank Such procedures are described
in details in the Manual of Procedures.
4.    Procurement methods for goods for FID. Contracts for goods such as vehicles, office
equipment and furniture for FID national and regional offices costing more than $100,000 per contract
would be purchased through ICB in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Contracts for goods available
locally for an aggregate amount of US$ 100,000 which cost more than $30,000 but less than or equal to
$100,000 per contract will be procured through NCB procedures acceptable to IDA. Small quantities of
office supplies and consumable materials which are normally available off the shelf at economical prices
and cannot be grouped in packages of $30,000 would be procured through national shopping based on
price quotations obtained from three reliable suppliers provided that the aggregate amount does not
exceed $100,000.

Prior review thresholds (Table B)
5.    IDA financed contracts above the threshold of $75,000 for works and goods will be subject to
IDA's prior review. All other goods and works contracts will be subject to post review. However, a
technical audit will be performed during each year of project implementation. About 10 percent of the
on-going or completed sub-projects (selection will be on a random basis) will be subject to an in-depth
review as part of the annual technical audit. This review will look into detail into compliance with the
procurement procedures utilized to ensure conformity with FID's Manual of Procedures.
Procurement of Consultancy Services, Technical Assistance and Training
6.    Consultants' Services for infrastructure and capacity building sub-projects. These types of
services, for an aggregate amount of US $600,000 would be for: (a) design and supervision of FID's
infrastructure sub-projects (US$500,000 million); and (b) technical assistance and training support for the
execution of FID's capacity-building sub-projects (US$100,000 million). Consultant selection for sub-
projects will be addressed through competition among short listed firms in which the selection will be
based on Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS). For contracts with firms estimated to cost less than
US$50,000 per contract, the short list may consist exclusively of national consultants. For the financial
audits, which will involve firms, the least cost selection will be used. Some smaU contracts for technical
audits and overseas training, not exceeding US$ 50,000 per contract, will be procured on a single-source
basis. Consultants' services consisting of technical assistance and training support to FID which would
involve individuals, including recruitment of local FID staff will be selected on criteria based on
qualifications, experience, and competence for their assignments.
Prior Review for Consultancy Services, Technical Assistance and Training
7.    Prior IDA review for consultants' services will be required for: (a) all contracts for individuals
costing more than $30,000 per contract; (b) all contracts (for any amount) for FID's high level personnel
including the national director, the regional directors, directors and division chiefs; (c) all contracts (any
amount) for the financial and technical audits; and (d) all contracts with firms costing more than $50,000
per contract. The technical evaluation report for the recruitment of consulting firms will be subject to
prior review for contracts exceeding US$ 100,000 each. All other contracts wiU be subject to post review.
Once again, the technical audit will look at selected random contracts for the recruitmnent of consultants.
Financial Management
8.    A computerized accounting and financial management system in conformity with internationally
accepted accounting has been established. It has been assessed by a Bank/IDA Financial Management
Specialist and practical measures have been recommended (annex 7) to improve its performance and
ensure its adequacy for an orderly financial implementation of the project. Given the short duration of the
project (2 years), disbursements will be made in accordance with the SOE-based method. This decision
notwithstanding, the project will be required to submit, in addition to its basic financial statements, five
quarterly reports, namely; a Summary of Sources and Uses of Funds, a Contract Expenditure Report -
Goods & Works, a Contract Expenditure Report - Consultants, a Procurement Management Report -
Goods & Works, and a Procurement Management Report - Consultants. All procurement documents,
contracts, and invoices would be maintained separately by FID and be made accessible to supervision
missions and auditors.

Disbursement
Method of Disbursement
9.    It is envisaged that based upon the outcome of the financial management assessment,
disbursements will be transaction-based (traditional mode) as they are currently done under the on-going
project (Cr. 2778-MAG) in accordance with procedures outlined in the Bank's Disbursement Handbook.
Given the short disbursement period of this credit (2 years) it is not foreseen that LACI type
disbursements will be introduced.
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
10.   Table c indicates the disbursement schedule, the amounts (in US$) for each expenditure category
and the disbursement percentage applicable to each. The disbursement percentages have been calculated
on a tax-inclusive basis such that, when applied to invoices denominated in local currency, the percentage
not financed by the Bank is sufficient to cover Government counterpart contributions and eliminate any
Bank financing of local taxes and duties.
I1.   The credit closing date is forecast for December 31, 2001, about six months after the end of the
disbursement period. Category 5 (operating expenses for FID) includes expenditures for local contractual
support staff salaries, employment related benefitis, travel expenditures and other allowances for travel
related to the Project, rental and maintenance of equipment, vehicle maintenance and repair, vehicle
insurance, office rental and maintenance, materials and supplies, utilities and communications expenses,
banking charges, and insurance for FID goods and equipment related to the project. No high level
salaries will be financed under operating costs.
Use of statements of expenses (SOEs)
12.   A simplified format will continue to be used for SOEs in which expenditures are summarized by
category. A sample of the simplified SOE form is contained in the project implementation manual. The
documentation for withdrawals under SOEs would be retained at FID (National and Regional Offices) for
review by IDA staff during supervision missions and for annual audits. SOEs will be used for payments
of contracts of less than US$ 75,000 for goods and works and consultant contracts of less than US$
50,000 and US$ 30,000 for firms and individuals respectively. SOEs will likewise be utilized for all
training and operating costs.
Special account
13.   The special account will be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA and receive an
advance of US$3,000,000 covering IDA's share of 4 months of estimated expenditures. Upon
effectiveness, an amount of $1,500,000 will be advanced to the special account with the balance of the
initial deposit ($1,500,000 being advanced once SDR 3,000,000 has been disbursed, or earlier if IDA so
agrees.
Flow of Funds
14.   The "special account 90-day advance procedure" especially designed for decentralized agencies
will be used to facilitate the operation of FID's regional offices and to ensure prompt payment of



Annex 6
Page 4 of 7
contractors and suppliers. This procedure is described in "Bank-Financed Projects with Community
Participation: A Manual for Designing Procurement and Disbursement Mechanisms" and is currently
utilized under the on-going project. Under this procedure, FID will advance funds sums covering no
more that 90 days estimated expenditures (in local currency) to regional FID accounts based upon
submission of satisfactory, budgeted work plans. Regional FID offices will submit quarterly expenditure
reports indicating sources and uses of funds upon which basis, justifying the use of funds, and
accompanied by reconciled bank statements. FID will then aggregate this data, prepare reconciliation
statement for the main special account, prepare replenishment applications accompanied by the bank
statement for the main special account.
Audit
15.   The independent auditor of the on-going Social Fund II Project will be retained, on a modified
and improved terms of reference, as the auditor of the proposed project for the fiscal years ending
December 31, 1999 and 2000. The project accounts will be audited in accordance with intemational audit
standards acceptable to the Bank/IDA. The auditors will: (a) submit their reports and the related project
accounts to the Bank/IDA within 6 months after the end of Government fiscal year; (b) in addition to
their standard short form report with the opinion, the auditors will be required to: (i) carry out a
comprehensive review of all the SOEs as well as the intemal control procedures governing their
preparation for the relevant period under audit, and express a separate opinion thereon; and (ii) review the
management and utilization of the 90-day special account and express a separate opinion thereon as well;
and (c) finally, the auditor will carry out an in-depth review of the intemal control system of the project
with a view to identify the major weaknesses and shortcomings and proposing practical recommendations
for improvement. The results of this review would be documented in a Management Letter to be
submitted along with the audit report. Revised terms of reference will be approved for the 1999 audit.
