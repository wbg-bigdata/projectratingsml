INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for the equivalent of US$7.8 mil-
lion on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for improving and ex-
tending water supply and sewerage facilities in Kathmandu, Kathmandu Valley
and Pokhara. The proceeds of the credit would be relent to the Water Supply
and Sewerage Board (WSSB) with interest at 6 percent per annum, for a term
of 25 years, including a five-year grace period on the payment of principal
and interest.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Economic Situation and
Prospects of Nepal" (125-NEP) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on April 18, 1973 (R73-78) and its sector annexes on August 30. 1973 (R73-217).
The principal findings and conclusions of t:hat report, brought up to date,
are summarized below. The country data sheet is given in Annex I.
3.        Nepal has been classified by the United Nations as one of the
least-developed countries in the world. It:s per capita income is esti-
mated at $90 per year and the literacy rate at about 14 percent. Lack of
dependable statistical data makes difficult: a precise assessment of recent
economic performance. Available statistics should therefore be considered
as indicating no more than orders of magnitude and broad trends. There is,
however, evidence that since 1965 Nepal's real economic growth has been
almost entirely neutralized by population growth, estimated at 2.2 percent
a year. Agriculture accounts for about 70 percent of GDP and provides
employment for over 90 percent of the labor force of which the great majority
are subsistence farmers. The industrial st-ctor is very small and its contri-
bution to GDP has been marginal.
4.        Serious efforts toward development have been underway only since
the late 1950's. Development expenditures have increased rapidly -- from
NRs 232 milllon in 1964/65 to NRs 620 milllon in 1972/73. The great bulk
of the resources available for development have been invested in infra-
structure, particularly roads, power and irrigation facilities. About
half of expenditures for development during this period have been financed
with external assistance, notably from India, the United States and China.
About 80 percent has been in the form of grants. Gross external reserves
have been increasing and as of May 1973 stood at $127.5 million, of which
about $110 million were convertible. Reserves are equivalent to about 12
months' imports.



- 2 -
5.        In its efforts to formulate and implement development programs
and projects, the Government (HMG) is faced with unusually severe constraints.
The country is landlocked and the physical resource base is very narrow,
consisting mainly of agricultural land, hardwood forests and abundant
water resources available for both power generation and irrigation. No
minerals in commercial quantities have been discovered. Nepal's internal
market is small and production costs tend to be high. About 58 percent
of the population live in the Hills 1/ at or near subsistence levels.
For lack of transportation facilities, large numbers of communities are
virtually isolated from each other.
6.        One of the important constraints on Nepal's economic development
has been the limited capacity of HMG to plan, appraise and implement
development programs and projects. The problem is apparent in most sectors
and its principal elements include poor coordination of closely related
programs; lack of progress reporting and evaluation; defective project
formulation and implementation; and general difficulty in taking decisions
within HMG. Given Nepal's early stage of economic development, these prob-
lems are not unexpected. While noteworthy attempts at improvements have
been undertaken in the past few years, much remains to be done and substan-
tial technical assistance will be required to supplement the limited
Nepalese staff that possesses requisite skills.
7.        In spite of these constraints, the prospects for increasing
agricultural output are reasonably good. Within the agricultural sector,
the best possibility over the short and medium term is increasing the
production of foodgrains, particularly rice, wheat and maize. Preliminary
analysis of Nepal's future foodgrain position indicates that, unless
timely and effective measures are taken, the current export surplus
(about 300,000 tons of rice per year mainly to India) may soon turn into
a deficit. In the Hills, where no additional land is available and yields
aire low, the principal requirement is to increase productivity by means of
improved technology and to restructure agriculture away from foodgrains
toward more suitable horticulture and livestock production. The Associa-
tion is presently discussing with 1MG possible projects in the development of
the Hills. In the Terai 2/ to the south, foodgrain production can be substan-
tially increased not only by improved technology but also by expanding the
area under cultivation and making use of the potential for extending irriga-
tion and for controlled resettlement in cleared forest areas and waste land.
1/   The Hills in the central region consist of rugged mountains ranging
from 1,000-4,000 meters in elevation and cut by the valleys and gorges
of Nepal's major north-south river systems.
2/   The Terai is the narrow plain along the Indian border with elevations
up to 1,000 meters.



-3-
8.        Over-population in the Hills and consequent unorganized migration
to the Terai pose serious threats to future development. A greatly expanded
land clearance and resettlement program in the Terai would help to absorb
part of the excess population and, if carefully planned and controlled,
could substantially reduce wasteful destruction of forests and severe
erosion of arable land. Intensive farming of new irrigated land would
also provide a livelihood for migrant farmers as would a program for
systematic and efficient utilization of Nepal's forest resources.
9.        Over the past nine years (1964/65-1972/73), domestic revenue and
total expenditures grew by about 16 percent per year - or about 10 percent
in real terms - substantially faster than the growth of GDP. Development
expenditures alone nearly tripled and increased their share of GDP from 3.9
percent to about 5.7 percent. About half of the development expenditures is
financed by external assistance (grants and. loans). With a quickening of
the pace of the development effort, a major constraint on further develop-
ment is Nepal's ability to mobilize resources, both domestic and foreign.
10.       Current domestic budget revenue dloes not exceed 6 percent of GDP.
This tax effort may appear rather low, but the country's ability to pay
taxes is also very low. Since the monetized sector of the economy is
small (covering perhaps 20 percent of active population) and is generating
most of Government's revenue, the fiscal pressure is indeed quite high on
the limited number of tax payers. There iEs probably some room to increase
further the taxation of the monetized sector, which in the past benefited
from the bulk of public investment, and alEio for better tax enforcement
but, by and large, it would be reasonable t:o expect a moderate growth of
revenue in the future.
11.       In that respect, the very comfortable level of foreign exchange
holdings should be seen in its proper perspective. Despite substantial
balance of trade deficits both with India and third countries, Nepal has
been able to generate substantial overall surpluses (the equivalent of an
average of $10 million a year for the last 6 years), thanks to its export
of services (Gurkha pensions and remittances, remittances from Nepalese
working in India, tourist industry, etc.). It would be nonetheless unwise
to expect this situation to remain unchanged since development expenditures
are bound to increase much faster than domestic revenue collection and
expected foreign savings inflow. Moreover, increases 1/ in the price of
petroleum are bound to result in a slight balance of payment deficit in
1974.
1/   Except for the small industrial sector, whose energy needs are largely
based on diesel stations, they are expected to have only a limited
impact on economic activity.



- 4 -
12.       In summary, on one hand, the extreme poverty of the country points
to its limited capacity to generate resources; on the other hand, urgent
development needs and the expected gradual improvement in the country's
absorptive capacity will lead to an early utilization of foreign exchange
holdings. Consequently, Nepal's requirements for foreign assistance on
soft terms will rise rapidly in the future and there is a clear need for local
cost financing, as most projects with high development priority have larger
domestic cost component than can be mobilized from internal sources.
13.       So far, Nepal's external debt has been very low.   The bulk of
foreign aid has been in the form of grants. As of March 1973 foreign
debt, which was all contracted with countries other than India, amounted
to only $65 million of which $50 million remained undisbursed. $ 8.4 million
of foreign debt was in IDA credits, of which only $0.8 million was disbursed.
This low utilization is largely due to the fact that 2/3 of foreign loans
have been contracted after mid-1970. Consequently, debt service was about
$0.6 million in 1973 or equivalent to 2% of exports of goods and services to
countries other than India. IDA's share in the debt service was negligible.
However, future assistance may increasingly take the form of loans, albeit
soft. In view of the accelerated development efforts, external public debt
is expected to rise and, based on the trend in recent years, may well reach
$250 million by 1980, of which 1/3 could be in IDA credits. Debt service
ratio by 1980 is forecast at below 10%, of which Bank Group share would
account for less than 1%.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL
14.       The first IDA credit to Nepal in the amount of $1.7 million
equivalent was made in FY 1970 for a telecommunications project. This
was followed by credits for highways ($2.5 million), tourism ($4.2 million),
irrigation ($6 million) and a second telecommunications project ($5.5 mil-
lion). The proposed credit would bring the total amount of IDA assistance
to Nepal to $27.7 million equivalent. No Bank loan has been made to Nepal.
IFC is considering an investment in a hotel project in Kathmandu. Annex II
contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of March 31, 1974 and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects. It shows certain delays in the
implementation of these projects, particularly during the initial periods.
These delays are largely due to Nepal's limited technical and managerial
capabilities. In order to assist Nepal in coping with this constraint,
considerable technical assistance in the form of inputs of staff time in
Washington, from our Resident Mission in Kathmandu, and during frequent
missions to Nepal is required.
15.       Bank Group lending to Nepal has so far been at a modest level
compared to the country's needs for, and total receipts of, external assis-
tance. This is due to the relatively large amounts of assistance given
to Nepal by other donors and the country's limited absorptive capacity,
affecting the rate of project identification, preparation and implementa-
tion. Prospective Bank Group objectives in Nepal reflect the country's



- 5 -
needs: (a) to place major emphasis upon directly productive sectors,
particularly agriculture and forestry; (b) t:o give special attention to
integrated schemes within the agricultural Esector upon which economic
development in Nepal basically depends; and (c) to continue assistance for
the development of complementary infrastructure, including feeder roads in
support of other development expenditure ancl other forms of communications,
particularly between the Hills and the Terai. The proposed credit would
contribute to infrastructure development in the Hills by meeting social and
health needs in the project area.
16.       A settlement project was appraised in October/November 1973.    Prep-
aration work is being carried out for a number of projects, including a second
highway project, a rural development project and a second irrigation project.
In view of the institutional constraints and shortage of trained personnel
in Nepal, the identification, preparation and implementation of these projects
are likely to require more time and effort on the part of the Bank Group
as well as greater inputs of technical assistance, than usual. For this
reason, technical assistance in feasibility studies, project preparation
and training, will be an important element in the proposed project as well
as in most future projects.
PART III - WATER SUPPLY AND SERERAGE IN NEPAL
17.       The water supply and sewerage sector in Nepal is in a very early
stage of development. Near the end of the last century the first water
supply systems were constructed in the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara. Only
about 5 percent of the population have piped water supplies and the majority
of these live in the larger urban areas. Village water supplies are
generally restricted to the provision of public standpipes together with
a small number of private connections to hospitals and public buildings.
Several towns and villages are supplied either with untreated water from
perennial streams with varying levels of pollution or by groundwater supplies.
Most of the water supply systems have proved inadequate in terms of source,
reservoir capacity or standby pumping capacity. Water supply hours are
consequently restricted.   For example, Kathmandu, the capital city, is
supplied with water for only six hours in each day.
18.       Apart from a small section of Kathmandu, there are no sewage dis-
posal facilities. In the old city of Kathmandu, several properties are
connected to a covered surface water sewerage system constructed at the
beginning of the century. Outside this area, raw sewage and odorous septic
tank effluent flow into and clog open roadside drains.
19.       Not until about 1950 was an effort made to organize the sector,
when the Department of Irrigation and Water Supply under the Ministry of
Water and Power was made responsible for construction of water supply
schemes. Following a recommendation in a study by WHO as executing agency
for UNDP, HMG separated water supply functions from the Department of
Irrigation and Water Supply in late 1972 and created a new Department of



- 6 -
Water Supply and Sewerage (Water Department). In 1973, WSSB was estab-
lished to take over responsibility for the sector. Its seven-member Board
represents the relevant ministries and the Planning Commission. The Chair-
man is the Secretary of the Ministry of Water and Power. The Chief Execu-
tive of WSSB is the Project-in-Charge, to whom the Board of Directors
delegates most of its powers. The staff and premises of the Water Depart-
ment now serving Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara areas, are the base upon
which WSSB is being built. The ultimate goal is to create a corporation
to replace WSSB and to be fully responsible for water supply and sewerage in
Nepal.
20.       Lack of qualified Nepalese staff has hampered the sector's devel-
opment. Since 1954 an Indian Cooperative Mission has provided technical
manpower in a program for the construction of nine urban and 14 rural
water schemes. Under a technical assistance program by UNICEF, about
87 rural water supply schemes serving some 7300 houses have been under-
taken. In addition to these, there is a modest program (run by a WHO expert
with some U.S. Peace Corps and German volunteers) under which aid is given
to small rural communities in the form of materials and technical assistance,
to improve their water supply facilities. As regards waste disposal, pilot
projects have been initiated to provide earth latrines in model rural com-
munities. A considerable decrease in the incidence of hookworm has been
reported following the initiation of one such scheme. There are no
proposals at present for providing water-borne sewerage outside Kathmandu
Valley or for improving rural sanitation.
21.       Leakage and wastage are estimated at about 50 percent of supply.
An inadequate rate structure for water service has contributed to wasteful
use of water. As WSSB extends its area of activities and improves service,
water charges in all areas will have to be increased, if services are to
be provided on a self-supporting basis.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       The proposed project is the first stage, 1974-78, of a 25-year
master plan for water supply and sewerage, prepared under the WHO/UNDP
study (paragraph 19 above) by Binnie & Partners, London, engineering
and management consultants, with assistance of the Government of Nepal.
The project is based on these studies and on the findings of an appraisal
mission which visited Nepal during May/June 1973. The report of the
appraisal mission entitled "Nepal Water Supply and Sewerage Project"
(No. 270a-NEP) dated April 10, 1974 is being circulated separately. A credit
and project summary is attached as Annex III.
23.       Negotiations were held in Washington in January 1974.   The
Government of Nepal was represented by Messrs. A.B. Rajbhandary, Secretary,
Ministry of Water and Power and Chairman of WSSB, B.P. Rimal, First Secretary,
Royal Nepalese Embassy, Washington, D.C., H.S. Shrestha, Under Secretary,
Ministry of Finance, B.S. Malla, Under Secretary, Ministry of Law and Justice.



-7.-
Description of the Project
24.       The proposed project would improve! and extend water supply and
sewerage facilities in Kathmandu and Lalitpur, a suburb of Kathmandu, and
water supply facilities in Kathmandu Valley and in Pokhara, a major center
with tourism potential. It would also develop WSSB as a viable entity
capable of taking responsibility for water supply and sewerage development
throughout Nepal; and would finance a tariff study and studies for the
preparation of a second stage development arLd assist in training of staff.
25.       The water supply facilities for KELthmandu include the development
of a new water supply spring source, five new wells, a pumping station, a
reservoir, and about 55 km of transmission End distribution pipelines. In
Pokhara, a new water supply spring source, End one well would be developed
and about 18 km of transmission and distribution pipelines would be
connected. Improvements and repairs would be made to existing installations
and the equipment needed for leak detection and waste prevention would be
provided. As a result of these measures, wEastage and leakage are expected
to be reduced from the current 50 percent of supply to 35 percent. These
facilities would be adequate to meet daily r equirements of water supply in
the project areas up to about 1981.  The sewerage component, which would
serve Kathmandu and the suburb of Lalitpur, includes about 40 km of sewers,
a sewerage pumping station for Kathmandu ancl a waste stabilization lagoon
for each. WSSB staff would be trained in administration, accounting,
engineering, operations and maintenance. Adequate facilities, equipment and
vehicles are included in the project for this purpose. Special equipment
required for collecting hydrological data would also be provided.
Project Cost and Financing
26.       The total project cost is estimated at US$10.4 million equivalent;
US$4.9 million equivalent is for water supply, US$4.7 million equivalent
for sewerage, and US$0.8 million equivalent for tariff and second stage
feasibility and project preparation studies.. The foreign exchange com-
ponent is estimated at US$6.5 million equivalent net of duties and taxes.
The proposed credit of US$7.8 million equivalent would cover the entire
foreign exchange cost of the project - including retroactive financing of
up to $260,000 for consultants' work and equipment for the preparation of
the project, incurred after December 1, 1972 - and would include a substan-
tial contribution to the local costs. The remaining US$2.6 million
equivalent, or 25 percent of total project c:ost, would be financed by HMG.
HMG's average annual contribution to the project cost from FY 1974 through
FY 1981 is expected to be more than three times its average annual capital
expenditures on the development of the sector in recent years. It would
not appear realistic to require a larger contribution, or to require even
higher water and sewerage charges during the construction period than
proposed (paragraph 30 below). The proceeds of the credit would be relent
to WSSB at 6 percent per annum for a term of 25 years including a five-year
grace period on the payment of principal an<l interest.
Project Organization
27.       The project would be executed by WSSB, which is still in its
formative stages. Simultaneously with technical assistance financed



- 8 -
under the proposed credit for project preparation and training in a local
engineering institute, the Overseas Development Administration of the
United Kingdom (ODA) is providing a team of about five experts for tech-
nical assistance in the establishment of procedures and systems in
accounting, administration, and engineering and in training Nepalese
counterparts. It is expected that over the next three or four years
enough progress in the building up of WSSB will have been achieved to
permit converting it into a corporation with greater powers and independ-
ence of management and budget.
Procurement and Disbursement
28.       Contracts would be awarded on the basis of international compe-
titive bidding in accordance with IDA guidelines, except for minor civil
works, equipment and electrical connections from the grid, the total of which
would not exceed US$250,000 equivalent. Disbursement would be made against
100 percent of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and of local expen-
ditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured equipment, against 100 percent
of total expenditure for consultants services, and against 60 percent of
civil works contracts. Production of sewer pipes is a simple process and
it is expected that some local enterprise may participate in bids for their
supply. Local suppliers of equipment would be granted a preference of
15 percent or the rate of applicable customs duty, whichever is lower.
Financial Aspects
29.       Examination of the finances of WSSB and preparation of the normal
public utility financial projections have been seriously constrained by the
almost complete lack of data. Past financial information presented in the
appraisal report is based on the best efforts of the consultants.
30.       Present water charges cover operating costs, but only part of
depreciation, and there is no sewerage charge. HMG agreed to introduce a
tariff based upon an increase of 60 percent in the basic water charge,
starting in FY1975, and a new charge for the sewerage service at the rate of
50 percent of the water charges starting three years later, in FY1978.
The objectives of this tariff are to allow WSSB to earn sufficient revenues
to produce a positive rate of return on net fixed assets while giving the
lower income groups benefits from the new and improved services. WSSB's
cash flow during the construction period would be adequate. The return on
average net fixed assets in service is estimated to reach at least 1 percent
during FYs1976-78, and is expected to increase to about 5 percent by FY1981 and
to 8 percent by FY1987. In view of the stage of development of the sector, the
recent establishment of WSSB, and the social and health character of the
service, these rates are considered acceptable. As the proposed tariff is
based on the very limited information available to the consultants who had
to make many assumptions, there is need for constant review and revision of
financial policies based upon the experience gained. A study covering all
aspects of demand for services and the level of tariffs is therefore included
in the project, to be made by consultants in FY1977, when adequate data on
demand should be available.



-9-
Justification
31.       The basic justifications for the proposed project are the
social and health benefits of: (a) providing an adequate supply of
safe water to 327,000 people representing 9S percent of the population of
the project area in Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara; (b) improving the sanitary
condition in Kathmandu and Lalitpur; and (c) reducing the pollution of the
Bagmati River in the densely populated Kathmandu Valley. Another important
benefit is the strengthening of WSSB as an :Lnstitution capable of improving
and extending water supply and sewerage services also outside the project
area with the ultimate goal of serving the whole country. The financial
rate of return is about 7.6 percent ^" the basis of the incremental revenues
attributable to the project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
32.       The draft Development Credit Agreiement between the Kingdom of
Nepal and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text
of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
33.       The special features described in paragraphs 26 (including re-
troactive financing and the five year grace period on the payment of interest
by WSSB), 28, and 30 (including the proposed tariff increases and the rate
of return to be met by WSSB) of this Report are reflected in Sections 3.02,
3.11 and 4.06 of the draft Development Credit Agreement as well as in Part
A (2) (b) of Schedule 3 thereto.
34.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
35.       In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to take
full account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices.
However, available information indicates that the proposed credit remains
fully justified.
36.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

a/ Since substantial parts of Nepal's foreign trade are unrecorded, there is no overall balance of payment
available. This table is a balance of payments with countries other than India and represents about 10%
of Nepal's foreign trade.
Note:- Petroleum imports, which amounted to about $7 million in 1972, we!re so far purchased from India and
paid in Indian rupees.

Credit No. 166      Telecommunicattions Project
US$1.7 million Credit of November 10, 1969;
Closing Date:  July 31, 1974
After initial delays in making the credit effective, delay in
signing an agreement with India for some oif the complementary aid provisions
and delays in taking procurement action, this project is now proceeding
satisfactorily and completion is expected by December 1974, some 18 months
behind schedule.

2/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the projects in execution and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken. They should
be read in this sense and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Credit No. 223      Highway Project
US$2.5 million Credit of December 21, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
Difficulties in acquiring land and procuring certain materials
have delayed construction of the five project bridges by over 12 months.
Procedures involved in opening letters of credit with some suppliers and
procurement problems with a foreign contractor delayed the delivery of
certain workshop and highway equipment by about eight months. Further delay
is anticipated and the bridges are not expected to be completed before the
end of 1974. The bid price for road bridges is about 10 percent above the
cost estimate; however, it is still within the contingency allowed. The
estimated cost of other project elements is the same as appraised. The
project is expected to be completed by the end of 1975, a year behind
schedule.
Credit No. 291      Tourism Project
US$4.2 million Credit of March 22, 1972;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975
The Credit became effective on November 9, 1972. Due to
delays in appointing qualified architectural, engineering and project
management consultants, and the sponsors proposing changes in the scope
of the subprojects, the project is more than a year behind schedule.
Consultants have been appointed and begun design work on the Yak and
Yeti subproject; construction should begin towards the end of this year. The
basic scope of the Annapurna subproject has been agreed by the parties con-
cerned. Appointment of consultants and arrangements for the future management
of the hotel are being finalized.
Credit No. 373       Bir_anj Irrigation Project
US$6.0 million Credit of April 18, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
A Project Board has been established and a General Manager
nominated. A detailed engineering and construction program up to
September 1974 has been drawn up and the necessary staffing schedule
agreed. Progress is satisfactory.
Credit No. 397      Telecommunications Project II
US$5.5 million Credit of June 20, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The Credit became effective on September 11, 1973. No problems
are expected at this stage.
