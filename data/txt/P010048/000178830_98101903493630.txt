LIFT IRRIGATION PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The Government of Ceylon has requested an IDA credit of US$ 2.0
million to assist in financing the development of a low lift pump irrigation
project to serve some 6,500 ac in four different areas in the dry zone of
Ceylon. Of the total project area, about 6,100 ac would be on existing farms
and the balance of 400 ac on jungle lands which would be cleared.
ii.       Water would be supplied to individual holdings in irrigation blocks
ranging in size from 50 to 250 ac by pumping from existing gravity irrigation
canals serving paddy fields to elevations varying between 15 and 50 ft above
the canals. Land leveling would be carried out on all project lands. Crops
to be produced on the project would be primarily chillies and onions which are
currently being imported into Ceylon.
iii.      The estimated cost of the project is Rs 19.6 million, US$ 3.3 million
equivalent, of which US$ 1.3 million would be in foreign exchange. The proposed
IDA credit of US$ 2.0 million, about 60 percent of the total estimated cost,
wculd be used to finance imports of equipment and supplies and a portion of
the local expenditures to be incurred in constructing the project.
iv.       The Irrigation Department of the Ministry of Land, Irrigation and
Power would be responsible for the design, construction and operation and
maintenance of the irrigation facilities. Land leveling would be the re-
sponsibility of the Lands Department of the same Ministry. All works would
be performed by force account with the necessary imported equipment and
materials being procured under international competitive bidding. Participating
farmers would pay a water charge sufficient to cover all annual operations and
maintenance cost and replacement of pumps.
v.        At maximum development, the incremental net value of production
would be about Rs 9.4 million. The rate of return to the economy would
exceed 25 percent.
vi.       The project is technically sound and economically advantageous to
Ceylon and is suitable for an IDA credit of US$ 2.0 million. The borrower
would be the Government of Ceylon.

LIFT IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Ceylon has requested an IDA Credit of US$ 2.0
million to assist in financing the development of low lift pump irrigation
from existing canals to serve 6,500 ac in four different areas in the dry
zone of Ceylon.   Of the areas selected, 6,100 ac are on the highland house
lots of existing colonist schemes and 00 ac are now in jungle which would be
cleared and developed for settlement by youths.   The colonists are farmers
who have been settled on crown lands in the dry zone under a Government plan
aimed at development of irrigated agriculture.   Agricultural production on
the house lots is restricted by lack of irrigation.   The settlement of
youths is a new Governmental program introduced in 1965 under which the
Government hopes to settle educated unemployed youths in the 17-21 age group
on two-acre irrigated plots.   Crops to be raised on the project would be
primarily chillies and onions, which are currently imported in large
quantities into Ceylon.   The proposed lift irrigation project would be a
part of the Government's plan to expand the production of chillies and onions
and other subsidiary food crops under irrigation.
1.02      An FAO mission visited Ceylon in June and July 1966 to review the
irrigation program of that country and, while there, made suggestions to the
Government on projects they considered worthwhile.   This report is based on
materials and reportsprepared jointly by the Ministry of Land, Irrigation
and Power, and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture of the Government of
Ceylon and on findings of an appraisal mission which visited Ceylon in
September 1967.   Members of the mission were Messrs. J.C. Douglass, H.T.
Chang, L.T. Sonley and H. Boumendil (FAO).   Mr. A. Golan contributed
materially to the preparation of this report.
II. BACKGROUND
2.01      Agricultural production in Ceylon represents about 34 percent of
the gross domestic product and employs over half of the labor force.   Tea,
rubber and coconut make up more than 90 percent of the nation's exports.
Although export volume of these commodities has been increasing in recent
years, the decline of prices has reduced foreign exchange earnings.
2.02      To help improve the foreign exchange position, the Government has
adopted a two-pronged policy in the field of agriculture.   First, diversi-
fication of the export sector, coupled with increased efficiency.   Second,
the attainment of self-sufficiency in food, particularly rice, subsidiary
food crops, dairy and meat products and fish, at the earliest possible date.
The proposed lift irrigation project would be part of an on-going Government
program aimed at increasing the production of subsidiary food crops under
which some 40,000 ac devoted to chillies and onions are expected to be pro-
vided with irrigation during the next five years.
2.03      Chillies and onions, the main crops to be produced on the proposed
project, are staple commodities in the Ceylonese diet.   Despite an active



- 2 -
demand and rising prices in recent years, domestic production has been limited
because chillies and onions can only be grown economically under irrigation
in the highland areas of the dry zone.   The lack of irrigation facilities
has been a serious constraint on the expansion of production.
2.04      Under these circumstances, Ceylon has relied upon imports to supple.
ment domestic production.   Thus, between 1955 and 1966, annual imports of
dried chillies have increased from about Rs 27 million to Rs 48 million.
Imports of onions include two varieties, red and Bombay, with the bulk of
imports being of the Bombay variety.   Total imports of onions into Ceylon
rose from Rs 9 million in 1955 to Rs 20 million in 1966.   Further details
are given in Annex 1.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
General
3.01      The proposed project lands would consist of four non-contiguous
areas in the dry zone of Ceylon, where colonist paddy irrigation schemes have
been in operation for several years (see Map).   Three criteria were used in
selecting the areas: availability of water; proximity to existing irrigation
canals; and suitability of the soils for the production of subsidiary food
crops.  All these areas are above the existing gravity irrigation canals.
Each of the four schemes are made up of a number of separate blocks varying in
size from 100 to 500 ac of land, of which from 50 to 250 ac would be irrig-
ated by pumping out of the canals.   The unit area to be irrigated under the
project within each block is one acre in the case of colonists and two acres
in the youth settlement scheme. Net acreage to be developed at each scheme
would be as follows:
Scheme           Net Irrigated Area (ac)
Vavunikulam                    500
Mahakandarawa                1.,000
Rajangana                    3,500
Polonnaruwa                  1,500
Total                  6,500
3.02      About 6,100 ac of the proposed project lands would be on four
colonists' schemes and 400 ac on Polonnaruwa would be for youth settlement.
Under the colonist schemes, each family is allotted about five acres by the
Government.   Three acres are devoted to paddy  cultivation under gravity
irrigation and two acres are on lands above the irrigation canals where the
colonists have their homes and produce subsidiary crops under dry farming
conditions.   Although the colonists on these schemeshave long association
with paddy irrigation, they have noprevious experience in producing subsidiary
food crops under irrigation.   In most instances, the colonists receive only
a limited return from their paddy fields and are unable to fully develop their
dry land house lots due to lack of irrigation.   The proposed project would
enable the colonist to supplement his income from paddy cultivation by growing
chillies and onions on the one acre of his dry land lot to be provided with
irrigation.
3.03      The youth settlement scheme would be part of a Government program
started in 1965 under which the Government hopes to provide employment
opportunity in agriculture to unemployed educated single youths in the 17-21
age group.   These schemes, which are largely untried and mainly experimental,



- 3 -
contain a large risk element. However, if proven successful, they would
contribute to solving Ceylon's unemployment problems. The Association has
agreed to 400 ac of jungle land adjacent to the Polonnaruwa colonist scheme
being included as a first stage in the project. If this settlement turns
out to be a success, other youth settlement areas would be considered for
inclusion in possible subsequent stages.
Climate
3.04      Ceylon is subject to the monsoon shift in wind direction with the
prevailing winds coming from the southwvest during the dry (yala) season from
May to September, and from the northeast during the wet (maha) season from
October to April. The wet zone of Ceylon is the southwestern part of the
island where precipitation occurs during the southwest monsoon as well as
during the northeast. The dry zone, where the lift irrigation project lies,
is on the north and east portion of the island and is in the rain shadow of
the mountains during the southwest monsoon and consequently receives about
70 percent of its precipitation during the northeast monsoon.  Annual rain-
fall varies from 55 in to 74 in on the four different project areas. Because
of rainfall distribution, irrigation would be most intensively used in the
dry season, May to September. However, irrigation would be used during the
wet season to supplement rainfall and ensure proper soil moisture conditions
for crop cultivation.
3.05      The climate in the project areas is tropical with average monthly
temperatures ranging from a minimum of 731F to a maximum of 880F. Average
daily sunshine varies from about 6 hours October through December to 9 hours
in April and May. Average number of days per month with precipitation
varies from 3 in June, July and August to 17 in November.
Soils and Topography
3.06      Soil survey and land classification show that the soils of the four
areas selected have good surface and subsurface drainage characteristics and
are suitable for irrigated cultivation of chillies, onions and a wide range
of field crops. The soils mostly have medium to good depth and moderate
water holding capacity. Further description of soils is given in Annex 2.
3.07      Although the four areas are widely scattered throughout the dry
zone, their topography is very similar. All areas consist of gently undu-
lating uplands ranging from 100 to 400 ft above sea level, with cross slopes
of up to five percent. Local farmers adapt to the slopes by using traditional
methods of small basin irrigation for even spreading of water and erosion
control. With land leveling, furrow or corrugated irrigation could be practiced.
Farm Size and Land Tenure
3.08      Each of the colonists occupies approximately five acres consisting of
three acres of paddy land with gravity irrigation in the valley bottom and a
two-acre dry-land house lot on the adjacent valley slope. One acre of the
house lot would be included in the project for lift irrigation to grow chillies
and onions. After clearing the jungle in the youth settlement area, each
youth would be assigned two acres of irrigated land in addition to one acre of
unirrigated land in a common area devoted to housing.
3.09      All the project areas are on Crown Lands presently owned by the Gov-
ernment and under the terms of alienation there is no possibility of



- h -
fragmentation of holdings. The colonists pay a nominal land rent and enjoy a
secure tenure arrangement. Steps are under way to effect transfer of land
title from the Government to the individual allottees. Similar arrangements
would prevail on the youth settlement.
Agricultural Production
3.10      On the homestead sites of the colonist schemes, some coconut, mango,
lime, jak, or banana trees are grown. In the 6,100 ac earmarked for the
project on these sites, the colonists presently produce, during the northeast
monsoon, wet season, some rainfed crops for domestic consumption such as
hill paddy, maize, cowpea, cassava and vegetables. The actual area under
cultivation in any given year varies according to weather expectations, but due
to absence of irrigation, yields are generally extremely low and for all prac-
tical purposes, total production is negligible. The 400 ac selected for the
youth scheme is presently jungle or reverting to natural cover after having
been used for chena (shifting) cultivation.
Marketing and Transportation
3.11      Key agricultural products in Ceylon, including chillies and onions,
are marketed under a guaranteed price scheme (GPS). Under this system, the
Government announces periodically the prices at which it stands ready to buy
various crops. Farmers are not compelled, however, to sell their produce
through the GPS and can sell on the free market where prices are often higher
than the guaranteed price. Thus, Government purchases of chillies in recent
years represent only a small fraction of local production and in the case of
onions roughly one-third of production has been moving through the GPS (see
para 5.04). The Government maintains purchasing stations at points convenient
to the project areas.
3.12      The project areas are served by a well-developed network of all-
weather roads and are also close to railway lines. Adequate trucking services
are available throughout the project areas and could easily handle the
expected increase in production.
IV. TIHE PROJECT
4.01      The project proposed for IDA financing would be part of a Government
program aimed at increasing domestic production of chillies and onions. It
would include: procurement of pumps and other equipment; installation of pumps;
construction of an irrigation system to serve about 6,500 ac; construction of
200 cottages and 400 ac of jungle clearing in the youth settlement area; land
leveling over the entire area; enployment of an agronorist to advise on the
irrigated culture of chillies and onions; and operation and maintenance for
the initial four years while the project is being established.  Develop-
ment of the project, including settlement on the youth scheme, would be com-
pleted within four years (see Annex 3).
Proposed Works
4.02      Irrigation and Drainage.  On each of the four areas, several inde-
pendent irrigation blocks would be developed ranging in size from 50 to 250
ac. Water would be pumped from existing gravity irrigation canals serving



-5 -
paddy fields to elevations varying between 15 to 50 ft above the canals. A
small pumping station equipped with one or more single stage centrifugal pumps
driven by a diesel engine would be constructed at each block. Pumps would
vary in size from four to eight inches and the size and number of pumps to be
installed at each block would depend upon the area to be served.  The dis-
charge lines would be of rigid polyvinyl chloride (P.V.C.) emptying into a
concrete-lined forebay on the high point of the block. From this point,
lined canals would deliver the water to each land holding with a turnout to
be provided at the high point of each holding. Lining would generally be
of concrete cast in place, although bricks, either of cement mortar or burned
clay, would be used in areas where they are found to be more economical.
Surface drainage would be provided by excavating small open channels to remove
excess water. Subsurface drainage is not considered necessary. A detailed
description of the works is presented in Annex 4.
4.03      Land Development.  Land leveling and grading would be carried out
over the entire project area. In addition, mechanized jungle clearing would
be carried out on the 400 ac youth settlement scheme along with the construc-
tion of 200 cottages for the youths.
Water Supply
h.04      Irrigation water would come from existing storage dams.  The water
is of good to excellent quality in each of the project areas for use on the
crops proposed. Water requirements, supply and quality are further discussed
in Annex 5. In an average year, the existing storage facilities could meet
the irrigation requirements of the proposed lift areas during the wet season
(October - April) without impinging upon paddy irrigation.  There would be,
however, ccmpetition over water uses during the dry season (May - September)
when water supply is normally limited to that carried over in storage in the
reservoirs from the wet season. Except for the Polonnaruwa Scheme where the
storage capacity is sufficient to allow year round paddy cultivation on the
entire area, water supply on the three other schemes generally dictates a
reduction in paddy acreage from about 25,000 ac in the wet season to 11,000 ac
during the dry season. The introduction of the lift irrigation project would
necessitate a further reduction in dry season paddy acreage.  Water oonsump-
tive use calculations indicate a necessity to reduce the paddy area of 11,000
ac by about 800 ac in order to ensure adequate water supply for the 6,500 ac of
the lift irrigation project.  Such a reduction would represent only a small
fraction of the total paddy area on the schemes and would be highly profitable
since returns from an acre of chillies and onions would be at least four times
greater than those from paddy.
4.05      At the beginning of the dry season, the Irrigation Department makes
an assessment of the water available in the reservoirs and informs the Govern-
ment Agent on the extent of paddy lands which could be provided with irrigation
on each scheme. The Government Agent in turn informs a Cultivation Committee
composed of colonists and the Committee decides what proportion of each holding
would be irrigated. Water for the lift irrigation project would be pumped out
of the canals serving the paddy fields and in order to ensure that adequate
water would be available for the project, assurances were nbtained from
the GT.-rnr.cnt that it would guarantee the priority of water for lift
irrigation.
Status of Engineering
4.06      Planning and preparation of the feasibility study for the project
was performed by the Technical Service unit of the Department of Irrigation,



- 6 -
with assistance from the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. Detailed designs
for the irrigation and drainage works have been prepared by the Irrigation
Department for about 6,000 ac in various colonist and youth schemes throughout
the dry zone. Much of this work was done in the project areas and the work
is considered adequate as a basis for cost estimate projections. Detailed
designs for the balance of the project areas would be prepared by the Irriga-
tion Department, which is competent to carry out the work.
Cost Estimates
4.07      Project cost estimates are based on detailed designs prepared for
6,000 ac of lift irrigation schemes in the dry zone. Unit prices are based
on costs experienced to date on similar work in Ceylon and the actual develop-
ment of about 1,000 ac of lift irrigation. Contingencies of 20 percent have
been added for unforeseen expenditures and possible price increases. The
cost estimates also include adequate provisions for engineering and overhead
and are considered reasonable. The cost estimates are summarized below:
Local           Foreign             Total

Financing
4.08      The amount of the proposed credit would be US$ 2.0 million (Es 11.9
million), which is approximately 60 percent of the total cost. The propcsed
credit would cover the estimated US$ 1.3 million foreign exchange cost of im-
ported equipment, spare parts, materials and employment of an agricultural
specialist. In addition, the credit would assist in financing part of the
local expenditures to be incurred in constructing .nd opcrtting the project
during the initial four years. Th& balance of cost, totaling Rs 7.7 million,
would be met by budget allocations.  The approximate expenditure schedule,
including disbursement of the proposed IDA credit, would be as follows:
Year             1st     2nd     3rd      hth     Total

- 7 -
4.09      Disbursements under the credit would be against the CIF cost of
imported equipment, spare parts and materials and foreign exchange cost
of an agricultural specialist. Disbursements would also be made on a per-
centage basis against the local cost of installation of pumps, construction
and maintenance of distribution system and land developrnt.  The cost of
these items is the equivalent of ""51.5 million and approximately L5 percent
of this amount would be disbursed under the credit. In the event of increase
in project costs, the percentage would be decreased to spread disbursement
over the period of construction of the project. Any savings remaining in the
credit account due to a decrease in project cost would be cancelled.
Procurement
4.10      The scope of the project works is too small to attract foreign
contractors and wcald be carried out as force account work by the Irrigation
and Lands Departments of the Ministry of Land, Irrigation and Power. All
imported equipment and materials for the project, however, would be procured
on the basis of international competitive bidding.
V. AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
5.01      The proposed lift irrigation project would provide an assured
irrigation supply for the cultivation of chillies and onions on 6,500 ac.
Each colonist would produce one acre of chillies during January-July and
follow it with the production of red onions on one-third of an acre from July
to September. The area to be planted to onions has been restricted to that
which could be cultivated with family labor without resorting to hiring out-
side labor. However, farmers wishing to expand their onion production could
do so by employing seasonal labor. A similar pattern (two acres of chillies
and two-thirds of an acre of onions) would be followed by the youths on their
two-acre plots except that they would have to depend more heavily on hired
labor which is expected to be readily available in the Polonnaruwqa area.
5.02      During the early years, irrigation would be by small basins,
generally three by six feet for chillies and three by three feet for onions,
but as farmers gain experience and the extension service agents have received
proper training in irrigation techniques, furrow irrigation would be intro-
duced. The use of furrow irrigation would reduce labor requirements and bring
about a more efficient operation. Necessary agricultural inputs would be
purchased by participating farmers through the existing farmrls cooperatives
in the area which are well-equipped to provide such services. Produce would
be sold through Government purchasing stations under the guaranteed price
scheme (GPS) or through commercial outlets.
5.03      According to production projections of the Ministry of Agriculture
and Food, about 38,000 ac would be planted to chillies in 1968. out of this
total, about 33,000 ac would be under rainfed cultivation and 5,000 ac, mostly
in Jaffna District, under irrigation. Anticipated production, however, would
be largely marketed as green chillies. This production would only supply
about ten percent of local demand for dried chillies thus necessitating large
imports to supplement domestic production. The level of reeent imports would
be equivalent to dried chillies production from some 40,000 ac of irrigated
land. Imports of red onions, on the other hand, account for a much smaller
fraction of domestic consumption (approximately 20 percent) and are usually
necessary only during November-January when climatic conditions



- 8 -
restrict local production.   However, Ceylon does import large quantities
of Bombay onions.   Since red onions can be substituted for Bombay onions,
any further increase in their production would enable a reduction in the
imports of Bombay onions.
5.04      The precarious foreign exchange position of Ceylon in the mid-
1960's prompted Government to introduce measures to encourage domestic pro-
duction and to reduce the imports of chillies and onions. To that end, GPS
prices for dried chillies were increased in late 1964 from Rs 168 per cwt for
Grade I and Rs 140 per cwt for Grade II, to Rs 252 and REs 196 respectively.
These new prices have been in effect ever since.   In the case of onions, the
GPS price was changed from a fixed price of Rs 27 per cwt to a moving
monthly average fluctuating between Rs 22 and Rs 35 to coincide with supply
fluctuations on the market and to encourage off-season production.   Imports
at the same time were brought under close scrutiny and restricted.   Follow-
ing the introduction of these measures, prices on the free market have been
rising steadily and are currently around Rs 312 per cwt for chillies and an
average price of Rs 28 per cwt for red onions.
5.05      Although farmers have responded to the new prices by expanding
production, imports are still large.   Further expansion of production is
restricted by the absence of the necessary irrigation facilities on lands
suitable for the production of chillies and onions.
5.06      At maximum production, estimated production of dried chillies on
the project would amount to 65,000 cwt, or roughly 19 percent of the aver-
age 1963-66 imports, while the projected red onions production would be
220,000 cwt, or roughly twice the average imports during the period.   How-
ever, in terms of Bombay onions, for which the red onions can be substituted,
the projected production would only amount to 19 percent of ixports.   Thus,
production of chillies and onions on the project would replace only a small
portion of present imports and farmers should find a ready market for their
produce in Ceylon.   Demand for these products is expected to increase with
population growth.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Construction
6.01      Responsibility for planning, design and construction of the irrig-
ation and drainage works would rest with the Irrigation Department, an agency
within the Ministry of Land, Irrigation and Power. The Irrigation Department,
which is staffed with experienced personnel, and has had previous experience
with similar works, would be competent to implement the project. Preparation
of designs and overall supervision of the works would be done from the
Department's headquarters in Colombo. Field supervision would be assigned to
the Division Engineer within whose jurisdiction the specific project area
lies and he in turn would assign a Resident Engineer to execute the work in
the field.
Operation and Maintenance
6.02      The colonist schemes are organized into cooperatives and the youth
settlement scheme would also be organized along similar lines.   It is the



- 9 -
Government's intention to eventually turn over responsibility for the oper-
ation and maintenance to these cooperatives. Until such time as this can be
done, responsibility for operation and maintenance activities would rest with
the Department of Irrigation, using its existing facilities established for
the paddy schemes. Assurances were obtained from the Government that the
Irrigation Department would operate and maintain the irrigation facilities
until such time as they could safely be turned over to the cooperatives
or other satisfactory organizations.
Land Development
6.03      Land leveling and smoothing would be done by the Lands Department
of the Ministry of Land, Irrigation and Power, with equipment to be purchased
under the Credit. The Department would also carry out the mechanized jungle
clearing on the youth settlement scheme. Land development works to be imple-
mented under the project are small in scApe and relatively simple, and wnuld
be within the c"mpetence of the Department.
Credit and Extension Services
6.a4      Annual production credit requirements for the cultivation of chillies
and onions are estimated at Rs 400 and Rs 800 per acre, respectively. Upon
completion of project works in the fourth year, annual credit requirements
would be around Rs 4.5 million. These loans would be granted to farmers in
the project areas by the farmer's cooperatives, who in turn would receive their
funds from the People's Bank. Loan terms would vary between nine and twelve
percent per annum, with the lower rate applying te leans paid back before the
date on which they are due. The cooperatives are well organized and would be
able to handle all credit requirements under the project. Aasurances were
obtained from the Government that the necessary production credit would be
made available to farmers participating in the project.
6.05      Extensi#n services in the project areas would be provided by the
Ministry of Agriculture through village agents supervising about 200 ac each;
an Agricultural Instructor for every five village agents; and mne District
Agricultural Officer in each of the project areas. Although the Department
has adequate personnel to provide assistance to farmers in the project areas,
most of them lack experience with irrigated chillies and onions. To
strengthen the system, all village agents assigned to the project would
receive an in-service training course at the Department's extension services
institute at Perandeniya. Assurances were obtained from the Government
that, within twelve menths after effective date of the credit, they will
employ an agronomist with qualifications acceptable to the Association,
to assist in the training of extension workers assigned to the project
fer at least a two-year peried. The foreign exchange costs to be incurred
in employing this specialist would be reimbursed out of the proposed credit.
Auditing of Accounts
6.06      Ministerial departments participating in the project would maintain
separate accounts for the project. Annual audits would be made by the Govern-
ment's Auditor General and submitted to the Association.  Auditing procedures
are satisfactory.

VII. FINANCIAL RESULTS
Operation and Maintenance Costs
7.01      Estimates of operation and maintenance costs are based on actual
expenditures incurred on the recently installed 1,000 ac of lift irrigation
and include charges for personnel, fuel and lubricants, repairs, materials,
a sinking fund for replacing the pumps and engines in the 15th year and
contingencies. Annual operation and maintenance costs are estimated at
Rs 135 (US$ 23) per acre. Further details are presented in Annex 6. For
the 6,500 ac included in the project, the annual cost would be about
Rs 0.9 million or US$ 150,000. Operation and maintenance cost estimates
during the initial four years are as follows:
Year           1st      2nd     3rd      hth     Total
(in thousands of Rs)
Cost            -       162      380    610      1,152
From the fifth year on, the full annual cost of Rs 0.9 million is anticipated.
Water Charges
7.02      Rates charged for water on existing irrigation schemes in Ceylon may
include amortization of capital cost, as well as operation and maintenance
costs. Only operation and maintenance charges are usually collected in exist-
ing projects. The Irrigation Department certifies the average operation and
maintenance costs for each individual scheme and the District Government Agent
is responsible for collection of water charges. For the lift irrigation pro-
ject, operation and maintenance expenses, including a charge to replace the
pumps and engines as needed, should be paid by the irrigators on the project.
This charge, estimated at Rs 135 per ac, is substantially higher than the
Rs 10 per ac now normally charged on the gravity schemes. In view of the high
benefits to be realized by participating farmers, the assessment of Rs 135 per
ac appears reasonable. This charge may be somewhat high on the youth settle-
ment scheme since the project would be the sole source of income for the
youths and might, therefore, have to be reduced somewhat in the early years
of the project. The existing legislation on water charges is complicated and
requires agreement of a majority of the cultivators to the charges to be
imiposed. The Government has recently issued temporary regulations which
enable it to levy water charges without the prior consent of the cultivators.
These regulations, however, must be renewed monthly and are only an interim
arrangement until passage of legislation presently before Parliament which
would give the Government complete power to assess and collect charges. The
Government has agreed that by June 30, 1969, it will have either secured the
agreement of a majority of the cultivators benefiting from the project to
the proposed charges or will have acquired permanent powers to levy water
charges without such agreement. It further agreed that water rates to be
paid by farmers benefiting from the lift irrigation project would be gradually
increased so that by the fifth year after completion of construction of each
block, all operation, maintenance and pump and engine replacement costs
(presently estimated at Rs 135 per ac) would be assessed to individual farmers
and that these charges would be collected.



- II -
Benefits to Farmers
7.03      Expected benefits to participating farmers would be substantial.
Even when chillies and onion prices are projected on the basis of the 1963-66
average import price valued at the current exchange rate, net returns (gross
value of production less costs of production) from the cultivation of one
acre of chillies and one-third of an acre of onions by the colonists are
expected to be about Rs 600 during the first year and Rs 1,200 by the fifth
year. These prices are well below the prevailing average GPS prices of Rs
225 per cwt for Grade I and II dried chillies and the moving monthly average
price of Rs 22-35 for red onions and the even higher free market prices (para
5.0b). When GPS prices are used, and these prices are likely to prevail in
Ceylon at least until domestic production matches demand, the net return
increase to Rs 1,100 and Rs 2,100 in first and fifth year respectively. These
returns are after payment for all production costs and operation and main-
tenance charges including a charge for pump and engine replacement, and are
based on the use of family labor only. Amortization of other project costs is
not deducted. Net income from the cultivation of one crop of paddy by com-
parison is estimated to be Rs 300 per acre. Thus, a typical colonist culti-
vating three acres of paddy during the wet season and 1.5 ac during the dry
sea%,M would have a net annual income of about Rs 1,350. Additional income
from the production of chillies and onions would represent a substantial
increase in colonist's net earnings and should provide adequate incentive to
them to participate in the project. Further details of projected farm income
are presented in Annex 7.
7.04      Unlike the colonists who would rely exclusively on family labor,
participants in the youth nettlement scheme would have to resort to hiring
outside labor. This in turn would bring about a substantial increase in
production costs and a corresponding reduction in net earnings. However, at
the prevailing GPS prices, even with the higher production costs, annual net
income in the fifth year from a two-acre plot on the youth settlement scheme
would be about Rs 3,000. This level of income should provide sufficient
incentive to attract and maintain the youths on the project.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The prime benefits to be derived from the project would be diversi-
fication of agricultural activities on the colonist schemes and a substantial
increase in farm income.  In addition, the project would contribute to Ceylon's
balance of payments position by reducing import needs. At maximum production
the project would enable the country to save about Rs 1T million (US$2.3 million
annually in imports -based on 1963/66 average import prices valued at the
current exchange rate). The project would also provide the experience on
which to plan the development of subsequent stages.
8.02      At full agricultural development the annual gross value of pro-
duction from project lands is expected to increase from the present negligi:bl
level to around Rs 14a million per annum. These figures are based on chillie
and onion prices corresponding to the average 1963-66 import prices valued at
the current exchange rate. After deducting production costs (family labor
used on the farm was valued at zero cost), the foregoing of paddy production
on some 800 ac and annual operation and maintenance charges, the annual direct
benefits to the economy at full development would be about Rs 9.5 million.
Assuming a useful life of 30 years for all irrigation facilities except for
purps and engines wqhich would require replacement after 15 years, the rate of
ret.arn to the economy would exceed 25 percent (Annex 8).

IX. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      The lift irrigation project would be part of the Government pleai
to expand the production of subsidiary food crops under irrigation in the
dry zone of Ceylon. Experience to be gained on it would be used to plan
subsequent development of lift irrigation. Upon completion, the project
would provide a dependable water supply to about 6,100 ac on colonists'
home sites which are presently being dry-farmed and bOO ac of youth
settlement. Crops to be produced on the project would be dried chi]lies
and red onions, two commodities which are currently being imported in
large quantities.
9.02      The project is technically sound and economically advantageous
to Ceylon. It is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$ 2.0 million. The
borrower would be the Government of Ceylon.

LIFT IRPIGATION PROJECT
Soils
The lands of the four selected schemes, though scattered in the dry
zone, are similar in general topographic characteristics. They are gently
undulating uplands lying between 100 and OO ft above sea level wTith cross
sLopes of up to five percent. The predominant soil type is reddish brown
earth which is suitable for the cultivation of a wide range of crops, includi na
chillies and onions, if irrigation is provided.
Areas to be developed under the project would be delineated within
lands of existing colonization schemes by conducting a seei-detailed soil
,urvey (one soil sanple for each 10 to 15 ac). Only suitable soils would be
salected. As of September, 1967, a total of 3,400 ac had been surveyed in
detail and about 80 percent of these lands were found suitable for the lift
irrigation project.  Other lands would be substituted for those found unsuit-
able. The survey will be continued at a pace keeping ahead of the contemplatec
construction schedule.
The reddish brown earth soils in the project area are deep to moder-
ately deep residual soils developed from parent rocks of various types of
quiartzite, gneisses and granites. A typical profile shows sandy loam top soil
in the first foot or so, sandy clay loam fo- the second foot and clay loan in
t1ie third and fourth feet.  Unweathered particles of quartz and fedlspar are
often found at a depth of between 20 to 30 in.         Because of the topography
and profile characteristics, the soils generally have good surface and sub-
surface drainage.
The reddish brown earth of Ceylon generally has a cation exchange
capacity of between 15 to 20 m.e. per 100 gm of soils, a base saturation of
around 70 percent, an initial organic matter content of from two percent to
five percent, a slightly acidic reaction, Ph being around six, and a field
rapacity of about 1.5 to 2 in  water per foot of soil.
The loss of initial soil organic matter will be rapid under the
'ocal climatic conditions. Annual replenishment by application of cattle
o;: green manure is recommended.  Soils Ph should be checked regularl17
5trials should be made to test practicability of substituting urea or other
I.eutral nitrogen fertilizers for ammonium sulfate as now prescribed by the
Extension Service.

LIFT IRRIGATION PROJECT
Description of Project
Irrigation Works
Areas for the lift irrigation project would be selected from suit-
able highlands above the paddy irrigation canals where the colonistsr honie;c
are located. The housing areas are scattered throughout the paddy schemes
and range in size from 100 to 500 ac.  Colonists' plots consist of twvo-ac're
units with a house situated at one end and the area to be irrigated at the
other.  Irrigation would thus be provided to contiguous two-acre plots (only
one acre of each to be irrigated) arranged into irrigation blocks varying in
size from 50 to 250 ac.
Irrigation would be provided by a pump which would be installed
adjacent to the main supply canals serving the paddy schemes. Water would
be pumped from the supply canal to a forebay located on the high point of the
block. A lined distribution system would deliver water from the forebay to
each individual colonist.
Pumps would be of three different sizes rated according to the
diameter of the discharge line.  The pumps would be of the single stage
centrifugal type driven by a diesel engine. The pump and engine are mounted
on a skid as a unit so they can be removed or exchanged conveniently. Ten
percent of the required pumps would be purchased for standby use in case of
breakdowns or need for heavy maintenance.
The characteristics of the pumps are as follows:
Size (Discharge     Maximum (Di-charge   MaximuLm Head   Efficiency   H.P. of
Line)             at Rated Head)         (feet)          (%)        Engine
Inches             Imp g p.m.
h                      500                106          50-60         12
6                    1,250                115          50-70         38
8                    1,650                115          50-70         48
The difference in level between water in the supply canal and in
the forebay would vary from block to block and would be between 15 and 60 ft.
The dy%namic or pumping head would vary from 60 to 110 ft depending on the
length of the discharge line. Pumping is planned for 16 hours a day during
peak water use periods. The size of pump and the number to be installed
at each block depends on the area to be irrigated in each block. Sufficient
pump capacity would be installed so that 1 c.f.s. can be delivered to each
53 ac of irrigable land. The pumps would be installed in a pump house having
a concrete floor and corrugated iron sides and roof.
Pump discharge lines would be of rigid polyvinyl chloride plastic
(PVC).  Diameters of 4, 6 and 8 in are used to match the pumps.  The PVC pipes
were formerly imported but can now be fabricated locally using imported
materials. Gate valves to control discharge and a water meter to measure
discharge would be installed on each discharge line.



The pump discharge lines deliver water from the pump to a concretue
Lined forebay which serves as a small regulating reservoir. The forebay is
on the highest point of each block and water is distributed by gravity fron
the forebay to the irrigable lands. Slide gates are used at the forebay to
control discharge to the various canals leading to the lands. The canals
would be lined with concrete cast in place or where bricks or concrete blocks
are readily available, they may be used and grouted into place. A turnout
would be provided to each irrigator.
The drainage system would consist of open shallow surface drailns
designed to remove excess rain and irrigation water.
Land Development
The colonist housing areas are now cleared. The 100 ac of youth
scheme would be cleared of jungle growth.
Land leveling and shaping would be done on all lands to adapt it  ;
surface irrigation.
Housing
Housing would be provided for the 200 youths who would occupy the
!0o ac on the youth scheme. These houses would be similar to those already
provided the colonists and represent a minimum type accommodation,
Agricultural Specialist
An agronomist knowledgeable in the irrigated culture of chillies
and onions would be employed for at least two years to assist in training
extension workers assigned to the project.

Water Requirements
Water requirements have been estimated by use of the Blaney-
Criddle consumptive use formula and checked by use of Thornthwaite's
formula.   The irrigation requirement,s as proposed by the Government and
as recommended by the Associaticn aro given beloTw,heirrigation require-
nents allow for 70 percent field irrigation efficiency for paddy and sub-
sidiary food crops and 4O percent transportation losses from the reservoiv
to the point of delivery to the farm.

The four schemes in the project would be supplied water from exi.:t-
ing storage reservoirs constructed for paddy irrigation schemes.   RaLifall
records are available at selected stations covering a period of about 75
years.   Records of flow are available for between I2 and 21 years at a few
stations on the island.
Detailed reservoir operation studieswere not made for each scheme,
but a reasonable margin of safety was used in the determination of the water
available at each scheme as compared to the areas to be cropped in order to
take account of variations in the yearly discharges.   Because of water

supply, initially proposed acreage in the Vavunikulam Scheme has been re-
duced from 1,500 ac to 500 ac, the balance being added to the Rajangana
Scheme.
The water requirements for chillies and onions totals 4.2 ac ft
per cropped acre.   Since only one-third of the land area will be cropped to
onions, the water requirements for the land area of the project would be:
Chillies (entire area)           2.4 a.f/ac
Onions (one-third of area)       0.6 a.f/ac
Total                  3.0 a.f/ac
of this  3.0 ac ft land area, 1.4 would occur in the wet season and 1.6 in
the dry season.
On all of the schemes there is adequate water in the wet season to
supply all requirements of the paddy and the additional requirements of 9,100
ac ft for the subsidiary food crops.   Normally, the area planted to paddy in
the dry season is reduced to match the water available in storage at the
start of the season.   The water required for the subsidiary food crops during
the dry season is 10,h00 ac ft.   The following table shows the reduction in
paddy area on three of the schemes in the dry season as a result of using
water for chillies and onions.

On Vavunikklam and Nahakandarawa, all of the water used for chill_es
and onions if not so used could be used for dry season paddy.   On Rajangana.
because of the large yield of the basin and the greater assurance that the
reservoir will be full at the start of the dry season, the extent of the
paddy production foregone is reduced.   On the Polonnaruwa Scheme, the water
supply with storage exceeds the requirements for paddy and a full acreage of
paddy is planted during the dry season.   There is sufficient water for
1,500 ac of subsidiary food crops on this scheme without interference to
paddy.

Water Quality
The water quality is very good for irrigation.   The total
dissolved solids content varies from 125 ppm to 305 ppm, making the water
generally class one on the U.S. Department of Agriculture classification.
The percentage of sodium is low (S.A.R. lower than 1.2), thus making the
water class Sl: low sodium class.

LIFT IRR.IGATION PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
For the purpose of economic analysis, the following assumptions
were made:
(a)  Benefits on the project would be derived from the production
of one acre of chillies and a third of an acre of red onions.
Yield projections for these crops in cwt per acre are as follows:
Y E A R
1        2         3        4         5
Dried Chillies        5        6         7        8         9
Red Onions           70       75        80       85        90
A further ten percent increase in yields is projected to take plac6
between the fifth and tenth year.  Full agricultural development was pro-
,ected to be attained in the 12th year.
(b) Production costs include all input requirements and marketing
expenses to distribution outlets but exclude water charges and
land rent. The area to be planted to red onions has been res-
tricted to one-third of the project area so as to correspond
with that which could be cultivated with family labor without
resorting to hiring outside labor. All family labor used on
the farm was valued at zero cost.
(c) Chillie and onion prices were based on the 1963-66 average
import price valued at the current exchange rate of Rs 5.95 to
the dollar. Losses from the 800 ac reduction in paddy culti-
vation were estimated to be Rs 0.3 million per annum.
(d)  The life of the project was assumed to be 30 years with replacemeny
of all pumps taking place in the 15th year.
The incremental net benefits and project costs streams based on the
above assumpt,ions are illustrated below.
