PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report for the Lisbon Region Water
Supply Project for which a Loan of US$40.0 million was made to the Republic of
Portugal. The loan las signed in June 1978, became effective in January 1979
and was closed in December 1986. US$14,120 was cancelled in February 1987.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Europe, Middle East
and North Africa Regional Office on the basis of a mission which visited
Portugal in February 1987, and of a review of the President's Report, the Loan
and Project Agreements, supervision and progress reports, and related
correspondence and internal memos.
In accordance witlh the revised procedures for ptoject performance audit
reporting, this Project Completion Report we3 read by the Operations Evaluatioa
Department (OED), but the project was not audited bv OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report to
the Borrower and Executing A4encv for comments. These colments have been
reproduced as an Attachwent to the report,

PORTUGAL
LISBON REGION WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
LOAN 1541-POR
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
Loan 1541-POR was approved in March 1978 for an amount of
US$40.0 million, mainly to help the Lisbon Region Water Supply Authority
(EPAL) meet increasing water supply demand in the Lisbon Region. The project
also included a study of regionalisation of water supply and sewerage services
in the Lisbon region and water supply and sewerage feasibility studies for the
Porto and Algarve areas.
Th- Loan became effective four months later than originially
envisaged, mainly because of delays in the execution of the subsidiary Loan
Agreement between the Government and EPAL (para 3.01).
The project main component, an aqueduct of 375,000 m3/day
capacity, 78 km long, with pumping and treatment facilities, was implemented
by EPAL, assisted by a local consulting firn. It is expected to be
commissioned in June 1987, 4.5 years later than envisaged at appraisal because
of poor performance of consultants and EPAL's management inability to make
decisions in the period 1979-80 and poor progression of the treatment plant
civil works in 1986 because of financial difficulties of a local contractor
(para. 3.06).
EPAL was expected to supply bulk water to 9 municipalities south
of the Tagus and regional trunk mains with distribution networks were included
in the project to this effect. Actually, because of municipal and
parliamentary opposition, this part of the project was not implemented and the
study of regionalisation of water supply and sewerage services in the Greater
Lisbon was abandoned in 1979 (para 3.02).
Total project cost expressed in US$ was 16% lower than estimated
in spite of the 4.5 year delay because of the decrease in scope of the
distribution component of the project (para. 3.09). The consultants,
suppliers and civil works contractors performed well except the local
consultants in charge of the pumping and treatment plants and the local
contractor for the civil works of the treatment plant (paras. 3.10 and 3.11).
EPAL's operating and financial performance showed general
improvement in the period 1976-1986 (para. 5.02). However, EPAL failed to
meet its debt service and contribution to investments covenants (para. 5.05)
and, in all but the lest three years, obtained clearly insufficient returns on
its average net fixed assets in operation (para. 5.04).



-v -
The major objective of the project, to meet increasing water
demand of tthe population ill the Lishon Region, has been met with the
commissioninig of the first stage of the Castelo do Bod.- aquedtict.  FPAT. will
be able to increase water sales by a maximum of 91 million m3 per year,
enabling thie demand for direct supply to the Lisbon population and for bulk
supply to 14 municipalities to be met  rtiti 1 2003.
The projcct w'as the lteaSt-cost solution. Using existing water
revenues, the internal rate of return of the projert. is 3.8%, as compared to
2% at appraisal and a target of iO% (paras 6.04 and b.05).  This confirms that
EPAL's tariffs are still too low.
The cancellation of contruction of the distribution facilities
south of the Tagus and of the regionalisation study shows the need to obtain
the conmitment of all the municipalities and other levels of C'vernment which
may be involved in a sector reorganization as early as possible during project
preparation (para. 3.03).



PORTUGAL
LISBON REGION WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
LOAN 1541-POR
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01     in Portugal, water supply, sewerage and solid waste management is the
responsibility of the municipalities, with the exception of Lisbon whose water
is supplied by a State Enterprise (Empresa Publica das Aguas Livres - EPAL)
which also provides potable water in bulk to fourteen surrounding
municipalities!'. Other sanitation services in Lisbon are provided by the
municipality. Municipalities in some cases have created autonomous
organizations to operate water supply and sanitation services. The water
supply and sanitation sector is supervised by the Central Government's State
Secretariat for Environment and Natural Resources (SEARN) under the Ministry
of Planning and Regional Management. The technical arm of the State
Secretariat is composed of the Directorate for Environment and the Directorate
for Natural Resources.
i.02     Technical assistance to municipalities for project design and project
implementation is offered by technical assistance offices (GATS) and Regional
Coordination Commissions (CCR) under the Ministry of Planning and Regional
Management.
1.03     The Lisbon Region Water Supply Project (Loan 1541-POR,
US$40.0 million, approved on March 28, 1978) for which this completion report
has been prepared is the only Bank operation in the sector.  The project was
mainly aimed at enlarging the water supply system for the Lisbon region,
shortages of potable water having proved to be the main cause for the high
incidence of water-borne diseases and the rapid spread of a cholera epidemic
in suburban areas of Lisbon in 1974-75.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin Preparation and Appraisal
2.01     In the mid-seventies, the quality of the water in the Tagus River,
used by EPAL as the main source of water supply to meet the needs of
1.6 million people in the Lisbon region, was deteriorating rapidly because of
agricultural, industrial and urban developments in the river basin.  Concerned
with this deterioration and the possibility of an accidental spillage of toxic
wastes into the river, EPAL, with the help of consultants, studied the
development of reliable new sources to expand its water production capacity
which at that time amotunted to 440,000 m3/day and also provide minimum water
supply in case of a shutdown of the Tagus intake.  The Castelo Do Bode
Reservoir, already constructed with a water supply intake, was chosen and the
main components of a new production and trat.smission sub-system of
500,000 m'/day capacity, to be implemented in two phases, were determined.

2.02     There was also poor coordination between municipalities, especially
in the Lisbon and Porto regions, for the development of water supply and
sanitation services. However, it was generally accepted among public
officials that regional water authorities must be established to take over the
distribution systems of the municipalities in the areas of Greater Lisbon and
Greater Porto with responsibilities subsequently extended to sewerage. In
Lisbon, the reponsibility to review the feasibility of regionalization was
given to EPAL.
2.03     The project was appraised on the basis of feasibility studies in May
1977. The main issues raised by the appraisal mission covered the need to (i)
increase tariffs progressively, with the first step in January 1978; (ii)
request the Government to provide 35% of the cost of EPAL's 1978-1982
investment program in the form of a grant of Esc.2,000 million
(US$51.0 million); (iii) ensure that arrears of payments due to EPAL by
municipalities, which totaled about Esc.135 million (US$3.5 million) at
appraisal, be substantially reduced; and (iv) have EPAL appoint acceptable
auditors. During negotiations of the Loan in January 1978, it was understood
that the Loan would be presented to the Board only after (i) decision by the
Government on the tariff increase; (ii) reduction of municipal arrears which
by the time of negotiations had increased to Esc.247 million; and (iii) Bank's
concurrence with the selection of EPAL's auditors. Measures acceptable to the
Bank having been taken on these three points, the Loan was approved on March
28, 1978.
Objectives
2.04     The objectives of the project were to:
(i)    meet the water supply needs of the population in the Lisbon
region until 1990; and
(ii)    assist the Government in implementing the reorganization of the
sector through studies aimed at strengthening the national
capability for planning and design in the sector.
Project Deseription
2.05     The main elements of the Project were:
(a)    the Castelo do Bode aqueduct with an initial capacity of
385,000 m3/day, including a 89 km long pipeline, one treatment
plant and two pumping stations;
(b)    expansion and upgrading of the distribution system through the
constructioni of trunk-mains (combined length of 73 km), three
pumping stations, seven distribution reservoirs of 130,000 m3
total capacity and secondary networks totaling 100 km;
(c)    a study for regionalization of water supply and sewerage
services in the Lisbon Region and feasibility studies for water
supply and sewerage in the Porto and Algarve regions;



-3-
(d)    training of the senior staff of EPAL and the General Directorate
for Basic Sanitation through short visits to water supply and
sewerage organizations abroad.
Revisions to the original project scope are discussed in para 3.02.
Loan Covenants
2.06     The loan documents included the following special covenants:
Measures to be Taken by Government
(a)    Contribute at least US$60 million equivalent to EPAL's capital.
This covenant was met.
(b)    Ensure that amounts owed by municipalities to EPAL for water
bills are paid within three months or within other period as
mutually agreed. Substantial efforts were made although
uncollected accounts remain at the equivalent of nine nonths of
sales.
(c)    Construct by July 1, 1979, facilities to treat the sewage from
the town of Santarem or to discharge it downstream from EPAL's
water intake in the Tagus River. This requirement was waived by
the Bank in 1983 as a result of a water quality study presented
to the Bank by the DGSB, which showed that the Santarem sewage
would have no significant effect on the quality of water at
EPAL's intake.
Measures to be Taken by EPAL
(d)    Establish and develop a planning department in charge of all
water supply planning in its service area; and propose
improvements in its organization. This was done.
(e)    Strengthen its system of internal financial control.  This was
accomplished.
(f)    Cover operating costs (excluding depreciation) and debt service
and, no later than 1983, make a reasonable contribution towards
its capital investments.  This requirement was virtually never
met (para. 5.05);
(g)    Take actions, by December 31, 1980, so that (i) charges to
consumers other than the poor be not less than the incremental
cost of service, and (ii) earnings be sufficient to provide a
reasonable rate of return on net revalued fixed assets; this was
achieved (para. 5.04); and
(h)    Not to incur debt unless net revenues shall be at least 1.5
times the maximum future debt service.  This covenant was never
met (para. 5.03).

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, COST AND OPERATION
Effectivene,s
3.01     Conditions of effectiveness required: (a) the execution of a
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and EPAL; (b) an increase in
EPAL's tariffs by April 1, 1978, to produce a minimum of 30% increase of gross
revenues; (c) a financial agreement between EPAL and a lender providing EPAL
with a loan of at least $80,000,000 equivalent for its investment program; and
(d) the hiring of a financial director and a commercial director. There were
delays in fulfilling items (a) and (d) (appointment of the Commercial
Director). The Loan became effective on January 19, 1979, about four months
later than originally envisaged.
Revisions to Project Scope
3.02     The most important revisions to the project scope (Annex 1) concern
(i) the study for the regionalization of sanitary services in the Lisbon
Region and (ii) the water distribution system.
3.03     EPAL was to carry out the regionalization study with the assistance
of consultants. Local consultants had been hired in July 1977 before the Loan
Agreement was signed. The Bank had serious reservations as to these
consultant's capability to carry out such a study. In 1979, EPAL hired a
foreign consultant to review the completed study. His report raised serious
questions as to the quality and potential value of the study. Meanwhile, the
Parliament rejected a draft law proposed by the Government for the creation of
regional water supply and sanitation entities because it would be an
infringement on the constitutional rights of the municipalities. As a result,
the study was dropped.
3.04     EPAL had been expected to supply bulk water to nine municipalities
South of the Tagus River. Actually, these municipalities decided, in a first
stage, not to buy water from EPAL and instead proceeded to study the
possibility of developing their own water system based on the use of their
groundwater. This study is practically completed and EPAL is awaiting for
their decision. The distribution facilities constructed n.nder the project
were thus limited ,o those required by the municipalities North of the Tagus.
The regional trunk mains actually built totalled 31 km (appraisal 73 km),
reservoir capacities 55,000 m3 (appraisal 100,000 ml) and pipes and
secondary networks 6.3 km (appraisal 100 km). However, only minor revisions
were made to the production and transmission facilities. The change of
location of the raw water pumping station reduced the length of the tunnel
between reservoir and pumping station but increased the length of the force
main connecting the pumping station to the treatment plant.
3.05     In 1984, studies of system optimization and control of water losses
were added to the project scope. The studies were awarded in 1986 to foreign
consultants in close collaboration with EPAL and are presently under
implementation.



-~ ~~~~~~5
Implementation
3.06     The project implementation lasted from mid-1978 to mid-1987, i.e.
4.5 years longer than expected (Annex 2). The contract for construction of
the 68 km transmission pipeline, the most important contract of the project,
was awarded in early 1979. Local consultants for the pumping station and
treatment plant were appointed in 1979 but important delays were experienced
in the implementation of these facilities because of the bad performance of
the consultants and the inatility of EPAL's managemaent to make decisions. In
1980, the Ministry of Public Works replaced EPAL's top management. The new
Chairman, former Minister of Public Works, establ4shed a Coordination
Committee for the project and progress in project implementation resumed.
Bidding for the treatment plant and the tunnel between the Castelo do Bode
intake and the pumping station took place in 1981. While the EPAL team in
charge of the construction of the transmission line was able to make
reasonable progress, the team in charge of the constructior of the production
facilities did not. The period of time between invitation or bids and award
of contract was more than one and a half year for the supply of pumping and
treatment equipment. Finally, the local contractor in charge of the civil
works for the treatment plant experienced seveie financial difficulties in
1986 and work practically stopped during that year. An agreement reached
between EPAL, the contractor and the contractor's Banks permitted resumption
of construction and testing of the treatment plant is expected to be completed
by .June 1987.
3.07     The feasibility studies for sewerage in the Algarve region and water
supply and sewerage in the Porto region were satisfactorily carried out
between 1980 and 1982 by local consultants in association with foreign
consultants under the supervision of the DGSB.
Procurement and Disbursements
3.08     Contracts for civil works, pipes and equipment estimated to cost more
than $500,000 equivalent were procured through international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for procurement and the
provisions set forth in the schedule of the Project Agreement. The main civil
works contracts were awarded to joint ventures of local and foreign firms.
During project implementation, the disbursement percentage for the most
important loan category (civil works and equipment required for the production
and transmission facilities) was gradually increased from 30% to 50% in order
to reflect the actual foreign exchange component of the contract, which was
higher than expected at appraisal. One factor affecting the foreign exchange
component was the substantial general price increase which followed the
increase in oil and gas prices after the loan was signed. The disbursement
percentage for consulting services for the Porto and Algarve feasibility
studies was also increased from 50% to 100% of foreign expenditures and 50% of
local expenditures in order for the DGSB to have all the foreign expenditures
of the studies financed under the loan. Reflecting implementation delays,
disbursements started two years later and were completed four years later than
anticipated. Appraisal and actual loan disbursements by fiscal year and by
category appear in Annlex 3.



-6-
Costs
3.J9     Total project costs (Annex 4, page 2) ar3unt to US$128.9 million, as
compared with US$153.2 million at appraisal, i.e. a decrease of 16%. The
change of location of the raw water pumping station allowed substantial
savings in the cost of the tunnel (para. 3.04). However, the cost of the
pumping station was higher than expected because of the change of its location
and the fact that it was designed for a capacity of 500,000 m3 /day
(originally 385,000 m3/day), with the water level of reservoir at normal
conditions. Conversely, the distribution installations cost 28% less than
expected because of their reduced scope (para. 3.04). The effect of the
4.5-year completion overrun (para. 3.06) on total project costs was mitigated
by awarding several one-year contracts for the 68 km transmission line, and
the relatively efficient execution of these contracts. Expressed in Escudos,
the project cost (Annex 4, page 1) totals 14.0 billion, i.e. 139% higher than
originally estimated. This variation must be treated with caution, however,
because of the high local inflation and substantial devaluation of the Escudo
which occurred during project implementation.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, and Suppliers
3.10     The local consultants chosen without Bank's concurrence to carry out
the study for the regionalization of water supply and sanitary services in
Lisbon did not perform well. The Bank refused to finance the cost of that
study although it offered to finance a new study with acceptable consultants
but these were never hired (para. 3.03). The consultants in charge of the
feasibility studies in the Algarve and Porto region performed well. Those
employed for the design of the Castelo do Bode aqueduct performed adequately
for the transmission line but not for the treatment plant and the pumping
station (para. 3.06).
3.11     The performance of contractors and suppliers was good, except for the
1u-l civil works contractor for the treatment plant who lagged in his works
because of financial difficulties (delayed payments made under other contracts
by employers in the public sector) during the construction period (para. 3.06).
Reportfig
3.12     Progress reports prepared by EPAL were incomplete until 1981 when the
head of the newly established Project Coordination Committee (para. 3.06) was
able to produce the first comprehensive progress reports. The quality of the
reports deteriorated again in 1983 but improved when the Board of Executive
Directors was changed in May 1984.

IV. OPERATING AND INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Operational Aspects for the Project
4.01     The Castelo do Bode aqueduct will be fully operative in June 1987.
The different components of the distribution facilit es were commissioned over
the 1982-1986 period upon completion, and are working well.
Operational Aspects for the Executing Agency (EPAL)
4.02     Because of the 4.5 year delay in the project implementation, EPAL's
volume of water supplied in bulk to municipalities or directly to consumers in
Lisbon levelled out during the 1981-85 period (Annex 5). In 1985, the total
volume of water sold reached 139 Mm3, about 25% less than expected at
appraisal. While the volume of water consumed in Lisbon was 11% less than
expected, the volume of water supplied to other municipalities was 32% less
than projected. The latter shortfall stems from the decision of the
municipalities South of the Tagus River not to use EPAL's water for the time
being. Although water sold in Lisbon in 1985 was 11% less than envisaged, the
number of connections was 7% more than expected because standpipes are
gradually being replaced by private connections. Unaccounted-for water
decreased steadily from 35% in 1976 to 19% in 1985, a level which is still too
high considering that 55% of the water sold is supplied in bulk.  The
computerized hydraulic analysis study being implemented will help to locate
wastes.  Also, the commissionning of the Castelo do Bode aqueduct will enable
EPAL to rehabilitate its existing aqueducts and reduce losses (para. 6.03).
Organization and Staffing
4.03     From 1974 to 1982, EPAL's operations were overseen by a three-member
commission (Commissao de Fiscalizacao das Aguas de Lisboa - CFAL). In 1978,
EPAL established and staffed a suitable planning department charged, to the
extent EPAL is permitted by law, with all water supply planning in its service
area.  In July 1981, statutes were approved which provide for a management by
a Board of Executive Directors (defined in the statutes as a Management
Council), consisting of a President and five Directors.  The first management
council was officially installed in January 1982, thus replacing the
commission.  Formal management meetings are held once a week, with informal
meetings as required.  The managing board achieved more progress in EPAL's
investment program but half of the directors (including the President)
resigned in May 1984. Since then, there has been more stability in EPAL's
organization and management is now efficient. In recenc years, the number of
staff has been relatively stable. Staff training needs are being met. During
the 1981-85 period, between 14% to 18% of the staff were trained each year
both within and outside EPAL.  Short visits of EPAL's and DGSB's staff to
water supply and sewerage organizations in Europe were financed under the
Loan. EPAL's accounting department currently does a creditable job. In recent
years, unaudited financial statements have been completed within a couple of
months after year end and financial information has been routinely prepared
for management each month. Audited statement have also been completed on a
timely basis.



-8-
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01     Annex 6 shows EPAL's appraisal forecast and actual financial
statements for the period 1976-1986. A comparison of forecast and actual
figures is difficult and the result not very meaningful because (i) the
project implementation period took 4 1/2 years longer than originally planned
(para. 3.06); (ii) the project scope was changed (para. 3.04); (iii) inflation
was considerably higher than foreseen (para. 3.09); (iv) the Escudo was
substantially devalued while the appraisal assumed a fixed rate of exchange;
and (v) a significant segment of EPAL's prospective customers did not
materialize (para. 4.02).
5.02     An analysis of EPAL's results, however, shows generally favorable
trends in its operating and financial performance in the period 1976-1986.
For example, unaccounted-for water went from 30% to 19% of water produced,
inventories of materials from the equivalent of 2.6% to 0.3% of net fixed
assets in operations and receivables from the equivalent of 4.2 to 2.8 months
of sales. In the same period, the total debt to equity ratio dropped from
76:24 to 57:43, the result mainly of fixed assets revaluation and equity
contributions. However, in the last year, current liabilities increased from
the equivalent of 12% to 20% of total assets, an unusually high level for a
water supply public utility.
5.03     In the period 1976-1986, the overall volume of water sold was about
3
9.2% smaller than foreseen at appraisal.  The 1986 average revenues per m
were considerably higher than foreseen because of higher than foreseen
3
inflation.  More importantly, between 1976 and 1986, average revenues per m
grew at an average of about 34% per year while inflation averaged slightly
below 20% per year-    Not surprisingly, in the last few years, EPAL had an
operating ratio in the low 60s. However, in all years after 1976, its debt
service requirements exceeded, sometimes considerably, its internally
generated funds. In some years, this shortfall was covered by borrowings and
in most years by Government equity contributions.
5.04     From 1981 onwards, EPAL was supposed to take any necessary measure to
generate funds sufficient to generate a reasonable return on revalued fixed
assets in operation. EPAL revalued its gross fixed assets by 56.8%, 61.4%,
37.7% and 36.1% at the end of 1981, 1982, 1984 and 1986 respectively. Thus
its fixed assets may be reasonably assumed to be currently valued. In those
years, EPAL obtained returns on revalued average net fixed assets in operation
of 3.7%, 2.0%, 19.4% and 18.2% respectively. Therefore, with the very high
inflation which prevailed in those years, only the last two yielded returns in
line and possibly above the opportunity cost of capital.
5.05     From 1983 onwards, EPAL was also expected to generate funds
sulfficient to finance a reasonable portion of its investments. Except for
1985, which yielded an insignificant surplus, this expectation was not
fulfiIlled because of EPAL's high debt service requirements (para. 5.03).

VI. PROJECTA.IISTIFICATION
Project Aehievements
6.01     The full benefits of the project will oTIly start to be realized in
June 1987 when the Castelo do Bode aqueduct is commissioned. The different
components of the project distribution facilities already put into service
over the 1982-86 period have until now had a marginal effect on service.  They
have only contributed to the increase of total people served by about 50,000
from 1981 to 1986.  With the commissioning of the first stage of the Castelo
do Bode aqueduct in mid-1987, it is expected that EPAL's volume of water sold
will increase by 3% in 1987 and by 4% per year afterwards. With the
comnmissioning of the first stage of the aqueduct, EPAL will be able to
increase water production by 375,006 P.3/day, and, taking into account
seasonal variations of demand and unaccounted-for water, to increase water
sales by 91 mi llion m3 per year. This increased2 capacity will allow EPAL to
meet the water demand of the population of Lisbon and 14 surrounding
municipalities until 2003.
6.02     The reorganization of the water supply and sewerage sector was not
fully carried out because the Government did not enact the necessary enabling
legislation (para. 3.02). However, the capability for planning and design in
the sector was strengthened by the establishment within EPAL of a planning
department in charge of all water supply plan.aing in EPAL's service area
(para 4.03). The Porto and Algarve water supply and sewerage studies were
also exeruted by local consulting firms assted by foreign consultants.
Least-Cost Solutio.i
6.03     The construction of the Castelo do Bode aqueduct was the least-cost
solution to expand the Lisbon region water supply system. Its commissioning
will also enable EPAL to rehabilitate its existing aqueducts, especially the
old Alviela aqueduct, which could not be repaired because of EPAL's lack of
reserve production capacity.
Econonie Anasis
6.04     At the time of appraisal, revenues from the then existing tariffs in
the Greater Lisbon Region yielded a financial internal rate of return of about
9% on the total investment program.  It was also estimated that a 70% increase
in constanit prices would be necessary in order to yi-ld a return of 10%.
6.05     A new internal rate of return h1fas been calc'iloted based on actual
project costs and additional investments tthat EPAI. would need to make to meet
the demand in its existing service area until 2007.  Water revenues have been
calculated using the existing (1987) average reveulle per m' for the combined
service (bulk supply and retail).  As detailed in Annex 7, the resulting
internal rate of return is 3.8%.  A variation of plus or minus 20% in
incremental revenues and operating costs would result in returns varying
between 0% and 6.4%.  The long-term incremental cost of water based on a



- 10 -
discount rate of 10% has been recalculated at 94 Esc/m3 (1986 price level)
as compared with the existing average revenue of 50 Esc/m3 (1986 price
level).  This reflects EPAL's low average water revenues per m3, which is
mainly due to the low tariff for water supplied in bulk to municipalities.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Conclusions
7.01     The major objective of the project, to meet the increasing water
demand of the population of the Lisbon Region through the construction of the
first stage of the Castelo do Bode aqueduct, has been met. The demand for
direct services to consumers in Lisbon and for bulk supply to 14 urban and
rural municipalities around Lisbon, North of the Tagus, will be met until 2003
(para 6.01). Although there was a 4.5 year delay in project construction,
project costs expressed in US$ were 16% lower than estimated (para 3.07),
mainly because of the decrease in scope of the distribution component
following the decision of the municipalities south of the Tagus not to be
supplied by EPAL at this time (para 3.02). This change in project scope and
the cancellation of the study on regionalisation of water supply and sewerage
services were the results of municipal and parliamentary opposition to the
creation of regional water supply and sanitation entities. Water tariff
increases were generally insufficient to cover EPAL's rapidly increasing
operating expenses and debt service, and its financial targets were not met
(paras. 5.03 to 5.05).
Lessons Learned
7.02     This project shows the need to obtain the commitment of all the
municipalities and other levels of Government which may be involved in a
sector reorganization as early as possible during project preparation
(para. 3.03).
