Overview
1.01      Underdevelopment of science e-nd cechnology in China has impeded
the country's ability to exoloiL  i'ts 'mraan and natural resources.  Advaaces
in these fields have been l.mited and sporadic due to periodic reversals in
government developmenrt policy.  Tee-_ololgical progress made during
1949-1957 was slowed with tb!e  L-aIrt of t.e Great Leap Forward in 1958, which
emphasized indigenous developmoent of techrnology initiated at the worker and
peasant levels.  During t1hese years, arphasis was on intermediate technology
such as backyard steel furnacec,  whil e high-level scientific technology was
promoted in limited areas such as space and defense.
1.02      Poor results ended the Great Leap Forward in the early l960s,
bringing scientific researchners temporarily back into active participation
in development efforts. Progress was again disrupted with the onset of the
Cultural Revolution (1966-1969), the effects of which were felt through 1976.
The Cultural Revolution. with its overemphasis on self-reliance and discri-
mination against intellectuials, isolated China from the outside world.  By
the late 1970s, science and technology were 15 to 20 years behind advanced
countries. China now faces an important challenge to reduce this gap by
developing scientific and technological manpower and research capacity.
Development Plans
1.03      The goal of China's long-term development is to make a substantial
progress towards the standards of the advanced world by the year 2000 in the
areas of agriculture, industry, defease, and science and technology - called
the "four modernizations.' At the National Science Conference held in March
1978, modernization of science and technology was declared the key to success
of tLhis goal.  The underdevelopment of science and technology was recognized
as an important cause of siow growth in other sectors. For example, increases
in agricultural productivity have been impaired by the high cost of industrial
inputs such as fertilizers /1 and by the scarcity of modern agricultural
machinery. Obsolete management of energy resources and the resultant high
cost of energy has contributed to  inefficiencies in industrial production.
About half of China's coal is still extracted, loaded and conveyed by manual
labor. The use of outdated technology in t'he nonferrous metals industry has
/1  Retail prices per ton or fertilizer for rice in 1977, for example, were
$952 in China, $313 in Tlhailand, and $378 in Japan.  Source:  S. Ishikawa,
Chinese Economy ir. the 1980s (Tokyo, March 1980), p. 54.

resulted in loss of potential yield and quality. Furthermore, the status of
computer technology in China is about 20 years behind the advanced countries,
in terms of bot:h hardware and software (Annex 2), greatly reducing the
benefits that could be derived by computer support in various sectors.
1.04       The tNational Science and Technology Development Plan (1978-1985)
emerged as the outcome of the National Science Conference, setting out eight
priority areas in China-s science and technology development: agriculture,
energy, materials, electronics/computers, lasers, space, high energy physics,
and genetic engineering.
1.05       Among these selected areas, special emphasis is placed on the
development of the electronics industry and computer technology. The
industry, which designs and produces telecommunications and various control
equipment for industry, is an essential prerequisite in establishing modern
industry, characterized by specialized, automated, and high capacity plants.
The quality of engineering work, for example, is circumscribed by the
capability of the machine operator and the equipment. Unless production is
automated, the limit imposed by the expertise of machine operators is
unavoidable. Electronic testing and measuring instruments are also
important tools in research and development of resources and products, in
chemical analysis of product composition, in mechanical testing for quality
control, and in maintenance and operation of systems and plants. The
adoption or development of advanced technology in turn requires a pool of
well-trained manpower and active research work in science and engineering.
Need for Science and Engineering Manpower
1.06       China suffers from a significant imbalance between the need for
highly trained scientists and engineers and the supply of this manpower.
The magnitude of the quantitative imbalance may be assessed by first
examining the labor force, particularly in terms of its educational profile,
and then estimating the coefficients of scientists and engineers for
projected growth in major sectors.
1.07       The Labor Force and Its Educational Structure.  By 1979, the total
population of China had reached 970.9 million, having grown at an average
annual rate of about 2% between 1952 and 1978./1 Over the same period, the
labor force grew at an average annual rate of 2.5%, with a 36% labor force
participation rate in 1952 and 42% in 1979. The breakdown of the labor
force by broad sector is shown in Table 1.1.
/1 The average growth rate, however, declined to 1.3% p.a. in the 1970s.

1.08      In the absence of census or survey, the educational profile of the
Chinese labor force may be estimated on the basis of government assumption
that the output of the educational system between 1949 and 1979 accounted
for about 90% of the trained labor force in 1979. Based on this assumption,
Table 1.2 indicates that about two-thirds of the 1979 labor force had a
minimum of primary education.

1.09      Shortage of Science and Engineering Manpower.  Of China's total
labor force, 0.5% have had higher education. This is low in comparison with
other developing Asian countries./l Of this highly-educated manpower, about
40% are in scientific and engineering fields.  Over the past 30 years,
science and engineering graduates have averaged about 6% and 35% of total
graduates, respect:ively, resulting in a manpower pool in 1979 of 126,000
scientists and 735,000 engineers. These numbers are significantly lower
than those required in these fields in each subsector. For example, only
about 0.5% of China's industrial labor force are highly trained scientists
and engineers. Thiis is low in comparison with other developing countries
and significantly below the level of advanced countries (Table 1.3), and does
not meet the need of China's industrial sector. To illustrate, the
Municipal Planning Commission of Shanghai, China's main commercial and
industrial city, estimates that, on the average, only about one-fifth of its
present need for high-level scientists and engineers has been met.
/1  The fraction of the labor force with higher education was 0.7% in
Indonesia in 1976; 1.8% in Malaysia in 1974; 2.2% in Thailand in 1976;
and 10.4% in Korea in 1975.

1.10      The severe shortage of scientists and engineers with higher
education is also illustrated by looking at research personnel. Only about
3,000 with high-level qualifications are involved in research on a full-time
basis, resulting in an acute shortage in this area. For example, at the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, it is reported that there is only one high-level
researcher to every one hundred technical staff, while advanced countries
generally have one qualified researcher to three to five technical staff.
1.11      The problem of shortages of science and engineering manpower is
compounded by the inadequate quality of that manpower. Due to an upheaval
during the Cultural Revolution and limited and out-dated training, the skill
and 'Knowledge of scientists and engineers are not on par with the standards
in advanced countries. To illustrate, even new graduates are often unable
to operate at new, computer-controlled plants, or to conduct physics-chemical
experiments for quality control. Further, in 1979 a survey was conducted
by the Shanghai Commission of Science and Technology on the quality of
scientific and technical manpower graduated between 1972 and 1976. At the
higher-level, it was found that only 20% were qualified according to the
standards set in university syllabi before the Cultural Revolution, prior
to 1966.
1.12      Projected Need for Science and Engineering Manpower.  Achievement
of the Government's long-term development goal (para. 1.03) will greatly
depend on the ability of the education system to produce a sufficient number
of well-trained scientists and engineers over the next decade. Assuming
industrial and agricultural output to grow at an annual rate of 6.5% and
3.0%, respectively, for the next ten years and applying the labor force
elasticities to industrial and agricultural output observed in the past
(1952-1979), the industrial and agricultural labor forces may be estimated
to rise at the average annual rates of about 3.5% and 2.0%, respectively.
Accordingly, the industrial labor force will grow by about 30 million by



1990 to reach a total of 80 million, and the agricultural labor force will
grow by 70 million by 1990 to reach 370 million.  Further, assuming that the
labor force in services will grow at 3.0% p.a., its labor force will rise by
10 million by 1990 to a total of 45 million.
1.13       In order to determine the future requirements for scientists and
engineers, a desired level of manpower in these professions as a percentage
of the agricultural, industrial and services labor forces was estimated, based
on a cross-country comparison. The broad magnitude of future needs in these
areas may be proje!cted as follows:

As shown in Table 1.4, the stock of scientists and engineers needs to
increase at an average annual rate of 10% and 5% respectively between 1979
and 1990. To reach this goal, the annual average output of higher education
needs to be increased from 6,000 to 27,000 scientists and from 21,000 to
61,000 engineers per year during the next decade.
Need for Science and Engineering Research
1.14       An increase in science and engineering manpower must be matched
by increased scientific and technological research, if China is to attain its
development goal.  Transfer of technology from the industrially advanced
world can expedite development, but it must be accompanied by research
designed to adapt technology to China's particular conditions. Further, if
China is to take a place among the technologically leading nations of the
world, it cannot be content to follow progress in science made by others.
This points to the need to expand China-s indigenous research and
development capaciLty. Accordingly, universities as well as the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and industry should increase their research and
development capac:ity.



2. SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
Overview
2.01      Since 1949, higher education enrollment has expanded at an average
rate of about 4% p.a. from 0.1 million to 1.0 million now. Science and
engineering students have accounted for relatively large shares of about 6%
and 35%, respectively, in the total enrollment. The number of the institu-
tions has tripled from 200 to over 600. However, the size of the higher
education subsector is still too small to meet China's development needs
(para. 1.09): the higher education enrollment ratio actually declined from
1.6% in 1958 to 1.2% in 1979. The subsector suffers from problems of both
insufficient output and inadequate quality. With these problems, the
existing subsector can meet merely 20% to 35% of the high-level science and
engineering manpower needed for national development in the 1980s, and make
only limited contribution to the progress of scientific technology.
Background
2.02      Since 1949, primary and secondary education in China has grown
dramatically, with enrollment ratios surpassing corresponding average ratios
in 92 other developing countries. In contrast, higher education has grown
sporadically and at a much slower rate. China today has an enrollment ratio
that is significantly lower than the ratio of other developing countries
(Graph 1). This growth pattern of education is closely related to China's
political events over the years. Between 1949 and 1957, all levels of
education expanded rapidly: primary education at 15% p.a., secondary
education at 27% p.a., and higher education at 21% p.a. (Table 2.1). The
Great Leap Forward (1958-60) then deemphasized the urban-oriented Soviet
education system in favor of education combined with production labor. It
was during this period that schools and universities set up factories, and
factories and communes established secondary and postsecondary schools. By
the early 1960s, the quality of education was seen to be declining and a
"two-track system" was introduced to meet the needs of academic excellence
as well as of the masses. To achieve better standards in higher education,
some institutions were designated as key institutions and received priority
in resource allocation. These measures did not, however, halt a steady
decline in enrollment in higher education. With the beginning of the
Cultural Revolution in 1966, emphasis was put on education to serve the
masses; intellectuals were criticized as being elitist and advanced
education and research were discouraged. The duration of higher education
was shortened from five/four years to three years and the intake to
universities was stopped altogether from 1966 to 1971. When universities
reopened in 1972, applicants were selected on the basis of their political
and social background and all course examinations were abolished. Not until
1977/78 were examinations reinstated and applicants again chosen on the

Basic Features of Higher Education and Research
Higher Education
2.03      Structure.  Higher education in China is given by comprehensive
universities and by colleges and institutes which specialize in certain
fields (e.g., agriculture, medicine, engineering). Before 1980 students
received a certificate of completion after four years of study. A small
number of students received some form of graduate education but no degrees
or certificates were awarded. In February 1980, new regulations for the
award of academic degrees were adopted by a standing committee of the Fifth
National People's Congress. Bachelor, masters and doctoral degrees will be
awarded beginning in 1981.
2.04      Management and Administration.  Education policy is formulated by
the Central Committee of the Party in cooperation with the State Council.
The Ministry of Education is responsible for overall administration of the
education system in the country including higher education. The Ministry
prepares long-term and annual plans, and coordinates higher education
through control of curricula, textbooks, and recurrent budgets. Day-to-day

management of higher education institutions is the responsibility of a
variety of ministries of the central government and provincial/municipal
governments (Table 2.2).

2.05       Dimensions.  In 1979, there were a total of 633 institutions of
higher education in China (Table 2.3), of which 97 were designated as key
institutions./l In 1979, a total of 1,020,000 students were enrolled in
undergraduate programs. In the same year, 86,000 students graduated /2 from
these programs (Table 2.4).
/1 China designated some primary, middle and higher education institutions
as key ones based on the concept that an efficient way to improve the
quality of education in a short-term is to allocate relatively more
resources to selective institutions. This concept started in early
1960-s (para. 2.02).
/2 In 1981, there will be no graduates because higher education, which had
comprised three years of study for 1976 matriculants, was lengthened
to four years for students matriculating in 1977.

2.06      Although the 97 key institutions account for only 15% of the total
number of higher education institutions, they play an important role,
enrolling 26% of total students and producing 29% of total graduates. Key
institutions are particularly important in the fields of science and engi-
neering, enrolling 45% of total science students and 66% of engineering
students.  In 1979, key institutions were responsible for 56% of total
science graduates and 70% of total engineering graduates.
2.07      Competition for student places in higher education is keen.  In
1979, 4.7 million students applied for 272,000 places. Students are chosen
for admission on the basis of their scores on a uniform national entrance
examination offered at testing centers spread throughout the country. The
scores, and also student's preference for where he/she would like to study
and which subject, are submitted to the Ministry of Education.  From this
pool of scores and preferences, the institutions select entrants, with the
key institutions getting first choice.
2.08      Before 1976, graduate education in China received little attention.
No formal structured programs were offered nor were any advanced degrees
awarded (para. 2.03). Graduate training usually took the form of a one or
two year apprenticeship to a professor.  Between 1949 and 1966 there were
only a total of 16,000 students who completed some form of graduate study;
an annual average of 1,500. By 1979, there were 15,500 students receiving
graduate training, about 70% of which were at the key institutions.
2.09       In 1979, there were 236,640 teaching staff in higher education
(Table 2.5). Of these staff, 5% were professors and associate professors,
62% were lecturers and instructors, and 33% were assistants. The total
average ratio of students to staff was 4 to 1. The 97 key institutions had
52% of this total staff, resulting in a lower student to staff ratio of 3 to
1.

2.10       Financing.  In 1979, China spent 3.3% of its GNP on education.
This is lower than the average of 3.9% of GNP allocated to education by
92 other developing countries and is about half that spent by most advanced
countries. Of China-s total expenditure on education, 92% is financed
publicly./l Among public sources (e.g., central and local governments,
communes and brigades) the central government contributed 69% of the total
public education expenditure, equivalent to 6.6% of the total central
government expenditure (Table 2.6).

2.11       China's expenditures on education have increased rapidly in recent
years. For instance, the average annual increase in the central
government's recurrent expenditure on education was 13.2% between 1977-1979
(Table 2.7). The recent high priority placed by the Government on higher
education is illustrated by the relatively faster growth in recurrent
expenditures for that subsector.
/1 The remaining 8% of education expenditure comes from sources such as
nominal student registration fees paid at all levels of education.

2.12      Higher education receives an almost equal share (30%) of the
public recurrent expenditures on education as do secondary (38%) and primary
education (32%). The annual recurrent costs per primary and secondary
students in China (Table 2.7) are low as percentages of per capita income /1
in comparison to other developing and developed countries./2 In contrast,
the higher education unit cost of 401% of GNP per capita is considerably
higher than that of other developing and developed countries of 362% and
52%, respectively.
Research
2.13      Management and Administration.  Similar to education, policy
related to scientific and technological research is formulated by the
Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in cooperation with the
State Council. Within this broad policy framework, the State Commission of
Science and Technology is responsible for overall planning and coordination
of research in these field[s in the country.
2.14      Administration of scientific and technological research is carried
out by various levels of government: central government, province/
municipality, district/region, county and commune. Above the county level,
/1  Per capita income in China is estimated at Y 393 ($256).
/2  Average primary and secondary recurrent unit costs as percents of per
capita income are about 10% and 50% in other developing countries, and
15% and 20% in developed countries.



- 15 -
there are 310,000 researchers at 2,400 research institutions./l In addition,
110,000 researchers at 3,600 institutions are involved in research at the
county and commune level. Of the total 6,000 research institutions, there
are 1,000 that are considered to be key centers of research. Of their
activities, 43% is devoted to life science, 34% to engineering and
technological science, and 22% to physical sciences.
2.15      University Laboratory Centers.  The scientific and technological
research activities at universities and university-affiliated institutes are
conducted at various laboratories, including centers specialized in
subfields of science and engineering, testing and analysis, and computer
science. The centers serve the needs of the university faculties for
teaching and experimentation. On a limited basis, the testing and
analytical centers and computer centers are also available to serve the
needs of other educational institutions, government agencies and industry.
Electronics/physics laboratory centers provide laboratory facilities for
such subjects as radio engineering, automation, electronics, semiconductors,
solid state physics and acoustics. Engineering laboratory centers provide
laboratories for disciplines including mechanical engineering, precision
instruments, metals, oceanic engineering, chemical engineering, and electric
power engineering. Testing and analytical centers are to meet the
laboratory needs for research and advanced training of departments such as
physics, chemistry, and biology. University computer centers support
graduate student and faculty research; training in programming practice,
computer aided-design, software development, and scientific and engineering
calculations; and university management and administration.
2.16      Financing.  In 1979, China allocated Y 5.87 billion for the
national budget for research and development, including investment in research
projects in medical and social sciences. Basic research received 10% of the
budget, applied research 20%, and development 70%. Basic research accounted
for 1.8% of the national income, an amount which is lower than allocations
for basic research in advanced countries./2 Some 50% of the basic research
budget is channelled through the State Science and Technology Commission
(18% to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and 32% to major national projects),
35% through government ministries including the Ministry of Defense, and 15%
to provincial commissions of science and technology. University based
research (including research conducted at institutions affiliated with
/1 Refers to research activities affiliated with institutions of higher
education as well as institutes involved in research alone.
/2 Of GNP, Japan and France spent 2.0% (1976), UK 2.3% (1972), USA 2.5%
(1976), West Germany 2.6% (1976), and USSR 4.8% (1975).

universities) is financed through the regular budget of the Ministry of
Education, by special appropriations from the central and local governments,
and by support from industry.  The support from the last two sources
accounts for almost 90% of research funds.
Issues in Higher Education and Research
2.17      There are three major issues in higher education and research in
the fields of science and engineering that inhibit China's ability to
accomplish its development goal (para. 1.03): (a) the low output of the
universities in terms of numbers of graduates and volume of research;
(b) the poor quality of these graduates and this research output; and
(c) the inefficient management of higher education and its associated
research activities.
Low Level of Output
2.18      The present level of output of science and engineering graduates is
insufficient to meet China's manpower needs for development (para. 1.13).
An important factor contributing to this low output is poor utilization of
existing staff and space. The current volume of research produced by the
universities is far below the potential contribution these institutions
could make, primarily due to the neglect of graduate programs (para. 2.08).
2.19      Utilization of Staff and Space.  An improved utilization of
existing teaching staff would enable universities to increase enrollment and
output significantly without additional staff. The present student to staff
ratio of 3 to 1 at key universities (4 to 1 at all universities) (Table 2.5)
is about three times lower than the ratios in other countries. This
unnecessarily low ratio of staff contributes to the high recurrent cost per
student (para. 2.12).  The main cause of this low student and staff ratio is
that during the Cultural Revolution, the universities employed hundreds of
workers and peasants, some with little or no postsecondary education, to
replace the many academicians who were dismissed. The majority of these new
staff were retained after the reinstatement of former faculty staff in the
late 1970s. As a result, the workload of Chinese teachers is about 6-7
hours per week, which is about half the full-time equivalent workload
(student contact hours) of 12-15 hours per week in countries with advanced
education systems. As is thre case with staff utilization, the output of
science and engineering graduates could be significantly increased by more
efficient use of existing space.  In general, lectures are held in the
mornings and laboratory exercises in the afternoons, with the result that
each type of facility stands idle half the day.  University libraries are
generally open about 7 hours a day; in other countries it is common for
libraries to be open 14 hours per day. As with libraries, most university
facilities are open from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., but close for three hours
for lunch and three hours for dinner. Utilization rates for facilities in
these institutions, therefore, vary from 30% to 40% in comparison to desired
rates of 60% to 80%, depending on the type of facilities. This low



- 17 -
utilization also contributes to high cost per student (para. 2.12). The
universities should improve the use of their staff and physical facilities
to allow for the needed increase in enrollment, and to improve internal
efficiency.
2.20      Graduate Programs.  While the institutions of higher education
could play an important role in the advances in scientific and engineering
research needed to achieve China's goal of modernization, research activities
within the universities have been limited. This is due, in a large part, to
the neglect of graduate programs (para. 2.08). Students in masters and
doctoral courses can make important contributions to a country's research
efforts. The graduate program in science and engineering at China's
universities should be expanded, therefore, in order to increase research
output and, at the same time, to add valuable masters and doctoral level
manpower to the labor force.
Poor Quality of Output
2.21      The quality of university graduates and research work fail to meet
the standards required by the country (para. 1.11). This failure can be
attributed to the poor quality or absence of university inputs, important
among which are teaching and research programs, staff qualifications and
laboratory equipment.
2.22      Teaching and Research Programs.  The existing teaching programs for
undergraduate science and engineering are both inflexible and imbalanced.
The inflexibility arises from the fact that all students within a major
follow the same courses. Few electives are allowed. The standardization of
course content as prescribed by the Ministry of Education aggravates the
problem. As a result, graduating students tend to leave the university with
essentially the same background as their fellow students and the group as a
whole cannot meet the demand for a wide variety of specializations needed in
modernizing industry. At the same time, curricula in some disciplines place
emphasis on lecture courses with little time devoted to practical content.
The prime example of this is in the computer science area where students are
only given a few hours of actual computer time during their four years of
study. As a result, graduating students are unable to solve problems within
an experimental framework. The current undergraduate science and engineering
curricula should, therefore, be revised to provide greater flexibility of
courses and give a better balance between theoretical and practical content
of training. At the graduate level, entire teaching programs need to be
developed as there have been no formal programs in the past (para. 2.08).
2.23      In research, universities have not had integrated, coordinated
research programs in science and engineering. Most university research topics
are determined in response to the requirements of a donor of funds. The
State Commission of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Education, as
well as industries, are the major sources of funds (para. 2.16), and,



- 18 -
therefore, they determine the areas of most university research efforts. As
a result, there is a concentration of efforts on applied research in
response to technological specialization and little work on desirable basic
research. For examlple, in the life sciences, limited basic research is
being done in the areas of immunology and genetics, without which important
progress in such areas as tissue typing for organ transplantation or genetic
counselling cannot be done.  Another problem with this means of selecting
research topics is that funding for certain topics is duplicated.  This has
been the case in laser research, for example. A coordinated research
program should be developed for China's universities in order to make
research more responsive to the needs of the development process.
2.24       Staff Qualifications.  Although leadership in the academic and
university research community has returned to the experienced professors who
were expelled to rural areas during the Cultural Revolution, many problems
exist: (a) these professors, as a group, are few in number and aged; (b)
staff recruited in the interval are poorly trained; (c) the isolation of
China during the decade of the Revolution has deprived its scientists of
exposure to developments in education and research in the outside world; and
(d) teaching staff have had little opportunity to learn from advances within
other Chinese universities due to lack of mobility for secondment to other
institutions.
2.25      Of total teaching staff of 237,000 in 1979, only 5% were professors
and associate professors (para. 2.09). Most of these have been teaching
more than 30 years (Table 2.8), and professors had an average age of 70.
These experienced staff will therefore need to be replaced in the near
future. The staff who have had six years or more of higher education
accounted for merely 7% of the faculty.  To be comparable to advanced
universities in other Asian countries, at least 50% of the teaching staff
should have six years or more of higher education. The problem of general
lack of necessary training of the staff has been compounded by the limited
exchange of teachers and students among universities. Most undergraduates
continue at the same institution from which they graduated. This inhibits
intellectual cross fertilization and hampers the exchange of ideas. This is
particularly harmful to progress in teaching and research at less developed
universities. The effect of isolation from the outside world has also
affected the qualil:y of teaching and research in all fields, but it is most
evident in those fields in which technological development has been rapid
during the 1960s and 1970s (e.g., the computer sciences). Although some
staff are well-read in such subjects, they lack needed practical experience
to enhance their work.

/a  Based on 21,600 staff in science and engineering at 18 key
universities.
2.26      To solve these staff related problems, there is a need for a
vigorous staff training program, particularly for junior staff, in
universities outside of China. In addition, greater interuniversity
mobility among students and staff should be encouraged.
2.27      Laboratory Equipment.  There are two basic problems related to
laboratory equipment: the amount of equipment is insufficient, and much
of available equipment is obsolete. This adversely affects the quality of
instruction, research and services. For undergraduate teaching there is a
shortage of multiple sets of basic equipment necessary for conducting science
and engineering courses. At the advanced level of teaching, research and
services, there is an absence of specialized equipment of high sophistication.
2.28      During 1980 the Government surveyed 165 laboratories of 13 leading
universities in four provinces and municipalities. The results showed that
there were no universities which could offer all experiments required by
the syllabi; 32% of the universities had adequate equipment for about 90% of
the experiments, 49% had adequate equipment for 70-90% of the experiments,
14% had equipment for 50-70% of experiments, 4% had equipment for less than
50% and 2% of the universities had no equipment. No chemistry department of
any university could offer all the physicochemical experiments required by the
syllabus due to the lack of such equipment as ultraviolet and infrared
spectrometers, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers, mass spectrometers
and x-ray diffractometers. The shortage of computers is also a serious
problem and most graduates are computer-illiterate. Even a computer
science student can have only a few hours of practice on computers before
graduation (para. 2.22). This shortage of equipment for practical training
at the undergraduate level needs to be rectified.
2.29      At the graduate and research level not only is there a shortage of
equipment, but what exists is obsolete. Equipment existing at Chinese
universities was manufactured in the 1940s and 1950s (or are copies of items



- 20 -
first manufactured in those years).  There is a great need for sophisticated
and up-to-date equipment with a high level of precision, speed and
dependability.
Weak Management
2.30      University Management.  The problems of low output and poor quality
are intensified by weaknesses in university management. This weakness is
most evident in the areas of: (a) staff and space utilization (para. 2.19);
(b) record keeping; and (c) accounting.
2.31      Efficient management of human and physical resources of universi-
ties through improved scheduling would permit increased enrollments without
adding to the existing staff or physical resources (para. 2.19). Further,
poor record keeping and accounting practices inhibit efficient management at
the university levels. The lack of a system of student credit hours and
transcripts make it difficult to keep accurate and accessible student
records. In accounting, the present system is based on a control budget
which identifies line items for which expenditures are made (e.g., salary,
utilities, equipment), but does not identify the purposes of the expenditures
(e.g., physics, chemistry, computing, student housing). To develop a better
management information system, the universities need to establish better
systems for record keeping and to introduce program budgeting to their
present accounting practices.
2.32      Ministry of Education Management.  Weaknesses in management at the
Ministry of Education level prevent it from effectively managing the
resources available to higher education and research. This shortcoming is
primarily caused by the weaknesses in the areas of: (a) analyses and
compilation of education statistics; (b) accounting practices; and
(c) monitoring and evaluation.
2.33      Under the guidanze of the State Statistical Bureau, the Ministry of
Education is responsible for the annual collection, analysis and compilation
of data on all levels and types of education. Problems arise in all three
areas of responsibility of collection, compilation and analysis. Education
statistics were not gathered between 1966 and 1972. The data gathering
forms in current usage have not changed significantly since 1972 and are
limited in coverage. They contain information relating to students and
teaching staff but not on physical and financial university resources, nor
on external and :internal efficiency.  The compilation and analysis of the
sketchy data that are collected is made difficult by the understaffing of
the Division of Statistics within the Ministry of Education. There are only
eight professional personnel responsible for compiling and evaluating more
than 1,000 reports received each year from provincial governments containing
information on the educational institutions within their jurisdictions.



- 21 -
There is a need for improving the data forms and processing of information
so that the country will have the data base needed for effective management
of the educational system.
2.34      The weaknesses observed in accounting practices at the university
level (para. 2.31) also exist at the Ministry of Education level.   A
detailed accounting system, including program bulgeting should be introduced
to provide management with more comprehensive information on levels and uses
of expenditures.
2.35      In some repects, China's higher education system is well monitored
and evaluated. The intake of students to the universities which is based on
a quota system and entrance examinations (para. 2.07) is carefully controlled
and assessed by authorities. This is also true of the final examinations and
the placement of graduates in the labor market. While dropouts and repeaters
are few in China and there is little need to establish a monitoring system to
follow them, little attention has been paid to education content, teaching
methods and the cost effectiveness of higher education. There is, therefore,
a need to monitor and evaluate curricula, student achievement and the rele-
vance of the knowledge and skills achieved at the universities to eventual
employment. It is furthermore necessary to monitor the costs since higher
education is comparatively expensive in China (para. 2.12).
Government Plans and Strategy for Higher Education Development
2.36      In support of its four modernizations programs (para. 1.03), the
Government plans to improve the quality, expand the enrollment, and increase
the research capabilities of the higher education system. It intends to
bring the quality of higher education institutions to a level comparable to
that of institutions in developed countries. At the same time, the
Government aims to increase the enrollment in full-time higher education by
7% p.a. reaching 2.2 million in 1990 with some 4 million graduates during
the 1980s. It is expected that enrollment in graduate training would rise
to 0.2 million with 0.1 million output by 1990. The Government also plans
to expand adult higher education from current 900,000 participants to 4
million in 1990.
2.37      Strategy.  To achieve the goal of quality improvement, the
Government plans to increase staff capabilities, improve teaching programs
(with a special emphasis on graduate courses), and increase the availability
of laboratory equipment for teaching and research. As a first phase of this
strategy, the Government has selected the disciplines of science and
engineering for strengthening at 26 key universities.  To develop science and
engineering education, the strategy calls for investment in two areas:
(a) improvement of general science and engineering education at the under-
graduate level; and (b) strengthening of training in selected specializations



- 22 -
at the graduate level: physics, chemistry, engineering /1 and computer
science and its applications. These specializations have been chosen
according to the c ountry's priority fields (paras. 1.04-1.05).
2.38       To strengthen training in these specialized fields and, at the same
time, allocate resources in a rational manner, the Government plans to
either create or :improve existing laboratory centers for these fields at the
universities. There will be three types of such centers (para. 2.15);
analytical and testing centers, key laboratory centers (basically
engineering and eLectronics/physics), and computer centers. To avoid
duplication of resources, these centers will serve for advanced training of
students from many departments as well as for research. The Government
intends to develop a total of 46 centers (13 analytical and testing centers,
13 computer centers, and 20 specialized laboratory centers) at the 26
universities selected for strengthening of their science and engineering
training and research.
2.39       These 26 key universities /2 have been selected on the basis of
the size of their science and engineering enrollment, their faculty strength
and their location. Their enrollment in science and engineering disciplines
accounts for aboul: 75% of their total enrollment, as compared to the
national average of 40%.  Their enrollment in graduate programs represents
30% of the total graduate earollment in the country.  The academic
qualification of t heir teaching staff is relatively high, with 7% of them
having six years or more of higher education, compared to the 5% of the
higher education staff as a whole who have attained that level of education.
All 26 institutions are located in major cities and in areas where industry
and commerce are active.
2.40       Enrollment increases at these 26 key universities will be
accomplished through improv(ements in internal efficiency to raise the
utilization rate of staff and facilities.  To reach its long-term goal of
higher education expansion (para. 2.36), the Government plans to: (a)
increase internal efficiency at all higher level institutions, (b) assist
regional universit:ies in a program similar to that for 26 universities,
(c) establish a system of polytechnics and colleges, (d) increase access by
adults to higher education through greater use of educational television and
correspondence courses, and (e) strengthen social sciences and business
administration.
/1  Included under these fields are: electronics, solid state physics, and
cryogenics (physics); high polymer, biochemistry, physical chemistry,
and organic and inorganic chemistry (chemistry); and marine/oceanography,
mechanical engineering, material testing, precision measurement, and
electrical engineering (engineering).
/2 Of the 26 institutions, 11 are comprehensive, 11 engineering, 2 normal,
1 agricultural., and 1 medical. All are administered by the Ministry of
Education except four, which are administered by the ministries of
Industry, Health, and Agriculture, and the Chinese Academy of Science.



- 23 -
2.41      External Assistance.  The Government expects to finance its higher
education expansion and improvement with its own resources and major
assistance from IBRD/IDA. Some multilateral aid is being provided from UNDP
while bilateral cooperation will primarily take the form of fellowship
programs and exchanges of scholars. The major assistance to universities
since 1976 has been from West Germany to Tongji University in Shanghai in the
amount of DM 1.0 million for laboratory equipment.
3. THE PROJECT
Objective and Scope
3.01      The objective of the proposed project is to support the first
phase of the Government's program to strengthen higher education
(para. 2.37) by helping to increase the output and quality of education and
research in the disciplines of science and engineering.
3.02      To achieve this objective, the project is designed to help over-
come existing problems in higher-level science and engineering education and
research and, also, to help rectify weaknesses in university and Ministry of
Education management which compound the educational problems. Specifically,
the project would include technical assistance (Annex 3), equipment and civil
works to:
(a) increase the number of graduates and the volume of research
work at 26 universities selected by the Government by improving
utilization of staff and space, and developing graduate programs;
(b) raise the quality of graduates and research work at the 26
universities by strengthening teaching and research programs,
improving staff quality, and modernizing laboratory equipment
and facilities; and
(c) strengthen management at university level through improved record
keeping and more comprehensive accounting practices; and at the
Ministry of Education level through improved education statistics,
more comprehensive accounting practices, improved monitoring and
evaluation capacity, and better preparation for future investments
in the education sector.
Expansion of Output (Proposed investment of US$1.0 million excluding
contingencies)
3.03      Staff and Space Utilization.  As a means to increase science and
engineering enrollment and output, the project would help improve utiliza-
tion of staff and space. Teaching loads and space utilization are at about
50% of desirable levels (para. 2.19). Planned science and engineering



- 24 -
enrollment expansion at the 26 project universities (Table 3.1) could
therefore be made without an increase in staff and space.  Techniques and
procedures to increase teacher workloads and improve scheduling of teaching
accommodations would be developed and experimented with at five project
universities selected by the Government (i.e., Beijing, Qinghua, Fudan,
Nanjing, and Huazhong Institute of Technology). Registrar's offices and
science and engineering departments of the five universities would be
responsible for developing the techniques and procedures with support of
specialist services (3 man-years) and fellowships (15 man-years) provided
under the project.
3.04      As a result of improved scheduling techniques, it is expected
that average teacher workloads for teaching would increase to 8-12 hours per
week, and utilization of classrooms to 60-80% and that of lecture halls and
laboratories to 50-70%. Understandings were reached with the Government on
the above efficiency targets and implementation schedules to be achieved by
the five universities.  Understandings were also reached that once the
experiments proved feasible, improved techniques and procedures would be
introduced to remaining project universities to reach the planned enrollment
expansion (Table 3.1).
3.05      Graduate Program.  To assist in increasing the number of students
studying at advanced levels and to promote increased research output, the
project would assist in deveLoping formalized graduate programs. Following
the 1980 decision t:o award bachelor as well as masters and doctoral degrees
beginning in 1981 (para. 2.03), several universities have prepared masters
degree courses of study for Ministry of Education review and approval.
But most programs of this kind have yet to be developed (para. 2.20).
These programs wouLd be developed at departmental levels in the universities
and students could take specialization in fields offered by the department
and the related university center.  The proposed project would provide
specialist services related to chemistry, physics, computer science and
application, and engineering by creating an advisory panel and a review
commission to assist in developing graduate programs (para. 3.07).

It is expected that by 1985/86 (a) a minimum of one masters degree program
per center (i.e., a total of about 50) would be established at the 26
project universities; and (b) the number of graduate students in science and
engineering would be increased from the existing 6,000 to about 10,000.
Understandings on these targets were reached with the Government.
Improvement of Quality (Proposed investment of US$233.0 million excluding
contingencies)
3.06      Teaching and Research Programs.  The project would help improve
undergraduate science and engineering teaching programs, establish
curricula for graduate programs, and develop more coordinated research
programs (paras. 2.22-2.23). Undergraduate curricula would be updated in
line with development needs to provide a more flexible and better balanced
program. Graduate courses leading to the award of a masters degree would be
prepared to comprise both a lecture and a research component at the ratio of
about 3 to 1. Such courses would reflect specialities and strengths of
individual project universities. A pamphlet describing existing and planned
courses would be prepared by the Government. A coordinated research program
would focus on a few long-term projects in fields supported under the
project.
3.07      To assist in qualitative improvement and quantitative expansion
(para. 3.05), two academic advisory bodies would be created (Chart 4): (a) a
review commission comprised of Chinese experts; and (b) an advisory panel to
the review commission. The review commission members would consist of 20-25
faculty members, largely those who have helped finalize laboratory equipment
lists for the 26 project universities. The commission would be headed by a
chairman and be organized in four groups - chemistry, physics, computer
science and engineering. To assist the commission in its work, the project
would provide 25 man-years of specialist services. The provision of specia-
list services would be coordinated by an advisory panel consisting of five
foreign panelists - a chairman and one cochairman in each field of chemistry,
physics, computer science and engineering (Table 3.2). Each of these
panelists would visit China for an average of two months each year during
project implementation. They would spend an average of one additional month
per year coordinating the program of specialist services. In conjunction
with the Ministry of Education and the universities, the panel would help
identify and coordinate the work of subject specialists who would visit
project universities and help develop curricula (especially the structure of
graduate degree programs), provide research direction, and establish contacts
in other universities in China and abroad from which collaboration could be
sought. The work of the commission and panel would be articulated by the
leaders of the two bodies. Both the commission and the panel would report
to the Vice Minister of Planning and Development in the Ministry of
Education. Annual reports of progress in each of the four disciplines would
be rendered to the Ministry of Education by the commission/panel with more
comprehensive reports due at project mid-point (June 1983) and completion
(June 1985).

draft terms of reference for the specialists (para. 4.07). The Government



- 27 -
and the Bank agreed that the members of the review commission, and a chair-
man and four cochairmen for the advisory panel, would be appointed by
November 30, 1981. Further, understandings were reached that by December 31,
1982 project universities would publish a booklet on existing graduate
programs and a plan for future programs in science and engineering,
including research areas to be provided as part of graduate work.
3.09      Staff Development.  The project would help strengthen academic and
professional qualifications of science and engineering staff at the 26 uni-
versities. At present only 7% of the staff have six years or more of higher
education; their training is outdated; and interuniversity exchange is
limited (para. 2.25). The project would enlarge the number of staff with
advanced degrees in science and engineering at project universities through
the provision of longer term (two to three years) overseas fellowships for
400 staff. Also, through the provision of shorter-term (about one year)
fellowships abroad, the project would help acquaint about 400 staff with
research and teaching programs, teaching methods, and operation and
maintenance of equipment at universities and research institutes outside the
country.
3.10      A total of 800 overseas fellowships for staff development would be
financed by the project, totaling an estimated 1,250 man-years. The
fellowships would be distributed and phased as follows:

/a  Calculated based on one man-year for a short-term, two man-years for a
medium-term, and three man-years for a long-term fellowship.
The medium-term fellowships should enable fellows to complete masters programs
and long-term fellowships to finish doctoral programs. The proposed fellow-
ship program would increase the proportion of science and engineering staff
with higher academic and professional capability at the project universities
from 7% to 10%. Fellowships would be awarded according to procedures and



- 28 -
criteria agreed between the Government and the Bank (para. 4.06). Before
departure, fellows would be trained in appropriate foreign languages. The
fellowship program would be managed by the Ministry of Education with the
assistance of university departments and the advisory panel.  Understandings
were reached on the programs and schedule to implement the fellowship
program and to conduct foreign language training courses for selected
fellows, and assurances were obtained that the language training programs
would be implemented on schedule.
3.11      In-country fellowships would also be included in the proposed
project in support of interuniversity exchange of staff and students to
promote exchange of teachi'ng programs and research (para. 2 25). As a
result of the project, it is expected by 1984/85 (a) that 5% to 10% of
science and engineering professors and associate professors at project
universities would be exchanged for a semester or longer among project and
nonproject universities to help promote balanced development of teaching and
research; and (b) that about one-fourth of admissions for graduate programs
in science and engineering at a project university would be selected from
among the candidates outside the university. Understandings were reached
with the GovernmLent on targets of interuniversity exchange of students and
staff.
3.12      Laboratory Equipment and Centers.  The project would improve the
quality of training and research by addressing the main issues of
insufficiency and obsolescence of laboratory equipment (para. 2.27). The
project would provide equipment for laboratories at the 26 project
universities: (a) those for practical training in undergraduate courses;
and (b) 46 laboratory centers for graduate training, research and services
consisting of 20 laboratory centers, 13 testing and analytical centers, and
13 computer centers. Distribution of these general laboratories and centers
among the project universities is illustrated in Table 3.4. Equipment for
undergraduate laboratories would be for general strengthening of science and
engineering courses, particularly for the third and fourth year students.
Equipment would be installed in relevant departmental laboratories.
Equipment for centers would be for specialized training, research and
services, and serve the needs of various university departments as well as
other educational institutions, government agencies and industry (para.
2.15). The centers would be managed and staffed by members of academic
departments. At present, the Government is renovating existing facilities
or constructing new buildings to house the centers.
3.13      Master equipment lists for both types of laboratories have been
finalized. The new equipment provided for the 20 laboratory centers would
create fully equipped facilities in the specialized subject areas within
which research and advanced training could be conducted. Individual testing
and analytical centers would have a core of needed equipment to perform

their role as service centers in addition to training and research centers.
These centers would have such core equipment as an electron microscope,
x-ray diffraction machinery or multipurpose tensile testing equipment. The
13 computer centers would be equipped with a mix of micro and medium-sized
computers. This mix is designed to cost effectively meet the need for
training and services for the university community. The project would also
finance the development of computer software.
Strengthening of Management (Proposed investment of US$5.0 million
equivalent excluding contingencies)
3.14      University Management.  The project would seek to rectify
weaknesses of management at the university level by introducing techniques
and procedures in scheduling staff and facilities, operating libraries,
record keeping, and accounting (para. 2.30). These procedures would be
introduced on an experimental basis at five project universities (i.e.,
Beijing, Qinghua, Fudan, Nanjing, and Huazhong Institute of Technology).
Programs judged successful by the Government would be extended to remaining
project universities.
3.15      Improvement in the capacity of the university management to
schedule human and physical resources more efficiently would help meet
the targeted increases in enrollment in science and engineering under the
project (paras. 3.03-3.04). Improved record keeping would help introduce a
system of student credit hours and transcripts to make student records more
accurate and accessible and to facilitate needed interuniversity exchange of
students (para. 2.25). Accounting methods would be improved to include
program budgeting to raise cost consciousness by emphasizing cost by unit
and program.
3.16      At the five pilot universities, the management improvement program
would be administered by the vice-president for administration assisted by
the registrar and the senior financial affairs officer and their staff.
The universities would be assisted in introducing the new management
procedures by foreign specialist services and fellowships for study
abroad (Table 3.5). The specialists would visit the universities during the
early part of project implementation to help establish the experimental
programs and identify particular needs for study abroad.
3.17      Library and computer center administration would be strengthened.
Management of these programs would also be coordinated by the vice-president
for administration working with the librarian and senior computing staff.
Technical assistance for library administration would be given at the five
universities selected for mianagement assistance while for computer center
administration it would be provided to all 13 project universities at which
computer centers would be established under the project.

3.18      Ministry of Education Management   The project would help improve
the capacity of the Ministry of Education in education statistics,
accounting, monitoring and evaluation, and preparation for future sectoral
investments (para. 2.32) through provision of technical assistance and
introduction of computer technology. Improvements would be made in
procedures for collection of statistics, as well as in methods of
compilation and analysis of data. These benefits would extend beyond higher
education to secondary and primary education as well. The Ministry of
Education-s accounting system would be expanded to include program budgeting
techniques similar to those at the five selected universities (para. 3.15).
The monitoring and evaluation capabilities of the Ministry of Education
would also be improved through technical assistance.
3.19      Administration of the Ministerial management improvement program
would be under the general guidance of the Vice Minister for Planning and
Development (para. 4.02). Working groups would be formed for the three
areas to receive attention - educational statistics, financial management,
and evaluation. To assist these groups the project would provide 10
man-years of specialist services and 16 man-years of overseas fellowships
(Table 3.6).

3.20      The Government-s ten-year education plan and the economic study
recently conducted by the Bank show that China has important needs for
further development in the! education sector. High priority areas for future
investments would be related to (a) the second phase of higher education
development, particularly for students in minority regions and in social
sciences, (b) the establishment of a polytechnic system, (c) teacher
training, curricula and instructional naaterials development, (d) university
training by means of television, and (e) agricultural education and research
(Annex 4). To prepare for future investments, the project would finance
technical assistance comprising 2 man-years of specialist services and 50
man-years of fellowships, and a limited amount of instructional equipment
for studies and developmental programs. Understandings were reached on
schedules and the scope of the developmental programs and studies.
4. MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
Overview
4.01      Management arrangements for project implementation would rely on
existing organizations and include:
(a) comprehensive plans for administrative responsibilities, organ-
ization and staffing;
(b)  relevant procedures and criteria for selection of fellowship
recipients and specialists;



- 33 -
(c) well-defined procurement procedures for civil works and equipment;
and
(d) a realistic implementation schedule.
These arrangements are discussed in the following sections of the chapter.
Administrative Responsibilities, Organization and Staffing
4.02      Responsibility for implementing the project would rest
with the Ministry of Education. The Vice Minister for Planning and Develop-
ment of Education would carry the overall responsibility for directing the
project. He would be aided in this task by two recently appointed project
coordinators. These coordinators would, through staff function, coordinate
project implementation work. One coordinator would be responsible for
coordination of relevant sections of the seven Bureaus (Planning, Science
and Technology, Production and Supply, Capital Construction, Foreign
Affairs and Higher Education Number One and Two) in the Ministry of
Education. The other coordinator would draw on expertise outside the
Ministry of Education, particularly inputs from the recently established
review commission and the foreign specialist panel (para. 3.07), the China
National Technical Import Corporation of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the
State Planning Commission, the State Capital Construction Commission, and
the Foreign Investment Bureau in the Foreign Investment Control Commission.
The Ministry of Education would therefore:
(a) coordinate activities of all project implementing agencies and
ensure compliance with Government plans and project objectives;
(b)  monitor the preparation of architects  briefs, civil works
designs, appointments of civil works and furniture contractors and
supervision of the capital works program;
(c) review equipment lists and specifications to ensure that project
equipment is of high priority and has appropriate specifications;
(d) prepare equipment tender documents for international competitive
bidding and conduct bidding, evaluation and equipment contract
awards in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines;
(e) monitor procurement of local equipment and give assistance to
universities in this respect;
(f) recruit specialist services and place fellows on overseas training
and exchange programs;
(g) develop university budget procedures, statistics and manage-
ment information systems as well as procedures to analyze and
improve staff and space utilization;



- 34 -
(h) prepare project budgets and monitor and control project costs in
accordance with approved budgets and agreed budgetary procedures;
(i) maintain records and accounts, prepare and submit disbursement
applications to the Bank and maintain a general liaison with the
Bank;
(j) conduct project studies and experiments, including preparation
of terms of reference, appointments of study teams, review and
evaluation of study proposals; and
(k) monitor and evaluaLte progress and submit periodical (quarterly,
annual, mid-project and completion) reports to the Bank (para.
3.07).
4.03      University Level Administration.  Existing development offices in
each project university have helped prepare architect's briefs for all project
facilities and have hired design consultants to prepare designs to accommodate
laboratory equipment.  The development offices would appoint all civil works
and furniture contractors, supervise their work and be responsible for
arranging for installation of imported equipment and procurement of local
equipment. The development offices would be assisted in these tasks as
necessary by the Ministry of Education.
4.04      University development plans and budget and management procedures
for project universities would be prepared under the auspices of senior
management committ:ees of each university. Details of such plans and
procedures would be prepared by the development offices, assisted by the
various university departments and foreign specialists supplied by the
proposed project.
4.05      Project Implementation Staff.  An overall project implementation
organogram identif-ying lines of responsibility is shown in Chart 4. Table
4.1 shows current staffing situation of the Bureaus and Sections within the
Ministry of Educalion which would implement the project. There is no need
to immediately hire additional staff but periodic, internal reviews would be
conducted by the Ministry to determine future need. New staff would be
appointed accordingly.

Selection Procedures and Criteria for Technical Assistance
4.06      Fellowship candidates would be nominated by each university
department, and by the Ministry of Education in the case of management
training of its staff.  Selection at the university level would be done by a
a selection committee, staffed by senior university management. Adminis-
tration of contracts of fellows at overseas universities would be the
responsibility of the Ministry of Education. Candidates would be selected
from among (a) disciplines of science and engineering (para. 3.09); (b)
existing and prospective staff of project universities; (c) staff designated



- 36 -
for management positions in the Ministry of Education; (d) staff not older
than 45 years except for short-term fellowships; and (e) staff whose foreign
language proficiency (after language training) is adequate for study abroad.
Understandings on the criteria and procedures for fellowship selection were
reached between the Government and the Bank.
4.07      The chairman of the advisory panel is being selected by the Ministry
of Education in consultation with the Bank. Specialist services would be
hired by the Ministry of Education following appropriate consultations with
project universities and panel chairman.  The Government agreed that it would
submit for Bank review draft: terms of reference for specialist services before
signing technical assistance contracts.
Procurement Procedures
4.08      Building Designs.  Architectural designs for the project are
being prepared by four different groups: (a) six permanent design centers
located at project universities;/1 (b) provincially administered design
bureaus; (c) a Central Design Office in the First Ministry of Machinery
with branch offices at the local level; and (d) ad hoc design groups formed at
some universities to prepare their own designs. Fees of about 1 - 1.5% of
estimated construction costs are charged for the designs. Supervision of
contract work is the joint responsibility of each university development
office assisted by the appointed design centers. Design and supervision
procedures, from the preparation of briefs to supervision of construction, are
acceptable, but old fashioned.  The project would include short term study
tours abroad for project designers (24 man-months) to study development in
modern university design.
4.09      Civil Works.  Construction of project buildings is in an advanced
state of preparation and construction at several sites is in progress.
Under this project, it woulcl not be in the interest of economy and
efficiency to introduce changes in contractual procedures for civil works.
/1 These are at Qinghua, Tianjin, Huazhong, South China Institute of
Technology, Zhongshan and Nanjin Universities.



- 37 -
Traditional contractual procedures would, therefore, be used and the
Government would finance all civil works construction under the proposed
project from its own resources. Under these procedures, the Government
selects civil works contractors on the basis of availability and capability
rather than price considerations./l Payments to the contractors are made
periodically against their bills for material, labor and overheads. Such
bills are reviewed and certified for appropriateness by site supervisors
representing the Capital Construction Bank. This Bank makes payments to the
contractors and is responsible for maintaining economy and efficiency in
construction.
4.10      Equipment.  Under the proposed project, equipment worth about
US$135 million equivalent in foreign exchange before contingencies, or over
80% of the proposed credit/loan would be procured and distributed to the
26 project universities. Equipment would be procured in accordance with
acceptable lists which have been prepared by project universities, reviewed
by the review commission (para. 3.07) and approved by the Ministry of
Education. Equipment would be procured in three phases spread over about two
years, starting in the fall of 1981. Bidding documents and specifications
for international competitive bidding were prepared with Bank/UNDP
assistance in March/April 1981. Preparation for procurement has reached an
advanced stage and bid invitation is expected to be announced soon after
loan/credit signing. The Ministry of Education would carry the overall
responsibility for procurement and administration. It has the
implementation capability of handling shipside acceptance, clearing of
customs, storage, repackaging and redistribution, domestic insurance, final
acceptance, installation, initial testing and initial operation. The China
National Technical Import Corporation of the Ministry of Foreign Trade,
which has experience in equipment procurement under international
competitive bidding procedures, would assist the Ministry of Education in
procurement by handling bid invitation, bid evaluation and contract awards.
The Ministry of Education has three major procurement supply stations:
Tianjin (North China), Shanghai (Central China) and Guangzhou (South China)
and an adequate number of warehouses. Advice on installation, operation and
maintenance of the laboratory equipment, as well as in management of the
centers, would be provided under the project by the review commission and
the advisory panel (para. 3.07). Assurances were obtained from the
Government that buildings suitable to accommodate equipment to be installed
would be available before the equipment was delivered to project
universities.
/1 As an exception, bidding procedures are being introduced on an
experimental basis in Tianjin. If results are positive, the aim is to
gradually introduce country-wide bidding procedures for civil works.



- 38 -
4.11      The equipment lists have been divided into two categories by the
Ministry of Education in accordance with estimated sources of supply. One
list contains equipment which is readily available within China.  This
equipment would be financed by the Government and procured within China in
accordance with local procedures. There is no local competitive bidding
system in China for equipment, since (a) heavy general equipment items are
produced and distributed through central planning; (b) specific instruments
and machinery are purchased by schools from state or local mechanical/
electrical supply companies; and (c) miscellaneous items are obtained through
direct purchase. The other equipment list contains sophisticated equipment,
which the Ministry of Education estimates to be beyond the manufacturing
capability of local industries. The bulk of this equipment would be
procured through international competitive bidding and financed by the Bank.
Equipment items in this group would be grouped into packages to the extent
possible for bulk procurement. Each invitation to bid exceeding an
estimated cost of US$100,000 would be subject to international competitive
bidding. Local manufacturers would be permitted to participate although the
amount of equipment contracts to be awarded to local suppliers through
international competitive bidding is expected to be marginal. Standard Bank
Group preferences in bid evaluation would be accorded to locally manufactured
goods procured under international competitive bidding. Items and groups
of items estimated to cost less than US$100,000 in each contract and not
exceeding an aggregate anount of US$20 million could be obtained through
procedures satisfactory to the Bank. It was understood between the
Government and the Bank that: (a) direct purchase would be used for
proprietary items under contracts directly negotiated with the supplier of
such items. Direct purchase would also be used when justified by the need
for standardization, or where the early delivery of the items is critical to
the timely execution of the project; and (b) for items other than those
referred to in (a) above, contracts would be awarded after obtaining
quotations from at least three suppliers and on the basis of comparison and
evaluation of the quotations so obtained.
4.12      During the initial procurement phase, the Bank would assist in
reviewing all award decisions to prevent misprocurement. From the Second
procurement phase, prior Bank review of contract awards would exclude small
size contracts (US$100,000 and less). Prior Bank review of equipment awards
is estimated to cover about 75% of the total value of all contracts.
Implementation Schedule
4.13      The proposed project would be implemented over a four-year period
(Annex 5).  This is considered feasible because the project is in an
advanced stage of preparation as follows:



- 39 -
(a) Civil Works. Remodelling works for 73,600 m2 at 62 construction
sites is in progress. About 50% of working drawings for altera-
ations have been completed, 45% of the remodelling is expected to
be completed in 1981 and the balance (55%) in 1982. New
construction of over 190,000 m2 is expected to be required at
47 construction sites.  About two-thirds of working drawings for
these works have been completed, 25% of the construction work has
started and is expected to be completed in 1981, 40% is expected
to be completed in 1982 and the balance in 1983.
(b) Equipment. All equipment lists have been prepared and modifica-
tions are nearly completed. Draft tender and contract documents
have been completed and tender documents, specifications and
invitations to bid for first phase procurement (estimated at 50%
of total equipment procurement) have been completed. Delivery of
first phase equipment is expected to be completed by the end of
1982; delivery of the fourth and last phase is expected to be
completed by early 1985.
(c) Technical Assistance. By mid-1981, the Government is
expected to: (i) make arrangements to set up foreign language
training courses for fellows and prepare a detailed schedule for
conducting the courses; (ii) select the first group of fellows
according to criteria and procedures agreed between the Government
and the Bank Group, and proceed with their placement in foreign
universities; and (iii) prepare draft terms of reference for
specialists who would assist in teaching and research programs,
management improvements and studies. The technical assistance
program is expected to be completed in mid-1985.
The closing date would be June 30, 1986.

5.03      Bases of Cost Estimates.  Base costs refer to December 1980 prices.
Construction costs have been estimated on the basis of existing sketch plans,
recently started construction and analysis of unit prices of recently
completed comparable buildings. Comparable facilities at the various project
universities cost about the same,/1 but unit costs for facilities with
different functions have a wide price range, depending on purpose as
follows:
Table 5.3: RANGE OF UNIT PRICES FOR CONSTRUCTION
Facility                  Price/sq m in US$
Classrooms, libraries                 100-110
Chemistry labs, library stacks        160-170
Computer centers                      270-300
Sterile, vibration free
laboratories                        400-500
These unit costs are low by international comparisons. Equipment costs have
been based on master equipment lists.  Technical assistance costs, including
salaries, housing costs, allowances and international airfares have been
estimated at US$7,500/man-month. Fellowships training is estimated at
US$1,250/man-month.
5.04      Estimated project costs include the following contingency allow-
ances:
(a) physical contingencies (US$12 million) estimated at 5% of the base
cost of all project items; and
(b) price contingencies (US$43 million) calculated on the December 1980
base cost plus contingencies in accordance with the following
estimates of price escalation (Table 5.4).
/1 Hostel facilities in North China cost significantly more than those in
South China because of climatic differences. No such facilities are
included in the proposed project.

The estimated low increases for local costs and computers are based on review
of historic data of costs of these items.
5.05      The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$200 million or
about 68% of total project costs. This foreign exchange component was
derived from analyses of the amounts and composition of imported equipment
and technical assistance under the proposed project. The resulting foreign
exchange contents amount to 82% for equipment and 92% for technical
assistance.
5.06      Duties and Taxes.  The Government would bear any charges for
customs duties levied on goods imported for the project. Cost estimates
for the project exclude any such costs.
Project Financing
5.07      The total project cost of US$295 million would be financed as
follows:

Expenditures incurred between Board approval and signing of the Loan and
Development Credit Agreements are recommended for retroactive financing up to
a total of US$5,000,000 equivalent.
5.08      Recurrent Cost.  Recurrent annual cost generated by the proposed
project is estimated at about US$95 million equivalent (in 1981 prices) and
would account for about 1% of the Ministry of Education budget in 1985/86, or
about 6% of its higher education budget in 1985/86. This estimate is based on
the assumptions that the recurrent expenditure of the Ministry of Education
will grow at 10% p.a. in real terms, as will that of higher education.
Considering the priority given to higher education development and, in
particular, to the proposed project which addresses the urgent need for
scientific and engineering manpower and research development, the share of 1%
in the Ministry's projected recurrent expenditure in 1985/86 would not
constitute an unreasonable budgetary constraint to the implementation of the
proposed project.
5.09      Disbursements.  The proposed loan/credit of US$200 million equiva-
lent would be disbursed over a period of five years. Disbursements would be
made on the basis of:



- 46 -
(a)  100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment or ex-factory cost of
locally-manufactured equipment procured in competition with
foreign goods; and 75% of invoiced cost of imported equipment
procured locally; and
(b)  100% of the cost of specialists and overseas fellowships.
5.10      To the extent practicable, withdrawal applications would be aggre-
gated in amounts of US$100,000 or more prior to submission to the Bank Group
for disbursements. The Ministry of Education would submit all applications
for withdrawals. Apart from direct payment to suppliers or payments by the
use of letters of credits and qualified agreements to reimburse, the Bank of
China would be the recipient institution for reimbursements from the Bank
Group. Estimated expenditures and disbursements under the proposed project
are shown in Table 5.6.

6. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01      There are three principal benefits of the proposed project:  (a)
increased output of graduates and research work in science and engineering
from the higher education system, through enhanced use of space and
expanded graduate programs; (b) improved quality of science and engineer-
ing graduates and research work, through strengthened teaching and research
programs, staff qualifications and physical facilities, and (c) increased
capacity for management of higher education at the university and Ministry of
Education levels, through improved administration techniques and procedures.
In addition, the project would lay the groundwork for further development of
the education sector through the support of studies and developmental
projects.
6.02      The increased output of high-level science and engineering graduates
generated by the project should meet about one-third of China's average
annual incremental needs. Measures taken to improve the quality of this
output should increase the productivity of the science and engineering
graduates in their chosen fields. The creation of at least 50 graduate
programs and the establishment of 46 well-equipped laboratory centers under
the project would lead to increased volume and quality of research
activities. The combined increases in quantity and quality of output of
science and engineering graduates and research should have the long-term
effect of enhancing China's capacity to operate and generate technology
needed for development. In addition the project should help improve the
overall planning and operation procedures for future development of
education.
Risks
6.03      Because of China's inexperience in implementing a World Bank Group
project, difficulties in implementation might pose a risk, especially in
procurement of goods and services.  To help reduce this risk, the Bank and
UNDP have assisted in preparing specifications and tender documents.
6.04      More specific risks associated with the project would be related
to the implementation of staff development and laboratory equipment instal-
lation. The proposed large number of fellowships might not be effectively
utilized because foreign language ability of most Chinese faculty is poor.
To reduce this risk, the Bank would ask the Government for assurance of the
implementation of foreign language training according to an agreed schedule.
Another risk would be that laboratory equipment might be procured before
appropriate buildings were completed and therefore be installed at temporary
locations. To reduce the risk, the Bank would seek agreement with the
Government that the necessary buildings be completed before the equipment
to be installed was due to arrive.

7   AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Understandings iwere reached between the Government and the Bank
on:
(a)  targets related to staff and space utilization (para. 3.04),
enrollment increase (para. 3.04), the number of graduate
programs (para. 3.05), interuniversity exchange programs (para.
3.11);
(b) publication of a booklet on graduate programs by project
universities (para. 3.08);
(c) criteria and procedures for appointment of fellows and the
implementation schedule for the program (paras. 3.10 and 4-06);
(d) the schedule and the scope of the developmental programs and
studies (para- 3.20) and
(e) procurement procedures for items costing less than US$100,000
equivalent per c:ontract (para.411).
7 02      The Government assured the Bank that:
(a)  the members of the review commission, and a chairman and four
co-chairmen of the proposed advisory panel, would be
appointed by November 30, 1981 (para. 3.08);
(b) foreign language! training for selected fellows would be carried
out in accordance with the agreed schedule (para. 3.10)
(c)  fellowships would be awarded according to the agreed criteria and
procedures (para. 4.06);
(d) the Government wrould submit for Bank review draft terms of reference
for specialist services before signing the technical assistance
contract (para. 4.07)- and
(e) buildings suitable to accommodate equipment to be installed would
be available before the equipment was delivered to project
universities (para. 4.10).
7.03       It is recommended that expenditures incurred between Board approval
and signing of the Loan and Development Credit Agreements be financed
retroactively up to US$5,000,000 equivalent (para. 5.07).
7.04       Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would
constitute a suitable basis for (a) a loan of US$100 million equivalent and
(b) a credit of US$100 million, to the People's Republic of China. The Bank
loan would be for a term of 20 years including a five-year grace period, and
the credit would be on standard IDA terms.

Summary of Development Programs and Studies /1
Nine priority development programs and studies were identified by the Govern-
ment and the Bank and are listed below. Of these, the project would finance
five studies: (a) study number one on regional and technical universities;
(b) study number two on polytechnics; (c) study number four on agricultural
education and research; (d) study number six on the use of television for
university instruction; and (e) study number eight on teacher training,
curricula and instructional materials.  Cost for the five preparatory studies
would come to about US$2 million. Detailed terms of reference for the
studies would be prepared by the Government and reviewed by the World Bank
Group.
Technical, Vocational, and Agricultural Education and Training
1.        Regional Technical Universities.  A group of 46 regional
universities has been identified for general and specialized strengthening in
technical disciplines. Topics to be studied would include: (a) further
review by the Government to determine adequacy of geographical coverage and
appropriateness of centers to be developed and equipment to be provided; (b)
study tours for faculty and staff to learn of parallel development in other
countries; (c) creation of an advisory panel and review commissions in
parallel to the present project; and (d) organization of a project management
structure. These activities would be in the form of project preparation for a
component of a second university development project and should begin in July
1981.
2.        Polytechnics.  The Government has announced plans for creation of a
large number of new type of post-secondary less-than-bachelors degree
granting institutions. One city (Changzhou) has been designated to receive
the first such institution and plans for civil works, construction, equipment
procurement and staff development program to review the need for purpose of
this type of institution and school mapping to determine the number needed;
(b) worldwide study tours to observe successful institutions of this type,
especially US community colleges and technical institutes and UK polytechnics;
(c) construction and equipment for the first institution following the study
tour; and (d) creation of a project management structure. These activities
would be scheduled during July 1981 and July 1982 as part of project
preparation of a component of a second university development project. Costs
of the proposal made by the Government are as follows (US$m): Civil works,
0.6; local equipment 0.8; foreign equipment, 1.0 and fellowships, 0.1;
total 2.5. All of this is for the initial campus in Changzhou.
3.        Technical/Vocational Education.  The Government proposal was limited
to improvement of two post-secondary technical schools: Tientsin Radio Meters
Professional School and Beijing Technical and Vocational Training Center with
total costs at nearly US$7.5 million, mostly for imported equipment for the
Beijing faculty. While not ruling out this approach entirely, it was agreed
during appraisal to direct this program toward a national study of the need
for technical/vocational education in addition to improvements at only two
/1 Additional details are provided in Working Papers, Section C4.

institutions. The Education Annex to the IBRD Economic Report indicated
that equipment provision of technical/vocational education could require
an investment as hiogh as US$2.0 billion. The study element should identify
alternative methods to meet the demand by using existing facilities and
equipment for training. Another important topic to be inlcuded is ways to
training teachers of vocational/technical subjects.
4.        Agricultural Education and Research.  The Education Annex to the
IBRD Economic Report makes it clear that training and education of agricul-
tural experts falls far short of need. There is debate on whether the
organizational structure followed in rural areas (communes, brigades,
counties) does not take the place of such persons as agricultural extension
officers. But, clearly there is a need for agricultural experts at higher
levels of government and production and processing and in research.
Social and Management Sciences
5.        The Government and the Bank recognized during preappraisal a need
for improvement and added enrollment in social and management sciences in
higher education. Total emphasis on technical higher education (the first
project, plus paras. 1, 2 and 4 above) without concomitant improvement of
programs in such fields as economics, political science, sociology, business
administration and law would produce an imbalanced structure. This
developmental program was added at the end of appraisal and no Government
proposal was received. The program should consist of an academic study of the
needs, capabilities of existing institutions and a plan for future expansion.
Adult Higher Education
6.        Television University (UTV).  The Government requested assistance
to expand the existing television university by adding capacity at four
locations: Central Television University, Beijing, Shanghai and Shengyang.
Total estimated costs are as follows: Central US$2.2 million; Beijing
US$1.8 million; Shanghai US$1.2 million; and Shengyang US$2.4 million;
total 7.6. About half of this total would be for imported equipment and more
than half of the remainder would be local equipment. The development program
would also include a staff development program and a study of the feasibility
of expansion of the system to cover the entire country and estimated costs
thereof. At present, most programming is at the post-secondary educational
level. The study would extend to the demand for adult literacy and lower
level skill training and the feasibility of adding such content to the
programming. The study would be conducted in late 1981 and ealry 1982 to
permit findings to be used for the inclusion of UTV in the second Bank
education project.
7.        Adult Higher Education.  The Government has proposed assistance
to an experimental adult higher education center in Tianjin. This proposal,
unlike many others, is truly an experiment and could be the beginning of a
national study of innovations in the delivery of higher education to adults.

Page 3
This study would be closely coordinated with the UTV proposal (para. 3).
The total cost of the proposed assistance to the Tianjin Center is
US$4.4 million of which US$1.6 million is for imported equipiment.
Teacher Training, Curricula and Instructional Materials Development
8.        Teacher Training, Curricula and Instructional Materials.  The
Government has proposed assistance to eight existing teacher training institu-
tions: Teacher College (Shandong), Hunan Pedagogical Institute, Gansu
Educational Institute (Lanzhou), T-eilongjiang Education Institute, Hefei
Teacher Training College, Jiangxi Institute of Education and Guizhou
Educational College. This assistance would total about US$10.0 million, about
half of which would be imported equipment. It was agreed during appraisal
that this request would be modified to include a comprehensive study of the
entire teacher demand and supply situation which would lead to experimental
assistance to selected institutions. New methods to deliver pre-service and
in-service training would be explored. The program would include a review of
primary and secondary curricula so that teacher training content could be
adjusted. Instructional materials needs and methods of production and
delivery to schools would also be covered.  The Education Annex to the IBRD
Economic Report suggests that an oversupply of new teachers for primary and
secondary could result from continuation of present enrollment levels in
teacher training institutions, so the study is timely.
9.        Minority Secondary Schools.  This proposal of the Government
includes equipment assistance to five middle schools, only one of which is
clearly located in a minority area (Urumchi). It was agreed during appraisal
that the Government would revise the request to cover only minority schools
and formulate the study design to make it more experimental rather than only
equipment provision.
