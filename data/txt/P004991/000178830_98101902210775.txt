INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECaO=ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR A POPULATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on a proposed
development credit to the Arab Republic of Egypt for the equivalent of
US$5.0 million on standard IDA terms to finance the foreign exchange cost
of a population project.
PART I. THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current tEconomic Position and Prospectls
of the Arab Republic of Egypt" (R73-16) dated December 30, 1972 was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on January 23, 1973. More recentc economic
developments were discussed in my report to the Executive Directors for the
Cotton Ginning Rehabilitation Project (R73-86). which was approved on July 24,
1973. This discussion is reproduced, with minor changes, in Annex I, which
also includes a Country Data Sheet.
PART II. BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN EGYPT
3.        The proposed credit would be the Bank Groupts eighth operation in
Egypt and would bring Bank and IDA commitments to $187.2 million.   The first
operation was a Bank loan for the Suez Canal Expansion Project ($56.5 million)
in 1959. IDA lending began in 1970 with a credit for the Nile Delta Drain-
age Project ($26 million). Since then, credits have been made for the follow-
ing projects: Egyptian Railways Rehabilitation ($30 million), Upper Egypt
Drainage ($36 million), Bank of Alexandria ($15 million), and Cotton Ginning
Rehabilitation ($18.5 million)l/. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans and IDA credits as of August 31, 1973 and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects. There have been no IFC investments in EgypG and none are
under consideration.
4.        The main purpose of the IDA lending program is to assist development
of key sectors and to alleviate Egypt's severe shortage of foreign exchange
by financing high-priority projects in agriculture, industry, population, and
infrastructure. The lending program is modest in relation to Egypt's size
and absorptive capacity, but the staff has been exploring the interest of
other donors in the complementary financing of some future IDA projects, in
order to broaden the impact of limited IDA funds.
1/ A $175,000 engineering cred-it (S-13) for the preparation of the Co-ton
Ginning Project, signed in November 1972, has since been consolidated
under the Cotton Ginning Credit dated July 30,   973.

that in rural areas, it is tempting tuio conclude that t'he process
of urbanization is contributing to lowering national fertility. However, it
is also in the cities  that Mhe most effective family planning work is being
conducted. It is therefore impossible to say what urban fertility would
nave been without the family planning program.
10.       Sixty percent of the population is still illiteraue, although the
proportion of school-age children attending school has doubled since 1952.
These recent gains have been shared by both girls and boys, though the gains
among girls have been much more dramatic at all levels of the educational
system.  This trend in female education reflects a slowly accelerating change
in. the subordinate position of women in many areas of Egyptian life. This
improvement in education for the general population could result in greaLer
receptivity to future family planning efforts.
Population Strategy
11.       The Government is well aware of the seriousness of its dernographic
situation.  It has had a government-sponsored, nationwide family  planning
program since 1965. Although this program has achieved some success, a mnuch
stronger effort will be required in the years ahead if the population problerm
is to be reduced to manageable proportions.  Cultural and religious attitudes
toward family planning are generally favorable, and the Government is considiering
the measures needed to mount a stronger and more effective national family
planning program.
12.       Thus far, the strategy has been to encourage the use of con-
traceptives (mainly pills) through the network of government health services,
Government-supported "private clinics", and private pharmacies.  This network
is much better established in Egypt than in most low-income countries, and the
supply of medical and para-medical manpower is relatively good. The high
density of population in a compressed habitable area eases the problems of
reaching and servicing acceptors through these facilities. However, Egyptian
women have a strcng preference for delivering babies at home and about 95
percent of all babies are home-delivered.  The low proportion of hospital
deliveries means that there are relatively few opportunities to reach anid
educate women through post-partum programs. Therefcre, thEr means, such as hBah
clinics, home visiting programs and the like, have to be also used to reach
them, and new approaches have to be found to educate and retain them as family
planning acceptors.
Organization and Resources for Family Planning
13.       Although private efforts in family planning for Egypt da-te from
the 1950's, the official program began only in 1965 with the establishment
of the Sapreme Council for Family Planning. This Council is headed by Uhe
Prime Minister and includes eight ministers plus a number of other senior
officials. Until recently, however, the Supreme Council seldom met. Most
of its functions were delegated to its technical secretariat, the National



Fa,mily Panniacm Board (NFPB), -whlich has a stalf G of about 165 atb i t,s head-
quarters in i,aro, -n addition to those in its field offices.   Thus, the basic
organizatiCoTal stiracture for family plannLing has consisted of a relatively
indeDendent agen,y (repcrtiing uo an in'ter-ministerial committee) responsible
for program psnaring and evaluation, but dependent on the Ministry of Healthi
(and to a lesiser extent other ministries) for executi-on of its program.

for The  ef&fiacy  of the progrsm.
1$.       Egyp-t has a relatively wre!1 -deve-loped network of healtLh facil-ities
consistilg of: u-niversity and gene-ral hospitals; district hospitals; maternal
and child-care centers and neal7h clinics in cities and townis, and rural health
centers aad satellite rural health un-its in the countryside.  Thi.s network is
under the control of the MI'T.  After the revolution of 1952, ermplhasis was
given to the extension of rural units, and their number rose more than sixfold,
reaching 1 836 i n 19711. The network of clinics and health centers -- which is
not yet complete either in cities, towns or rural areas -- has been the main
instrument f or distributing contraceptives, and providing family planning inior-
mnation and services. There are also aboultD 500 "private" clinics operated by
the volurnta-y Egyptian Family Planning Association, with the help and supervision
of the linistry of Soc-ial Affairs.  .-pplnenenting this overall network are some
2000 phazrma;JLes wincla are im-portant distributors of pills and condoms, and are
estimiated to   supplY   about 25 percent of total fami` ly planning practitioners.
16.       In 1972, the  aovernmen.t anun7ced i'ts intentio.n to introduce a new
system of Integrated Health Services (Ti-is), on a tarial oa2sis, in four areas:
Qena and Dami.etta Governorates and t-woc, parts of Greater Cailro.  This pilot
system, which is expected to increase the effecti_veness of the health system
and to place greater emphasis on famil.y plar,nnirg, inc-ldes the following:
(i) general health centers (former ur:an and rural h}ealth centers are renamed
as such), where all patient-s enter the health service system in Egrpt;
(ii) polyclinics, where patients requ:iring treatme;t by specialists are referred
to from) the general health cenaters, arnd (iii) hospittals, which provide specialized.
care and attention.  Thais new EHS tystem is reflected in the physical facilities
included in tne proposed Drojectu.
17.       Despite thle rapidi expansion of healtlh facilities in recent years,
there has been nc serious ove:vall shortage of ttrained zmanoower to staff them.
The staffins of unnits in rura:l areas has been aided by a law recuiring a]l
doc-:) os to serve at least twv;o years wherever the Mintistry of H.ealth directs
them,  bus or. there are still specific shoDrtages of qualified nurses and of the
more highly-      0nurse-middives, as we11 as of teachers of these skills.
Tih}ze most urgen!t -anooer problem confronting the family planning program is
training..  Ne'c;-.cal an-d nursing: schools need l-o strengthen both their curricula
and t-heir teachim dnat,erals concer-aing demographic and family planning topics;
there is also a need for irproved in-service training in family planning for
medical personnel who have had litt,le or no such training in the medical and
nursing snc.^ooLs.



18.       The Ford Foundation, Population council, International Planned
Parenthood Federation, the Pathfinder Fund, Denmark, Sweden and UNFPA have
all made assistance available to Egypt's family planning prcgram. of these,
UNFPA has been the largest contributor. Under a frame agreement signed in
April 1971, UNFPA is prepared to make available $8.o million over a four year
period, with detailed work plans to be developed each year by consultations
between the Egyptians and various UN agencies such as UNICEF and WHO. The
efforts of other donors were reviewed during project formulation and aopraisal,
and it is eviden-L  that there is an important role for TDA to play along with
these other agencies in Egypt's family planning efforts. None of the software
activities under the project would duplicate or interfere with similar activities
which the Government is presently planning to undertake under the UNFPA Master
Agreement.
Prog7am Results and Future Requirements
19.       The Egyptian program for family planning has achieved a participation
rate of 13 to 14 percent of the eligible population (married women 15 to 44 years
old). Comparison with other countries shaws that this is a middle-zange figure
-- a respectable but not an outstanding level of achievement. The level of
acceptance is close to that of Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand and Iran, and is
more than double the rate for Turkey and triple that of Morocco. However, i-t
is far below the rates achieved (about 30 to 45 percent of eligible couples)
in Korea, Singapore or Taiwan. The Egyptian picture is less encouraging if one
looks at increases in acceptors over time. The nurnbers of new acceptors were
highest in the early years of the program, but have declined in subsequent years.
XFr example, the number of IUD insertuions was about 6000 a month in 1966/67 but
fell to about 4500 insertions monthly in 1971.
20.       The importance of reaching much larger numbers of acceptors becomes
clearer if one considers the growth in the number of married women in the fer-
tile years.  Assuming that there were about 4.2 million married women in 1966,
and that this group has been growing at 2 percent annually, then each year
around 85,000-90,000 mQre women become eligible to have babies. In order to
have held the total number of births constant during 1966-71, the equivalent
of 85,000-90,000 additional new acceptors would have had to be recruited each
year; this means about 450,000 new acceptors (after allowing for dropouts) over
the five-year period. The government program does not seem to have achieved
even half this figure, and contraceptive sales through pharmacies have not risen
enough to influence the overall result significantly. Although the data are
weak, it is almost certain that the absolute number of married couples not
practicing contraception is increasing. And this means that the number of
births is still increasing each year, even though the fertility rate may now
be falling.
21.       In sum, the most pressing need of the Egyptian family planning Drogram
is to develop effective new approaches to reach more acceptors and increase
acceptance and retention rates, and then to apply these approaches nationally.
The record of NFPB in this respect is mixed, and the sector needs a stimulus
to move ahead with new approaches to family planning. Deficiencies in training

The project is described in greater detail in the Credit and Project Summary
attached as Annex III. A report entitled "Appraisal Report of a Population
Project, Arab Republic of Egypt' (Report No.210a-UAR, dated September 28, 1973)
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Project Cost and Financing
25.       The total cost of the project, net of taxes, is estimated at about
$10.5 million. The proposed mA credit of $5.0 million would finance the
foreign exchange component, or about 47 percent of total costs. The Govern-
ment would finance the local costs of the project.
Organization and Execution
26.       The overall responsibility for project implementation will rest with
a three-men "Project Coordinating Committee," located in the MOH. It will be
headed by a Project Coordinator (a senior officer of the MOH),- who will report
directly to the Health Minister. He will have two Assistant Project Coordi-
nators. The Assistant Project Coordinator for Construction (designated by the
Ministry of Housing and Construction, which is responsible for supervising the
construction of all public health facilities in Egypt) will deal with all
matters relating to the construction of the project's physical facilities and the
procurement of equipment and furniture. The Assistant Project Coordinator for
Program Activities (appointed by the MOH) will be responsible for implementing
and monitoring studies and program activities included in the prqject. The
establishment of the Committee and the appointment of its three members, in
consultation with the Association, is a condition of credit effectiveness.
27.       The Borrower has also agreed to retain, as a condition of credit
effectiveness, a firm of consulting architects, mutually satisfactory to the
Borrower and the Association. These consultants will provide general guidance
and assistance on the planning, design and construction of the project's
physical facilities and also prepare the furniture and equipment lists. They
will also advise on the appointment of the architects and the preparation of
tender documents, besides assisting the Borrower in establishing a planned
system of maintenance for health buildings, installations and equipment.
283.      The evaluation studies and program activities will be prepared and
conducted by qualified Egyptian institutions, and where necessary, with the
assistance of experienced foreign consultants.
Procurement and Disbursements
29.       Except for contracts for civil works and furniture estimated to
cost $25,000 or less and contracts for the production of health materials and
equipment related thereto, all contracts would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA Guidelines. IDA
would be expected to finance only some $50,000 worth of such hea'lth materials
and equipment exempted from international competitive bidding. To the extent appro-
priate, bid packages would be prepared to encourage bidding from both foreign and
local firms. Contracts not subject to international bidding would be awarded on
the basis of local competitive bidding, in accordance with the procurement

improve the quality   of health services but would not expand significantly
the geographic coverage of the health delivery system in the IHS system pilot
areas. Support for the IHS system would strengthen the Government's family
planning objectives. More attention to preventive and environmental health,
conceived as one of the objectives of the IHS, should facilitate the recruitment
of new acceptors. The IHS is also expected to create a better relationship
betweeni doctors and patients, which will ensure a better follow-up of family
planning acceptors and therefore increase the retention of eligible couples
as acceptors of family planning. While the project is expected to enhance the
quality of family planning services, it is not feasible to estimate in advance,
quantitatively, the project's effects on family planning acceptance or on
fertility levels.

for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Asso-

Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.

annually, imports by 1006 percent annually.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT - POPULATION PROJECT
I. The Econoyr-/
1.        With the impetus of the First Five-Year Plan ( 1961-65), Egypt's
economic growth accelerated in -the early 190)'s to an average annual rate
of about 6 percentswhich was co-nsiderably faster than the pace of growth
in the 1950's and nearly reached  the plan target of 7 percent.   However,
the increased investment rate of the early 1960's was accompanied by
growing defense expenditure which led to serious balance of paynents
pressures by the mid-196o's.  In 1966/67, the government imposed severe
import restrictions and deflationary policies, resulting in ,egligible
growth in that financial year. The war of June 1967 compounded an already
difficult situation, and there was a substantial fall in GDP in 1967/68.
2.        In the succeeding two years, the economy recovered rapidly, but
the growth rate fell to about 4 percent annually dcuringthe past three years.
Defense has taken a progressively greater share of Egypt's resources (reaching
15 percent of CNP in 1970/71), largely at the expense of investment ex,enditure,
which has fallen to about 12 percent of GNP in recent years.   The share of
private consumption in CNP has remained at about 68 percent -- implying a
growth rate in per capita  private consumption of about 1½v percent annually.
Employment has grown slowly (by about 2 percent annually in recent years),
resulting in increased unemployment and underemployment.
3.        The heavy claims of the military on economic and human resources
have not only squeezed investment and development resources, but have also
given rise to balance of payments pressures. Although transfer receipts from
Arab countries under the Khartoum Agreement (amounting to about BE 110
million annually) have more than offset the loss of Suez Canal revenues,
a severe scarcity of foreign exchanige continues to limit both the utilization
of existing productive capacity and the implementation of new development
programs. The tight balance of payments position is highlighted by the
large amount of short-term foreign liabilities which, at the end of 1972,
exceeded extermal reserves by the equivalent of about six months imports.
Debt Service Burden
4.        Egypt's medium and long-term extenral debt outstanding at the
end of December 1972 was reported at $1.5 billion disbursed, or $1.9 billion
including undisbursed credits.   The USSR is Egypt's principal creditor,
