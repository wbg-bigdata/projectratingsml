I. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Swaziland is rich in energy resources, mainly in the form of coal as
a depletable source and in the form of hydroelectric potential as a renewable
resource. There are about 250 million tons of good quality coal (the energy
equivalent of about 100 million tons of oil) in the western lowveld regions.
All significant hydroelectric schemes are in the western plateaus, on the Great
Usutu River (Lusutfu) or its major tributaries, including the Little Usutu
(Lusushwana), and on the Komati River. The total hydroelectric potential of
the rivers is estimated at about 3,000 GWh per year (0.743 million toe/year).
Although these are Swaziland's major rivers, they rise in the Eastern Transvaal
in the Republic of South Africa (RSA).
1.02      RSA has tentative plans for large development schemes to use water
from these rivers, mainly for thermal power station cooling systems and for
industrial and domestic purposes. A series of RSA's White Papers on water
policy show that, by diversion, RSA could reduce Swaziland's total hydro-
electric potential by nearly half to about 1700 GWh per year (0.421 million
toe/year). However, it seems that RSA has so far consulted Swaziland on the
use of water resources of common interest.
1.03      Swaziland proposes to formulate its long-term water use policy
when the water resource study financed by AID and prepared by U.S. Army Corps
Engineers becomes available in 1981. The Lupohlo-Ezulwini Hydroelectric
Scheme (the proposed third power project) will be located on the Little Usutu
River, which has catchment areas in RSA that are too small for RSA's economic
use. Even though the Little Usutu River rises in South Africa, since the
major portion of the catchment is in Swaziland the project faces no signi-
ficant risk in the event use of the upstream water by RSA becomes economic in
the future. Also, since the project is non-consumptive except for evaporation
and the possibility of increased irrigation use through enhanced regulation,
no impact is foreseen on the downstream riparian Mozambique. Therefore
specific undertakings in respect of international waters are not considered
necessary.
1.04      Although Swaziland has no known petroleum deposits or natural gas,
firewood and bagasse provide other major energy resources. There are 200,000
acres of indigenous forest in the north-western and central-western highveld
areas. Three sugar factories produce about 280,000 tons/year of bagasse (about
0.0506 million toe/year) as a by-product of refining sugarcane, and use much
of it as a fuel for steam and power production to meet power demands from
factories and irrigation pumping. The production of power alcohol (ethanol)
from molasses is being studied at one of the three sugar factories.
1.05      The Government's energy consultants (Fichtner, Ottogo:Ld and
Electrowatt of Federal Republic of Germany (FRG)), are preparing an optimized
Energy Master Plan to meet the future energy demand. The plan, expected to be
completed in 1981, will include the development of hydroelectric power, coal,
bagasse and other energy resources. It will also review the possibility of
substituting other fuels for petroleum and also of refining oils in Swaziland
for domestic use. The Government expects this study to form the basis of its
energy policy.

Energy Demand and Supply
1.06      Total energy consumption of Swaziland in 1979 was about 366,400
toe, or 0.672 toe per capita, among the highest in the Eastern Africa Region,
as defined by the Bank. This is mainly attributable to the relatively high
industrial consumption compared to Swaziland's small population, which is
550,000. Energy consumption 1/ per capita in other East African countries
is, for example: Kenya 0.024 toe, Madagascar 0.026 toe, Mauritius 0.305 toe,
Sudan 0.027 toe. A general breakdown of Swaziland's consumption is as follows:

a/   Conversions to toe are made on the basis of the following rates:
toe 1.0 = tce 1.5 (ton of coal equivalent); toe 1.0 = 4038 kWh (on the
basis of a 33% thermal efficiency).
b/   Electricity is generated from hydro and diesel stations and steam plants,
using coal, firewood and bagasse. Electricity, 109.4 thousand toe,
also includes 25.7 thousand toe (104 GWh) imported from RSA.
c/   25,000 tons of imported coal (35 GWh) forms 8.7 thousand toe included
in the 109.4 thousand toe of electricity and is therefore excluded
from the 71.8 thousand toe of coal.
d/   Fired by Usutu Wood Pulp Co. in their lignin burning plant.
e/   Made up of:  2 million liters of liquified petroleum gas; 1 million
liters of avgas and jet fuel; 3 million liters of luboil; 41 million
liters of motor spirit, and 44 million liters of diesel oil and kerosene
(mainly for transportation, household cooking and lighting).
f/   Industrial use for steam production only.  See bL above for the balance.
g/   Mainly wood, dung and charcoal consumption in rural areas.

1.07      Swaziland has a hydroelectric potential of about 3,000 GWh per year,
of which 140 GWh per year are being used. The proposed project will provide a
further 95 GWh per year.
1.08      Swaziland-s coal production is about 145,000 tons per annum, and
feasibility studies are underway for the development of two additional mines.
The mines are expected to produce coal for export as well as replacing coal
imports from RSA, which in 1980 were about 30,000 tons per annula. Swaziland
has no oil refinery. It imports all its oil and petroleum products through
RSA and Mozambique.
Energy Pricing and Tariffs
1.09      The Government of Swaziland regulates fuel prices, but the Swaziland
Electricity Board (SEB) is empowered to set electricity tariffs. Prices of
important fuels used and of electricity in Swaziland are shown below:

Average price of electricity                                    30.5      35.4
(MWh)
Firewood, kerosene and electricity are the most commonly used sources of
energy in Swaziland households. Electricity is used for lighting and water
heating, other fuels for cooking and also water heating. The effect of
different pricing policies on energy consumption and the possible need to
change the tariff structure to a more cost effective basis will form part
of the proposed tariff study (para. 4.06).
Power Sector
1.10      The total electricity energy consumption of the country in 1979
was about 442 GWh, which corresponds to a per capita energy use of about 850
kWh/yr, and is among the highest in the Eastern Africa Region. For example,
electricity consumption per capita in other East African countries is as
follows: Kenya, 90 kWh; Madagascar, 43 kWh; Mauritius, 417 kWh; and Sudan,
49 kWh. SEB generates about 26%, but supplies about 67% of the electricity
consumed in Swaziland (including RSA imports). Power is also generated by
private companies to meet their own requirements, such as the operation of
sugar and wood pulp mills. Swaziland-s electricity generation and installed
capacity in 1978 and 1979 are given in Annex 1.



-4-
1.11      Between 1975 and 1980, SEB's energy sales increased from 126 GWh
to 276 GWh, which corresponds to an average increase of about 17% per annum.
Increasing industrial loads have caused a very high rate of growth in SEB's
sales since it started operations in 1963. Between 1975 and 1980 the average
annual increase in SEB-s industrial sales was 17.6%. SEB has not made any
additions to its generating capacity since 1973, but instead has met increased
demand by importing from RSA. During 1980, 188 GWh were imported compared to
117 GWh generated by SEB.
Existing Facilities of the Swaziland Electricity Board
1.12      The SEB system (map IBRD 15243) comprises the Board's three hydro-
electric stations, a diesel generating plant, and two 132-kV links, with a
capacity of about 67 MW, for importation of power from RSA's Electricity
Supply Commission (ESCOM) and transmission and distribution facilities. SEB's
total generating capacity is about 30 MW, of which 21 MW is hydro and 9 MW
diesel, as shown below:

1.13      Although almost all private power plants (para. 1.10) are connected
to SEB-s system, most operate independently except for seasonal start-ups
during maintenance periods. The bagasse (para. 1.04) is insufficient to
produce any surplus energy for sale to SEB. At present, the use of coal for
power production by private plants is not an economic alternative to supply
from SEB because of the small plant sizes involved.
1.14      At present, the 66-kV transmission network covers almost the entire
country and is also connected to ESCOM's system by the 132-kV power links.
SEB's distribution voltages are 11 kV, 6 kV and 400 volts. It is a well-
designed and effective network. System frequency is 50 Hz.



-5-
1.15      SEB's control center (for load dispatching and switching), which is
located in Mbabane near its headquarters, communicates with its power plants
and almost all major substations and ESCOM by radio and power-l:Lne carrier. 1/
It controls almost all important circuit breakers on the network by the
radio/remote control system. Furthermore, SEB's power network has an effi-
cient load control system, which reduces loads automatically during system
disturbances. The control center uses diesel sets during peak hours to
keep ESCOM demand charges at the most economic level.
1.16      Statistical data on SEB's network are:

1.17      SEB's existing transmission system has sufficient capacity to
carry the additional electricity to be generated by the project. However,
SEB-s consultants have recommended minor additional transmission facilities
which would improve the reactive load flow control and will reduce system
losses. These facilities are included in SEB's general system development
and are not included in the project.
Access to Service and Electrification of Rural Areas
1.18      The Government has given high priority to industrial and urban
electrification for many years. About 14% of the population, totalling about
77,000, is supplied with electricity by SEB. This is one of the highest
percentages in the Eastern Africa Region.
1.19      Neither Government nor SEB has any special rural electrification
policy. To date, nearly all electricity supplies to the rural population,
which is widely dispersed, have been to community services such as schools,
1/   Telephone system which works through the transmission lines.



- 6 -
hospitals, churches, water supply systems, post offices, police stations and
to workshops and community centers of rural development schemes. In all
cases, SEB expects the capital cost of connections to be recovered in two
years from revenues for the sale of electricity to the consumers. In cases
where SEB estimates revenue to be inadequate, a bank guarantee of revenue is
required before a project is started.
II. THE BORROWER AND EXECUTING AGENCY
Lending Arrangements and Previous Loans
2.01       The Swaziland Electricity Board (SEB) would be the borrower and
executing agency. The proposed loan would be the third Bank loan to SEB.
The first of these loans (338-SW) for US$4.2 million was made in 1963
to help finance the foreign exchange costs of a 10-MW hydroelectric plant at
Edwaleni. This was followed by a second loan (492-SW) for US$2.75 million
in 1967 to help finance a 6.5 MW hydroelectric plant at Magaduza, a 5-MW
diesel station at Ezulwini and expansion of Edwaleni hydroelectric plant by
5 MW. Both projects included transmission and distribution extensions. The
projects were completed within the time and cost estimated at appraisal, and
SEB's administrative and technical performance was satisfactory.
Organization
2.02       SEB, a government-owned corporate body operating throughout
Swaziland, was established under the Electricity Act in 1963. SEB's main
functions are to generate, transmit, distribute and supply electricity and,
except under the authority of a license by SEB, no other body is empowered
to carry out these functions.
2.03       The Board consists of a chairman and not less than three or more
than five other members appointed by the Minister of Works, Power and Com-
munications. Subject to the general directions of the Minister, the Board
is given considerable autonomy under the Act to conduct its business along
commercial lines. SEB's chairman is a leading businessman in Swaziland.
The Board approves all matters involving financial, staffing and other policy
issues. The Board also approves tariff changes. The General Manager (who is
also Chief Executive Officer) is given considerable freedom to carry out
day-to-day operations within prescribed policies, and his recommendations on
policy matters have an important influence on the Board decisions.
Management and Staffing
2.04       SEB's General Manager has occupied the position for several years
and is an effective manager. He is supported by competent and experienced
persons in the senior management positions, most of whom have been with SEB



- 7 -
for many years. The covenant under Section 2.11 of Loan 492-SW requires the
agreement of the Bank prior to making any new appointment to the position of
General Manager. It was agreed during negotiations that this covenant would
be repeated for the proposed project. It was also agreed that Government would
obtain the consent of the Bank before making any new appointment to the
position of Chairman of the Board.
2.05      SEB's staff totalled about 360 in 1980 and, apart from additions
to meet increasing work requirements, has remained stable. The staff includes
8 professional engineers, including the Deputy General Manager. SEB's manage-
ment performance has been good.  Accounting, plant operation and maintenance,
procurement and personnel activities have been carried out effectively.
2.06      SEB's organizational structure is given in Annex 2.  The allocation
of responsibilities among senior staff has developed on an ad hoc basis.
Senior staff are individually involved in a number of activities such as
planning, construction, procurement and administration. This informal arrange-
ment has worked well in the past. However, as the size of SEB's activities
increases, SEB in consultation with the Bank will review the continuing adequacy
of its organization to meet current needs and will make changes if necessary.
Accounting and Auditing
2.07      SEB's financial management is of a good standard.  Accounting
records are well maintained, expenditures carefully planned, recorded and
monitored, and close attention given to planning future cash needs. The
General Manager is a qualified accountant with many years of practical
experience and the accounting staff, most of whom have substantial practical
experience, are competent.
2.08      SEB's accounts are audited by a well-established, reputable firm of
external auditors. The audit covenant under Loan 492-SW, which requires SEB
to have its financial statements audited by independent accountants acceptable
to the Bank and to submit its audited financial statements to the Bank within
four months after the close of SEB's fiscal year, has been met. It was
agreed at negotiations that a similar covenant would be included under the
proposed loan.
Billing and Collection
2.09      SEB's accounting records are maintained manually with the exception
of accounts receivable and billings. Billings for about 10,000 consumer
accounts are processed through a computer bureau which produces related
statistical information. The system works well and collection performance is
satisfactory. Although Government departments meet their obligations, some



-8-
are slow payers. Accounts receivable at March 31, 1980 were equal to about
70 days sales, and it is expected that this level, which is reasonably satis-
factory, can be maintained or even reduced in the future.
Insurance
2.10       SEB maintains a comprehensive insurance program with a private
insurance company which is reviewed annually with the insurers and is satis-
factory for third party coverage. The project would carry no unusual risks.
Manpower Development and Localization
2.11      SEB places much emphasis on manpower development, and it has been
successful in training Swazi nationals to occupy most of the professional
and technical positions which in the 1960s were staffed almost entirely by
expatriates. In 1980 only six out of 16 of SEB's senior management positions
(including the top management group) are occupied by expatriates, and it is
expected that this number will be reduced by the further development of
qualified Swazi staff through training and experience.
2.12       SEB commenced its training efforts in the 1960s.  It administers
fellowship-training programs for professional and technical personnel at
universities, colleges and technical institutions, and personnel have been
trained in the UK, USA and RSA. Many technicians participated in a special
training program for SEB personnel at the Swaziland College of Technology. In
addition to other staff development efforts, SEB training officers and senior
staff conduct introductory courses for new staff as well as a number of short
courses for technical staff. Almost all professional SEB staff have benefited
from some of the above training opportunities.
2.13       In preparation for the operation of the project plant facilities,
SEB will select some of its experienced personnel for training by the plant
manufacturers in operating and maintenance practices; this training will
be provided for in the contracts with the suppliers.
2.14       Since 1978 when a new training officer was appointed, SEB has
enlarged and improved its existing systematic manpower development program.
The appraisal mission is satisfied that this program will continue to be
administered successfully and that adequate resources will be available
through SEB or bilateral assistance.
III. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Project Market
3.01       SEB sales more than tripled between 1970 and 1980, with an average
growth rate of about 13% per annum. Sales growth has been particularly
rapid since 1975, averaging 17% per annum due to rapid industrialization.



-9-
Energy consumption by SEB consumer groups is as follows: domestic 17%,
commercial 9%, irrigation 32%, and power and bulk (wholesale industrial,
commercial and domestic) 42%. Industrial consumption, including irrigation,
accounts for about 50% of SEB's total sales. Statistical data on SEB-s power
system are given in Annex 1.
3.02      A comprehensive load forecast study covering the period 1980-1990
was carried out in 1979 by SEB's main engineering consultants, Merz and
McLellan and Watermeyer, Legge, Piesold and Uhlmann (UK) in assc,ciation with
Coopers & Lybrand Associates Limited (UK), and was included as aL part of their
draft feasibility study for the project. It was based on historical growth
trends for domestic and small consumers and on projected individLual growth for
major consumers.
3.03      The load forecast study estimates average yearly growth from 1979
to 1982 at 16%, followed by a decline to 6% from 1982 to 1990 (Annex 3). The
projected higher load growth for initial years of the forecast is due to
relatively large additions to existing industrial consumption because of new
industrial construction, and the expansion of existing large plants (such as
a third sugar mill, the Swaziland Irrigation Scheme, and a new coal mine).
Thereafter, growth in industrial usage is expected to taper off as there are
no firm plans for other large industrial projects.
Development Program
3.04      Based on the load forecast study mentioned above, SEB"s consultants
recommended a generation development program which includes (i) the proposed
project, the Lupohlo-Ezulwini Hydroelectric Scheme, to be commissioned in
1984; and (ii) construction of a third power link between ESCOM and SEB
systems by 1985; and (iii) construction of an additional hydroelectric station
with a capacity of 8 MW by 1986.
3.05      The possible additional hydroelectric station downstresam of the
existing Magaduza Hydroelectric Station was proposed to the Bank for financing
as part of the proposed project and has been thoroughly investigated.
Although the recommended installed capacity of this scheme is 8 MW, its firm
capacity would only be about 4 MW for most of the year. Its costs would be
about US$6,600 per installed kW, compared to US$3,000 for the proposed project
and it is not economical. SEB has, therefore, decided not to include it in
its present development plans.
3.06      In 1985, SEB-s total firm capacity (including the proposed project
and the proposed third ESCOM link) will increase to about 110 MW, which will
be sufficient to meet the expected system maximum demand of about 90 MW with
reasonable system reserves until 1990 (Annex 4). SEB will probably construct
another power link with ESCOM after 1991 to meet growing demand, and will
study the feasibility of using indigenous resources, such as coal and hydro,
for its future long-term power generation plans.



- 10 -
3.07      The consultants have also carried out studies to evaluate the
future performance of SEB's 132-kV and 66-kV systems and have recommended
reinforcement of the 66-kV systems in the north-east (including Simunye,
Mhlume and the Big Bend areas). These reinforcements are included in SEB's
transmission construction program.
Project Objectives
3.08      The project objectives are:  (a) the provision of additional power
generating capacity to help meet the power demand up to 1990 (average produc-
tion 94 GWh per year; firm production 54 GWh per year); (b) the development
of an indigenous renewable energy resource; and (c) the reduction of depen-
dency on RSA for power. The project will also help to improve SEB's pricing
policies through a tariff study (para. 4.06).
Project Description
3.09      The project consists of the following elements:
(a)  a rockfill dam at Lupohlo, about 40 m in height and
400 m in length, to provide an 3effective reservoir
capacity of about 20 million m on the Little Ulutu
river, and an average river flow of about 3.5 m /sec;
(b) a tunnel and penstock system consisting of an unlined
low-pressure power tunnel 4.4 km long, leading to a
surge chamber and thence to a vertical shaft; a 600-m
long steel-lined tunnel and a surface penstock system
providing a head of about 250 m between the Lupohlo
site and the powerhouse at Ezulwini;
(c) a powerhouse with two 10-MW pelton turbine-generator
hydroelectric units at Ezulwini, with a short tailrace
channel to the Mwutshini river, which joins the Little
Usutu river near Mbabane; a 66-kV switchyard adjacent
to the power station; and
(d)  consultants  services for bid evaluation, construction
supervision (para. 3.17), a tariff study (para. 4.06),
health and ecological studies (para. 3.28); and a panel
of experts to advise on civil works (para. 3.18).
3.10      The dam is to be constructed about 3 km downstream from the road
bridge which links Mbabane and Mhlambanyati. The site selection was based on
an optimization study which considered the most favorable ground conditions,
together with the required reservoir capacity. The transfer of water from
the reservoir at Lupohlo to the power station will be made through an unlined,



- 11 -
low-pressure tunnel system passing under Lupohlo mountain. The surge chamber
will be located at the junction of the low-pressure tunnel and the high-
pressure system, which will consist of the shaft, steel-lined tunnel and the
penstock. The Ezulwini power station will be located about 5 km south of
Mbabane along the main road to Manzini on the Mwutshini river at a point of
about 1 km upstream of its confluence with the Mbabane river. A more detailed
description of the project is given in Annex 5.
Cost Estimates
3.11      The estimated project cost, without interest during construction,
is E 42.01 million (US$52.52 million), of which about 69% amounting to
E 28.84 million (US$36.06 million) are foreign exchange costs. The local
costs include allowances for import duties and taxes. These total about
E 0.50 million (US$0.63 million) or about 1% of the total financiing require-
ment. The cost estimates (Annex 6) are summarized below:

3.12       The cost estimates are based on contractors  offers for recent
similar civil, mechanical and electrical works. The base costs are expressed
in January 1, 1981 prices. SEB engaged two additional consultants, the first
to re-evaluate the geological investigations and design (Woodward Clyde, USA)
and the second to re-evaluate estimated costs (Farrow Lane, RSA). During the
appraisal mission, the project costs were revised to take into account the
consultants' recommendations. Physical contingencies for different project
components, ranging from 8% to 16% for civil works and 7% to 10% for equipment
and 10% for engineering services, have been added. The cost estimates are
based on the price escalation shown in the following table:
Calendar Year             1981    1982    1983-85
Local (%)                 12.5    11.0        10.0
Foreign (%)                9.0      8.0        7.0
3.13       The risk of cost overruns has been minimized by obtaining bids for
the main civil works contracts prior to finalizing the cost estimates.
Project Financing
3.14       The proposed Bank loan of US$10 million equivalent would be used
to help finance the foreign exchange costs of the civil works and related
engineering services, health and ecological studies and the services of a
panel of experts to advise on civil works (para. 3.18). The Bank loan would
cover about 23% of the estimated foreign exchange requirements and 16% of the
total project financing requirements.
3.15       The following table shows the financing sources and the allocation
to specific goods and services:

The European Investment Bank (EIB) funds of US$8.8 million equivalent would
be used to help finance the local costs of the dam, tunnel and powerhouse and
related engineering services, the African Development Bank (AfDB) funds of
US$8.2 million to help finance the foreign costs of generators, turbines,
valves and crane, and resettlement costs, and Kreditanstalt fur lWeideraufbau
(KfW) funds of US$8.1 million would finance the foreign and part of the local
costs of electrical and mechanical plant and engineering services for all
electrical and mechanical work. The Commonwealth Development Corporation
(CDC) funds of US$7.6 million equivalent would be available to help meet
project financing requirements not met by other sources.
1/   Project parts are identified in Annex 6.
2/   Excluding resettlement costs.



- 14 -
3.16      External finance would cover about 72% of the project's financing
requirements (including total foreign exchange costs estimated at 69% of those
requirements). US$6.2 million from the Swaziland National Provident Fund
(SNPF), US$2.5 million from Government and the remainder from SEB's internal
cash generation would complete the financing. In the case of AfDB and KfW,
finance will be provided to Government and passed to SEB under onlending
arrangements. As a condition of the effectiveness of the Bank loan, all
conditions of effectiveness of the AfDB, CDC, EIB, KfW and SNPF loans should
be met.
Engineering, Consultants Services and Project Implementation
3.17      SEB would be responsible for implementation, assisted by engineering
consultants, who were also responsible for preparing the feasibility study
(para. 3.02). SEB is to enter into a separate contract with these consultants
to cover the preparation of bid documents, the evaluation of bids and construc-
tion supervision. The cost of the consultants' services is estimated at
US$4.2 million. The average man-month cost (including about 800 man-months
of salary, international travel and subsistence) is estimated at US$6,600.
Additional consultants' services for health and ecological studies are esti-
mated to cost US$0.2 million. The estimated average man-month costs for these
services is US$5,700. It was agreed during negotiations that SEB would employ
engineering consultants to supervise project construction whose qualifications,
experience and terms and conditions of employment are satisfactory to the Bank.
3.18      SEB staff have some experience in the construction of transmission
and distribution facilities as well as hydroelectric projects. SEB will set
up a constru'ction supervision unit consisting of a project manager, engineers
and technicians. A panel of experts would be appointed to review the engineer-
ing design and revisions to the detailed engineering design and to review
progress of construction from time to time. Among other things the panel will
advise on foundation treatment, extent of excavation, grouting and concreting
programs, composition of the fill, and support to the tunnel during its
excavation. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that SEB would
submit to the Bank a detailed dam inspection program including the nature,
frequency and monitoring procedures for the inspection of hydroelectric works
and dams to ensure that the works will be inspected regularly in accordance
with sound engineering practice. The panel would consist of an engineering
geologist and two civil engineers specializing in dam construction and under-
ground excavation. The estimated total cost of the panel's services would be
US$0.42 million with an average man-month cost of US$12,700. These man-month
costs reflect the high calibre of experts required for a panel of this nature.
During negotiations it was agreed that SEB will appoint a panel of experts
whose qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment are
satisfactory to the Bank. SEB plans to appoint the panel by August 1, 1981.
Terms of reference were agreed with SEB during negotiations.
3.19      Project design was completed in May 1980.  Bid documents were issued
in January 1981 and bid closing was in April 1981. Construction is expected
to begin in October 1981, and to be completed by March 1984 (Annex 7).



- 15 -
Procurement
3.20      Contracts of US$100,000 equivalent or more for civil works financed
from the proposed Bank and EIB loans would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB) consistent with the guidelines for procure-
ment under World Bank loans and IDA credits. Contracts for whiclh ICB is not
required may be awarded in accordance with local procedures which have been
reviewed and are acceptable to the Bank. Total expenditures under such
procedures would not exceed US$500,000. All major materials and equipment
would be imported as there are no local manufacturers or contractWors in these
specialized fields.
3.21      Contracts to be financed by other co-lenders will be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding, but AfDB procurement procedures
exclude RSA. Bid documents were issued in January 1981 for the major civil
works items and for mechanical equipment related to dam construction.
Disbursement
3.22      Bank funds would be disbursed against: (a) 26% of the total costs
of civil works for construction of the dam, tunnel and power house and related
engineering services and (b) 40% of the total costs of consultants' services
for health and ecological investigations relating to the project, and of a
panel of experts to advise on civil works.
3.23      If any of the Bank funds remain undisbursed after project completion,
they would be cancelled. The proposed closing date would be March 31, 1985,
about one year after the expected project completion date. A disbursement
schedule is given in Annex 8.
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
3.24      During negotiations the reports and records necessary to monitor
progress of the project and its evaluation on completion were agreed upon.
Proposed guidelines for a project monitoring system are given in Annex 9. It
was agreed during negotiations that, within one year of the project completion,
SEB will submit a completion report to the Bank, based on an outline to be
agreed with the Bank.
Environment
3.25      As part of the feasibility study SEB-s consultants con,ducted a
review which showed that the impact of the project on the environment will
be insignificant as the reservoir would be relatively small. The surface
area of the lake at maximum and minimum supply levels will be 1.8 km2
and 0.5 km2.



- 16 -
3.26      About 300 people in the reservoir area would be resettled and
crops and forests in the same area would be inundated. Environmental effects
on the Mlilwane game park, which is close to the Lupohlo reservoir, would be
minor. The following measures would be taken in relation to these environ-
mental and social factors:
(a) resettlement of residents, land acquisition, and bush clearing
in the reservoir area;
(b)  a forestry survey to assess exploitable timber potential
and siltation in the reservoir area;
(c)  an ecology survey covering present and future fish life and
to identify measures to avoid any possible effects on health
arising from water diversion; 1/
3.27      SEB has assessed the timber potential at the reservoir site working
closely with the Forestry and Agricultural Departments. SEB would be respon-
sible for resettlement of the people in the reservoir area. Government
permission for land rights for the project and for resettlement plans has been
obtained and various options discussed with individual property owners and the
local chiefs. Progress on this only awaits approval of the project. The
National Trust Commission and Government would be responsible for the imple-
mentation of (c) and (d) above. The National Trust Commission would also
assess the fish potential and tourism value of the proposed lake. The con-
sultants' report (para 3.02) recommended a coordination committee be estab-
lished consisting of SEB and concerned government agencies. This would help
ensure integrated develoDment, optimum reservoir utilization and appropriate
conservation measures.
3.28      It was agreed during negotiations:  (a) that by June 30, 1982
SEB would complete a study of the human health and disease implications of the
project and, based on an exchange of views with the Bank, promptly take all
necessary measures to implement the appropriate recommendations of the study;
and (b) that Government would carry out a study of the ecological implications
of the project on the Lusushwana/Usutu River basin and promptly thereafter
exchange views on the results thereof with SEB and the Bank.
1/   While Bilharzia is endemic in still waters in Swaziland it is felt that
this can be controlled by periodically lowering the reservoirs- water
level to prevent the hatching of snail eggs. This method will be
examined in the health and ecological study.

IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Financial Results
4.01      The results of SEB's FY1976-1980 financial performance are summar-
ized below. Except for FY1980 SEB has more than met its principal financial
objective of achieving an annual 9% rate of return on the average net fixed
assets at historical costs in operation under Loan 492-SW. As a consequence
of tariff increases (para. 4.03) the rate of return for FY1981 should be
about 13%. Between FY1976 and 1980 SEB financed about 65% of its investment
requirements, which totalled E 9.2 million (US$12 million), froma internal cash
generation.

Tariffs
4.03      One of SEB's principal financial objectives has been to earn an
annual rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation at historical
cost of at least the minimum 9% level required under Loan 492-SW. To achieve
this objective, tariffs were increased from January 1, 1980 and this raised
average revenues per kilowatt hour sold by about 13%. In 1978 and 1979
tariffs had been increased by 10% and 13%. These were the only tariff in-
creases over the last ten years, a period when consumer prices increased by
at least 120%.
4.04      It was agreed during negotiations that SEB would contribute not less
than E 20 million (US$25 million) from internal cash generation towards its
capital spending, including the proposed project, during the 1981-1985 project
disbursement period. This would be close to SEB's capital requirements, not
provided by loans, based on present capital spending estimates. It was also
agreed during negotiations that SEB would annually review the adequacy of its
tariffs for meeting the E 20 million (US$25 million) cash generation objective
on the basis of forecasts prepared in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
As a first step towards meeting this objective SEB made a 15% tariff increase
on February 1, 1981 and plans to follow this with further tariff increases of
12% on January 1, 1982 and January 1, 1983, after which two 6% annual tariff
increases are estimated to be required during the project disbursement period.



- 19 -
4.05      Notwithstanding the above it was agreed at negotiations that, to
ensure that SEB earns a reasonable rate of return on capital employed, it
would earn a minimum annual rate of return on net revalued net fixed assets of
not less than 7% in FY1982 and not less than 8% in FY1983 and thereafter. The
following table indicates the estimated annual nominal tariff levels and
increases that would be required if adjustments were made annually to meet the
minimum 8% rate of return requirement from FY1986 to FY1990.

Annual nominal tariff increase (%)           13        7       6        7      10
The above rate of return covenant would replace Section 2.07 of Loan 492-SW
under which SEB is to set its revenues at a level sufficient to cover operating
expenses, interest, repayments on long term indebtedness or depreciation
(whichever is greater) and reasonable allocations to reserve, and would
replace the Supplementary Agreement requiring SEB to earn an annual 9% rate
of return on average net fixed assets at historical cost.
4.06      Although some minor changes have been made in SEB-s tariff struc-
ture over the last few years, a systematic review of the econom:ic and social
aspects of SEB's tariffs should now be made. It is expected that changes will
be required which will bring the tariff more into line with long run marginal
supply costs to different types of consumers and take into account time-of-day
consumption. During negotiations it was agreed that SEB will employ consultants
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank to complete a tariff study by
June 30, 1982 and that, after consultation with the Bank, SEB will promptly
implement such tariff changes as are considered necessary.

Revaluation of Assets
4.09      SEB s consultants have revalued its fixed assets to reflect current
values by using the wholesale machinery and transport index published in
RSA, which they recommended as most appropriate for SEB's purposes. This is
acceptable and at negotiations it was agreed that, for the purpose of the rate
of return covenant (para 4.04), fixed assets will be valued at March 31, 1980
at a replacement cost of E 44.22 million less accumulated depreciation of
E 14.78 million. It was also agreed at negotiations that fixed assets would
be annually revalued using the same index or such other method als is accept-
able to Government and the Bank.
Future Operations and Financial Position
4.10      Projected income, balance sheet and cash flow statements for
FY1981 to FY1990 together with notes on assumptions, are shown iLn Annexes
10 to 13. The statements indicate that SEB's financial performance would be
satisfactory. Between FY1981 and FY1990, electricity sales are forecast to
increase at an average annual rate of 6% from 305 million kilowatt hours in
FY1981 to 526 million kilowatt hours in FY1990. Revenues would increase by
about 4 times during this period, while expenses (including depreciation)
would increase by 3 times. The increase in expenses assumes that inflation
would about double during this period. SEB would be able to contribute an
increasing proportion of its revenues towards capital spending. SEB is
expected to be well able to meet its current obligations throughout the
1981-85 project disbursement period and has regular access to bank overdraft
facilities should they be required. Present facilities are for E 1 million.



- 22 -
4.11      Section 2.06 of Loan 492-SW included a provision limiting SEB-s
borrowings without the Bank's agreement to outstanding amounts which did not
exceed the equivalent of Rand 400,000. SEBEs financial management has been
of a high standard, and such strict conditions relating to future indebtedness
are no longer necessary. The foregoing covenant should be rescinded. Instead
it was agreed at negotiations that SEB will not incur future long-term debt
without the Bank's consent, unless net income before interest and depreciation
is at least 1.5 times future debt service, including proposed new borrowings.
V. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Need for Additional Generating Capacity
5.01      In a report on SEB's generating capacity 1/, the consultants clearly
demonstrated that SEB should increase its capacity by 1984 to meet demand
growth (para. 3.03). Taking into account variations in SEB's generating
capacity because of seasonal water flow changes, SEB's firm supply capacity
(including existing ESCOM links) would be about 73 MW in 1984 compared to the
estimated maximum system demand of 86 MW.
Alternative Expansion Programs, Least-Cost Solution and Optimization
5.02      In considering SEB's generation requirements up to the year 2000,
the consultants investigated a number of alternative optimization programs
combining various power generation and fuel sources using diesel, coal, oil
and hydroelectricity taking into account various plant and reservoir sizes.
Given the highly seasonal system load characteristic and that the ESCOM
tariff is largely a capacity-charge tariff, SEB's main consultants (Merz and
McLellan) and also independent consultants (EPDC) employed by the Government
carried out comprehensive optimization studies to determine the most economic
unit size and total power plant capacity. Their studies showed that, using
indigenous resources, the least-cost solution for meeting SEB's long-term
power requirements would be the proposed project.
5.03      The consultants also considered importing more power from RSA
(ESCOM) as an alternative to local generation. The equalizing discount rate
between proceeding with the project and the ESCOM alternative is 9%, which
represents the approximate opportunity cost of capital in Swaziland. This
estimate does not take into account the possibilities of real increases in
South African coal prices which would cause ESCOM to increase its electricity
tariffs and would further justify the proposed project. The equalizing dis-
count rate will increase to 10% if ESCOM increases its tariff in real terms

association with Watermeyer, Legge, Piesold & Uhlmann, and Coopers &
Lybrand Associates Ltd.) 1978.



- 23 -
by about 2% per year during the next five years. This is well below the
real increases which were about 8% per year over the last 4 years. Moreover,
Swaziland would benefit from the development of indigenous renewable resources
as well as from reduced dependence on RSA. Therefore, the project is ade-
quately justified. A description and economic analysis of the alternative
development program is given in Annex 14.
Rate of Return
5.04      The return on the project, which is taken to be the discount rate
at which the present value of all capital and operating costs (excluding
interest during construction and taxes) equals the present value of all
revenues and benefits (using the current average tariff level of E3.46 cents
per kWh) associated with the project over its lifetime, is 12%. The rate of
return would drop to about 11%, if costs were 10% higher than estimated or if
expected revenues were 10% lower. If both these events occurred the rate of
return would be 9%. The present value calculations are given in Annex 14.
Project Risks
5.05      No major risks to the project are foreseen.  However, since the
long-term availability of water for the operation of the hydroelectric plant
is essential to the project, it was agreed during negotiations that the
covenant under section 5.08 of Loan 492-SW would be extended to provide
that, except as the Bank and the Borrower shall otherwise agree, Government
will not permit any abstraction of water from the Little Usutu River or its
tributaries that would reduce the potential generating output of the Ezulwini
Hydroelectric Station, and will permit SEB to divert water from the Little
Usutu River in such amounts as may be necessary for the operation of the
proposed project.
VI.  SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached that SEB:
(a)  would obtain Bank approval before making an appointment
to the position of General Manager (para. 2.04);
(b)  would continue to have its financial statements audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and would submit
its audited financial statements to the Bank within four
months after the close of its fiscal year (para. 2.08);
(c)  would employ engineering consultants to supervise project
construction (para. 3.17);
(d)  would ensure that the project construction works, including
the dam, be inspected regularly in accordance with sound
engineering practices and would inform the Bank about the
nature, frequency and monitoring procedures for their
inspection (para. 3.18);



- 24 -
(e) would appoint a panel of experts (para. 3.18);
(f) would submit a report to the Bank on the project within
one year of project completion (para. 3.24);
(g) would complete, by June 30, 1982, health and ecological
studies satisfactory to the Bank and would promptly impleme)
such recommendations as are considered necessary (para. 3.2,8);
(h) would contribute E 20 million (US$25 million) towards its
FY1981 to FY1985 capital spending from internal cash genera-
tion and would annually review the adequacy of its tariffs for
meeting this objective (para 4.04);
(i) would maintain its tariffs at a level sufficient to earn
an annual rate of return on average net revalued fixed
assets of not less than 7% in FY1982, and 8% thereafter
(para. 4.05);
(j) would employ consultants to complete a tariff study by
June 30, 1982 and would promptly implement such tariff
changes as are considered necessary (para. 4.06);
(k) would revalue its fixed assets annually on the basis of
an index acceptable to the Bank, and, for the purpose of
the rate of return covenant, the gross value of fixed
assets at March 31, 1980 shall be E44.22 million less
accumulated depreciation E14.78 million (para. 4.09);
(1) would not incur long-term debt without the Bank's consent,
unless future debt service is covered at least 1.5 times
by internal cash generation (para. 4.11).
6.02      During negotiations it was agreed that Government:
(a) would obtain the consent of the Bank before making new appoint-
ments to the position of Chairman of SEB (para. 2.04);
(b) carry out a study of the ecological implications
of the project (para. 3.28); and
(c) would not permit water abstractions that would reduce the
potential generating output of the project (para. 5.05).
6.03      As a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan, all conditions
of effectiveness of the AfDB, CDC, EIB, KfW and SNPF loans should be met
(para. 3.16).
6.04      With the above agreements the project would be suitable for a Bank
loan of US$10 million equivalent, available to the Swaziland Electricity
Board over 20 years, including a 3-year grace period.

THIRD POWER PROJECT
Project Description
Project Area
1.        The project area is shown on the map (IBRD 15243).  A summarized
project description is given in Chapter III. A fuller description of major
components is given below, with a summary of important hydrogeological
features.
Hydrology
2.        Hydrology and reservoir operation studies are based on the 47-year
record of simulated monthly hydrological data developed by the Hydrological
Research Unit (HRU) of the University of Witwatersrand of RSA. Extensive
topographical and geological studies have been carried out by SEB's consul-
tants. The location, type and principal dimension of all the major project
components were based on various optimization studies. Principal field
investigations and drilling for detailed construction methods and schedules
have been finalized.
3.        Average monthly outputs of the project are as follows:
Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   June  July  Aug   Sept  Oct   Nov   Dec
Power (MW)    20    20    20    20    20    20    20    10 1/ 10 1/ 20    20    20
Energy (GWh)  10.97 11.03 11.10  8.94  7.37  6.11  5.78  5.25  5.01  5.95  6.80  9.01
Total Production: 93.32 GWh per annum (54 Gwh per annum with 95%
reliability)
1/   One of the two 10-MW units will be out of service for the programmed
yearly maintenance.
Dam
4.        The embankment will be of the rockfill type, utilizing fine material
to form an impervious core. The rock excavated from the spillway channels
will be used for the embankment. The foundation of the dam, including a
colluvial fan at the left bank, will be stripped to expose the unweathered,
fairly homogeneous granite bedrock.



- 31 -
.ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 3
5.        A spillway (without gates) situated at the left bank of the Little
Usutu River incorporating a side weir, chute and flip bucket will be partly
concrete-lined and mash reinforced throughout, and will be consiructed to
carry the peak discharge of the catastrophic flood flow (2850 m per second).
6.        Compensation water will pass through an encased, steel pipeline
situated on the left bank at an elevation just below the lowest drawdown
level of the reservoir. The flow will be regulated at the downstream end
by an outlet valve which will discharge into a dissipater situated at the
toe train of the embankment.
7.        The temporary diversion conduit located below the embaLnkment will
be closed by a concrete plug constructed at, and keyed into, the upstream end
of this conduit. The plug will be built in dry conditions by working behind
a stoplog located at the entrance to the conduit. Permanent outflow facili-
ties will be incorporated in the plug and the temporary diversion conduit
to provide a means of drawing down the reservoir during either an emergency
or inspection maintenance of the upstream face of the dam.  A pipeline3of
1.2 m in diameter would reduce the top water level of the 20 million m
reservoir by about 5 m during the course of one week.
Reservoir
8.        The reservoir created by the dam will stretch 4.8 km upstream end
will ayerage about 400 m in width. The lake surface area will be 1.8 km and
0.5 km at the maximum supply level (1016 m) and the minimum supRly level
(997 m).  The effective reservoir capacity is aout 20 million in . However,
the capacity could be increased to 40 million m , if this should prove to be
justified in the future, as the dam design permits the height of the dam to be
raised.
Intake Structure and Low Pressure Tunnel
9.        The intake to the hydraulic system will be located at a large
granite outcrop situated on the left bank of the reservoir about 800 m
upstream from the dam. The intake gate will be raised and lowered by a
double acting hydraulic system with an emergency closure device.
10.       The low pressure tunnel will extend from the intake structure
for a distance of 4,400 m passing through Lupohlo mountain to the surge
chamber situated above the Ezulwini valley. The depth of rock cover over
the tunnel will exceed 100 m for some 80 percent of the length and this, in
conjunction with the excellent overall geology, makes the construction of an
unlined tunnel practicable. The tunnel design is of horse-shoe cross-section
with a diameter equivalent to 3 m.

ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 3
Surge Chamber
11.       The surge chamber, situated just inside the boundary of the Mlilwane
game park, will be set into the hillside overlooking the Ezulwini Valley. The
chamber will be lined with reinforced concrete and will be about 35 m high.
High Pressure System
12.       The high pressure system will consist of three sections:  the first
section, located immediately below the surge chamber, will be a concrete-lined
vertical shaft; the second section, a 650 m long steel-lined tunnel; and the
third section, downstream from the steel-lined tunnel, will be a free-standing
penstock incorporating expansion joints where appropriate; it will be located
at ground level and supported on reinforced concrete piers; a single guard-
valve will be located at the portal. The penstock will fork near the power
station and the final length leading to the turbine inlet valves will be
located below the surface.
Power Station and the Switchyard
13.       The station will be sited high enough to ensure tat, even under
catastrophic flood conditions on the Mwutshini river (600 m per second), the
tailrace flow will be unaffected. The station will accommodate the two 10-MW
pelton hydroelectric generating sets on a single floor. The superstructure
will consist of a series of portal frame constructed in reinforced concrete
with infill panels to the sidewalls built of face brickwork and steel cladding.
Crane-beams and rails will be supported by the portal frames. The roof will
consist of a structural steel lattice supporting steel roof sheeting.
14.       The 66-kV switchyard will be located next to the power station and
above the catastrophic flood level of the Mwutshini river. An access road to
the power station and the switchyard will be built from the Mbabane to Manzini
road.
15.       The average production of the project will be 94 Gwh per year,
together with the diesel sets, and firm production will be about 54 Gwh per
year. The project is not designed for peaking. The load factor will be about
53% average and 30% firm.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.        In preparing the financial projections SEB's FY1980 actual financial
statements have been used as a base.
Revenues
2.        Average revenues per kWh for 1981 are based on SEB's estimates
of E 3.10 cents per kWh which will be produced from tariff increases effected
January 1, 1980 and February 1, 1981.
Operating Costs
Fuel
3.        Expenditures for fuel (which are small) are based on engineering
estimates of diesel plant utilization for peaking. Costs are assumed to
increase by 9% per annum.
ESCOM Purchases
4.        The quantity of electricity supplied is based on engineering esti-
mates. Inflation is assumed at 8% for 1982 and 7% for 1983-1990.
Employment Costs
5.        These are assumed to increase by 4% per annum in line with past
experience and in addition local inflation rates have been assumed as follows:
1981 - 12%, 1982-1984 - 11%, 1985 onwards 10%. Provision has also been made
for additional staffing.
Other
6.        Inflation is assumed at 9% for 1981, 8% for 1982 and 7% for 1983
onwards with real increases assumed on capacity additions.
Depreciation
7.        An average rate of 4% has been used.

BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS
Fixed Assets
8.        Fixed assets and related accumulated depreciation at March 31, 1980
are based on a revaluation by SEB's consultants. To maintain these assets
at current values they have been revalued annually, using estimated inflation
rates of 9% for 1981, 8% for 1982 and 7% thereafter.
9.   Accounts Receivable
Based on experience, it has been assumed that 20% of annual revenues
would be outstanding.
Inventory
10.       This consists of repair parts, poles, transformers, conductors,
insulators. These are estimated at 0.75% of gross fixed assets.
Creditors
11.       These are estimated at 15% of cash operating expenses.
Consumer Deposits
12.       These are estimated to increase at 14% per annum.

THIRD POWER PROJECT
Economic Analysis
Alternative Expansion Proposals and Least Cost Solution
1.        Selection of the next step in expanding SEB's generatiLng capacity
involves the economic analysis of different possible development strategies
which would satisfy the increasing demand in the interconnected power system
over the planning period (1981-2030). The cost streams of these different
strategies have been compared, and the development program which includes
the project as the next stage is the least cost solution among all possible
local alternatives.
2.        SEB's consultants also reviewed the possibility of importing more
power from RSA through additional 132-kV power links between the ESCOM and
SEB systems. This review included the following alternatives: expanded
supplies from ESCOM; and hydroelectric development at Lupohlo-Ezulwini,
followed by additional supplies from ESCOM. In addition the consultants
considered variants of options based on the various levels of system reserve
standards (lower reserve and higher reserve).
3.        Local development possibilities are hydro, coal (steam), diesel and
gas turbine. The first comprehensive survey of the hydroelectric potential
in Swaziland was carried out under a UNDP program in the late 1960s. About
21 potential sites for hydroelectric development were identified, including
the project. The UNDP report 1/ concluded that the most suitable site for
hydroelectric development is the project site. SEB's consultants, who also
reviewed all 21 sites, drew the same conclusion. The possibilities of using
a coal-fired thermal power plant were also studied: (a) 30-MW steam turbine
units, (b) 15-MW steam turbine units; (c) mixed development with hydroelectric
generation either followed by 15-MW thermal units or following 15-MW thermal
units or (d) followed by increased supply from ESCOM. Furthermore, the
consultants also considered options under which Swaziland would be either
completely self-sufficient in electricity supply, by terminating the existing
agreement with ESCOM and installing 30-MW thermal units, or normally self-
sufficient, by retaining the ESCOM supply for standby purposes.

Method of Comparison
4.        The alternative plans have been extended over the useful life of
the projects (about 45 years) and also to reach a point of insignificance
for the present worth factor. The discounted cash flow method was used for
the comparison and for calculating the equalizing discount rates of the
alternatives. The total costs of the programs includes capital costs, and
operations and maintenance costs but exclude interest during construction.
5.        In arriving at the net expenditures used in comparing alternatives,
the benefits to Swaziland from the South African Customs Union (SACU) agree-
ment and from the irrigation potential arising from the regulation of water
flows during the dry seasons have been deducted. SEB's consultants have
calculated that the project will increase the firm water flow of the river
by 1.7 m /sec and have estimated that this will have a minimum annual value
of E340,000 based on the present water tariffs to downstream users.  The
customs revenue benefit to Swaziland from SACU would be increased by the
application of the revenue sharing formula to the goods imported for the
project.  It is estimated that SEB will pay about E430,000 for goods imported
into the RSA customs area, and this has been included in the project cost
estimates. The SACU net benefits which are about 20% of the value of all
goods imported from RSA into Swaziland, including power, are included in the
economic analysis.  The average incremental cost of power produced by the
project is estimated at about US4J.
Diesel Engine and Gas Turbine Plant Alternatives
6.        Two 4.5-MW diesel sets are in service at the Edwaleni power station
and further diesel engine and gas turbine driven generating plant can be
commissioned in Swaziland as part of the electricity supply system. At
present, SEB operates these diesel sets for peak lopping to reduce ESCOM
bills. Simulation studies carried out by the SEB consultants have shown
that the existing diesel capacity will be adequate to meet daily system peaks
up to about 1990. The studies have also shown that the diesel station will
be more expensive than the steam plant alternative for capacity factors above
30%. A gas turbine plant (which combines low capital costs with high fuel
costs and low efficiency) is even more unfavorable due to the higher capacity
factors (estimated at about 45%) and the existence of the above diesel sets
for peak lopping and emergency use.
7.        The most probable supply options are therefore, hydro, steam plant
and importing more power from ESCOM. Discounted economic costs of the alter-
native development plans taking into account these options are given below:

(E million)
8.        Equalizing discount rates between the alternatives of ESCOM and the
hydro followed by ESCOM (the project alternative) is estimated at about 9%,
and of all other alternatives are negative. Cash flow for the two least cost
alternatives (a) ESCOM and (b) the project, followed by additional ESCOM
imports are given on pages 7 and 8 of this annex.
9.        The sensitivity of the discounted economic costs to changes in the
major variables (capital costs, local coal costs and ESCOM tariff charges)
were tested as follows:
Capital Costs
10.       Although it is unlikely that the mission's capital cost estimates
for the project would be exceeded, the effects of variation in project costs
using a 9% discount rate have been considered. The ESCOM alternative would
be 4% cheaper than the project, if the project costs increased by 15%, and
3% more expensive if the project costs decreased by 15%. Equalizing discount
rates for 15% higher and lower project capital costs are estimated at 6% and
12% respectively.
Fuel Costs
11.       It is assumed that the proposed coal-fired plant will burn local
coal with the following characteristics: moisture 7.0%, ash content 22.7%,
volatile matter 10.0%, gross calorific value 5830 kal/kg and that the price
of the coal (without taxes will be E12.5 per ton (US$16.5 per ton). The rate
of coal consumption of thermal units is estimated at 0.68 kg/kWh. Economic
costs of the petroleum fuels are considered as follows (excluding tax but
including transportation): heavy fuel oil E91 per ton (US$120 per ton) diesel
oil E 115 per ton (US$152 per ton) and jet fuel E151 per ton (US$199 per ton).
A plus or minus 50% variation in local coal cost does not affect the priority
of the alternatives.
ESCOM Tariff Charges
12.       The charges made by ESCOM under its bulk supply agreement with SEB
have three components:



- 48 -
ANNEX 14
Page 4 of 7
(i) a monthly extension charge of about E33.000 (US$43,560)
covering ESCOM's capital cost of additional transmissions
equipment which ESCOM has to provide to make supply of the
agreed capacity available, and to cover the associated costs
of operation and maintenance. The charge is equivalent to
1.3% of the capital cost per month, i.e. 15.6% per year. The
monthly extension charge is subject to a discount of R 1.0 per
kVA of maximum demand charged under (i) following:
(ii) a monthly demand charge of R 5.175 per kVA (US$6.831 per kVA)
of maximum power demand supplied i.e. an effective power
charge of R 4.175 per kVA (US$5.51 per kVA) when the R 1.0
(US$1.32 per kVA) per kVA discount on the extension charge
is deducted from the power charge. However, the total
discount cannot exceed R 33,000 (US$43,560).
(iii)  a unit charge of R 0.00855 per kWh of energy supplied by
ESCOM 1/. Using a 9% discount rate, the ESCOM alterna-
tive would be 4% cheaper than the project if ESCOM tariffs
decreased by 15%, and 3% more expensive if the ESCOM
tariffs increased by 15%. Equalizing discount rates for
15% higher and lower tariff charges are estimated at 10%
and 7% respectively.
Rate of Return
13.       The return on investment for the project is defined as the dis-
count rate at which the present worth of the estimated capital and operating
costs of the development over its life equals the present worth of revenues
attributable to it.
14.       Costs are assumed to consist of the estimated expenditures for
constructing and operating the project and for the related transmission
and distribution network extensions.
15.       Benefits attributable to the project are custom union revenues
(para. 5 above) and revenues from the energy sales and water benefits. Based
on electricity production from average annual river flows, project revenues
from electricity sales would commence in 1984 with 47 GWh (average water
year), rising to 91 GWh in 1985 and remaining constant thereafter. Pro-
duction from the project facilities would immediately replace electricity
imported from ESCOM.
16.       The project cost and benefit streams are shown at the end of this
annex. This rate of return is estimated at 12%. Shadow pricing of foreign
exchange is not necessary because the shadow rate is 1.0.
1/   The formula for the ESCOM tariff charges is:  (R33,000-Rl.O per kVA
maximum demand + (R5.75 per kVA maximum demand + 0.954 per kWh) x 0.90.
