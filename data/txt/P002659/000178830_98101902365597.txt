INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE SWAZILAND ELECTRICITY BOARD
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGOM OF SWAZILAND
FOR A THIRD POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendations on a proposed loan
to the Swaziland Electricity Board, with the guarantee of the Kingdom of
Swaziland, for the equivalent of US$10 million to help finance a Third Power
Project. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including 3 years' grace,
and an interest rate of 9.6 percent per annum. Additional External financ-
ing for the project would be provided by European Investment Bank (US$8.8
million equivalent), the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (US$8.1 million
equivalent), the African Development Bank (US$8.2 million equivalent), and the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (US$7.6 million equivalent).
Part I - The Economy
2.        Swaziland 1/ is one of Africa's smallest countries, with an area of
17,400 sq. km, and a population (1980) of about 550,000 that is growing about
2.8 percent a year. It is landlocked and bordered by the Republic of South
Africa and Mozambique.
3.        Swaziland has good development potential.  It has sizeable coal and
asbestos deposits, extensive forests, water for irrigation and' power generation
and a climate and soils suitable for diversified agricultural production. The
economy is made up of a small, capital-intensive and highly productive modern
sector that employs about a quarter of the population, but provides about 80
percent of GDP, and a traditional sector engaged mostly in subsistence
agriculture and cattle raising. The export oriented modern sector is mostly
foreign managed and includes coal and asbestos mining, plantation crops such
as sugar, citrus and pineapple, and the wood and paper industries. The
dualistic nature of the economy has limited distribution of betnefits from the
country's resources; while 1979 per capita GNP was estimated aLt US$650,
incomes in the traditional rural sector that supports half the population
probably averaged less than US$60. However, slightly over half of the rural
families receive regular remittances of about US$160 per capita per annum from
family members employed in the wage earning sector.
4.        The Swazi Government is also dual.  King Sobhuza II presides over a
modern Government, led by appointed cabinet ministers, that maLnages Swaziland's
1/   An Economic Memorandum on Swaziland (852a-SWA) was distributed to the
Executive Directors onApril 20, 1981. An agricultural sector report was
issued in December 1980. A summary of social and economic data is
included as Annex I.



economic activities and provides most public services. He also heads the
advisory Swazi National Council that has jurisdiction over traditional law and
the Swazi Nation Land which comprises 60 percent of the country. While these
lands are used by traditional farmers and herders, the King retains ownership
in trust for the Swazi people.
5.        Of the nearly one million ha of Swazi Nation Land, about 100,000
ha are used for crop production, primarily maize. The remainder is used for
grazing livestock, largely on an extensive, communal basis. Overgrazing with
progressive deterioration of ground cover and land erosion is, however, a
major problem exacerbated in recent years by low off-take rates. All together,
some 40 percent of the country's agricultural output is produced on Swazi
Nation Land, where about 70 percent of the population reside. The approxi-
mately 700,000 ha of non-Swazi Nation Land, which include 400,00 ha of pasture,
are held in some 850 individually tenured farms. These account for almost all
modern commercial agriculture in the country, although nearly 20 percent of
the land is unutilized. Raising the productivity of both traditional and
modern farming is one of the major development issues confronting Swaziland in
the 1980s.
6.        Economic growth in the early years of independence (1968) was rapid
due to rising volumes and prices of the country's main exports, a high rate
of investment in the economy's modern sector and continuous expansion of the
services sector, primarily tourism, trade and the public sector. Real
GDP (factor cost) grew at an average annual rate of about 8 percent during
the 1967/68 to 1973/74 period. In more recent years, however, the economy's
vulnerability to events on international markets and in South Africa has
manifested itself in a marked slowdown in economic growth. Tumbling world
market prices for wood pulp and sugar sharply reduced export earnings and
discouraged investment in these industries. At the same time, Swaziland's
iron ore reserves became depleted further reducing exports, and the tourism
sector suffered from the recession in South Africa. The slowdown in South
Africa's economy also accounted for a marked reduction in private investment
in Swaziland. Livestock production has stagnated over the past several years,
as efforts to raise off-take rates were unsuccessful, and low import prices
for maize discouraged domestic production of this important basic food item.
As a result of these developments, most of which were outside the Government's
control, real GDP grew by only 2 percent p.a. on average during the 1974/75-
1977/78 period.
7.        National accounts estimates for the period subsequent to 1977/78 are
not yet available, but preliminary estimates suggest that real GDP may have
grown by 4 percent a year on average. This performance is mainly attributed
to the pace of public investment activity which peaked in 1978/79 with the
implementation of a number of large, capital intensive projects such as the
construction of a Third Sugar Mill complex, a southern rail link and the
extension of the main road network. In addition, improved international
prices for wood pulp and sugar accelerated growth of these industries. On
the other hand, mining sector output continued to fall as a result of further
rapid declines in iron ore extraction.



- 3 -
8.        Throughout the decade of the 1970s both GNP and GDP at market prices
have grown more rapidly than GDP at factor cost. This is explained by a rapid
expansion of Custom Union 1/ receipts reflecting increased Swaziland imports
and higher rates of duties and excise taxes; an increase in migrants remit-
tances; and a reduction in profit remittances abroad, particularly during
the mid 1970s. The rapid growth of GNP has permitted a higher level of con-
sumption and investment than would have been possible on the basis of domestic
production alone.
9.        Budgetary policy in Swaziland generally has been conservative.
Recurrent budget surpluses achieved throughout the 1970s were sufficient to
finance over 75 percent of total capital expenditures in that period. In
addition, the Government accumulated substantial financial savings and has
been a net creditor of the domestic banking system for many years. Recurrent
revenues more than doubled between 1975/76 and 1980/81, primarily due to
substantial increases in Customs Union receipts as a result of Swaziland-s
import growth and a concommitant rise in tariffs and duties levied by South
Africa. Since 1977/78 Customs receipts have on the average contributed over
50 percent to total government revenue. Expenditures have risen even more
rapidly from E 40 million in 1975/76 to about E 180 million in 1980/81,
primarily as a result of a marked acceleration in capital spending. Capital
expenditures (including net lending) grew particularly fast in 1978/79
when the Government started implementation of its Third Development Plan
with a number of large projects. However, alarmed by a subsequent deteriora-
tion in budget and balance of payments performance, the Government, with the
help of the IMF, adopted a financial program in 1979/80 to curb the growth
of public spending. The program was implemented successfully and the overall
budget deficit declined from E 48 million in 1978/79 to E 12 million in the
following year.
10.       So far, Swaziland has not yet experienced severe balance of payments
problems with subsequent repercussions on growth and employment. Nevertheless,
rising current account deficits brought on by worsening terms of trade and
rapid increases in import volume have become a matter of concern. In 1979, the
Government successfully attempted to keep the current account deficit at its
1978 level, but nevertheless, capital inflows were insufficient to cover it and
net official reserves were drawn down by E 5 million to E 89 million at the end
of 1979, equivalent to about 4 months of imports.
11.       Swaziland's 1978-82 Third National Development Plan emphasizes the
creation of conditions supporting sustained economic growth, increased self-
reliance, and extending economic opportunities and services to the rural areas
to promote social justice and stability. It calls for a public investment
program of E 413 million in 1977 prices (over 3-1/2 times that achieved under
the 1973-77 Second Plan) of which 61 percent would be financed from domestic and
the rest from external sources. While actual revenues and expenditures have
1/   Swaziland, Botswana, Lesotho and South Africa have formed a free trade
area, the Southern Africa Customs Union, in which customs and excise
revenues are pooled and shared under a formula in which each country s
total imports and production of tradable goods are an important element.



- 4 -
come close to plan forecasts during the first three years of implementation,
the growth target of 7 percent a year in real terms was not achieved. A 1980
mid-term review indicated that real GDP may have grown by 4 percent during the
first two years, and given that revenues are expected to level off in the
remaining years, because of stagnating or possibly declining revenues from the
common customs pool, growth may not accelerate markedly within the near
future, which would aggravate the problem of rising unemployment. While open
unemployment was not an issue until recently, the Government is now much
concerned about the economy s potential to absorb large increments to the
labor force. Government, therefore, intends to expand the original plan
investment program to include several industrial and infrastructure projects
geared to accelerate growth, employment creation and domestic resource mobili-
zation. The proposed hydroelectric power project is part of this program.
However, the large size of the proposed program will require a substantial
increase in public external borrowing.
12.       Before 1977, Swaziland relied less on external public borrowing
than other African countries with similar per capita incomes, such as Botswana,
Ivory Coast and Zambia. Between 1977 and 1979, however, Swaziland-s outstand-
ing debt almost trebled to $146.3 million at the end of December 1979, as
Government had to finance a large portion of its rapidly growing expenditures
from external sources. Nevertheless, the low initial debt base, concessional
lending terms, and the large portion of exports in GNP have kept debt service
payments still below 3 percent of export receipts at the end of 1979. Until
1972/73, the UK and the Bank Group were the only sources of public external
financing, but since then the Government has been successful in diversifying
its sources of foreign funds, including borrowing on commercial terms.
Swaziland's major creditors at the end of 1979 were the UK (22 percent), a
consortium of private banks (19 percent), the Federal Republic of Germany (17
percent) and the World Bank Group (16 percent). However, due to some reliance
on commercial sources, average loan terms have become harder and the grant
element in total commitments had fallen from 32 percent in 1977 to about 25
percent at the end of 1978. Terms may even become harder in the near future
as Government attempts to mobilize further large increases in foreign resources
to finance planned investments during the remaining years of the Third Plan
and beyond. If Government is successful in sustaining an average GDP growth
rate of 4 percent until the mid 1980s, it may have to borrow some US$80
million a year which would raise the debt service ratio to about 6 percent by
1985.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SWAZILAND
13.       The Bank Group began operations in Swaziland in 1962 and has approved
nine loans, two credits and one IFC investment for a total of US$67 million.
These have helped finance three road projects, two power projects, three
education projects, and projects for rural development, water supply and
sewerage, a development finance company and an irrigated sugar estate and
factory (IFC). Implementation of these projects is proceeding satisfactorily.
In the power sector the Bank provided a US$4.2 million loan to SEB in 1963 to



- 5 -
assist in financing a 10-MW hydroelectric project at Edwaleni; this was fol-
lowed by a US$2.75 million loan in 1967 to help finance a 6.5-MW hydroelectric
plant at Magaduza, a 5-MW diesel station at Edwaleni, and a 5-MW expansion of
Edwaleni hydroelectric plant. Both projects included transmission and distri-
bution extensions. They were completed on schedule and within cost estimates.
SEB-s administrative and technical performance was satisfactory, and it has
operated a successful technical and professional training progranm. A summary
of Bank Group operations is given in Annex II, together with notes on the
execution of ongoing projects. The Bank aims to continue assisting Swaziland
with projects for roads, including maintenance, industrial development,
agriculture, particularly in the low veld, and possibly urban activities and
wood energy.
14.       In recent years, the Bank Group has become an important source of
financing for Swaziland's development. At the end of 1979, the Bank Group's
share in debt outstanding and disbursed was 16 percent (IBRD's share was 11
percent). The Bank Group's share in total debt service in that year stood at
39 percent. As a consequence of the large capital inflows required by the
Third Plan and in succeeding years, the Bank Group's exposure is expected to
decline: its share in debt outstanding and disbursed is expected to fall to
eight percent by the end of 1985 while its share in debt servicing is expected
to total only nine percent in that year.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
15.       While Swaziland's coal and water resources give it the potential for
near self-sufficiency in energy, they have been only partially developed and
nearly half the country's yearly energy use of about 365,000 tons of oil
equivalent is based on imported oil, coal, and electricity. 1/ Swaziland's
strategy in the sector calls for the development of its second and third coal
mines, for which feasibility studies are underway, and exploitation of its
hydropower potential.  An energy master plan is expected to be completed in
1981.
16.       The Swaziland Electricity Board (SEB) is the only public electricity
generator and distributor in Swaziland; it operates three hydropc,wer instal-
lations totalling 22 MW, and a 10 MW diesel plant used during peaLk hours
when power imported from South Africa's Electricity Supply Commission (ESCOM)
is most expensive. During 1980, SEB produced 117 GWh of electricity and
imported 188 GWh. Another 175 GWh was self-generated by three sugar mills
burning bagasse and other industrial plants using firewood, coal, diesel oil,
and water. The proposed Project would give SEB an additional 95 GWh of capac-
ity, initially reducing dependence on South Africa by about half.
1/   Oil imports are 91,000 tons of oil equivalent (toe), or 24 percent of
yearly energy use; coal imports, 20,000 toe (6 percent), and electricity
imports 46,000 toe (13 percent). Present coal production from a single
mine is 145,000 tons (89,000 toe), and hydroelectric generation is 35,000
toe, about 5 percent of Swaziland's hydro potential of 740,000 toe. The
proposed project would utilize another 3 percent of this potential.



-6-
17.       Swaziland's per capita electricity consumption of some 850 kWh a
year, high by Eastern African standards, is largely a function of its small
population and the presence of a few large industrial users. SEB's domestic
service is limited to urban areas and small towns as the rural population is
too scattered for service to be economic; about 14 percent of the population
has access to SEB power and some large self-generating industrial users also
supply electricity to their workers.
18.       SEB sales have grown at 13 percent a year since 1970 to 276 GWh in
1980. About 17 percent is sold to domestic consumers, 32 percent to irrigators,
and 18 percent to large industrial users, with the balance being taken up by
commercial and bulk users. Power sales in 1981 are forecast at 305 GWh,
growing at an average of 6.2 percent a year to reach 526 GWh in 1990.
19.       SEB plans to meet this growth through the proposed project and build-
ing a third ESCOM link in 1985. The forthcoming energy master plan will
provide guidelines for further power development in Swaziland, and decisions
between additional imports and new hydro or coal facilities are expected to be
made in late 1980s.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
20.       The Project 1/ would help Swaziland meet local power demand by
utilizing domestic resources while reducing dependence on South Africa.
21.       The Project would have three components:
A.   Civil Works
(1) a 40 meter high and 400 meter long rockfill dam at Lupohlo
on the3Little Usutu River 2/ that would create a 20 mil-
lion m reservoir aid an average water flow for power
generation of 3.5 m /sec;
(2) a 4.4 km unlined low-pressure tunnel leading to a surge
chamber and vertical shaft and a 600 m steel-lined tunnel and
surface penstock system providing in all, a 250 m head
between the reservoir and the powerhouse at Ezulwini;
1/   The Project was prepared by SEB on the basis of consultants' studies.
Appraisal took place in June/July, 1980, and negotiations were held in
Washington, in April 1981. N. Kirsh, Chairman of SEB's Board, led the
utility's delegation, V.E. Sikhondze, Permanent Secretary of Finance, the
Government Delegation. A report, "Swaziland Third Power Project - Staff
Appraisal Report (No. 3172 SW, Dec. 22, 1980)" is being distributed
separately. Annex III gives supplementary information.
2/   While the Little Usutu rises in South Africa, its watershed lies almost
entirely within Swaziland and South Africa would have no control over
the flow of water to the Project.



-7-
(3)  a powerhouse with two 10 MW hydro-turbine generators and a
short tailrace channel, and a 66kV switchyard;
(4) consulting services for bid evaluating bids and supervising
construction (about 800 man-months, at an estimated US$6,600
per man-month), and a panel of experts that would advise on
civil works (about 33 man-months, at an estimated US$12,700
per man-month); and
B.   Studies of SEB's tariffs and the Project's implication for health
and diseases and its impact on indigenous fish resources in the area
(about 35 man-months, at an estimated US$5,700 per man--month); and
C.   Resettlement of about 300 people who live on the reservoir site.
22.       SEB, like many smaller electric utilities, has based its tariff
structure on the historic costs of supplying various classes of customers and
negotiated rates with some larger consumers. Although some minor changes have
been made over the last few years, further modifications probably are needed
to bring the SEB's tariff structure better into line with the long-run marginal
costs of supplying power to different kinds of consumers and to itake account
of time-of-day consumption. Toward this end SEB will carry out, by June 30,
1982, on terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, a study of its tariff
structure, and after that will make appropriate changes in it (Draft Loan
Agreement, Section 3.06).
23.       In addition, there is provision for studying the Project's health
and ecological effects. These aspects were examined during the feasibility
study, which concluded that any adverse effects likely would at most be
marginal. Bilharzia is endemic in still waters in Swaziland. However, it
is proposed to control the disease by periodically lowering the :Project
reservoir's water level to prevent snail eggs from hatching. SEB will
complete a study of the Project's human health and disease implications
(including control measures), with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank,
by June 30, 1982 (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.06). SEB also will complete
by that date an investigation of the Project impact on indigenous fish resour-
ces, and the Government will carry out a study of the ecological implications
on the Lusushwana-Usutu River basin (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.03).
The Project includes resettling some 300 people whose homes and farms would
be flooded. SEB will carry out an appropriate resettlement plan which the
African Development will finance. The Bank will supervise the program jointly
with the ADB.
Project Execution
24.       SEB will carry out the Project, with the assistance of consultants
and a panel of experts, whose qualifications, experience and employment terms
and conditions would be satisfactory to the Bank, to advise on civil works
(Draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.02). SEB was established in 1963 as a
government-owned corporation empowered to generate, transmit and distribute

electricity; it was also given exclusive authority to license others to
produce electricity in Swaziland. Its power network is adequate and well
organized through a system control center linking its power plants, most major
substations and ESCOM. The network also has an effective load control system.
Power is distributed to substations through about 1,700 km of overhead lines.
25.       The utility is well managed and staffed.  Its six-member Board,
appointed by the Minister of Works, Power and Communications, has considerable
autonomy, including the power to set electricity tariffs. SEB's staff of 360
is headed by a competent general manager, and agreement was reached at nego-
tiations that Bank approval would be needed before any new appointment was
made to this position and/or to that of the utility's chairman (Draft Loan
Agreement, Section 4.04 and Draft Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.04). SEB
began a strong staff training and development program in the 1960s that has
steadily reduced its need for expatriates, who now make up only about a third
of its senior management. To assure that SEB's organization and management
continues to be adequate, the Borrower will review its position annually with
the Bank and take whatever steps might be necessary.
26.       Detailed engineering designs for the Project were completed in May
1980, and contracts for constructing the dam, tunnel and powerhouse (for which
bids have been received) are expected to be awarded in August 1981. Tendering
was in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines for international
competitive bidding. Construction is scheduled to begin in October 1981 and
run through March 1984. SEB already has acquired the rights to the land for
the Project. In addition to periodic progress reports, the Borrower will
prepare a completion report within a year of the loan's closing date (Draft
Loan Agreement, Section 3.04(d)).
Costs
27.       Project cost net of duties and taxes (US$630,000), is estimated
at US$58.6 million, of which US$41.2 million (70 percent) would be foreign
exchange. Interest during construction would be an additional US$6.7 million.
Base costs have been expressed in January 1981 prices. Physical contingencies
range from 8 to 16 percent for civil works, 7 to 10 percent for equipment and
are 10 percent for engineering services. Price contingencies assume local
cost rises of 12.5 percent in 1981, 11 percent in 1982, and 10 percent
thereafter. Foreign cost escalation has been taken at 9, 8, and 7 percent for
the same periods. The bids received by SEB for the dam, tunnel and powerhouse
are within cost estimates.
Financing Plan
28.       Project financing of US$42.7 million from five external sources
would meet foreign exchange costs and 10 percent of local costs, or 72 per-
cent of total project cost. The proposed Bank loan of US$10 million (23
percent of foreign costs, 16 percent of total net cost) would help finance the
foreign costs of civil works for the dam, tunnel and powerhouse and related



- 9 -
engineering services and the panel of experts that would advise on civil
works, as well as studies on SEB's tariffs and the Project's implicatiods for
health and fish resources.
29.       Besides the proposed Bank loan for the Project, the European Invest-
ment Bank (EIB) would loan SEB US$8.8 million equivalent at 8 percent annual
interest, and the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) US$7.6 million
equivalent at 9.5 annual interest, both for 15 years, including 3 years grace.
The Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) would lend US$8.1 million equivalent
and the African Development Bank (ADB) US$8.2 million equivalent to the
Government for onlending to SEB. KfW's loan would be at 8 percent interest
for 30 years with 3 years' grace and ADB's at 8 percent for 20 years with 5
years grace.
30.       In addition to the financing from external sources, the Government
would lend SEB the equivalent of US$2.5 million at 8 percent interest for 24
years with 4 years' grace, the Swaziland National Provident fund would lend
the equivalent of US$6.2 million at 10 percent interest for 20 years with 10
years' grace, and US$7.8 million equivalent would be provided from SEB's
internal cash generation.
Procurement and Disbursement
31.       Civil works contracts of US$100,000 or more financed by the Bank
loan would be awarded after international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group guidelines.  SEB's procurement procedures, which are satis-
factory to the Bank, would be used for smaller contracts, up to an aggregate
of US$500,000. All major civil works and equipment contracts are expected
to be procured by international competitive bidding, as there are no local
manufacturers or contractors in these specialized fields.
32.       Disbursements would be made against 26 percent of the costs of civil
works and related engineering services. The Bank would also disburse against
40 percent of the costs of consultants- services for the project studies
and the expert panel. Disbursement is expected to be completed by March 31,
1985.
SEB's Finances
33.       Since its creation in 1963, SEB's financial management and performance
has been strong. Between FY76 and FY80, it was able to finance about 65 percent
ot its US$12 million investment requirements from internal cash generation and,
with the exception of 1980, achieved rates of return on average net fixed
assets (at historical cost) ranging from 9.9 to 12.7 percent. Under the impetus
of a 15 percent tariff increase in FY80, the FY81 rate of return is expected
to be about 13 percent.
34.       The utility's present financial position continues to be favorable:
As of March 31, 1980, it had total net assets (at historical cost) of US$19.4
million                                             , a current ratio of 1.8 and
a debt equity ratio of 40:60.  Outstanding loans, mainly from the Swazi



- 10 -
Government, totalled US$7.9 million. SEB's accounting records are well
maintained, expenditures carefully planned, and close attention given to
future cash needs. In accordance with the loan agreement for the Second Power
Project, its financial statements have regularly been audited and sub-
mitted to the Bank within four months after the close of each fiscal year.
This practice would be continued under the present project (Draft Loan Agree-
ment, Section 5.02).
35.       During 1981-85, SEB intends to finance at least US$25 million (E 20
million) from internal cash generation towards its capital spending, which is
expected to total US$76 million, including the proposed project. As a first
step toward meeting this objective, SEB increased its overall average tariff
15 percent in February and expects to follow with further increases of 12 per-
cent in 1982 and 1983 and 6 percent in each of the succeeding two years. SEB
has agreed to maintain its tariffs at levels that would generate US$25 million
(E 20 million) and return at least 7 percent in FY82 and 8 percent thereafter
on its average net fixed assets (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.04). The
Borrower would, before the beginning of each fiscal year, review the adequacy
of its tariffs to meet these requirements. SEB would revalue its fixed assets
to reflect their current value at March 31, 1980 and each year thereafter.
36.       Based on current projections, SEB's future financial performance
should continue to be satisfactory. Revenues are expected to increase about
four times between FY81 and FY90, while expenses increase about three-fold,
so that SEB should be able to contribute an increasing proportion of its
income toward capital spending. In view of its past record on financial
management, the E 400,000 limit on SEB's outstanding borrowings imposed
by the Loan Agreement for the Second Power Project would be liberalized.
SEB would not incur any long-term debt, without the Bank's agreement, unless
projected net revenues before interest and depreciation during the term of
the debt was at least 1.5 times future debt service for all SEB debt (Draft
Loan Agreement, Section 5.05).
Benefits and Risk
37.       The proposed Project would be the first step in the least-cost
program for meeting Swaziland's power needs to 2030. SEB's consultants
have analyzed this program against alternative combinations of domestic
generation and imports from South Africa. Since it was assumed that the cost
of imported electricity would remain constant, any increases in ESCOM's
tariffs (which risen-an average of eight percent a year in real terms since
1976) would make the Project even more attractive.
38.       Including the February 1, 1981 tariff increase of 15 percent, the
economic rate of return of the Project would be 12 percent. If costs were
10 percent higher than'estimated or revenues 10 percent lower, the rate of
return would drop to about 11 percent. If both of these events were to
occur simultaneously, the rate of return would fall to 9 percent. Finally,
the Project has the important additional benefits of reducing Swaziland's
reliance on South Africa for power, providing employment and training for
Swazis and improving the efficiency of SEB. No major risks to the project
are foreseen.

loans would be a condition of effectiveness for the proposed Bank loan (Draft
Loan Agreement, Section 8.01).
41.       Special Conditions of the Loan Agreement are listed in Annex III of
this report.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.       1 recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. BANK PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 518   Education; US$5 Million Credit of December 9, 19,74;
Effectiveness Date: March 11, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
Civil works have been largely completed and all furniture and
equipment procured. The project's educational objectives are being met,
although tracer studies and evaluation of the Rural Education Centers are
not yet finished. The closing date has been extended a year, to
December 31, 1981, to allow further staff housing and other facilities to be
built.
Loan No. 1375-SW Rural Development; US$4.0 Million Loan of April 6 1977;
Effectiveness Date: January 27, 1978; Closing I)ate:
November 30, 1982.
Infrastructure construction performance is going well after a slow
start. The project's objective of increased smallholder productiLon is not,
however, being met as increases in productivity are releasing labor for
non-agricultural work in the wage sector that produces higher incomes.
Loan No. 1409-SW National Industrial Development Corporation of Swaziland
(NIDCS); US$5.0 Million Loan of May 12, 1977; Effective-
ness Date: July 18, 1977; Closing Date: Decemlber 31, 1981
The NIDCS' portion of the loan (US$4.7 million) was fuLly committed
in late 1980, but commitment of the $300,000 earmarked for the slubsidiary
Small Enterprises Development Company has lagged.
Loan No. 1478-SW Education II; US$4.0 Million Loan of August 8, 1977;
Effectiveness Date: November 7, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
While overall progress has been satisfactory, the Project's closing
date has been extended because of delays in deciding the site for one school.
Loan No. 1619-SW Third Highway; US$11.0 Million Loan of September 27, 1978;
Effectiveness Date: December 29, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
Construction of the Big Bend Nggwavuma River, and Manzini Mhakondvo
River roads began in early 1980, about 6 months behind schedule; both the
construction and technical assistance components of the Project are Proceeding
well.

Design work for the first phase has been reviewed and approved;
the project is off to a good start, although work tenders indicate construc-
tion work may be more expensive than expected.
