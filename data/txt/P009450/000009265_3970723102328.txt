DEVELOPMENT CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:        People's Republic of Bangladesh.
Beneficiary:     Rural Electrification Board (REB).
Amount:          SDR 76.4 million (US$79.0 million equivalent).
Terms:           Standard.
ReLending        The proceeds of the credit would be relent to the Rural
Terms:           Electrification Board (REB) for a period of 30 years,
including a grace period of five years, at a rate of 0.75Z
per annum (capitalized) during the grace period and 2Z during
the repayment period. The assets of the completed schemes
would be transferred by REB to the respective Rural
Electrification Cooperatives (Palli Bidyut Samities - PBSs),
on the basis of sub-loans. The sub-loans would be for a
period of 30 years, including a grace period of five years,
at a rate of 0.75% per annum (capitalized) during the grace
period and 3% per annum during the repayment period.
The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project          The proposed Project would support the Government's efforts
Description:     to expand the supply of electricity in rural areas and
finance the installation of electricity distribution
networks in six new PBS areas and expansion in five existing
PBSs. It also includes technical assistance to strengthen
financial and institutional aspects of both REB and PBSs.
Project Risk:    The proposed Project is relatively free of complexities.
Slippage could occur due to delays in procurement and
shortage of linesmen. These possibilities would be
minimized through the employment of consultants to provide
REB with technical and institution-building services and the
implementation of an agreed training program.

SECOND RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
I. ENERGY SECTOR
A. Overview of Energy Resources
1.01    Bangladesh's principal commercially exploitable energy resources
consist of large deposits o' natural gas and a small hydropower potential.
In addition there are some potential peat and coal resources; however, at
present their development would be uneconomic. Traditional fuels, such as
crop residues, animal dung and wood, supply about 60% of energy consumption.
Natural Gas
1.02    Natural gas is the main commercial energy resource, accounting for
over 50Z of commercial energy supply. One offshore and twelve onshore fields
have been discovered and six fields were in production in December 1984. All
onshore fields are located on the eastern side of the Brahwaputra/Jamuna
River, which runs across the country from north to south. The production of
natural gas increased rapidly during the period 1975-1984, from about 80
MMCFD to 250 MNCFD (1,800 to 5,700 TOE/day). Seventeen wells in six fields
are in operation, and another four wells are planned to be in operation by
the end of 1985. The completion of these wells is expected to enable total
gas production to reach about 600 MMCFD (13,700 TOE/day). Gas-in-place is
estimated to be about 11 TCF (250 million TOE), however, the Asian Develop-
ment Bank (ADB) and United Nations Development Program (UNDP) financed
Bangladesh Energy Planning Project (BEPP) estimated that there is a 50%
probability that undiscovered gas reserves are in the range 12-20 TCF (275 to
460 million TOE). Uncertainty regarding the level of existing reserves makes
it impossible for GOB to formulate a long-term development strategy for the
subsector. Therefore, there is a need to initiate a professionally-designed
appraisal program to assess reserves. As a first step, detailed high-
resolution seismic surveys of the major gas fields are being undertaken as a
part of the IDA-financed Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project (Credit
1402-BD) to firm up the reservoir structure maps, provide a basis for locat-
ing future wells to be drilled and assist in identifying gas-water contacts.
A critical follow-up would be a program of appraisal drilling which is now
being addressed under the IDA Second Gas Development Project (Credit
1586-BD).
Oil
1.03    To date no commercial reserves of oil have been discovered.  The
IDA-financed Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project (Credit 1402-BD) is
intended to revive the interest and engender the participation of foreign
investors in petroleum exploration in Bangladesh. This includes, besides



-2-
the aforesaid seismic surveys (para 1.02), estr.'lishment of a data processing
center, preparing a hydrocarbon habitat study, and strengthening the
capabilities of the national oil and gas corporation, Petrobangla. In addi-
tion GOB is conducting other seismic works covering most of the western zone
in order to identify promising structures.
Hydropower
1.04    Bangladesh's hydropower potential is limited because its large
rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra/Jamuna, flow over a flat deltaic area.
The hydropower potential is estimated to be about 1,500 GWh/year, of which
850 GWh/year has been developed. All of the existing development is on the
Karnafuli river at Kaptai, where the installed capacity is 130 MW.  The
construction of a second power house, financed by OECF (Japan), was started
in 1984 and two 50 MW units are scheduled to be commissioned in December
1987. Provision has been made for a subsequent extension to house two addi-
tional 50 MW units. When completed, the Kaptai project will have a total
installed capacity of 330 MW and a generating capability of about 1,050
GWh/year. Two other prospective hydro sites have been investigated in the
same area: (a) Sangu, where about 00 GWh/year could be generated from a 150
MW peaking plant working under a maximum head of 45 meters; and
(b) Matamuhari, where a peaking plant of about 100 MW operating under a head
of 40 meters could generate about 200 GWh/year. The development of these
schemes would require the relocation of about 30,000 people, consequently no
detailed engineering studies of these schemes have been 'xndertaken to date.
Coal and Peat
1.05     Good quality coal with a heat value of about 6,200 kcal/kg exists
in north western BangLadesh, at Jamalganj, with total deposits estimated at
700 million tons. The deposits are at a depth of 650 to 1,050 meters under
soft water-bearing strata and their extraction would require sophisticated
and costly soil-freezing techniques. Production costs have been estimated
to be about US$150/ton (mid-1983 p-ices), which is considerably higher than
the cost of imported coal. Good deposits of peat are known to exist in the
Faridpur and Khulna districts. The Faridpur reserves are believed to be
s-±fficient to fuel a 200 MW thermal plant for 40 years at a 50% load factor.
The Bangladesh Energy Planning Project has reported that a 30 MW pilot plant
consuming about 200,000 tonnes of peat a year is under consideration by
Bangladesh Power Development Power Board (BPDB).
Renewable Energy Resources
1.06     Traditional fuels play a crucial role in Bangladesh's energy sector,
supplying about 60% of total energy requirements. Wood is one of its major
renewable energy resources, but its usage is believed to be in excess of its
sustainable yield. It has been estimated that tree biomass, such as stem
wood, branches, and other tree fuels, contribute between 50% and 60Z of total



-3-
household energy requirements. AnimaL dung and agricultural wastes supply
the remaining domestic energy requirements. According to the Bangladesh
Bureau of Statistics the amount of energy supplied by traditional fuels in
the unorganized sector increased by less than 1% a year between 1976 and
1982. During the same period commercial energy supply increased by about 6%
a year.
1.07      Urgent action is required to increase fuelwood production, improve
the recovery of forestry wastes for charcoal production, improve the
efficiency of traditional stoves and investigate the use of non-conventional
forms of renewable energy. GOB policy is to increase the availability of new
and renewable energy resources, with the emphasis on fuelwood (through com-
munity and homestead afforestation) and the promotion of non-conventional
energy resources. IDA is assisting the implementation of this policy through
the Mangrove Afforestation Project (Credit 1042-BD). In addition, the ongo-
ing Bangladesh Energy Planning Project is due to make practical recommenda-
tions to help stabilize the dwindling base of traditional energy in the face
of rising demand.
B. Organization of the Energy Sector
1.08      Responsibility for energy policies and programs in Bangladesh is
dispersed over a number of agencies. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources has overall responsibility for commercial energy. Operational
responsibilities are vested in a range of public sector entities responsible
for commercial energy supplies. Bangladesh Oil and Gas Corporation
%Petrobangla) and its subsidiary organizations are responsible for oil and
natural gas exploration and production, and distribution of natural gas.
Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) is responsible for imports'of crude
oil, refining and marketing of petroleum products. BPDB is responsible for
generation and transmission of electric power, and its distribution except in
those rural areas served by the Rural Electrification Board (REB). REB was
created in 1977 to take over the distribution of electricity in rural areas
through a system of cooperatives, referred to as Palli Bidyut Samities
(PBSs). By mid-1984, 17 cooperatives, serving about 110,000 connections 1/
had been partially energized and another 16 cooperatives are being developed.
At present there is no institutional structure for the coordination of
activities in the non-commercial energy sector. Various government agencies,
including the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Local Government,
Rural Development and Cooperatives, are responsible for non-commercial
energy. The issue of coordination is being reviewed under the ongoing
Bangladeshi Energy Planning Project (BEPP). The draft final report of the
BEPP was forwarded to IDA in August 1985.
1/ On average each domestic connection serves about 2.5 households, and thus
the 110,000 connections provide supply to about 237,000 consumers.



-4-
1.09      The Planning Commission, which is responsible for macroeconomic
planning and produces the Five-Year Plans and Annual Development Plans
(ADPs), is also responsible for the preparation of the master plan for
energy. An Energy Study and Planning Cell (ESPC) has been established within
the Planning Comnission to formulate this plan through the ADB/UNDP financed
BEPP.
C. Energy Consumption
1.10      Bangladesh's per capita consumption of commercial energy is about
36 kg of oil equivalent per annum, about 90% lower than the population
weighted average for all low-income countries. Total per capita consumption
of energy is about 90 kg of oil equivalent per annum, about 60% of which is
supplied by traditional energy resources. The level of energy use is very
low, and thus there is high potential for increased energy demand. Between
1976 and 1983, commercial energy consumption grew at about 5.8% per annum,
while traditional energy showed relative stagnation, increasing at less than
1X per annum. rn FY84, commercial energy consumption was about 3.4 million
tons oil equivalent, of which imported fuels, petroleum and coal, accounted
for 37% and 5% respectively, natural gas 522, and hydropower 6%. Consumption
of natural gas, which accounts for about two-thirds of electricity gener-
ation, increased at 13.5% per annum between 1975 and 1984.
D. Energy Pricing
1.11    The prices of traditional fuels are determined in the market place,
while the prices of petroleum products, natural gas, coal and electricity are
set by the Government. For each class of consumers the prices of conmercial
energy products are uniform throughout the country, with the exception of
electricity supplied by PBSs. Each PBS sets its own tariff with the approval
of REB. GOB's pricing policy for petroleum products is based on the prin-
ciple of periodic adjustments to recover increases in procurement, processing
and distribution costs and allow reasonable returns. The most recent adjust-
ment, in July 1984, raised prices Lo or above their border price levels.
Furthermore, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources is now authorized
to increase automatically petroleum prices by up to 10% in response to
increasing costs. The current ex-refinery price levels, in comparison with
import parity equivalent prices, are satisfactory. Gas tariffs have been
raised several times in recent years. The most recent increase, in July
1984, resulted in a weighted average increase marginally in excess of that
required to maintain tariffs in real terms. Natural gas prices for some
classes of consumers, such as electric power and fertilizer users, are well
below long run marginal cost. A tariff study by international consultants
was carried out under Bakhrabad Gas Development Project (Credit 1091-BD) to
assist the Government in establishing reasonable gas prices. Under the
Second Gas Development Project (para 1.02) GOB increased the average price of
natural gas by 20% on July 1, 1985, and agreed to introduce an additional



-5-
increase of at least 20% by July 1, 1986. Beginning FY88 and thereafter, GOB
has agreed to adjust the structure and level of gas prices an the basis of
long-run marginal cost plus an allowance for depletion. Electricity tariffs
were increased by 28% on July 1, 1982, by 3.2% on July 1, 1983, by 9.5% on
March 1, 1984, by 3.4% on December 1, 1984 and by 16.4% on September 1, 1985.
The latest tariff incorporates time-of-day pricing for some consumer classes.
However, there is a need for an updated long run marginal cost tariff study.
COB agreed, under the IDA-financed Ashuganj Thermal Power Project (Credit
1254-BD) and the Rural Electrification Project (Credit 1262-BD), to undertake
such a study, but to date this has not been carried out. However, in October
1984 GOB approached UNDP to finance this study. The project document has
been signed and the Bank Group appointed as the executing agency. In
mid-September consultants were invited to submit proposals, and the study
should begin in January 1986.
E. Energy Planning and Development Strategy
1.12      Energy development in general, and oil and gas exploration in
particular, were designated a "core priority" in the Government's Second
Five-Year Plan (SFYP) 1981-1985. Particular emphasis has been placed on
substituting imported fuels with indigenous resources, such as natural gas
and hydro potential. Other major objectives being pursued by the Government
in the energy sector include: (a) improving the reliability of electricity
supply and efficiency of the power system operation; (b) achieving a regional
balance in energy supply between the eastern and western zones of Bangladesh;
(c) implementing a comprehensive rural electrification program; and
(d) improving efficiency of use and increasing the availability of renewabLe
resources to meet the growing demand for energy in rural areas. 1/ In line
with the priority given to energy development, the SFYP allocated 19% of
total public sector outlays to the energy sector, of which 70% was allocated
to the power subsector and 30% to hydrocarbons.
F. Bank Group Strategy in the Power Subsector
1.13    The objectives of the Bank Group's assistance in the subsector have
evolved from a continuing dialogue with GOB on the complex problems confront-
ing the electricity supply industry. They are aimed at supporting efforts
to: (a) meet the forecast demand for electricity at least cost;
(b) substitute electricity generated using indigenous resources for that
generated using imported petroleum products; (c) assist in institution build-
ing and training; (d) strengthen financial management, particularly of BPDB;
and (e) electrify rural areas. In line with these objectives, the Bank group
1/ The Bangladesh Energy Planning Project will address this issue.



-6-
and GOB have agreed that priority should be given to: (a) development of
gas-fired and hydroelectric power plants; (b) the reduction of system losses;
(c) the development of efficient transmission and distribution systems,
including the rural electrification systems; and (d) the financial objectives
and practices of BPDB. Progress has been made in alL of these areas, but
further improvements are necessary. In particular additional efforts are
needed to: (a) continue improvement in the maintenance, operational proce-
dures and management of BPDB; (b) address system losses; (c) develop the
transmission system to allow the substitution of energy generated from
gas-fired pLants for that generated from thermal stations using petroleum
products; (d) improve transmission and low-voltage distribution systems to
supply new consumers, and generaLly improve the quality of supply; and
(e) electrify new rural areas and expand the supply systems in areas which
have already been electrified.
G. Bank Group Involvement and Donor Coordination
1.14      To date IDA has supported energy development with six operations:
three in the power subsector and three in the hydrocarbon area. The total
amount of IDA funds committed through these operations is US$296.5 million,
representing about 20% of total IDA resources comitted to Bangladesh during
the last five years. IDA's involvemer. with Bangladesh's power subsector
began in June 1979, with the approval of a US$28 million credit for the
Greater Khulna Power Distribution Project (Credit 934-BD) to upgrade and
improve the distribution networks in Khulna and three neighboring towns. The
completion of this project has been delayed by more than one year, mainly due
to delays in procurement. BPDB has however, taken corrective steps to remedy
the situation and the Project is expected to be completed in FY86. This
credit was followed by the approval of two power credits in June 1982: a
US$40 million credit for the Rural Eleccrification Project (Credit 1262-BD),
to provide electricity to seven rural cooperatives which was supplemented by
US$8 million under the Supplemental Assistance Credit (Credit 1504-3-BD) in
June 1984, and a US$92 million credit for Ashuganj ThermaL Power Project
(Credit 1254-BD), to expand the generating capacity of the Ashuganj thermaL
power station by adding two 150 MW gas-fired steam units. The Rural Elec-
trification Project is expected to be completed on schedule in December 1988.
After some initial delays which have caused the estimated completion date for
the Ashuganj Project to slip by about one year to July 1987, work is
progressing smoothly. IDA is anticipating substantial savings under Credit
1254-BD, and GOB has requested IDA to finance, utilizing these savings, a
third unit at Ashuganj to meet forecast load growth. In the hydrocarbon
sector, the first IDA financing, in June 1981, was the US$85 million credit
for the Bakhrabad Gas Development Project (Credit 1091-BD) to develop wells
at the Bakhrabad gas field and to supply gas to the Greater Chittagong area.
A US$28.5 million credit was approved in May 1983, for the Energy Efficiency
and Refinery Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1357-BD). This seeks to
rehabilitate the oil refinery and to study modifications needed to improve
the yield pattern. This project also provides support for the development of



-7--
an energy conservation program to improve the efficiency of energy use in the
industrial sector and for feasibility studies on gas-based export-oriented
projects. In July 1983, a US$23 million credit was approved for the
Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project (Credit 1402-BD). This seeks to
stimulate interest among foreign investors in the resumption of oil explora-
tion through a proper assessment of petroleum prospects by undertaking seis-
mic surveys and hydrocarbon habitat studies. In April 1985, IDA approved the
Second Gas Development Project as a part of GOB's program for gas development
and gas infrastructure in the north eastern part of the country.
1.15      In addition to IDA, a large number of external donors have been
involved in assisting investment in the energy sector. They include over
20 agencies, including ADS, KfW, UNDP, OPEC Fund and Islamic Development
Bank. ADB has been particularly active in the energy sector through its
involvement with the Bangladesh Energy Study (BES), carried out in 1976, and
a number of lending operations covering all major energy subsectors. ADB is
currently executing BEPP (para 1.02) and a Power Sector Master Plan Study.
These reports are expected to provide the basis for formulating the Govern-
ment's energy policies and investment program for the Third Five-Year Plan.
It is intended to review the investment plan of BPDB in the Bank's forthcom-
ing Energy Investment Review Mission in FY86 and this will be discussed with
other donors and GOB.

II. THE BENEFICIARIES
A. Rural Electrification
Background
2.01      Over 90% of Bangladesh's population Live in rural areas.  Agricul-
ture remains the backbone of the Bangladesh economy, accounting for close to
50Z of its gross domestic product and employing over 75Z of the labor force.
In 1976, less than 3% of the rural population had access to electricity. At
that time GOB decided to extend the public supply of electricity to rural
areas to improve the quality of life and stimulate economic growth through
the development of agriculture and smaLl-scale agro-industries. Following
that decision, COB created REB in 1977 to carry out a national program of
rural electrification. A comprehensive rural electrification master plan was
developed by REB assisted by the National Rural Electrification Cooperative
Association (NRECA) of USA. The plan envisages the electrification of the
populated landmass of the country in five phases by about the year 2000.
2.02      Rural electrification under the plan is based on the concept of
"Area Coverage Rural Electrification" (ACRE), involving the design of a basic
distribution system to provide a backbone system that can cater for rapid
increases in the number of consumer connections (para 3.02). The ACRE con-
cept involves the development of autonomous member-owned rural electric
cooperatives (PBSs), each of which covers an area of 900-1300 square km and
has between 20,000 and 30,000 members. Each PBS includes a number of
Upazilas, which are administrative districts. The formation of PBSs has been
progressing smoothly under the guidance of REB with assistance from two
consulting firms, NRECA and Commonwealth Associates, Inc. (CAI), both
financed by US'AID. The PBSs are subject to supervision and control by REB,
which is the lending and construction institution.
2.03      The rural electrification master plan envisages the creation of
62 PBSs by FY2000. Phase I of the implementation program, financed by US$70
million from USAID, has been completed and its 13 PBSs are operating. The
Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) provided US$30 million to
finance eight additional PBSs under Phase I, four of which have been ener-
gized, and ADB has provided US$10.3 million for the expansion of two Phase I
PBSs. Phase II of the program, comprising 12 PBSs, is under construction
with financial assistance from IDA (Credit 1262-BD and Credit 1504-3-BD,
US$40 million and US$8 million respectively) for seven PBSs, USAID (US$50
million) for four PBSs and consulting services, and Government of Finland
(US$6 million) for one PBS.
2.04    By June 1984, 17 PBSs under Phase I had been connected to the grid
and were supplying about 237,000 consumers, of which 3,900 were irrigation,



-9-
2,000 industrial, 16,200 commercial and about 215,000 households 1/. The
planned total number of connections envisaged during appraisal for Credit
1262-BD has been achieved. However, a very important change has occurred in
the distribution of consumers among the different consumer categories. The
number of industrial and irrigation consumers is doubLe that which was
expected, and in consequence these consumers account for 65% of total elec-
tricity sales compared with the 40% which was forecast (see para 5.01).
Future Developments
2.05      GOB is now considering the implementation of Phase III of the
program. This includes the construction of 12 systems, each to be operated
by a new PBS, and the expansion of some existing PBSs established under the
first two phases. The objective of Phase III is to cover about 23,300 square
km of rural areas and provide service to about 500,000 consumers. The
estimated cost of Phase III is about US$253 million, including about US$179
million in foreign currency. This Phase is planned to start in FY86 and is
scheduled to be completed by FY94. REB has provided both a prefeasibility
study for Phase III and a detailed feasibility study for the proposed
Project. GOB is also discussing Phase III financing with Canada, Japan,
Finland, Denmark, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
2.06      Market prospects for future rural electrification developments
appear to be good. Over 40Z of households in existing PBSs have signed up
for connections. About 95% of existing irrigation pumps and tube wells use
diesel motors, which indicates that the replacement market is potentially
large due to the expected cost savings associated with electric pumps.
Experience with Phase I PBSs also suggests that there are excellent prospects
for large sales of electricity to industrial consumers. Forecast electricity
saLes and maximum demand in Bangladesh, including sales to PBSs, for the
period FY85-FY92 are shown in Annex 4.
B. Rural Electrification Board
Organization of REB
2.07      REB and PBSs are the prospective beneficiaries of the proposed
Project. REB is a government entity which was formed in 1977. It is respon-
sible for the initiation, planning and implementation of rural electrifica-
tion schemes within the framework of the rural electrification master plan.
REB's specific responsibilities include: (a) arranging finance for rural
electrification schemes; (b) construction of new distribution systems and
1/ Past electricity sales and number of consumers in Bangladesh, including
REB, are shown in Annex 2, and the historical growth in demand and energy
generation are shown in Annex 3.



-10-
rehabilitation of existing schemes; (c) organizing prospective consumers into
PBSs and prescribing their by-Laws; (d) establishing technical and
administrative standards for PBSs; and (e) approving their tariffs. Accord-
ing to the PresidentiaL Ordinance which created REB, it is also responsible
for electricity generation to supply rural areas, however, at present, it is
not carrying out this task. REB's management consists of a chairman, three
full-time members and four part-time members. The period, terms and condi-
tions of appointment for the chairman and members are determined by GOB.
REB's organization chart is shown in Annex 5 and its staffing in Annex 6.
This structure has been reviewed by IDA and found to be appropriate for REB's
activities and objectives.
Scheme Selection and Implementation
2.08      REB's project area selection criteria consider such things as the
availability of power supply and roads, population density, irrigation
requirements, and the promotion of regional balance (Annex 10). A project
proforma is prepared following the provisional allocation of foreign exchange
to a proposed project, and contains details of project targets, proposed
physical facilities, proposed financing and a cost-benefit analysis for the
project. Following a review of the project proforma by the Planning Co;mis-
sion it must be approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic
Council (ECNEC). REB then establishes PBSs in the project area. A draft
Project Proforma for the proposed Project was prepared by REB and provided to
IDA as a condition of negotiations (para 6.01(a)). A condition of credit
effectiveness would be the final approval of the Project Proforma by COB
(para 6.03(b)).
2.09      REB exercises statutory control over PBSs.  This includes the
supervision of their operations, assisting with the implementation of techni-
cal and administrative control systems which REB has developed for the PBSs,
and training PBS staff. REB has established a 'Rate Cell' which reviews PBS
tariffs. Following implementation of a project by REB, schemes are handed
over to the newly created PBSs. REB lends the initial cost of the scheme,
secured by a mortgage, to the PBS, provides loans to cover working capital
requirements, and arranges finance required to expand PBSs.
Training
2.10      REB's training program is designed to meet its own requirements,
together with those of PBSs (para 2.13) and local construction and consulting
firms which are implementing the rural electrification program. Between July
1978 and July 1984 it trained about 7,280 persons in courses designed and
supervised by the NRECA consulting team (Annex 7). Its training program,
when judged in terms of the number of persons trained and its policy of
developing appropriate skills in institutions concerned with the rural elec-
trification program, both has been and promises to continue to be effective.



-l1-
Project Evaluation
2.11    REB has set up an 'Evaluation Cell' in its program planning direc-
torate to assess the impact of completed rural electrification schemes on
rural communities. A base line study of the 13 Phase I PBSs has been com-
pleted by REB's Evaluation Cell, USAID and Dhaka University's Institute of
Statistical Research and Training (ISRT). The study, which was undertaken in
1983, assessed the socio-economic changes which bave occurred in rural com-
munities as a result of electrification. The results of the study are
encouraging and indicate that nearly all of the objectives of the ACRE
program are being realized. The NRECA/CAI Advisory Team prepares annual
evaluation reports. The most recent report (Fifth Report) considered the
period January 1978 to June 1983. The report identified a number of
problems, including a shortage of skilled employees. This problem is being
addressed by REB through its training program (para 2.10).
C. Palli Bidyut Samities - PBSs (Rural Electrification Cooperatives)
Organization Structure
2.12      The PBS system consists of member-owned autonomous cooperatives for
electricity distribution in rural areas. A PBS's initial Board of Directors
is selected from locaL citizens, subject to the approval of the REB Board of
Directors. After their appointment the directors register the PBS with REB,
which then proceeds to promote PBS membership among potential electricity
consumers. The Board of Directors consists of 10-15 members elected by an
annual Member's meeting. Eligibility to become or remain a director includes
being a bona fide member of a PBS and a resident of the area. Any person or
organization in a PBS area may become a member of the PBS following accept-
ance by the Board of Directors and payment of the membership fee of TklO.00.
REE, with assistance from the NRECA consulting team, has developed a typical
organizational structure for PBSs. Two sample organizational charts have
been prepared as flexible models to meet different levels of activity
(Annex 8). The General Manager is the chief executive and is accountable to
the Board of Directors. Four main departments, each headed by an Assistant
General Manager, are responsible for extension and member services, finance,
construction and maintenance, and general services. The organization struc-
ture has been reviewed by IDA and found satisfactory.
2.13      REB is devoting serious efforts to the recruitment and training
of staff for PBSs. A shortage of linesmen has hindered consumer connections,
and REB is attempting to overcome this shortage through an intensive training
program. By September 1984, about 1,050 PBS employees had participated in
training courses for linesmen. The training program would assist in the
smooth implementation of the proposed Project (para 2.10). During nego-
tiations, REB agreed to submit to IDA, not later than twelve months before
the commercial operation of each PBS is due to commence, a program for



-12-
recruiting and training staff required for each such PBS and a timetable for
implementation of that program (para 6.02(m)).
PBS Responsibilities and Operations
2.14      PBS responsibilities begin when a scheme is handed over to it after
being constructed and energized. The principal objective of a PBS is to
supply its members and other consumers with electricity. Its functions
include: (a) planning and implementing the expansion of local distribution
systems with financial and technical assistance from REB; (b) purchase of
electricity from BPDB; (c) distribution of electricity and making consumer
connections; (d) meter reading, billing and collection; (e) setting tariffs,
with approval of REB; and (f) providing technical and financial assistance
to consumers for wiring their premises and acquiring and installing electri-
cal appliances and low tension (LT) capacitors to improve power factors
(para 2.18).
2.15    About 110,000 connections (supplying about 237,000 consumers) had
been made by June 1984, and in FY84 the average number of new connections
made per month was 3,374. Total energy consumption increased from 44.97 GWh
in FY83 to 88.08 GWh in FY84, with an associated increase in average annual
consumption per connection from 660 kWh to 801 kWh. Operational data for
Phase I PBSs is given in Annex 9. Meter reading, billing and collection are
satisfactory in all the energized PBSs; all consumers are billed regularly
every month and in FY84 96% of revenues were collected on time. By October
1984, energized PBSs had constructed, with the assistance of local consult-
ants and contractors, about 400 km of additional distribution lines for which
REB provided required financing.
2.16      Losses in PBS supply systems have been falling since they were
energized. However, losses in some systems are higher than were anticipated
during appraisal of the First Rural Electrification Project (Credit 1262-BD).
In June 1984, system losses in seven out of 13 PBSs which had been energized
for at least two years were about 10 percentage points higher than the
anticipated levels, namely that losses would not exceed 25Z in a PBS's first
year of operations, 20% in the second year, 15% in the third year and 10% in
subsequent years. REB attributes these excess losses to the fact that trans-
formers are not fully loaded during the initial years of operation of a PBS.
Non-technical losses are believed to be low since members of a PBS perceive
that it is in their own interest to report any form of theft of electricity.
However, the exact causes of these excess Losses have not been ascertained.
In order to identify the causes of losses and assist REB in introducing
appropriate remedial measures, during negotiations it was agreed that REB,
with the assistance of its consultants, would carry out a study to determine
the causes of high losses in PBSs and recommend dated action programs to
remedy each of the specific causes of system losses. The study would be
completed by June 30, 1986 and its recommendation would thereafter be imple-
mented as shall be agreed with the Association (para 6.02(a)).



-13-
Advisory Consulting Services
2.17      The first agreement with NRECA, financed by USAID, to provide
general institution buiLding and technical consulting services to PBSs and
REB was signed in February 1978.  Among other things NRECA assisted in set-
ting up accounting and operating systems for the PBSs. These systems have
been reviewed and found acceptable to IDA. The initial consulting services
agreement with NRECA expired in July 1984; but was then extended to July 1987
under USAID financing. However, at that time the proposed Project is
expected to be at the initiaL stage of its implementation. Consequently, REB
and PBSs will still require institution building and technical consulting
services (para 3.08). In order to assist REB and PBSs in obtaining such
services, during negotiations, REB agreed to continue to employ, under terms
and conditions acceptable to IDA, consultants to review technical specifica-
tions, supervise construction, and assist REB and PBSs in developing their
technical and institutional building services (para 6.02(b)).
Power Factor
2.18    The large scale connection of motors used by industrial and agricul-
tural consumers may lower the power factor, causing increased voltage drop
and system losses. In recognition of this, REB has fixed a minimum accept-
able power factor of 0.85 and recommended that capacitors be installed with
all new motors exceeding 25 HP. To assist REB in pursuing this policy, the
proposed Project includes the procurement of about 25,000 kVAR LT capacitors
of various sizes.  These would be procured by REB on behalf of PBSs, which
would sell them to consumers for use in power factor correction. During
negotiations REB agreed to: (a) propose, not later than June 30, 1986, a
dated program, satisfactory to IDA, including the installation of capacitors,
to ensure that the power factor does not fall below 0.85, and (b) thereafter
carry out such a program (para 6.02(d)).
Reliability of High Voltage Power Supply
2.19    The success of the proposed Project will be partly dependent on PBSs
receiving reliable supplies of high voltage power from BPDB. DetaiLed plans
prepared by BPDB to give supplies to new PBSs have been reviewed by IDA and
found satisfactory. However, the reliable supply of power to the new PBSs is
of paramount importance. During negotiations it was agreed that GOB shall
cause BPDB to expand in a timely manner its transmission and distribution
capacity to provide reliable power supply to PBSs to be established under the
proposed Project (para 6.01(a)).



-14-
III. THE PROJECT
Project Setting
3.01    GOB attaches great importance to the rural electrification program
(para 2.01). A master plan for rural electrification was prepared by REB
with the assistance of their consultants (NRECA) in November 1982 to cover
implementation in five phases by FY2000. Rural areas are electrified through
newly formed PBSs, 33 of which have already been formed under Phases I and
II. GOB has now prepared plans to implement Phase III of the program. The
proposed Project consists of the first part of Phase III (Phase III-A). It
comprises the installation of new electricity distribution networks in six
proposed PBS areas; rehabilitation of existing networks in those areas;
expansion of the networks in five existing PBSs; and technical assistance to
strengthen the financial and institutional aspects of both REB and PBSs. GOB
is approaching other donors to finance the remaining part of Phase III (Phase
I}I-B) of the program (para 2.05).
Objectives
3.02    The main objectives of the proposed Project are to:  (a) install new
distribution networks in six new PBSs (Kishoreganj, Naogaon, Sylhet, Patuak-
haLi-Barguna, Narsingdi, Barisal); (b) rehabilitate existing networks in the
areas of proposed PBSs which are now operated by BPDB but which will be taken
over by REB; and (c) expand the systems of five existing PBSs (Laxmipur,
Bogra, Rangpur-I, Jessore, and Rangpur-II) to include six new Upazilas in the
PBSs (Laxmipur, Adamdighi, Dupchachia, Sundarganj, Bagerpara, and Pirgacha).
The proposed Project includes a total of 40 Upazilas covering an area of
9,100 square km. It would provide electricity to about 117,000 domestic,
15,000 commercial, 1,700 industrial consumers and 5,000 irrigation pumps by
1992 (Annex 11). On completion of the proposed Project in FY92 about 24% of
existing households, 36% of existing diesel irrigation pumps, and 52% of
existing industries using diesel engines would be electrified in the project
areas. The Project, however, provides the infrastructure required to permit
connections up to FY97 when about 38Z of households, 58Z of irrigation pumps
and 83% of industries could be electrified. Beyond FY97, expansion of the
system will be carried out by PBSs using their own resources and assisted by
REB.
3.03    REB, with the assistance of NRECA, studied about 140 Upazilas in 43
potential PBS areas (Annex 10) throughout Bangladesh to select, according to
a rating system (para 2.08), PBSs for Phase III of the rural electrification
program. Details of the proposed Project areas are given in drawing 18740.



-15-
System Design
3.04    The system design was selected after evaluating alternatives for the
primary voltage (11-kV versus 33-kV), types of poles, types of conductors,
and three phase versus single phase expansion. It was found that 11-kV was
the least cost primary voltage for both three phase and single phase lines,
together with both three phase and single phase transformers. ACSR conduc-
tors mounted on wooden poles were selected as the least cost design for the
lines. The selected consumer voltage was 400/230 volts. (Details are avail-
able in the Project File.) Compared with earlier concepts used by BPDB, this
design permits the use of (a) shorter length in 400/230 volts secondary
circuits; (b) reduced unit-size of 11-kV distribution transformers;
(c) increased length in 11-kV three phase and single phase lines; and (d) an
increase in the number of 11-kV three and single phase distribution trans-
formers. This design will continue to be used for the proposed Project
following its successful use in previously energized PBSs.
Project Description
3.05    The proposed Project (details of which are given in Annex 11) would
consist of the following components;
(a) construction of about 5,660 km of 33-kV and 11-kV
three-phase and single-phase primary lines, and about
2,850 km of 400/230 volts secondary lines;
Cb) construction of 22 substations 33/11-kV each of 5 MVA;
Cc) service material for consumer connections including service
connection, meters and LT capacitors;
Cd) support commodities consisting of vehicles, motor cycles,
tools, communications equipment, boats, etc.;
Ce) rehabilitation of existing 33-kV, 11-kV and low voltage lines
and distribution substations now operated by BPDB but to be
taken over by PBSs in the areas included in the proposed
Project;
(f) general plant consisting of local transport, office and
residential buildings including cost of land and office
equipment; and
(g) consulting services for reviewing the technical specifications,
supervising construction and assisting REB and PBSs in building
up their technical and institutional support services.

Project Cost
3.06    The estimated cost of the proposed Project, including physical and
price contingencies, local duties and taxes, is US$ 108.2 million. The
financing required, including interest during construction, is US$ 110.6
million. The foreign exchange cost of the proposed Project is estimated at
USS 63.8 million. The cost estimate is based on mid 1985 prices. Physical
contingencies of about 7.5% of all equipment and service costs have been
included. Price contingencies have been included at 7.5% of annual foreign
costs for FY86 and 8% each year thereafter, and 13Z of annual local costs in
FY86 and 11% each year thereafter. Taxes and duties amount to US$13.4 mil-

Project Financing
3.07    A proposed IDA credit of US$79.0 million would finance 100% of the
foreign cost and 49Z of the local cost excluding taxes and duties and inter-
est during construction, which would represent 83% of the total project cost
(excluding local taxes and duties and interest during construction). The
remaining 51% of the local cost, together with local taxes and duties and
interest during construction, wouid be covered by grants from COB to REB.
The proposed Project financing plan is summarized in Table 3.2. Cost overrun
and foreign exchange risk will be covered by COB.

Project Implementation and ConsuLting Services
3.08    The proposed implementation schedule is shown in Annex 13.  REB, as
the main impLementing agency, would carry out the construction works using
contractors engaged under LCB procedures. Technical specifications and
bidding documents would be prepared on the basis of design criteria given in
the master plan "Rural Electrification Planning Study." Although NRECA
assisted in the preparation nf the specifications for the First Rural Elec-
trification Project, REB proposes to carry out this task for the proposed
Project itself. NRECA will be responsible for reviewing technical specifica-
tions. However, the existing agreement between REB and NRECA expires in July
1987 and no agreement has been reached for its extension. Consequently, a
financing provision for a consulting firm, satisfactory to IDA, estimated to
cost about US$2.4 million (including salaries, fees, subsistence allowances,
international travel and contingencies), has been made in the proposed
Project. This consultant would provide REB and PBSs with technical and
institucion building services after July 1987. In the event that USAID
decides to continue financing the services of the existing consultants, or
any other agency agrees to provide financing for this purpose, these funds
would be reallocated to other categories of this Credit, if necessary, to
finance other eligible project components. Project equipment for each area
would be procured by REB under ICB procedures. The physical execution of the



-19-
proposed Project would be carried out by contractors engaged under LCB proce-
dures. A consultant, satisfactory to IDA, would be responsible for detailed
field services, system design and construction supervision in each area.
This procedure has been followed since the initial implementation of the ACRE
program; it has been reviewed by IDA and found satisfactory. REB has
assisted in developing an adequate number of competent firms to meet the
consultancy and construction requirements of the proposed Project. Provision
has been made to rehabilitate and upgrade old BPDB systems before they are
transferred to PBSs. During negotiations it was agreed that: (a) REB will
send draft bidding documents for the first tranche of procurement by Decem-
ber 31 1985; (b) within two months of the issue of the draft bidding docu-
ments referred to in (a) above, REB will send to IDA the draft letter of
invitation, TOR, short list of prequalified local consultants, and the selec-
tion procedure; and (c) within two months of issue of draft bidding documents
referred to in (a) above, REB will send to IDA draft bidding documents for
engaging contractors on LCB procedures, satisfactory to IDA, for the civil
works for lines and substations and erection and commissioning of the lines
and substations.

-21-
Procurement of material and equipment would be on ICB basis in accordance
with IDA guidelines. It is expected that foreign suppliers would submit bids
for equipment and material. Should a local manufacturer submit a bid, a 15X
price preference on CIF prices or prevailing duties, which ever is lower,
would be allowed. Minor quantities of materials, tools and spares and equip-
ment not exceeding US$100,000 each and in aggregate not exceeding US$750,000
would be procured on a LIB basis, satisfactory to IDA. In addition, minor
quantities of materials not exceeding US$100,000 each and in aggregate not
exceeding US$750,000 would be procurred on LCB procedures satisfactory to
IDA. Civil works consisting of office and residential buildings would be
constructed by local contractors and financed through GOB contribution to the
Project. However, civil works related to lines and substations, including
poLe foundations and control room buildings, would be financed by IDA, and
would be constructed by contractors. The selection of contractors would be
through LCB procedures which have been reviewed by IDA and found satisfac-
tory.
3.10    Separate bidding documents would be prepared for line materials,
substation material, and support commodities costing US$67.9 million. Bid-
ding documents would be issued in different tranches to suit the implementa-
tion program. All bidding packages and contracts over US$50,000 would be
subject to IDA's prior review.
Disbursement
3.11    Disbursements under the proposed credit would be in respect of
materials and equipment, erection and commissioning expenditure, and consult-
ing fees, as shown below:
(a) 1001 of the CIF expenditure of imported material for lines,
substations and support commodities; in the case of locally
manufactured goods, 100% of ex-factory expenditure, and in the
case of goods procured localLy 70Z of the expenditure;
(b) 100% of total expenditure of consulting services, including
inspection of equipment and materials; and
(c) 85% of che expenditure of erection and commissioning, including
civil works related to lines and substations.
These disbursements would be fully documented except for small civil works
costing less than US$20,000. In such cases, disbursement will be made
against Statement of Expenditure (SOE), the documentation of which will not
be submitted to IDA but retained for inspection by the supervision missions.
The standard procedures for auditing SOE's would apply. In order to
facilitate disbursement, a Special Account will be established in the
Bangladesh Bank (Central Bank) on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.



-22-
The initial deposit in the Bangladesh Bank would be equivalent to SDR 3.0
million.
3.12    The implementation program for the proposed Project, which was
prepared in consultation with REB, envisages a five year construction period
and the completion of construction by December 31, 1990. The disbursement
schedule is based on a period of 5 1/2 years, and allows for outstanding
payments, pending claims and retention money which will be paid after con-
struction is completed. No average disbursement profile is available for
rural electrification projects, and thus a disbursement comparison has been
made with the ongoing rural electrification project . The performance of REB
for the proposed Project is expected to exceed that achieved for the ongoing
project as a result of the experience which REB has gained during the last
four years. With the ongoing project about 40% of the credit amount has been
disbursed within about two and a half years of credit effectiveness. This
compares with 42.1Z assumed to be disbursed for the proposed Project. In
view of the past good performance by REB, which is expected to show further
improvements, the proposed disbursement schedule shown at Annex 14 is jus-
tified.
Ecological Effects
3.13    GOB has assured IDA that Bangladesh's existing laws provide adequate
compensation for properties acquired or damaged as a reszilt of projects
undertaken for public purposes. During negotiations REB also assured IDA that
any rights of way acquired for the purposes of the Project will not have
adverse impact upon wild life preserves (para 6.02 (o)).
Project Monitoring
3.14    During implementation the proposed Project would be monitored by REB
with the assistance of consultants. After completion, BEB should undertake
not later than six months after the closing date, or such later date as may
be agreed for this purpose, to prepare and furnish to IDA a Project Comple-
tion Report of such scope and in such detail as IDA shall reasonably request,
on the execution and initial operation of the project, its cost and the
benefit derived from it, the performance by REB and the accomplishment of the
objectives of the Credit.
Risk
3.15    The proposed Project is relatively free of complexities.  Slippages
could occur due to delays in implementation and shortage of linesmen. These
risks are addressed through the proposed continual employment of consultants,
satisfactory to IDA, and through the training program for linesmen
(para 2.13). Appropriate contingencies have been provided to cover cost
overruns.

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Rural Electrification Board (REB)
REB'S System of Accounts
4.01    REB's system of accounts was developed by NRECA, and is based on the
Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the Rural ELectrification
Administration of the United States, with suitable modifications to make them
appropriate to REB. The system is based on sound commercial accounting
principles and is properly maintained by REB accounting staff under the
supervision of NRECA. Under the First Rural Electrification Project (Credit
1262-BD) it was agreed that REB shall maintain records, in accordance with
consistently maintained appropriate accounting practices, to reflect its
operation and financial condition. In order to ensure the continuation of
these practices, during negotiations, REB agreed to maintain records to
reflect its operation and financial condition in accordance with appropriate
accounting practices (para 6.02(e)).
REB Audit
4.02    Under Credit 1262-BD, REB agreed to have its accounts audited by an
independent auditor acceptable to IDA and furnish to IDA not later than six
monnhs after the end of each fiscal year, certified copies of its audited
financial statements, the audit report, and its comments or, if necessary, a
plan for corrective actions. Although some delays were experienced in the
final selection of the audit firm, REB provided IDA with its financial state-
ment for FY83, along with the audit report, in January 1985. The audit was
carried out in a satisfactory manner. During negotiations, the C-OB delega-
tion indicated that the existing six months deadline for the submission of
the annual financial statements and the audit report is not realistic and
-:ould be changed to nine months.  However, REB will continue its efforts to
gradually achieve the six month target by FY88. During negotiations, REB
agreed to have its accounts audited by an independent auditor accei-.-ible to
IDA and furnish to IDA not later than nine months after the end of each
fiscal year certified copies of its audited financial statements, the audit
report, and its comments or, if necessary, a plan for corrective actions
(para 6.02(f)).
Onlending Arrangements
4.03    Under the first phase of the rural electrification program, USAID
agreed that its contribution to GOB, gr1 ts and loans, as well as GOB's
contribution required for the implementa. ion of that phase, should be passed
on as grants from GOB to REB. Under Credit i262-BD, GOB agreed on a dif-
ferent framework, under which REB would onlend both GOB's contribution and
foreign loans to PBSs. The Government contributions are to be provided as



-24-
grants to REB, while foreign loans have a repayment period of 25 years, with
an interest rate of 2% p.a. after a five-year grace period during which the
interest rate of 0.75Z p.a. is to be capitaLized. It was agreed that REB
would in turn lend the entire sum to PBSs, with a repayment period of 25
years and an interest rate of 3% p.a. after a five-year grace period during
which the interest rate of 0.75% p.a. is also to be capitalized. The purpose
of this arrangement was to allow REB to mobilize resources for the implemen-
tation of subsequent phases of the program, and for PBSs to service their
debts and reflect this cost in their tariffs. This financial arrangement has
been successful, and all subsequent lending for rural electrification since
the conclusion of IDA Credit 1262-BD, in 1982, for example by Kuwait Fund,
Finland and USAID has followed the same arrangement. USAID, has now revised
the terms of its lending arrangement covering Phase I to put them on the same
basis. In view of the widespread acceptance of the framework for the flow of
financial resources outLined by IDA under Credit 1262-BD, during nego-
tiations, it was agreed that, pending the review which will follow completion
of the LRMC tariff and subsidy studies (paras 4.09 and 4.11), the onlending
arrangements agreed under Credit 1262-BD would be continued under the
proposed Credit and that the foreign exchange risk would be borne by GOB
(paras 6.01(e), 6.01(f) and 6.02(n)). The conclusion of a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement between GOB and REB, satisfactory to IDA, would be a condition of
credit effectiveness (para 6.03(a)).
REB Financial Performance
4.04    REB raised about US$214 million from external sources to cover the
foreign costs of goods and services required for the implementation of Phase
I and Phase II of the ACRE Program (33 PBSs). COB made available about Tk
1,107 million (US$50 million 1/) as grants to cover the local costs of the
two phases up to June 30, 1984 2/. Based on REB's provisional accounts on
June 30, 1984, the total funds utilized in the ACRE Program were about
Tk 2,180 million (US$99 million), of which about Tk 1,620 million (US$ 74
million) represented the cost of the completed schemes handed over to PBSs
and about Tk 560 million (US$ 25 million) represented works in schemes under
construction. REB has not experienced any problems regarding the flow of
funds required to implement the ACRE Program in a timely manner.
4.05    When compLeted schemes are handed over to PBSs their total costs,
including those covered by GOB grants to REB, are considered as long term
loans to PBSs. AccordingLy, REB, because it enjoys a spread on the interest

-25-
rate and receives GOB's contribution as equity capital, is expected to estab-
lish its financial viability when PBSs start servicing their loans. Since no
interest on PBS loans fell due before FY84, and actual figures for that
fiscal year are still under preparation, REBts financial performance can only
be assessed in the light of its financial projections (Annex 15). REB's
relevant financial ratios for the period FY85-FY92 (Table 4.1) indicate that
the aforesaid spread will be sufficient to cover administrative expenses and
to realize an increasing net income.

According to REB's Presidential Ordinance, GOB is committed to cover REB's
administrative expenses. It was thus agreed under Credit 1262-BD that GOB
shall cover, when required, any deficit arising from REB's operations. The
need for this commitment will continue under the proposed Project, therefore,
during negotiations GOB agreed to cover, when required, any deficit arising
from REB's operations (para 6.01(b)).
4.06    The financial objectives of REB, as established under Credit 1262-BD,
depend on its ability to: (a) realize a reasonable margin of net income after
covering its administrative expenses and interest payable; and (b) generate
sufficient funds to meet its debt service requirement and to provide a
surplus necessary for future expansion. Accordingly, agreement was reached
under Credit 1262-BD that REB shall ensure that: (a) its administrative
expenses and interest payments in any fiscal year beginning FY86 shall not
exceed a maximum of 752 of the aggregate interest and other revenues received
from all sources during that fiscal year; and (b) its internal sources of
funds, including PBS loan repayments in any fiscal year, shall cover at least
1.5 times the debt service requirement. It was also agreed that GOB will
cause REB to adjust its future onlending rates so as to enable REB to comply
with the above provisions. Although these financial objectives have not yet
been assessed due to the early stage of REB's operations, its financial
projectic-.s (Annex 15), which are based on realistic assumptions, indicate



-26-
that it will be able to satisfy these requirements. During negotiations, GOB
and REB agreed that REB's financial covenants agreed under Credit 1262-BD
would be continued under the proposed Project, together with GOB's commitment
to REB to adjust its future onlending rates so that it can comply with these
covenants (para 6.02(g)).
B. Palli Bidyut Samities - PBSs (Rural Electrification Cooperatives)
PBSs' Uniform System of Accounts
4.07    PBSs have a Uniform System of Accounts based on the system prescribed
by the U.S. Rural Electrification Administration, in line with that adopted
for the REB accounting system. The system is designed to meet all the
requirements of commercially oriented utilities and is working successfully
in the 17 energized PBSs. REB, assisted by NRECA, is devoting serious
efforts to training the accounting staff required for the proper implementa-
tion of the system, especially in the newly formed PBSs. Under the First
Rural Electrification Project (Credit 1262-BD), it was agreed that REB shall
cause PBSs to maintain records adequate to reflect, in accordance with con-
sistently maintained appropriate accounting practices, its operation and
financial condition. REB reaffirmed that commitment during negotiations for
the proposed Project (para 6.02 (e)).
PBSs Audit
4.08    Under Credit 1262-BD, REB agreed to cause PBSs to have their accounts
and financial statements audited by independent auditors and to furnish to
IDA, not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year, certified
copies of such audited financial statements along with the audit report.
Accordingly, the audit agreement has been included as a PBS undertaking in
the sample Sub-Loan Agreement between REB and each PBS, which was accepted
by IDA as a condition of credit effectiveness. Regarding the existing PBSs,
financed by other donors, independent auditors have already been selected
and started their audits. During negotiations, the GOB delegation indicated
that the existing six months deadline for the submission of the annuaL finan-
cial statements and the audit report is not realistic and should be changed
to nine months. Meanwhile, REB will continue its efforts to achieve
gradually the six month target by FY88. Based on this consideration and in
order to ensure that REB continues to conform to the audit arrangements
agreed under the First Rural Electrification Project (Credit 1262-BD), during
negotiations REB agreed to cause PBSs to have their accounts audited b
independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and to furnish to IDA not later than
nine months after the end of each fiscal year, certified copies of their
audited financial statements, the audit report and their comments or, if
necessary, a plan for corrective actions (para 6.02(f)).

Tariff and Subsidy Study
4.09    Under Ashuganj Thermal Power Project (Credit 1254-BD), and the First
Rural Electrification Project (Credit 1262-BD), it was agreed that GOB shall:
(a) carry out by December 31, 1984, a study of the bulk and retail tariffs to
be applied in the power subsector taking into account the long-run marginal
cost of supply; and (b) implement by July 1, 1985, the tariff structure and
such other recommendations of the study as agreed by GOB and IDA. IDA has
been urging GOB to start the study, and in October 1984, GOB requested UNDP
to finance the study. During the appraisal of the proposed Project, it was
found that an additional study should be undertaken to investigate the finan-
cial burden placed on the Government by the rural electrification program,
including both current and capital costs of existing and planned investments.
The study should assess the extent of subsidies provided through such
mechanisms as onlending arrangements between the Government and REB, and
subsequently between REB and PBSs, the Government's program of subsidizing
PBSs during the first five years of their operations, bulk supply tariffs,
and PBSs' retail tariffs. In addition, the subsidy study should provide an
evaluation of the tariff levels which consumers would be able to afford and
the possible implications for the rate of expansion of the rural electrifica-
tion system. Following completion of the tariff and the subsidy studies, the
onlending arrangements, Government provision of subsidies to PBS's and both
bulk supply and retail tariffs would be reviewed with the Government in order
to develop and implement a program, satisfactory to IDA, for the expansion
and operation of the rural electrification program which would maximize cost
recovery within the limits of affordability and without jeopardizing the
economic and social objectives of the program. Due to the related natures of
the LRMC study and the subsidy study IDA prepared single TOR for both and a
project document was signed by GOB, UNDP and the Bank, as executing agency,
as a condition of negotiations. During negotiations it was agreed that GOB
shall: (a) within a time-frame, under arrangements and in accordance with
terms of reference satisfactory to the Association carry out, or cause to be
carried out, a study of: (i) the subsidies provided to the rural electrifica-
tion program, and of (ii) the bulk and retail tariffs to be applied in the
power sector, taking into account the long-run marginal cost of supplying
electricity and financial objectives; tb) promptly furnish to the Association
t   fmmendations of such study; and (c) by December 31, 1986
or such later date as the Association may agree, implement in phases revised
tariffs satisfactory to the Association, based on the recommendations of such
study, and such other measures as GOB and the Association may agree (para
6.01(c)).
4.10    The load forecast indicates that unless suitable remedial actions are
taken, the future annual system load factor will be lower than the existing
level of about 55%. Any fall, however, would be minimized if REB introduces
suitable load management measures and regulations, such as time-of-day
tariffs, use of control devices or prohibition of consumption in peak hours,
for industrial and agricultural (irrigation) consumers. The use of these and



-28-
other measures will be considered in the LRMC tariff study. As an interim
measure pending the results of that study, during negotiations REB agreed to
introduce, not later than December 31, 1985 appropriate load management
measures and regulations, satisfactory to the Association, so as to ensure an
adequate annual system load factor (para 6.02(c)).
Bulk Supply Tariff
4.11    Under Credit 1262-BD it was agreed that, until such time as a revised
tariff structure based on the LRMC tariff study could be introduced, GOB
would design and implement, not later than December 31, 1982, a method for
the calculation of the bulk tariffs to be charged to PBSs based on LRMC. At
the end of 1982, an acceptable methodology to do this was developed with
assistance from a consultant financed by USAID. Based on this study a bulk
supply rate of Tk 0.78/kWh was accepted by IDA. As a condition of nego-
tiations, GOB updated the 1982 bulk supply tariff calculations using the
previous methodology 11, and to meet a Board presentation condition, the bulk
supply tariff to PBSs was increased to Tk 0.95/kWh effective September 1985.
This increase is considered to be an acceptable step towards charging PBSs a
realistic rate for power supply, taking into consideration the existing level
of BPDB's retail tariff to its urban domestic consumers. Further, it was
agreed during negotiations that GOB shall (i) by March 31, 1986, recaLculate
the bulk supply tariff rate for the next fiscal year based on a methodology
satisfactory to the Assocation; and (ii) by July 1, 1986 or such other date
as the Association may agree, implement until such time as the revised
tariffs are introduced pursuant to paragraph (4.09) above, a bulk supply
tariff rate acceptable to the Association (para 6.01(g)).
PBSs' Retail Tariffs
4.12    Each of the existing PBSs has its own tariff which is based on a
calculation method developed by REB with the assistance of the NRECA consult-
ing team. The method has been reviewed by IDA and found to be acceptable.
The estabLished tariff rates are revised annually (the average annual
increase has been about 10% per kWh sold). In July 1984 the average rates in
PBSs were between 50% and 60% of estimated LRMC (Annex 9). Under Credit
1262-BD, it was agreed that until the tariff structure based on the LRMC
tariff study is introduced, the average rate per kWh sold by PBSs should not
be less than the average rate per kWh sold by BPDB. While the IDA financed
PBSs have not yet been energized, it was found at time of appraisal that
among the USAID financed 13 PBSs which had been energized for more than two
years, four PBSs had average rates below BPDB's average rate. However, PBSs'
tariff rates for all consumer categories, with the exception of industrial,
1/ The updating of the calculation indicates that the LRMC based bulk supply
tariff rate is about Tkl.14/kWh.



-29-
are higher than comparable BPDB rates. During negotiations REB agreed that
until a revised tariff structure based on the LRMC study is introduced, the
average price per kWh sold by PBSs, should not be less than the average price
per kWh sold by BPDB (para 6.02 (h)).
GOB Subsidy to PBSs
4.13    Under Credit 1262-BD, GOB agreed to subsidize PBSs during the first
five years of their operations. The subsidy was introduced in recognition of
the fact that BPDB's tariff for bulk supply to PBSs is significantly higher
than BPDB's subsidized tariff for its own urban and rural consumers. The
higher bulk supply rate was considered likely to lead to two problems.
First, it would discourage new connections in rural areas. Second, it could
lead to equity problems where BPDB and PBS supply areas were in close
proximity to each other. The subsidy was based on a formula which was
accepted by IDA. Subsequently, GOB applied this formula to all PBSs created
with the assistance of other donors. Part of the subsidy for the past four
years (FY81-FY84) has already been provided and the remaining part will be
released by GOB after completion of the audit of PBSs' accounts for those
years. During negotiations IDA was provided with a list of PBSs that either
have or soon will reach the five years limit. It was found that four PBSs
energized in FYs 81-82 succeeded in eleminating the need for subsidies; the
other PBSs (nine) have not yet completed five years of operation but their
subsidies are planned to be terminated by the end of this period.  Meanwiile
GOB would continue to subsidize PBSs during the first five years of their
operations, in accordance with a formula acceptable to IDA (para 6.01 (d)).
PBSs Desirable Financial Performance
4.14    Financial projections were prepared for the average PBS under
Phase III (Annex 16). The bulk supply tariff for PBSs is assumed to increase
at an annual average rate of about 14% between 1985 and 1993. Because of low
initial sales volume, financial break-even is not expected during the first
five years of a PBS's operations. Under Credit 1262-BD, it was agreed that
REB shall cause each PBS to take such measures, including adjustments of its
tariffs, to: (a) earn, after the first five years of operation, revenues
sufficient to cover electricity purchases, based on the economic cost of
supply, its administrative expenses, depreciation and interest expense and to
eliminate the need for GOB subsidies; and (b) generate, starting from the
seventh year, a surplus of cash equivalent to 20X of its average capital
expenditure 1/. The financial performances of PBSs under Credit 1262-BD have
not been tested against these requirements since they are still under con-
struction. During negotiations REB agreed that the above-mentioned agreement
1/ Based on a three-year average, including the capital expenditure of the
current year, previous year and the next following year.



-30-
will be continued for the proposed Project. Meanwhile, REB reaffirmed its
commitment, (under Credit 1262-BD), to cause PBSs to pay promptly for their
electricity purchases from BPDB in such a way that the unpaid consumption of
any of them - at any time - does not exceed the total billed consumption of
the preceding two months. In view of the fact that PBSs have only minimal
paid-up capital it was agreed under Credit 1262-BD that REB shall make avail-
able to PBSs: (a) short term finance necessary for their working capital; and
(b) the funds needed to provide credit facilities for the purchase of
appliances and members' house-wiring. During negotiation REB agreed that
these commitments would be continued under the proposed Project (paras 6.02
(i), 6.02 (j) and 6.02 (k)).
Rural Electrification Financing Plan
4.15    During the period of FY86-FY90 (the project construction period) REB
plans to: (a) complete the ongoing works of Phase II of the ACRE program;
(b) fully implement Phase III-A; and tc) start the initial works of Phase
III-B. The total investment required to carry out these works will be about
Tk 7,300 million (US$281 million), of which Tk 5,100 million (US$196 million)
will be in foreign currency and about Tk 2,200 million will be in local
currency (Table 4.2). REB has already secured all the foreign funds needed
for the completion of Phase II (about US$120 million). However, about US$76
million are still required in the same period to finance Phase III-A and to
start the initial works of Phase III-B. The foreign currency considered
under the proposed Project, US$63.8 million, will meet the financing require-
ment for Phase III-A.

accounted for by households is less than half of that which waa projected,
while the shares of irrigation and industrial consumers are much higher than
was forecast. This trend provides prima facie evidence that industrial and
irrigation consumers will substitute electricity for alternative sources of
energy when they are given the opportunity. This trend has beer allowed for
in the forecast.
5.02      The load forecast for the period FY85-FY93 was prepared using a
disaggregated approach. The base forecast was prepared for a Model PBS of
900 square km, and project PBSs were converted into equivalent Model PBSs.
The load forecast is shown in Table 5.2 and Annex 17. (Details of the
forecast number of consumers in each category, average consumption per con-
sumer per annum, etc. are available on the Project File.) The table shows
that significant changes are projected to occur in the relative proportions

of total sales accounted for by the major consumer groups.  Sales to residen-
tial consumers are projected to increase in relative terms, while those to
irrigation consumers are projected to become relatively less important. This
is a consequence of the assumption that priority will be given to the early
development of the irrigation load, and hence its relative importance will
decline over time as increasing numbers of residential consumers are con-
nected to the supply system.
B. Least-Cost Alternative
5.03      The proposed Project was prepared by REB with assistance from
NRECA. Each component of the proposed Project has been evaluated by NRECA to
determine its optimum design and capacity in order to meet the forecast
demand for electricity at least cost. The methodology, cost data and recom-
mendations have been reviewed by IDA and found to be satisfactory. Least
cost analysis has been undertaken considering both alternative technical
methods for the supply of electricity and the use of alternative forms of
energy, such as kerosene and diesel, to satisfy consumers' demands (Project
File). That analysis indicates that the proposed Project is the least cost
way of supplying electricity in the project areas and that the use of elec-
tricity is the least cost way of meeting consumers' demands for energy in the
projected uses.
C. Economic Internal Rate of Return
5.04      Benefits and costs were estimated, and the economic internal rate
of return (EIRR) calculated, for the Model PBS which formed the basis of the
load forecast.  Benefits were estimated in tcrms of consumers' willingness to
pay (iTP) for electricity. Both benefits and costs were measured in terms of
economic prices. The analysis was undertaken using a 30 year time horizon.



-35-
5.05      Investment and operations and maintenance costs for the proposed
Project are given in Table 1 of Annex 18. All foreign costs were measured
using border prices in terms of mid-1985 prices. Local costs were converted
into equivalent economic costs using the standard conversion factor (SCF) of
0.8. The costs per connection which w-uld be incurred by consumers, for
example those of house wiring and electric bulbs, are referred to as private
costs and are also shown in Table 1 of Annex 18, together with the costs of
energy and power.
5.06     Using benefits measured in terms of WTP, the EIRI  was calculated to
be 12.7Z (Table 1, Annex 18), which is above the estimated opportunity cost
of capital, 12%. The sensitivity of the estimated EIRR to variations in
project costs and benefits is shown in Tables 2 and 3, Annex 18. Table 2
shows that the EIRR is negative if benefits are measured as being equal to
estimated revenues based on 1984 tariff rates, but multiplied by the SCF.
This is because the marginal costs of electricity supply associated with the
proposed Project exceed the weighted average tariff rate. The sensitivity
analysis also shows that the EIRR increases to 15.5X if base case WTP for
electricity is increased by 20X.
D. Justification for IDA Involvement
5.07      In addition to allowing the forecast demand for energy to be met
at least cost the proposed Project will, through IDA involvement:
(a) extend the public supply of electricity to rural consumers,
thereby substituting electricity generated using indigenous
energy resources for other forms of energy, particularly
imported petroleum;
(b)  increase the supply and availability of electricity for
irrigation and motive power in order to encourage multiple
cropping, and the creation of both new 3mall-scale industries
and ruraL employment opportunities;
(c) improve efficiency by reducing system losses;
(d) assist the power subsector in moving tariffs to a level which
reflects the economic costs of production and distribution
and which also achieve a greater degree of self financing; and
(e) strengthen the institutions concerned with rural electrifica-
tion by improving their accounting systems and by providing
advisory consulting services.

factor (para 4.10);
(d)  REB will: (a) propose, not later than June 30, 1986 a dated

ti) REB will cause each PBS to: (i) earn, after the first five
years of operation, revenues sufficient to cover electricity
purchases, based on the economic cost of supply, its
administrative expenses, depreciation and interest expense
and to eliminate the need for GOB subsidy; and (ii) generate,
starting from the seventh year, a surplus of cash equivalent of
20% of its average capital expenditure (para 4.14);

arrangements, including the creation of a pool fund
through contributions from PBS's, for insurance of their
property or assets in such kinds and amounts as shall be
consistent with appropriate public utility practice and
acceptable to IDA (para 4.17);
(m) REB will submit to IDA, not later than twelve months before
the commercial opera 3n of each PBS under the proposed
Project, a program f : the recruitment and training of
required staff and a timetable for implementation of that
program (para 2.13);
(n) on completion of each scheme under the proposed Project REB
will enter into a Sub-Loan Agreement with the PBS under terms
and conditions satisfactory to IDA, including: (i) a repayment
period for the principal representing the cost of the scheme
of 25 years after a five-year grace period; and (ii) an interest
rate of three-fourth of one percent (3/4 of 1X) during the



-39-
grace period and three percent (3Z) per annum thereafter
(para 4.03); and
(o)  assurance was obtained from REB that any rights of way acquired
for the purpose of the Project will not impact adversely
upon wild life preserves (para 3.13).
6.03    The following conditions should be met before Credit effectiveness:

REB, satisfactory to IDA (para 4.03); and
(b) the final approval of the Project proforma by GOB (para 2.08).
6.04    The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit
of US$79.0 million.

SECOND RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
RURAL ELECTRIFICATION BOARD
Project Details
The design of the proposed Project is based on a model PBS spread
over an area of 900-1300 square km. Quantities of material designed for a
model PBS have been used for the Project. When the Project starts, the
new areas will be surveyed and actual bills of material will be prepared.
In order to start the project, 25Z of material included in Tranche 1 will
be procured without preparing the detailed survey and design. The sub-
sequent procurements will be based on detailed survey and design and will
include any adjustment in quantities of material required to be made out
of first procurement.
Lines
1.      It is estimated that the proposed Project wouls consist of about
30 km of 33-kV and 5630 km of 11-kV three phase and single phase primary
lines. The 33-kV lines would be for taking supply from existing BPDB
system. All lines would be on wooden poles. In addition there would be
about 2850 km of low voltage secondary lines.
2.      The main physical features of the lines are summarized below;

Load Forecast
1.        The load forecast for the period 1984/85-1992/93 was prepared by
the mission using a disaggregated approach. Separate forecasts were prepared
for: the number of new connections for each year of the forecast period, the
annual specific consumption of the t,pical consumer who had been receiving
supply for a specified number of years, losses in the transmission and dis-
tribution systems, and values for various coincidence and load factors. The
connection forecast is based on data given in a project paper prepared by REB
under the guidance of NRECA/CAI.1I/ That paper contains a forecast of the
number of connections in a 'Mode]l PBS', which is defined as an average PBS
area in Phase III-A of the rural electrification program. Project PBSs were
corverted into equivalent Model PBSs using the area of the Nodel PBS.  The
consumption forecast is based on historic data for PBSs energized in the
period 1980-82. After 1984/85 losses were assumed co decrease by 5Z a year
from the 1984/85 level of 21.3Z.
2.        The load forecast is given in Table 1.  Energy sales are forecast
to increase from 167.7 GWh in 1984/85 to 1247.3 GWh in 1992/93, an annual
growth rate of 28.5%. Total purchases from BPDB are projected to increase
from 213.1 GWh in 1984/85 to 1465.6 GWh in 1992/93, an annual growth rate of
27.3%. Required power is forecast to increase from 37.8 MW in 1984/85 to
506.8 MW in 1992/93, an annual growth rate of 38.3%. This high growth rate
is due to the decrease in the apparent load factor, from 0.72 in 1984/85 to
0.61 in 1992/93, as a result of an increase in the proportion of total sales
accounted for by residential consumers. The forecast fall in the apparent
load factor emphasises the importance of the introduction of load management
measures for industrial and irrigation consumers.

Economic Analysis and Economic Internal
Rate of Return
Methodology
1.      Benefits and costs were measured, and the economic internal rate of
return (EIRR) estimated, for tI- Model PBS which formed the basis of the load
forecast. Benefits were estimated in terms of consumers' willingness to pay
(WTP) for electricity. Both benefits and costs were measured in terms of
economic prices. The economic analysis was undertaken using a 30 year time
horizon.
Benefits
2.      WTP benefits were estimated by placing forecast electricity consump-
tion into two categories; first, that which was considered to be substituted
for an alternative source of energy (a diverted market) and, second, that
which represented energy consumption which would not have occurred in the
absence of the project (a generated market). WTP in the diverted market for
each consumer group was determined with reference to the total annual cost of
the displaced alternative source of energy, using data presented in the least
cost study. Conceptually this annual cost could be subdivided into an amount
which consumers would pay for electricity (a revenue measure of benefit), and
a cost saving measure of consumers' surplus.
3.      WTP benefits do not capture the full benefits of the project.  For
example, WTP does not measure the full benefits associated with the substitu-
tion of electricity for kerosene, diesel oil and lubricants, or the substitu-
tion of electric for diesel irrigation pumps. This is because estimated WTP
is multiplied by the SCF of 0.8, resulting in a 20% underestimation of the
border priced value of the reduced consumption of petroleum products or
saving in investment costs. Recognizing this, an additional benefit equal to
20% of the initial saving of fuel costs and investment costs for irrigation
pumps has been added to the estimated benefits (shown as other benefits).
The conversion factor for these benefits was 1, since they are foreign cost
savings.

ANNEX 18

Costs
4.      Project cost streams consist of REB investment costs, REB operation
and maintenance costs, marginal costs of energy and power, and private costs
(excluding tariffs) associated with the project and incurred by consumers.
Investment costs for a Model PBS were derived from the consultant's study and
suitably border priced. Additional connections beyond the first five years
require incremental investment by REB, which was assumed to be Tkl6.4 mil-
lion/year until year 12 of the project. Annual O&M costs were assumed to be
3% of cumulative investment costs, and were assumed to comprise 12% foreign
costs, 80% unskilled labor cost and 8% local cost. The marginal cost per kWh
was estimated to be Tkl.148 assuming a consumption pattern of 30Z in peak
periods and 70% off-peak. Long run marginal capacity cost, transmission and
generation, was estimated to be Tkl,505.3/kW/year.
5.      All foreign costs were measured in terms of CIF values in mid-1985
prices. Local costs were valued in equivalent border prices using the SCF of
0.80. The opportunity cost of unskilled labor was assumed to be 0.75 of the
market price, multiplied by the SCF. Project estimated costs are presented
in Table 1.
Economic Internal Rate of Return
6.      The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated to be 12.7%
using the foregoing data (Table 1). Sensitivity analysis was undertaken
allowing for variations in forecast sales, capital costs, and estimated
benefits (Tables 2 and 3). Table 2 shows that the EIRR is very sensitive to
the application of a multiplier to benefits for irrigation consumers. The
substitution of electric for diesel motors in existing PBSs has been accom-
panied by significant increases in irrigated acreage (on average 13.3 acres
per connection) and annual output of boro paddy (on average 29,260 lbs worth
Tk60,00/year). This generated benefit of the project represents an injec-
tion into the economy which will be accompanied by multiplier effects. Sen-
sitivity analysis was undertaken assuming a muLiplier of 2. This increases
the ETRR to 23.2%. Table 3 shows the effect on the base case EIRR of per-
centage changes in capital costs, estimated benefits, and so on.

a/  The table shows the impact on the base case EIRR of percentage changes
in base case parameter values. Thus an 8.5% increase in REB capital
costs would reduce the EIRR from 12.7% to 12X. Similarly, a reduction
of total benefits by 11.9% would reduce the EIRR to 10Z.
