MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE FOR AN
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR MANAGEMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Zai-e for SDR 9.0 million
(US$11.6 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms and help finance an agricultural
sector management and institutional development project.  The project would
be co-financed by a grant from Belgium for SDR 1.9 million (BF 100
million). IDA would manage the Belgian contribution in accordance with
IDA's Co-financing Agreement with the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium,
dated September 15, 1982.
2.       Background.  Agriculture and forestry hold a major share of
Zaire's resources and play a major role in the economy (over 30S of GDP in
1985). These sectors have suffered, like others, from the economie
difficulties that, since the 1970s, have stemmed from the deterioration of
Zaire's terms of trade, ill-conceived policies and poor investment
decisions. In 1983 the Government embarked on a comprehensive
stabilization-cum-liberalisation program with IMF support. However, public
management deficiencies have, inter alia, led to an uneven application of
policy changes and contributed to disappointing economic growth. The
Government's severe financial constraints require invesement objectives to
be closely linked to resource availability in order to achieve greater
efficiency with existing resources, staff and infrastructure. Since 1983,
IDA has assisted the Ministries of Agriculture and Rural Development to
prepare and implement their public investment programs and to strengthen
their economic analysis and policy formulation capacity through the
Agricultural Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 1244-ZR, closed on
December 31, 1987). While generally successful, this first project
(attached to the Minister's cabinet) suffered from a lack of integration
with the permanent structures of the institutions it supported. The
proposed project has been designed to be fully integrated into the
Ministries. It will also complement other donors' current and planned
interventions.
3.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Strengthening public sector
institutions is an important focus of IDA's strategy in Zaire, so as to
create and maintain a policy environment conducive to private investment in
productive sectors, with Government providing essential infrastructure and
services. The project would support three key elements of this strategy in
the agriculture sector: (i) improved public investment planning;
(ii) effective control of public expenditures; and (iii) civil service
reform. IDA's continued intervention in the agricultural sector ministries
wouldi contribute to improve public sector management, in particular through
publ:Lc expenditure reviews, improved cost-effectiveness and policy design.



4.       Prolect Obiectives.  The proposed project would continue to
strengthen key public management functions of the agricultural ministries
(economic analysis, policy formulation, investment programning, budget
preparation and execution, personnel management, and training). By working
through permanent governm-nt structures, instead of project-specific
management units, the project aims at institution-building. In addition to
this long-term goal, short-term objectives include improved public
expenditure programming capacity and the development of cost-effective
personnel management systems.
5.       Project Description.  The proposed project would strengthen the
government policy formulation and implementation capacity affecting three
key agricultural ministries (Agriculture, Rural Development and
Environment) through technical assistance, training and logistical support.
The project would include the following components:
I.    Support for Economic Analysis and Policy Formulation,
complementing other donor contributions, by promoting available in-house
capacity and strengthening expert supervision of studies and project
preparation. The project would operate through the Planning and Studies
Units in the Ministries of Agriculture, Rural Development, and Environment.
II.   Support for Programming and Execution of Public Exgenditure
by strengthening information systems and organizational structures
established under the first Agricultural Technical Assistance Project
(Cr. 1244-ZR) and expanding the scope of the project to include the
management of recurrent as well as investment budget expenditures.
1II. Support for Personnel Management to re-inforce the
government-wide civil service reform underway, through (i) an assessment of
the General Services Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture to
introduce procedures for sta'f performance evaluation; and (ii) a staffing
and functional review of the Ministries of Agriculture and Rural
Development and the design of human resource development plans. The
staffing and functional review would lead to recommendations on the
advisability of maintaining separate Ministries of Agriculture and Rural
Devalopment.
IV.  Training.  IDA would finance training as the donor of last
resort, based on a comprehensive annual training plan. Training would be
done mainly by local ivstitutes, and a critical mass of personnel would be
tr.ined.
6.       Project iManagement Arrangements.  To coordinate project activities
in the three ministries concerned, a Project Coordination Committee has
been set up, chaired by the Secretary General of Agriculture and including
the Secretary General of each of the other two beneficiaries (Rural
Development and Envirornent). An Executive Secretary to the Coordination
Committee, acceptable co IDA, has been appointed for the annual
programming, budgeting and execution of the project.  Annual Work Programs
and Budgets, agreed with IDA, would provide the basis for IDA disbursements
and budget allocations. Assisted by a financial expert, the Executive
Secr-tar' would also keep consolidated project accounts.
7.       The project, to be carried out over seven years, provides funds
for technical assistance, studies and surveys, vehicles and equipment,



training and incremental operating costs. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$16.6 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$11.2 million (68Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown 4n Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Zaire are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. A map is
also attached.
8.       Agreed Actions.  At negotiations, the Government agreed on the
following actions: (i) to include in the Project a short term study, to be
entrusted to consultants recruited under the Project, on the allocation of
responsibilities covered by the Ministries of Agriculture and Rural
Development; (ii) the establishment of the Project Coordination Committee
to oversee the activities of the three ministries involved in the project;
(iii) the appointment of an Executive Secretary, acceptable to IDA, to
serve the Committee; (iv) the selection of personnel eligible for
performance bonuses according to an agreed temporary list of positions; (v)
criteria for evaluating performance and awarding bonuses; and (vi) a Work
Plan for 1989.
9.       Benefits.  Project benefits would be the strengthened capacity of
the agricultural sector ministries to formulate appropriate sectoral
policies, to allocate resources rationally, and to develop their human
resources.
10.      Risks.  One risk lies in the high turnover of the ministers and
their cabinets, which has caused frequent changes in the organisation and
management of the ministries. The project is designed to strengthen the
permanent civil service structures, rather than the ministers' cabinets.
Another risk lies in poor donor coordination of day-to-day operations.
However, the donor community is supportive of the project, which was
designed in close collaboration with them. Through their technical
assistance, donors will costribute in setting objectives and in preparing
work plans and budgets for tche central agricultural services in the context
of the proposed project.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

TECHNICAL ANNEX
SECTION A. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Background
1.       Agriculture and Forestry hold a major share of Zaire's resources and
play a major role in the economy. They represented more than 30% of GDP in
1985. Like others, the two subsectors have suffered from the economic
difficulties that, since the 1970s, have stemmed from the deterioration of
Zaire's terms of trade, ill-conceived policies and poor investment decisions.
In 1983 the Government embarked, with IMF support, on a comprehensive program of
economic stabilization and liberalization. However, public management
deficiencies have, inter alia, led to an uneven application of policy changes
and contributed to disappointing economic growth. In the agriculture sector,
the lifting of market and price controls only eliminated a few of the many
bottlenecks inhibiting private investment and production incentives. Remaining
bottlenecks included: the continued deterioration of the interior road network;
the absence of a flow of improved technology to farmers; domestic credit
ceilings; oppressive taxation and smuggling. The Government's severe financial
constraints require investment objectives to be closely linked to resource
availability in order to achieve greater efficiency with existing resources,
staff and infrastructure. %."r recent review of the agriculture sector concludes
that improving the efficiency of some key public services is an investment with
high returns because in the present context it is the most effective way of
encouraging private investment and Zairian farmers to participate in thei trading
economy.
2.       Since 1983, IDA has assisted the Ministries of Agriculture and Rural
Development to prepare and implement their public investment programs and to
strengthen -heir economic analysis and policy formulation capacity through the
Agricultura. Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 1244-ZR, closed on December 31,
1987). While generally successful, this first project (attached to the
Minister's cabinet) suffered from a lack of integration with the permanent
structures of the institutions it supported. The proposed project has been
designed to be fully integrated into the Ministries. It will also complement
other donors' current and planned interventions.
Rationale and Issues Addressed
3.       Strengthening public sector institutions is an important focus of IDA's
strategy in Zaire, so as to create and maintain a policy environment conducive
to private investment in productive sectors, with Government providing essential
infrastructure and services.  Another important aim for IDA is to help the
Government develop the institutional framework in which donors will operate in
harmony and contribute to the accelerated development of the public sector
institutions they wish to support. The project would support three key elements
of this strategy in the agriculture sector: (i) improved public investment
planning (involving sector-wide planning of donor interventions); (ii) effective
control of public expenditures; and (iii) civil service reform. IDA's continued
intervention in the agricultural sector ministries would contribute to public
expenditure reviews, improved cost-effectiveness and policy design.



Details of Prolect Components
4.       Financing would be provided under the project for the services of long-
and short-term consultants, studies and surveys, equipment and training and
incremental operating costs to strengthen the capacity of the Ministries of
Agriculture and Rural Development in the areas of: (i) economic analysis and
policy formulation; (ii) programming and execution of publa expenditure; (iii)
personnel management; and (iv) training. The project would also include a
component to strengthen economic analysis and policy formulation in the Ministry
of the Environment.
5.       Economic Analysis and Poliev Formulation.  Lead responsibility for
planning, project Identification, statistical services, and policy analysis lies
with the Planning and Studies Directorate in the Ministry of Agriculture. The
Directorate has benefited from extensive training support and technical
assistance from USAID, Belgium and the FAO. The Directorate employs about
thirty university graduates, including 12 masters degrees and one PhD. (Five
more masters degrees and one PhD are being obtained abroad.) The project would
finances (i) the extension of two resident economist positions, one currontly
financed by IDA and the other by Belgium, as advisors to the Director ^f Studies
and Planning of the Ministry of Agriculture; ($$) twelve man-months of
additional short-ternm technical assistance for the Directorate; (III) a studies
and survey fund to finance studies, surveys and project preparation exercises
undertaken by the Zairian staff under the supervision of the resident technical
assistance; (iv) additional equipment; and (v) logistical support. An important
output of the project would be the Directorate's anmnal work plan, which would
include the activities of all the technical assistance in the Directorate (seven
from USAID, two from FAO, two from IDA/Belgium) and would be discussed annually
with the Government and interested donors to ensure the consistency of sector
policy. Activities of the Directorate would includes (i) agricultural
statistics surveys; (ii) analyses of fiscal and marketin8 constraints In the
agriculture sector; (i1i) crop and regional study updates; (iv) special
subsector reviews (dairy, sugar Industry); and (v) proparation of service-
oriented projects (animal health, extension) in collaboration with the Ministry
of Rural Development.
6.       Ministry of the Environment.  An IDA-financed assessment of the
forestry sector and of environmental issues, recently completed, has shown that
the Ministry of the Environment lacks the capacity to design the detailed
implementation measures of a broad policy for forestry and environment
protection. Current technical assistance is focusing on forest and wood
industries: the European Development Fund on a fuelwood plantation near
Kinshasa, and Belgium on the techniques of forest plantation and conservation.
The Ministry's desire to develop a comprehensive policy, including broad forest
conservation and agro-forestry intiatives, calls for the development of the
Ministry's economic analysis capacity based on the expertise of a sector
economist and of a resident forest micro-economist. Such expertise, to be
provided under the project, would strengthen the Government's contribution in
future multidonor initiatives to finance a sectoral forest and environment
operation.



Programmint and Execution of Public Expenditure
7.       Progranming and monitoring of public expenditure is performed in two
directorates of the Ministry of Agriculture. First, the Direction des Services
Generaux is responsible for preparing and monitoring the financial execution of
the overall budget of the Ministry, including recurrent as well as investment
expenditure. Second, the Direction de l'Administration Generale des Projete is
responsible for monitoring the physical execution of projects. Whereas IDA -
first Technical Assistance Project (para. 2) focused on the public investment
program, the proposed project would expand its scope to overall public
expenditure, including recurrent as well as investment expenditure. The
technical assistance provided under this project component would includes (i)
sixty man-months of financial expertise (reporting to the Direction des Services
Generaux) to develop effective co.ipsprehensive systems for budgeting, accounting,
and internal auditing of the overall budget (recurrent and investment) and to
review organizational and managerial arrangements for these activities; the
financial expertise would also ensure the proper management of the project funds
provided to the Ministry of the Environment; and (ii) sixty man-months of
expertise in the management of field services reporting to the Direction de
l'Administration Generale des Projets. The component would cover the Ministries
of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment. Equipment, training and
logistical support would also be provided to the Secretary General of
Agriculture to complement Canadian technical assistance, with the a&m of
improving the efficiency of the small corps of agricultural inapectors of the
Ministry, of Agriculture.
Ministerial Organization and Personnel Management
8.       While the respective mandates of the Ministries of Agriculture and
Rural Development are justifiably distinct, it is important to ensure there be
no overlap in the development of their Studies and Planning Units. A short toem
study, to be entrusted to consultants recruited under the Project, would review
the organization and functions of the two ministries and identify the means of
ensuring the most efficient allocation and use of their respective rosources and
responsibilities in general, and their study units in particular.   The
consultants would make recommendations by the end of June 1989, including the
possible merger of the two ministries.
9.       Within the Ministry of Agriculture, the Direction des Services Generaux
does not have the expertise required to prepare salary reviews, recomend
promotions or even keep accurate records on numbers of staff working in the
Direction. The Government-wide census, completed in November 1987, showed that
15% of the civil servants presently on the ministries' payroll were fictitious
workers. Personnel records containing only the barest of documentation have not
been updated in several years. No personnel evaluations have been carried out
for several years.
10.      The project would assist the Direction des Services Generaux of the
Ministry of Agriculture in personnel management and salary policy
implementation. With the help of consultants, an institutional assessment of
the Direction would be carried out by the end of June 1990 and a short- and
medium-term institutional development plan drawn up. Pressing institutional
issues include the rehabilitation of the basic personnel data management
systems, a review of the Direction's functions, including the distribution of



work load and responsibilities of each division, a review of the job inspection
function, and iutroduction of procedures for staff performance evaluation.
11.      Based on the analysis and recommendations of the institutional
assessment, the Ministries of Agriculture and Rural Development, with the help
of the expertise provided under the project, would undertake a staffing and
functional review of their overall organization, including field positions. Job
descriptions for the functions and positions identified would then be written.
Since the Ministry of the Civil Service is involved in a similar job
classification exercise in three other ministries, the Ministries would draw on
the methodology used there. In addition, the institutional assessment would
include the design of sector-wide plans for human resource development,
including a training and staff development plan for the three ministries
involved in the project.
12.      The Government feels that, despite on-going efforts to improve the
career incentive structure, civil service salaries will remain unattractive for
some time. At least in the short to medium term, performance bonuses will
remain an important source of income for civil servants, as technical assistance
is ineffective unless Zairian staff enjoy adequate pay and working conditions.
The staffing and functional review would include the definition of criteria for
awarding performance bonuses and of a system for periodic and fair review of an
individual's performance. In addition, the review would atdress the issue of
whether performance bonuses should be awarded on the basis of individual or
divisional performance. As performance bonuses were being awarded under IDA's
first Technical Assistance Project (Cr.1244-ZR), a transitional system would
apply pending the results of the staffing land functional review. Criteria for
the awarding of bonuses and eligible positions were agreed at negotiations. The
personnel management component of the project would include a total of forty-
eight man-months of expertise in human resources.
13.      Training.  The Ministries of Agriculture and Rural Development do not
have comprehensive training strategies or in-house training capabilities.
Although the Direction des Services Generaux has the mandate for defining,
Implementing and monitoring training policy, it does not have the expertise
required to do so. The Direction's role is limited to signing the travel orders
for participants already selected by other groups. Some of the training
responsibilities of the Direction have been taken over by the Studies and
Planning Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture. Thus, one of the
objectives of the project would be to clarify the distribution of
responsibilities. For the time being, training is generally financed by
external sources, is done on an ad hoc basis, and is usually related to project
implementation. Each donor has identified its own training priorities, and the
ministries have not yet compiled a complete description of all training being
provided. Under the project, an expert on human resources would assist the
beneficiary ministries in linking the training program (Schedule 2) to the human
resource development plan (para. 11) and in providing an annual update to
include the relevant training opportunities provided by donors. As many
overseas fellowships are financed by bilateral donors, the project would
concentrate on financing in-country training. On-the-job training and short-
term observation visits would be provided through technical assistance and
studies financed under other components of the project. Local training
institutes are able to offer courses tailored to the needs of the implementing
agencies; otherwise, overseas institutions, experienced in offering in-country



courses, would be found to teach two- or three-week seminars using local
premises. The project would finance course fees, travel, and training per diem.
14.      Prolect Costs.  The total project cost is estimated at US$ 16.6 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$ 11.2 million (67%). The
break-down of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The Project
would provide about 438 months of technical assistance and enable the training
of about 300 people. Equipment would include vehicles, micro-computers and
office machinery. Local price contingencies are based on estimated inflation
rates of 65% in 1989, 35% in 1990, 25% in 1991, 15% in 1992 and 102 in
subsequent years. Foreign price contingencies are based on estimated foreign
inflation of 3% for the first two years and 12 for subsequent years. Project
costs expressed in US dollars are based on constant purchasing parity exchange
rates. Physical contingencies include 52 for technical assistance and operating
costs.
SECTION B. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION
Proilect Management and Administration
15.      The project would be under the responsibility of a Coordination
Committee, chaired by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Agriculture. The
two other members of the Committee would be the Secretary General of the
Ministry of Rural Development and the Secretary General of the Ministry of
Environment. The directors of the services benefiting from the project (Studies
and Planning, Services Generaux and Administration Generale des Projets fc, the
Ministries of Agriculture and Rural Development, and the Studies and Planning
and the Services Generaux of the Ministry of the Environment) would attend
meetings and participate in the work of the Committee with their technical
inputs. The meetings of the Coordination Committee would be prepared by an
Executive Secretary, who has been appointed and is acceptable to IDA.
16.      The main mission of the Coordination Committee would be to examine and
approve the annual work program and budget, the components of which would be
prepared in the context of the regular budget exercise by the concerned
directors with the assistance of the Executive Secretary. During the budget
preparation exercise, the Executive Secretary would submit revised versions of
the work program and budget to the Coordination Committee. The project annual
work program and budget would cover a three-year rolling period. Each annual
work program and budget would include: (i) a brief evaluation of the previous
year's performance; (ii) a statement of specific quantified objectives to be
pursued and a description of the activities to be undertaken to achieve those
objectives; (iii) staffing and training plans; (iv) the project budget; (v) a
financing plan indicating the source of funds; and (vi) procurement plans for
goods and services, including the type of bidding procedures and timetables.
17.      The work program and budget for 1989 were reviewed at negotiations with
a view to coordinating the Government's sectoral planning and studies with IDA's
sectoral strategy and with a view to developing a detailed format for subsequent
years. Project cost tables would guide the preparation of the annual budget.
From the second year of the project, the budget would be formatted according to
the Government's accounting system (using the Plan Comptable National Zairois)
to facilitate audits. Furthermore, to assure balanced allocation of the



proceeds and of the counterpart funds, annual budgets would be reviewed by IDA
on the basis of the detailed cost tables available on file. IDA's review of the
approved budget would be an annual condition of disbursement.
18.      Financing.  Belgium would commit 100 million Belgian francs ($2.5
million) over three years in the form of a grant to meet expenditures for
technical assistance supplied from Belgium. These funds would be managed
according to the 1982 co-financing agreement between Belgium and IDA. The
remainder of the foreign exchange expenditures and a share of local expenditures
would by financed by IDA, as shown in Schedule A. The Government would finance
15% of project costa.
19.      Procurement. Methods of procurement for project services and goods are
summarized in Schedule B, appended. Services - The Government would recruit
expertise for the technical assistance, studies and training tasks of the
project under individual contracts or through consulting firms in accordance
with Bank Group guidelines for the use of consultants. Expertise financed by
Belgium would be supplied from Belgium. The qualifications, experience, terms
and conditions of employment of all specialists and consultants would be
satisfactory to the Association. Final terms of reference would be reviewed and
approved by the Association. Goods - Our country procurement assessment has
concluded that public procurement procedures are unacceptable to the World Bank.
Procurement legislation is being revised under the Economic Management and
Institutional Development Project (Cr. 1832-ZR). Under the proposed project,
procurement would use international competitive bidding, as described in the
World Bank Guidelines, for vehicles and equipment grouped in lots equal to or
more than US$ 50,000.  To the extent possible, items would be g:ouped for
bidding to encourage competition. Vehicles, equipment and furniture in lots
costing less than US$ 50,000 and not exceeding an aggregate amount of USS
200,000 would be acquired through local shopping.
20.      Disbursements.  Disbursements from the credit would be made on the
basis outlined in Schedule C, appended. All disbursements would be fully
documented except those for local training and payments against contracts of
less than US$ 30,000 equivalent, which would be made against statements of
expenditure, and for which documentation would not be submitted for review.
However, the Government would make this documentation available for review by
IDA project supervision missions and independent auditors. While the
implementation of the project is scheduled for five years, an eight-year
disbursement period is retained in accordance with the regional disbursement
profile for similar projects.
21.      Special Account.  The Government would open three Special Accounts (one
for each ministry involved in the project) in a commercial bank to expedite
disbursements with terms and conditions of operations acceptable to IDA. Upon
cefedit effectiveness and receipt of a withdrawal application, the Association
would make an advance deposit of US$400,000, US$100,000 and US$100,000,
respectively, in each account of the ministries of Agriculture, Rural
Development and the Environment, corresponding to six months' expenditure. The
Special Accounts would be replenished upon receipt and approval of satisfactory
documented evidence of expenditure to be provided by the project administrators
in each ministry. Should any disbursements be made from the Special Account
that are not acceptable to IDA, the Government would deposit the corresponding
amount in the Special Account.



22.      Accounts and Audits.  Separate accounts would be kept for all
expenditures under the project. The Executive Secretary would submit project
accounts to the Coordination Committee, consolidating the accounts of the three
ministries, using the assistance of the project financial expert as necessary.
His comments on the use of funds would be reflected in the subsequent annual
work plan and budget. The accounts and statements of expenditure would be
audited each year by external auditors acceptable to IDA and submitted to IDA no
later than June 30 after tSe close of the financial year. Agreement to this
effect was obtained at negotiations.
23.      Prolect Implementation Schedule and Prolect Readiness.  The proposed
credit ould be submitted to the Board in October 1988. There would be no
condition of effectiveness. Consultants are being identified with the intention
of posting them by early 1989. Project completion is scheduled for December 31,
1995. The closing date is June 30, 1996.
24.      Reporting and Monitorint. The Executive Secretary would report to the
Coordination Committee every six months on the _ogress of implementation of the
annual work program. The Coordination Committee would submit to IDA, every year
by March 31, an annual report, prepared by the Executive Secretary, with the
eonsolidated accounts.
