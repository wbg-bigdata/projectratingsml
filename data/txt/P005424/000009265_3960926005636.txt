SIXTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT (CNCA V
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:            Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole
Loan Amount:         US$120.0 million Equivalent
Lending Terms:       20 years, including a 5 year grace period at the Bank
Standard variable interest rate.
Project Description:      The proposed project would pursue the Government's
sectoral objectives being supported by the Bank
through the recent Agricultural Sector Adjustment
Loan (ASAL) (Loan 2590-MOR). The project would: (i)
increase institutional credit penetration in rainfed
areas to help ircrease agricultural production and to
assist Morocco towards reaching self sufficiency in
food stuffs; (ii) augment non budgetary financing of
agriculture through increased credit extension to
small farmers; this is aimed at increasing production
and farmers' income and at enhancing the role of the
private sector in the economy; (iii) upgrade the
technology being used by small farmers in rainfed
areas and increase land productivity by financing
more intensive use of chemical fertilizers, high
yielding seeds and small scale mechanization; (iv)
generate value added by financing individual and
cooperative on-farm storage to safeguard the prices
of cereals obtained by farmer, small- and medium-size
agroindustry, construction and equipment of
greenhouses for the production of vegetables,
and flowers mainly for export; and (v) provide for
institutional development already started during
CNCA V by: strengthening CNCA's management
structure; improving its lending appraisal
procedures; completing the installation of
the management information system in CNCA; and
increasing domestic resources mobilization activity.

SIXTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) has requested Bank
assistance to finance, with other cofinanciers, the Sixth Agricultural Credit
Project. The Project would follow five successful Bank-financed agricultural
credit projects implemented by CNCA. It would support Government's development
objectives through: (a) improving agricultural production by financing on-farm
investments; (b) shifting an increased share of investment in agricu'Lture to
the private sector; (c) increasing access by small farmers to institutional
credit; (d) increasing CNCA's financial autonomy and promoting the mobilization
of domestic savings; and (e) strengthening CNCA's management efficiency and
financial situation.
1.02     The Project would be implemented by CNCA and finance on-farm
investments undertaken by individual farmers and farmers' cooperatives,
investments for the establishment or extension of small- and medium-scale
agroindustries, and rural housing investments as well as the extension and
rehabilitaLl on of CNCA's branch offices network construction of a headquarters
building and technical assistance to CNCA for the introduction of medium- and
long-term planning and for the improvement of its Management Information
System (MIS). The Project would be implemented over a three-year period
(September 1986 to August 1989).
1.03     The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$720.3 million,
of which US$221.4 million (30.0%) is foreign exchange. A Bank loan of
US$120.0 million to CNCA would finance part of CNCA's medium- and long-term
lending, agroindustry, rural housing, and institutional development during the
Project period. The remaining investment resources would be mainly provided
by CNCA's own resources, sub-borrowers' contributions and by loans from the
Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederaufbau (KfW) of the Federal Republic of Germany, and
the African Development Bank (ADB).
1.04     The Project was identified and prepared by CNCA with the assistance
of Bank missions supervising the Fifth Agricultural Credit Project (Loan
2367-MOR). The Project was appraised in November 1985 by a mission composed
of Messrs. Lucca, Hovnanian, Ms. Effron (Bank), and Messrs. Diamond and
Barraclough (consultants), together with representations of the German
Government bilateral agency (KfW) and of the African Development Bank (ADB).

H. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Economic Background
2.01     Since 1978, the Government of Morocco has tried various stabilization
measures sulpported by the IMF to prevent a financially deteriorating economy.
These efforts included some attempt to contain the growth of domestic
expenditures, reform of tariff and interest rate increases, reduction or
elimination of subsidies, and improvements in management and financing of
public enterprises. These efforts were hampered by a number of exogenous
shocks: (a) the 1979 increase in oil prices, whici added to an already
sizeable petroleum import bill; (b) a severe drought in 1980/81, followed by
several poor harvests, which led to large imports of cereals; (c) increases in
international interest rates which led to a steep increase in debt service;
and (d) a decline in the world market price of phosphate, a major source of
Morocco's foreign exchange earnings.  These factors, combined with expansionary
public spending policies to carry out the ambitious 1981-85 Development Plan,
led to a further deterioration in the situation.  By end 1982, the Treasury
deficit had increased to 12.3% of GDP and the debt service ratio was 34.7b of
exports (up from }1% and 27%, respectively, in 1980).
2.02     By 1983, the financial situation required a renewed effort at
stabilization, structural adjustment and debt rescheduling. The Government
limited monetary expansion, revised investments downward, decreased subsidies
on food prices, and increased prices of fertilizer, electricity, water and
petroleum products. The flexible exchange rate policy, begun in 1980, was
continued and the external public debt maturing in September 1983-December
1984 was rescheduled. These stabilization measures were supported by an
SDR 300 million stand-by arrangement with the IMF. In addition, Morocco has
been encouraging the growth of the export sector and removing the bias towards
import substitution and inefficient use of resources. Industrial and trade
policy reforms, including reduction of import taxes', tariffs and restrictioiis,
elimination of export licensing and improvement of administrative procedures,
export credit and export credit insurance systems, have been supported by two
Bank Industrial and Trade Policy Adjustment (ITPA) Loans, the first in 1984
for US$150 million and the second in 1985 for US$200 million. Agricultural
sector reforms have been supported by the Bank with a US$100 million loan for
an Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL) in mid-1985 and include:  (a)
reorientation of investments towards on-going priority projects and activities
for completion or rehabilitation; (b) restructuring the pricing and incentives
framework to encourage growth in rainfed areas and shift production in
irrigated areas to more marketable crops; (c) improvements in cost recovery
for agricultural support services; (d) action programs to make the support
services more effective; these services include irrigation management,
livestock services, agricultural extension, research, fertilizer and cereals
marketing; and (e) replacing public sector investment by gradually increasing
private sector financing through increased lending of CNCA.
2.03     While these adjustments and stabilization efforts need to be
sustained over several years, information for 1983 and 1984 indicate that the
early results of the Government's adjustment program have been generally
positive. The current accounts deficit of the balance of payments decreased
from US$1.9 billion in 1982 to US$1.1 billion in l9831' and is estimated to
have remained at US$1.1 billion in 1984.'  GDP growth was low, however, at
1/ Before debt relief.



- 3 -
2.2% in 1983 and 2.4% in 1984 (in real terms) due to a combination of poor
harvests and the impact of the stabilization policies. Over the next five
years, Morocco should continue to address the objectives of improved balance
of payments by encouragirg investment in export oriented or import
substituting activities and of curtailed public expenditures by encouraging
domestic resource mobilization and private sector investment. The present
Project would help to meet these objectives.
B. Place of Agriculture in the Economy
2.04     Morocco's population is estimatei at 23.0 million (mid-1983) of whom
about 58% live in rural areas. During the last ten years, population growth
has averaged ..5% p.a. (4.2% in urban areas and 1.4% in rural areas). About
40% of the total labor force is employed in agriculture. While the proportion
of total Moroccan population estimated to live below the absolute poverty
level went down from 43% in 1970 to 35% in 1984, the improvement occurred
mainly in urban areas. The proportion of rural familles. living at or below
the absolute poverty level (US$239 per capita in 1979) remained constant at
45%, and the number increased to 5.3 million by 1980.
2.05     The value of agricultural output grew at 1.5% (in constant prices)
during 1970-80 period, lower than other sectors of the economy. Since 1980,
the value of agricultural output has decreased because of a severe drought
followed by several bad crop years, and for the 1980-85 period, it is
estimated that output decreased by an average of 0.7% p.a. Because
agricultural output has not kept pace with the country's demand, imports of
agricultural products have increased rapidly and now account for about 25% of
merchandise imports. However, because of the return of normal climatic
conditions, the 1985/86 harvest is expected to be excellent. The relative
contribution of agriculture to GDP has fallen from about 29% in 1960 to about
17% in 1979-82 (in current terms), and is estimated to have decreased further
to 14% in 1985. In 1982-85, cereals and pulses contributed to 36% to total
agricultural GDP, with livestock contributing 33%, citrus and vegetables 11%
each, and industrial crops and forestry about 6%.
2.06     Agricultural exports have decreased in importance, accounting fer
about 15% of total exports in 1985 compared to 38% in 1970 (current prices);
their value has stagnated in the last fifteen years and the agricultural trade
balance has been in deficit by about US$200 million, where it had been in
surplus up to 1974.
2.07     Since the mid-seventies, Morocco has had a widening of the "food-gap".
The rate of self-sufficiency for key items has declined over the last decade
(cereals from 86% to 60%, edible oils from 31% to 13%). Even for sugar and
dairy products where self-sufficiency ratios have increased (60% to 64% for
dairy products and 46% to 53% for sugar), the level of imports has hardly
declined.
C. Ag&icultural 0erformance and the Government Strategy
2.08     The recent poor performance of Moroccan agriculture can be divided
into two contrasting trends between the modern irrigated sector, which now
covers 10% of the cultivated land, and the traditional rainfed sector.
Government has concentrated 60-75% of its investment and most of the producer



-4-
subsidies in the irrigated sector. As a result, considerable progress was
made in farming techniques and yields, output from this sector grew at 5.5%
during 1971-85, and production of sugar beet, sugar cane, end dairy cattle
showed rapid progress. Morocco now obtains 45% of the total agricultural
value added and 60% of its agricultural exports from the irrigated areas.
Rainfed cultivation, on the other hand, which involves 75% of the rural
population and provides the bulk of the country's basic internal food supply
(cereals, pulses, oil seeds and red meat), remains largely traditional. Low
yields are the result of a combination of factors: climatic constraints, in
which 7 out of the past 14 years have been drought years, fragmentation of
holdings (typical plot size is 0.6 ha), insecure land tenure, poor farming
practices, inadequate use of modern inputs and poor support services, except
in small areas of special development projects. Potential does exist, however,
in both the irrigated and rainfed sectors to increase yields: in the rainfed
areas, mechanized land preparation, use of modern inputs and selected improved
seeds and a more intensive and rational land use would improve productivity;
in irrigated areas, improved farming techniques, greater cropping intensity,
development of complementary infrastructure and better maintenance could
expand production by as much as 100% over the next decade.
2.09     Within the general objectives of improving self-sufficiency of food
through increased production, iucreasing agricultural exports, and reducing
social and regional income disparities, the Government has committed itself
to a structural adjustment strategy for agriculture, aiming at accelerating
growth as noted above in para. 2.02, which has as primary objectives:
(a) restructuring public investment and expenditure towards quick
maturing and big return investments, while maintaining existing
infrastruicture;
(b) correcting prices and incentives framework;
(c) strengthening agricultural support services and improving cost
recovery for some of the services; and
(d) improving institutional capacity of agricultural policy planning and
analysis, to resolve basic issues of improving land use and
protecting the natural resource base.
D. Sectoral Lssues Relevant to Agricultural Credit
Institutional Credit and Low Debt Service Capacity
2.10     A key element in Government strategy for structural adjustment is to
rely more on private investment channelled through institutional credit, as
opposed to public sector investment. In agriculture, private investment now
accounts for about 50% of total investment, of which 50% is financed by CNCA.
CNCA handles about 60% of total agricultural lending."' Since public
investment has been concentrated in the irrigated areas, the development of
1/ The rest is mainly lending by commercial banks, which is primarily
short-term. The commercial banks play a minor role in financing on-farm
investments (less than 5% of total medium- and long-term credit to
agriculture).



- 5 -
rainfed areas has relied heavily on institutional credit and roughly 65% of
CNCA lending is targeted in these areas. In order to carry out its strategy
of gradual privatization of the economy, Governmenv plans to phase out its own
investments and make additional credit available chiefly through CNCA for
private investments in on-farm and market level storage, farm mechanization,
field irrigation facilities and agroindustry. The Project would be the major
provider of funds for the implementation of this strategy.
2.11     Several constraints exist to expanding the role of CNCA, however.
One is the limited savings and debt service capacity of many rural families,
shown in the Table 2.1 below.

In addition, because most farmers do not hold documented title to their
land, CNCA's established lending criteria have been based on a notion of
fiscal income (i.e., income estimated to be derived from existing land
holdings plus livestock) and have resulted in credit extension to a limited
proportion of small farmers and for smaller than requested amounts. Recent
1985 data indicate that CNCA is lending to only about 26% of potential CLCA
borrowers,"' (para. 4.12). To increase accessibility of farmers to credit,
particularly in rainfed areas, CNCA has begun to expand its physical network,
to open temporary credit outlets, and to develop a new credit policy on
eligibility, based on the direct assessment of farmers credit needs which
should increase the ceilings on the loan amounts as well as the number of
eligible borrowers.  The Project would support this effort (para. 6.11).
Deposits and Savings Mobilization
2.12     A second constraint to expanding CNCA's role is its ability to
mobilize deposits and savings in ordcr to provide an increasing share of
domestic resources to finance a rapidly expanding lending program.  Domestic
savings mobilization in Morocco has been poor and only recently begun to
increase,-Z  with a pa-ticular effort by Governmeat to reduce budgetary
1/  Cais.e Locale de Credit Agricole (CLCA) serves smaller scale farmers, with
fiscal income DH 50 - 6,000 (see para. 4.08).
2/  In the mid 1970's, gross domestic savings was 15^16% cf CDP, by 1981-82 it
had fallan to 9-10% of GDP and in 1984 and 1985 it had increased to 12% of
GDP.

deficits and contain the external debt. Mobilization of private savings to
finance investments has priority. CNCA with its large network of branch
offices is particularly well positioned to mobilize deposits and savings in
the rural sector of the econonmy.
2.13     Since 1975, CNCA's deposits hiave increased by about 20% p.a., from
DH 136 milllon to DH 821.6 million in 1985. A large part of these deposits
are institutional, from state-owned companies, however, and rural savings
are still not adequately attracted. CNCA has recently raised the interest
rates on deposits. by 1-2% in April 1985 and it has undertaken a more intensive
campaign to mobilize savings, including use of a "carnet-vert" (savings
passbook) system, rehabilitation of existing branches and expansion of banking
activities. Nevertheless, many farmers still prefer to store their wealth in
real assets such as livestock, or to invest, for the larger farmers, in urban
based investments, so that in 1984/85 only 14% of CNCA's resources were raised
through deposits and savings. A medium- and long-term strategy to increase
savings mobilization is therefore required, and would be developed under the
Project (paras. 6.05 and 6.08).
Agroindustrial D_velopment
2.14     Development of small-scale, relatively labor intensive agroindustrial
activity complementary to primary production has been constrained by a
combination of lack of entrapreneurs' experience in dealing with financial
institutions, a lack of technical and finan-ial competence to manage firms and
a lack of access to finance.1I  Under the ongoing Fifth Agricultural Credit
Project (Loan 2367-MOR), efforts have been made to strengthen CNCA's capacity
to assess rural industry potential, and to provide funds for financing
selected activities in fruit and vegetable processing and packing, milk, meat
and olive oil processing, flour milling and cold storage. Lending levels for
agroindustry increased from DH 25.0 million in 1983 to DH 48.9 million in 1985
or about 10% of total agroindustrial lending. Increase and regionalization of
agroindutrial lending was in part due to the establisht,ent of a special office
in Meknes, which actively promoted lending for agroindustrial activity. In
addition, CNCA is providing technical assistance to entrepreneurs on
legal, financial and technical matters and marketing assistance is being
provided through technical assistance financed by USAID. There is still a
need, however, to expand assistance and access to credit to small-scale
agroindustries to other areas of the country. Under the proposed Project,
CNCA would increase its efforts in developing a sectoral s :rategy to provide
credit, technical assistance and internal and export marketing services to
small-scale agroindustries in other high-potential areas of the country
(paras. 6.14).
2.15     Land Tenure.  Land owned individually (5.4 million ha) represents
about 74% of all cultivable land in Morocco, land collectively owned about
14%; the balance belongs to the state or other groups such as religious
foundations. The land tenure situation represents a constraint to
I/ Medium- or large-scale agroindustries, defined by an investment in
equipment alone of DH 5.0 million or more, are promoted by the Office de
Developpement Industriel and have access to several forms of institutional
credit.

agricultural growth. This is because land distribution is unequal, with 74%
of the farmr having 5 ha or less, owning less than 25% of the cultivable land
and 0.5% having more than 50 ha on average and owning about 17% of the
cultivable land (see Table 2.2). In addition, the land is highly fragmented,
with an average plot size of 0.6 ha, too small for efficient rainfed farming.
A third problem is that most private farmers do not have a documented land
title which limits their access to long-term credit for land improvements and
other investments. In addition, absentee land ownership may represent as much
as 30-35% of the land, resulting in under-use of resources and unwillingness
to invest in improvements, and farmers of collectively owned lands are also
generally unwilling to make such investments.

2.16     The Government's efforts to improve the land tenure situation have,
so far been concentrated on the redistribution of land regained from foreign
settlers and the development of a legal framework for land transfers in the
irrigation schemes. In the latter, land consolidation and titling programs
have been completed on about 460,000 ha and are underway on another
275,000 ha. The Government sees the importance of improving the structure
of land tenure in the rainfed areas and under the adjustment program referred
to above (para. 2.02) is taking the following actions: (a) acceleration of
collection of the statistical data base on land tenure and potential for
750,000 ha, partly funded under three on-going Bank projects'' and one
project financed by the Government of Canada; (b) land consolidation schemes
to restructure farms into economically viable units; and (c) introduction of
new legislation to modify the relationships between lessors and lessees in
agriculture, to be developed for review and finalization before December 1986
and to provide credit to farmers to finance land registration operations.

Detailed information on land holdings is essential for the distribution of
agricultural credit and improved land ten'Ue will expand the potential for
credit use and investment in improved operations.  In aC  tion, CNCA is
helping to accelerate the registration process (para. 6..Z).
2.17     Agricultural Extension.  Agricultural extension services are not
providing for an adequate transfer of available technology to farmers and need
strengthening if maximum benefit is to be achieved by the rural community.
Except for some crops, specific efforts, such as in sugar beet and vegetables,
the extension service has been constrained by a number of factors: (a) an
unfocused organizational structure at Rabat; (b) field level staff devoting
most of their attention to administrative and commercial tasks such as input
supply, mechanical cultivation, production and harvest scheduling and
statistical work; (c) a lack of technical specialists with ability to develop
simple, effective extension messages for extension staff; (d) an inadequate
number of field staff; (e) inadequate training; (f) inadequate infrastructure,
particularly field housing, and mobility; (g) inadequate operating funds in
rainfed areas; and (h) absence of organized linkage between extension and
research. Under the on-going ASAL (Loan 2590-MOR) reforms of agricultural
research and extension services are being undertaken, affecting both rainfed
and irrigated areas. These reforms are focused on low cost improvements in
the field organizational structure, development of work programs, training and
increased mobility within existing total staff resources, and strengthened
linkages with research.
Price and Subsidy Intervention
2.18     Producer prices are fixed or supported at minimum fixed levels by
selective purchasing by the Government for a number of basic products (cereals,
oilseeds, cotton, milk, sugar beet and cane) and have generally been maintained
at or above world market levels at the official exchange rate. These official
floor prices are, however, ineffective as only a small proportion of total
production (10-15%) is marketed through official channels. This is due to a
combination of factors which includes limited official marketing capacity for
domestic production and limited budget, both of which give priority to imports.
On the free market, cereal prices show sharp seasonal fluctuations, with
prices below official floor prices, except for hard wheat, by 30% to 40% for
up to nine months of the year. Fruit, vegetable and meat prices are not
regulated.
2.19     Input subsidies to agriculture amounted to DR 961 million (US$118 M)
in 1984, of which 35% was for fertilizers, 35% for animal feed and 13% for
irrigation water. In addition, other subsidies cover commercial services to
farmers in the irrigated areas and part of the costs of on-farm investments.
It is estimated that about 70% of total input subsidies benefit irrigated
farming systems, which represent less than 10% of the agricultural land and
contribute about 45% of the value added in agriculture. In order to reduce
excessive protection to irrigated farming systems and to encourage better use
of domestic resources in the dairy sector (over two thirds of dairy production
comes from irrigated areas), under the adjustment program the Government plans
to eliminate gradually the fertilizer subsidy, move to fuller recovery ot
water charges and of commercial services to farmers in the irrigated area, and
to phase out price and distribution control on animal feed. In addition,
Government also plans to operate a more effective price support program and to



9-
ensure producer prices at least equal to the prevailing world prices.  These
measures are particularly aimed at encouraging production of cereals in the
rainfed areas.
E. Bank Agi:cultwral SectorStrategy
and Performance under Previous Projects
2.20     The Bank's strategy in the agricultural sector has supported the
Government objectives of increasing agricultural production wherever
economically justified while placing, for economic and social reasons, an
increased emphasis on developing rainfed areas, where a large untapped
potential exists and most of the poorest members of the rural population
live. In the near term, emphasis is being given to (a) highly productive
projects which will increase foreign exchange earnings or savings; (b)
strengthening agricultural services at the national level in order to provide
an efficient support for regional projects and to address certain sector-wide
policy issues; and (c) adjustments in the prices and incentives framework to
promote more economic production, particularly in rainfed areas.
2.21     Bank Group lending to Morocco began in 1965, and to date, 64 loans
have been made and supported by US$2,608.5 million Bank/IDA funds (US$45.2
million of IDA credits). In agriculture, 10 projects have been completed
and 11 are underway. These include seven irrigation projects: Sidi Slimane
(FY65), Sebou I (FY70), Souss Groundwater (FY75), Doukkala I (FY76), all
completed, and Doukkala II (FY77), a Small- and Medium-Scale Irrigation (FY83)
and a Large Scale Irrigation Improvement Project (FY86); five rainfed
agricultural development projects in the Meknes (FY75), Fes-Karia-Tissa
(FY78), Loukkos (FY80), Middle-Atlas (FY82) and Oulmes Rommani (FY83) areas;
an agroindustrial and flood control project (Sebou II, FY74); a Vegetable and
Marketing Project (FY80); a Forestry Project (FY82); five Agricultural Credit
Projects (FY66, FY73, FY77, FY79 and FY83), four of which have been completed;
and an Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (2590-MOR) for which a first
tranche was already released because of good project performance. A second
ASAL is under preparation. Performance of the Agricultural Credit Projects
has been good.  OED reports are available for all four of them.-I  These
reports stress the contribution made by the projects to agricultural
development, their success in introducing institution building measures (CNCA)
and the successful expansion of credit to small farmers. Following is a brief
summary of their achievements.
2.22     The first and second projects (Loan 433-MOR, and Loan 961-MOR,
Credit 338-MOR) financed mechanization and modernization of medium- and
large-farms resulting in a maximum short-term production impact in an effort
to meet urgent domestic food requirements. Part of the Third Agricultural
Credit Project (Loan 1361-MOR) was directed to meet rural smallholder needs by
financing improved subsistence production. The Folurth Agricultural Credic
Project enlarged the project scope to include small- and medium-scale,
rurally based agroindustries to promote processing and exports. The Fifth
Agricultural Credit Project is pursuing the objectives of CNCA IV and

particularly strengthening the management structure of CNCA. All five
projects had a strong institutional impact by strengthening CNCA's capital
-structure and its lending appraisal and procedures, improving loan collection
performance and transforming it in an efficient credit institution. A more
detailed description of the projects' performance and sectoral impact is in
Annex 8.
Ul. "HE FINANCIAL SECTOR
3.01     Morocco has a well developed financial sector.  It consists of
(a) fifteen commercial banks having a combined network of about 630 branches;
(b) five specialized credit institutions including CNCA; and (c) twn savings
banks. Morocco has a Central Bank (Banque du Maroc) and a capital market
(Casablanca stock exchange) where stocks and bonds of private companies are
listed and traded. Medium- and long-term credit is provided to investors
mostly by three specialized institutions: the Housing and Tourism Bank (CIH),
the Industrial Development Bank (BNDE) and the Agricultural Bank (CNCA).
Each of these institutions caters to its respective economic sector and has
received Bank loans. In 1985, the banking system provided about DH 36.4
billion to the economy, about two thirds of which (DH 23.4 billion) were
short-term.
Commercial and Saving Banks
3.02     At the end of 1985, the fifteen commercial Banks had total assets of
DH 48 billion (US$4.8 billion). The eight largest banks account for some 92%
of total assets. Their branch network is unevenly distributed geographically,
251 of all branches being located in Casablanca where about 40% of deposits
are collected and another 50% of the branches in cities along the Atlantic
coast. In 1985, commercial banks extended DH 24 billion in credits to the
economy (or 651 of total credits), of which 902 were short-term. In spite of
Government encouragements, banks have been cautious in extending investment
credit, partly because of the possibility of making higher profits at lower
risk on short-term lending. ,At the end of 1985, their medium- and long-term
lending (DH 2,646 million) represented 20X of total medium- and long-term
credits to the economy. It represented 8% of their sight deposits (DH 34,055
million) and 24% of their term deposits (DH 11,151 million). About 25% of
all commercial banks deposits originated from Moroccan immigrant workers.
Commercial banks participate, under the strict control of the Ministry of
Finance, in the syndicated financing of production and marketing operations of
state-owned agricultural enterprises. In principle, they also offer seasonal
and investment credit to individual farmers. However, (a) their branches are
mostly located in urban centers along the coast; (b) they are profit-maximizers
and avoid making small loans with relatively high processing costs; (c) they
lack adequately trained agricultural staff; and (d) their lending is usually
restricted to borrowers who also keep sizeable deposit balances and offer
sufficient guarantees. As a result, their agricultural lending to individual
farmers is minimal.
Specialized Credit Institutions
3.03     Specialized credit institutions are responsible for the bulk of
medium- and long-term lending. In 1985, they provided DH 11 billion or 80b



of all medium- and long-term credit to the economy, CNCA's share was about
DH 1.5 billion or 12% of the total. Since 1981, credit extended by these
institutions has grown at an average annual rate of 13% p. a. (in current
terms), at the same rate as total credit to the economy.
Interest Rates
3.04     The Government sets interest rate ceilings on both deposits received
and loans granted by Morocco's financial institutions. Interest rates on
deposits have been increased recently in April 1985, to attract savings:
sight deposits yield no interest, except current accounts with CNICA (up to
3% p.a.); term deposits yield from 8.5% p.a. for 3-months deposits, to 12%
p.a. for 12-month deposits. The cost of rediscounting facilities with the
Bank of Morocco ranges from 4% for agricultural loans to 8% (basic rate). The
yield of Treasury bills varies between 10.5% p.a. for 6-month bilis, to 12%
for one year bills. Local currency bonds carry interest rates up to 11.5% and
are mostly issued by specialized financial institutions (CIH, BNDE, CNCA) or
public enterprises.
3.05     Lending rates were raised across the board in April 1985.  Maximum
rates charged by commercial banks on rediscountable loans (including
agricultural loans) are now 13% for short-term loans and 15% for medium-term
loans. CNCA's interest rates on loans are positive in real terms and
competitive with those of other financial institutions (para. 4.09 and
Annex 5). CNCA is providing an estimated 90% of investment credit to
agriculture and about 50% of production credit.
Recent Financial Sector Reforms and ITPA Loans
3.06     As part of the structural adjustment process (paras. 2.02 - 2.03),
efforts are being made to remove distortions in the factor markets,
particularly the capital market, while promoting competition in the sector
and reducing Government's intervention in the economy. This has involved a
reduction in the bias favoring capital by increasing the cost of capital and
reducing the subsidies to capital, which includes removing interest rate
rebates and shifting the foreign exchange risk to the specialized financial
institutions and their clients. The April 1985 interest rates increase
referred to above also made rates more flexible by setting minima for deposits
and maxima for lending, to replace fixed rates and/or narrow ranges of rates.
A Permanent Committee for Interest Rates has been established to review the
rates on a regular basis. In addition, to begin to shift the foreign exchange
risk on term-borrowings by the specialized financial institutions, the
Government has set up a Foreign Exchange Risk Fund to which these institutions
would contribute. The Government plans to shift gradually the full foreign
exchange risk to the specialized institutions and the ultimate borrowers.
This arrangement is part of the ITPA II program and directly affects CNCA (see
para. 6.21 and Table 6.1 for further details).'/
1/ Other changes have also been introduced: in reserve requirements and
obligatory placements of term-deposits and certificates of deposit, in
credit ceilings, and in the setting of bank commissions; all of which are
designed to promote competition and domestic resource mobilization by
banks.

V. THE CAISSE NATIONALE DE CREDIT AGRICOLE
A. Background, Organization and Staffing
Organization
4.01     Established in 1961, CNCA is a wholly government-owned institution.
Its objectives are: (a) to promote agricultural development in Morocco by
extending credit for agricultural inputs, investments and marketing to
individual farmers, farmers' groups and service cooperatives and companies
and (b) to mobilize savings, especially in the rural sector. To do so, CNCA
prepares and implements annual lending programs which must be approved by both
the Ministers of Finance and Agriculture, and it rehabilitates its branch
offices network and increases its Banking activities to increase deposits and
savings.
4.02     CNCA is administered by a board of directors and a managing
committee. The board of directors is chaired by the Minister of Agriculture
and includes representatives of the Ministries of Agriculture, Finance,
Planning, Interior, of the Bank of Morocco and of local agricultural
institutions. The managing committee is chaired by CNCA's Director General
and includes representatives from the bodies which are represented on the
board of-directors. CNCA's chief executive officer is the Director General.
He is appointed by Royal Decree and is in charge of CNCA's day-to-day
operations. He appoints CNCA's staff with the exception of the Financial
Controller who is nominated by the Minister of Finance. The Controller is
responsible for reviewing at year-end CNCA's financial transactions and
ensuring that they have complied with pertinent laws and the decisions of the
board.-" The Controller participates on a consultative basis at the
meetings of the board of directors. Neither the Board of Directors nor the
managing committee are effective bodies as their members with the exception of
the President and thte General Manager of CNCA, are little informed and/or
interested in CNCAs policy and operational activity. These bodies are
therefore of little or no help to CNCAs management in setting the
institution's policy or providing advice on operational activity.  The Project
will support the institution by providing a strong and competent managing
committee (para. 6.03).
4.03     CNCA's credit is extended from the headquarters in Rabat, 38 Regional
Branches (CRCAs) ' and 99 Local Branches (CLCAs),'3/ of which 43 offer
banking services (see Map No. IBRD 19570). Since the appraisal of the Fifth
Credit Project in 1983, 5 new CRCAs and 4 CLCAs have been opened. In
addition, 146 seasonal credit outlets, attached to CLCAs, have been opened
and six deposit branches in major urban centers have been added. There are
six Inspection Directorates (IRCAs)!' in charge of banking inspection,
coordination of credit activities, and undertaking special surveys and studies.
However, due to the rapid expansion of the lending program, additional and
more modern office space is needed. The Project will support construction

and rehabilitation of CNCA's headquarters and branch offices to improve the
administration of the lending program and the expansion of banking activities
(para. 6.08 and 6.09).
Staffing and Staff Training
4.04     As of August 31, 1985, CNCA staff numbered 2,159.  Staff productivity
is relatively high.  The number of loans granted annually per operational
staff is about 230 for CRCAs and 500 for CLCAs. The level of education of
CNCA's staff is adequate. Most administrative and account officers are high
school graduates or have a diploma in accounting. Middle and higher
management staff (11% of total) are university graduates. Every newly
appointed employee receives induction training from one to six months
depending on his or her position. In addition, the training department in
CNCA, established under the Fourth Agricultural Credit Project, prepares and
implements training programs in various activities (agroindustries,
accounting, banking activities) for continuous in-service training. The low
level of salaries especially at the senior management level is an issue. In
recent years, CNCA has been losing up to 10% of its more experienced managers
as they find better paid positions in the private sector. Some adjustment in
salary scales was made recently, and CNCA's management comittee has been
assigned responsibility of establishing salaries of high level staff on the
basis of market conditions.
B. Lending Policies and Procedures
4.05     CNCA's objective has been to provide maximum access to credit, make
the provision of credit rapid and simple and adapt credit norms to regional
agroeconomic conditions. Simplification of procedures and expansion of the
range of investments financed have been the main characteristics of CNCA's
credit policies since 1975. Lending operations are governed by "'Credit
Guidelines" which are revised every year in collaboration with MARA. These
guidelines are comprehensive and cover types of credit available, appraisal
criteria, financing norms, sub-borrower contributions, interest rates, loan
approval authorities, security for loans and maximum credit ceilings available
to borrowers. Lending procedures are different for commercial farmers,
clients of headquarters or CRCAs, and for small farmers who are clients of
CLCAs: Headquarters and CRCAs' loans are subject to considerably more
stringent appraisal criteria than CLCAs' loans for which procedures are
streamlined. Short-term loans are usually granted for periods of 3 months
(harvest loan) to 12 months and finance farm inputs and produce marketing;
medium- and long-term loans extend from 2 to 25 years and finance a wide range
of on-farm investments.
Head Office and CRCAs
4.06     The head office lends to a few large farmers whose borrowings exceed
CRCAs' loan approval authority, state-owned comranies producing or marketing
agricultural products, irrigation development otiices and agroindustrial
enterprises.  CRCAs lend to individual farmers with a fiscal income (Fl)"'
1/  Net income estimated for tax purposes.  Depending upon the crops grown,
real annual net tarm incomes range from 2 to more than 20 times fiscal
incomes.

above DH 6,000 (actual net farm income of at least DH 12,000 or US$1,200) and
to Agrarian Reform Cooperatives. CNCA has achieved a good balance between
thoroughness of appraisal and the objective of reaching a large number of
farmers with limited staff resources and operating costs. Field appraisal is
systematically undertaken for investments in land improvement, irrigation,
pure bred livestock, plantations, poultry farming, rural housino and for all
loans disbursed by installments.  On-farm appraisal is also carried out for
other purposes when considered necessary. Credit norms are set to cover about
70S of estimated crop production costs and 502 of investment costs.
4.07     Loan applications are reviewed and approved by CRCAs' credit
committee, which is chaired by the CRCA director and meets weekly. However,
Internal Credit Commissions (ICC) were created in 1975/76 to simplify and
speed up application processing. They are composed of the CRCA director and
two of his staff who can meet daily, if necessary, to approve short-term
loans. The type of guarantee required from borrowers is based on CRCA staff
judgment of credit risk. Short-term loans to individuals are generally
secured by crop liens and sureties and medium- and long-term loans by a
chattel mortgage on equipment. Loans for land improvement, irrigation and
constructions are secured by a mortgage.
CLCAs
4.08     CLCAs make loans to small farmers with fiscal income between
D3  50 and DR 6,000, which corresponds roughly to annual net farm income of
about DH 250 (US$25.0 million) to DH 12,000 (US$1,200).  Comprehensive lists
of farmers' FI are kept with CLCAs and consulted for every loan application.
As in the'case of CRCA clients, loan amounts are determined on the basis of
norms revised annually. However, there is a ceiling on maximum borrowings
intended to keep borrowing within estimated debt capacity of CLCA clients.
For farmers having documented title to their land, maximum short-term
borrowing is limited to DR 30,000 (US$3,000) and maximum medium-term loans
outstanding to DH 55,000 (US$5,500). For borrowers who cannot present
evidence of ownership (which represent about 952 of CLCA clients), short-term
loans are limited to 200% of their FI and annual medium-term loan installments
to 160X of FI. The ceiling on borrowing capacity minimizes CLCA lending
risk. This is important, because loan appraisal is based on desk review.
Systematic field appraisal and supervision of small farmers' loans (average
short-term loan is DH 1,700 or US$170) would not be administratively or
financially feasible. The FI ceiling is necessarily arbitrary, however, and
often not related to investment cost or actual farmer's repayment capacity.
As a result, credit provided to CLCA clients often constitutes less than 60%
of production cost and 50% of investment costs. Under this Project, new
criteria would be applied for establishing eligibility and credit ceilings in
two large regions where about 40% of CNCA's credit is extended (para. 6.11).

In addition, an appraisal fee- of 0.5% is charged on CRCAs and HQs loans1'
and a 0.75% commitment fee on loans over DH 100,000. All medium- and
long-term loans are also charged a 1% front end guarantee commission to
partially cover the foreign exchange risk. Interest rates on CNCA's loans
are now compatible with those charged by commercial banks for agricultural
loans, which range from 10% to 12% p.a. on short-term credit and from 12% to
15% p.a. for medium-term credit. CNCA's interest rate for agroindustrial
loans is 14% p.a. Bank projections indicate a decline in the domestic rate
of inflation from 10% in 1985 to 8% in 1987-1988. This would keep CNCA's
current lending rates positive in real terms during the project period.
However, if real on-lending rates were to become negative, credit rationing
would result, with large, low risk borrowers obtaining most of the credit.
Increase in the cost of CNCA's resources would also undermine CNCA's financial
viability. A mechanism has been established under the Fifth Agricultural
Credit Project to adjust CNCA's interest rates on its loans .o as to protect
its financial situation. The same mechanism would be applied under this
Project (para. 6.18).
C. Lending Operations
4.10     In 1984/85, total CNCA lending reached DH 2,638.1 million (Table 4.2),
up from DH 951.6 million in 1980/81, for an average rate of growth of 29% p.a.
over the period. In real terms, lending increased at about 9% per year.

4.11     Over the period, the share of short-term credit in total credit
decreased from 61% to about 43X. In 1984/85 short-term loans to private
farmers have primarily financed crop production (421), animal production (381)
and animal feed (121). Short-term credit to State agricultural companies,
which represented 20% of total short-term lending, was used mainly (721) to
finance, throogh the ORMVAs, industrial crop production (cotton, sugar beet
and sugar cane) in irrigated perimeters. About 45% of total mediUgl- and
long-term credit went to CLCA clients, 432 to individual CRCA clients and
the balance to Agrarian Reform Cooperatives (2%), State companies (31),
agroindustries (301, rural housing (4%). Four types of investment represented
more than 82% of total lending: livestock (40%), construction (19%),/'
mechanization (17%), and draft animals (161).
Credit Coverage
4.12     Between 1981/82 and 1984/85 total amount of lending to individual
farmers increased from DH 1,292 million to DHi 2,379 million, an average
rate of growth of 16.4% p.a.. During the same period, loans to small
farmers increased by about 29%. Excluded from these figures are loans to
Agrarian Reform Cooperatives, whose members are, by definition, small farmers,
and loans granted through ORMVAs to private farmers (many of whom are
small-holders) for the production of industrial crops. The extent of CNCA's
credit penetration in rural areas is illustrated in the table below:

Of the approximately 1.9 million farms in Morocco, 480,000 (242) have a fiscal
income of less than DH 501/ and only about 9% of them are eligible for CNCA
credit. In 1984/85, about 423,000 individual farmers had an active file with
CNCA. This corresponds to 28.71 of the total number of CNCA's potential
c-lients. In addition, it is estimated that another 100,000 farmers were
receiving credit through Agrarian Reform Cooperatives and ORMVAs.
4.13     About 67% of potential CCRCA clients, but only 26% of CLCA potential
clients were receiving credit in 1984/85. For the latter, CNCA penetration
was relatively high for farms having a FI in the DH 1,600-6,000 range (which
corresponds to approximately 5 ha to 15 ha of rainfed land). However, very
few marginal farmers with FL below DH 1,600 (about 5 ha rainfed land) were
actual CNCA clients, reflecting their low borrowing capacity and their lack of
participation in the monetized economy. The increase in the number of CNCA
clients has followed the expansion of the network of CRCA and CLCA offices.
In 1973, t.here were 21 CRCAs and i4 CLCAs; in 1977, 24 and 88 respectively; in
1985, 38 and 99. During this period the number of CLCA clients has increased
at an average rate of 15% p.a. A sharp increase in 1981/82 coincided with the
opening of 90 seasonal credit outlets to bring credit facilities closer to
farmers, while containing distribution costs. Given the already current high
coverage level of CRCA clients (67%), only modest scope exists to increase
coverage of th-is category of clients. Nevertheless-, the planned development
of CNCA physical infrastructure during the period of the Project (para. 6.09)
would permit an overall increase in the number of CNCA's clients, in both
CLCAs and CRCAs and as both credit and banking customers.

/h Including profits (DH 70.8M).
During the 1982-1985 period, total assets increased at an average annual rate
of 35% in current terms. This increase was mostly due to the growth of
long-term borrowings (51% p.a.) and deposits (262 p.a.), as well as from the
increase .n CNCA's own funds (paid-up capital, special accounts}' and
reserves) which represented about 10% of total CNCA's resources, and have
increased by about 18% p.a. since 1982. The provision for bad loans was
adequate, and retained earnings from annual profits were satisfactory (13% of
equity) and allowed CNCA to protect its equity from inflationary erosion.
Long-term borrowings amounted to DH 3,394.4 million as of August 31, 1985 and
represented about 53% of CNCA's total resources. About 95% of long-Lerm
borrowings were external borrowings of which DH 1,386 million (41%) were from
the World Bank. Domestic long-term borrowings amounted to DR 156 million,
less than 3% of CNCA resources, which indicates insufficient efforts to
mobilize domestic resources.
it Special accounts are funds managed by CNCA on behalf of Government and can
be treated as quasi-equity.



_ 19 -
4.15     Deposits.  Deposits' relative share (14%) of CNCA's total resources
decreased from the 1982 level (17%), as did the number of depositors, from
70,000 in 1982 to 58,000 in 1984. Deposits are primarily sight deposits
(85% of total) and are collected mostly by CRCAs (69%) and headquarters (29%);
little is collected by CLCAs (2%). CNCA has introduced banking services in
all CRCAs and in 9 CLCAs, while all CLCAs offer savings passbooks (super
carnets verts) to accustom small farmers to financ'al savings. Currently,
49 branches offer banking services (see map IBRD 17220) which represents about
7% of the total Moroccan domestic banking network. However, in spite of
certain competitive advantages,"' CNCA has been only moderately successful
in mobilizing domestic resources. To increase significantly private savings
mobilization, CNCA will have to concentrate on the following areas:  (a)
improvement of the physical aspect of its branch offices assigned to savings
mobilization; (b) diversification of financial instruments available to savers
by promoting the use of checks, promoting long-term saving plans for home
construction, and issuance of bonds; and (c) training of personnel in the
promotion and administration of banking activities.
4.16     To channel more domestic resources into agriculture and to allow CNCA
to meet vastly increased credit demand after the 1980/81 drought, commercial
banks were required to invest 3.5% of their deposits at the Bank of Morocco
into CNCA in the form of one-year bonds bearing a 3.0% p.a. interest rate. As
of August 31, 1985, the total amount of these bonds was DH 900.1 million or
14% of CNCA's total resources. Since CNCA's financial situation has improved
in recent years, it will, under the Project, seek alternative sources of funds
so as to eliminate its recourse to these preferential resources and raise an
equivalent amount of resources in the money markets (para. 6.19).
Loan Recoveries
4.17     CNCA recovery procedures are efficient and have the full backing of
the Government. As a result, recovery rates have generally been good. The
levels of recovery during the 1982-85 period are shown below:

4-.18    As of=August 31, 1985, total overdue stood at DR 894.8 million or
20.3% of the total outstanding portfolio.  However, as loans normally fall due
in the July-August period, a large portion of the loans shown overdue as of
August 31, the end of CNCA's fiscal year, is in fact recovered before the end
of the calendar year. Loans overdue for more than 15 months amounted to
DR 245.0 million of total portfolio. As of August 31, 1985, total provisions
for doubtful loans amounted to DH 218 million, i.e. 89% of loans overdue by
more than 15 months or 3.5% of total outstanding portfolio.  In view of CNCA's
strict recovery procedures such levels are considered satisfactory.
Financial Position
4.19     CNCA's Balance Sheets for the period of 1981/82 to 1984/85 are
presented in Annex 6.  In current terms, CNCA's total assets increased by
351 p.a. during the 1982-85 period. This growth occurred more rapidly in
liabilities than in equity with the result that the Equity to Total Assets
Ratio declined from 13.92 to 12.3% over the period. This ratio is still
satisfactory and reflects an adequate capitalization. CNCA's long-term
borrowings grew et an average rate of 51% p.a. over the period, much faster
than its equity (182 p.a.). As a result, the Long-Term Debt to Equity Ratio
increased from 2.6 to 5.1 as of August 31, 1985.   This is still relatively
-ow and within the 6 to I ceiling set under the Fifth Agricultural Credit
Project (Loan 2367-MOR). CNCA's current ratio increased from 1.3 to 1.4, the
latter figure still indicating an acceptable and improving liquidity and
short-term assets position.
Profitability
4.20     CNCA's total operating income increased at an average annual rate of
301 over the 1982-85 period, less rapidly than total assets (352 p.a.) but
faster than average loans outstanding (252). CNCA's Income Statements during
this period are presented in Annex 6 and suiimarized below:

In 1984/85, CNCA's financial costs were 512 of total costs as in 1981/82. The
average cost of borrowed funds was 4.8g and average cost of total resources
was 4.22.  Staff expenses were 26% of total expenses, down from 337 in 1981-82,
depreciation expenses increased slightly as a percentage of total expenses
from 1.42 to 1.6? reflecting recent investment in physical infrastructure.
Net profits increased from DH 19.1 million in 1981/82 to DU 70.8 million in
1984/85, an increase of 55% p.a. In 1984/85 profits represenited a 13.6%
return on equity as against 5.3% in 1981/82. This increase in profitability
has made possible an increase in reserves of about 522 during the period.
CLCA Operations
4.21     CLCA accounts are kept separate from HQsICRCAs accounts, though
the two are consolidated at the end of the year. Because of the higher cost
involved in lernding to small farmers, CLCAs have consistently experienced
losses before 1981/82. CLCA's operating losses were compensated by a
Government subsidy. A mechanism to ensure that CLCAs would generate
sufficient income through its operations to eliminate the need for Government
subsidy was proposed in the Fifth Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 2367-MOR)
and since 1984 the CLCA operations have generated sufficient income to cover
the costs and to generate a small profit in some years.
E. CNCA Objectives and Development Strategy
4.22     The Government has continued to emphasize the role of CNCA in the
development of the country's agricultural sector, and defined the main themes
of CNCA's future objectives and organization: (a) expansion of farmers'
coverage and regionalization of activities; (b) increased mobilization of
domestic savings; and (c) financial autonomy and viability of the institution.
CNCA is a well managed financial institution which has grown substantially in
operational efficiency and profitability in recent years and has successfully
met various operational criteria established during the Fifth Agricultural
Credit Project. In spite of this, CNCA faces certain constraints. In the 25
years since its establishment, CNCA has grown enormously in size, geographic
spread, scope of activity and organizational complexity. Recently, its
management committee has been strengthened and will develop long-term plans.
Also, a critical review will be undertaken under the project to examine CNCA's
future role in the agricultural sector and ensure that it continues to have
an effective role as a specialized development bank in the longer-term
(para. 6.02).  At the same time, changes under the Project would be made
within CNCA to allow it to operate more effectively. These include: (a)
development of a long-term planning system (para. 6.05); and (b) establishment
of an efficient Management Information System (MIS) to allow for a more
efficient administration and for effective planning, budgeting and monitoring
(para. 6.06).
F. CNCA Projected Lending Progi-am and Financing Requirements
(1986/87-1987/88)
4.23     Based on past trends, Government's objectives and policies for the
development of the agricultural sector and on CNCA's own development strategy,
including a major program to expand credit outlets, CNCA's total lending could
reach as much as DH 4,752 million in 1987/88, provided normal climatic
conditions are experienced, for an annual growth in real terms of about 15%.



- 22 -
CNCA's projected lending program is given in Annex 1. The resources necessary
to finance such a lending program will primarily come from domestic sources
through (a) credit recoveries; (b) increased deposit mobilization; and (c)
financial revenues. The remaining financing needs will be financed from
external sources. The Project's cofinanciers would provide the external
financing necessary. Rediscounting facilities available t3 CNCA from the Bank
of Morocco and the expected increase in deposits (mostly sight deposits) would
provide CNCA with the resources necessary to finance its short-term lending
program. The Project would provide CNCA with long-term resources to finance
its medium- and long-term lending program.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Rationale for Bank Involvement and Project Objectives
5.01     The Project would be in line with Government objectives and Bank
strategy to assist Morocco in increasing the impact of credit in agricultural
development. It would specially be aimed at: (a) increasing agricultural
production to improve food self sufficiency; (b) favoring private investment
in high return low costs projects and for export production; and (c) improving
the sectoral policy framework by strengthening CNCA policy making role and its
financial performance. The Project would finance 98% of CNCA's medium- and
long-term lending program. Excluded is the financing of State enterprises
because of their inefficient administration.
5.02     Bank involvement is justified because the Project is in line with the
Bank assistance strategy for Morocco. It would Lelp the Moroccan Government
improve the balance between private and public sector investment, help the
Government mobilize cofinancing and assist the Government in the process of
rehabilitation of public enterprises (CNCA).
Project Objectives
5.03     The Project is conceived and designed to:  (a) pursue the Government's
sectoral objectives which are being supported by the Bank through the recent
ASAL (Loan 2590-MOR). The Project objectives relevant to Government policy
are: (i) to increase institutional credit penetration in rainfed areas where
present CNCA lending is estimated to reach only about 30% of eligible farmers,
and to increase dairy, meat and cereal production and self sufficiency in food
stuff availability; (ii) to maximize non budgetary financing of agriculture
through increased credit extension to small farmers; this is aimed at
increasing production and farmers' income and at enhancing the role of the
private sector in the economy; (iii) to adapt the pattern of cultivation of
small farmers in- rainfed areas to increase land productivity by financing more
intensive use of chemical fertilizers, high yielding seeds and small scale
mechanization; (iv) to generate value added by financing individual and
cooperative on-farm storage to prevent the collapse of the prices of cereals
at cropping time, small- and medium-size agroindustry, construction and
equipment of greenhouses for the production of vegetables, bananas and flowers
mainly for export; and (b) continue emphasizing institutional development
already started during CNCA V by:  (i) strengthening CNCA's management,
structure; (i) improving its lending appraisal procedures; (iii) completing
the installation of the management information system in CNCA; and



- 23 -
(iv) increasing domestic resotrces mobilization activity.
B. Summary Project Description
5.04     To achieve its objectives, the Project would support over a three
year period (September 1986 - August 1989) the following activities:
(a) Investment Credit. To finance (i) on-farm investment by private
farmers and agrarian reform cooperatives; (ii) investment by small-
and medium-scale agroindustries; (iii) investment in rural housing;
(b)  Institutional Development.  To finance (i) the procurement and the
installation of microcomputers in CNCA's branch offices; (ii) the
construction and rehabilitation of 48 CNCA's branch offices and
part of the construction of the new headquarters; (iii) technical
assistance for the establishment of a system of medium- and long-term
planning and an MIS; and
(c)  Technical Assistance.  To finance consulting services required for
management support and to support Project implementation.
C. Detailed Features
Investment Credit
5.05     Investment 1ending to Small Farmers.  This-component would finance
about 200,000 loans for on-farm investment by small farmers clients of
CLCA's. Investment would mainly be for livestock, draft animals, stables,
wells and pumps, land improvement, small mechanization and on-farm storage.
The loans for this component (US$225.0 million) would represent about 44% of
total lending under the Project.
5.06     Investment Lending to Medium and Large Farmers.  This component
would finance about 60,000 subloans to clients of CRCAs or CNCA headquarters
including Agrarian Reform cooperatives for on-farm investments. Lending would
be mainly for agricultural machinery such as tractors and harvesters,
transport, wells and irrigation, and greenhouses construction and equipment,
plantations, livestock and land improvement. In addition, CNCA would finance
maintenance operations undertaken by small holders in large irrigation
perimeters under the supervision of ORMVAs. The loans for this component
(US$241 million) would represent about 47% of total lending under the Project.
5.07     Lending to Agroindustries.  This component would finance investment
in small- and medium-scale agroindustries consisting of fruit and vegetable
packing and processing, olive oil processing and dairy production, flour
milling, meat processing, poultry, animal feed and storage. Lending for this
component (US$19.0 million) would represent aibout 4% of total lending.
5.08     Lending for the Construction of Rural Housing.  The main objective of
this component is to provide limited credit for construction of rural housing
for agricultural laborers and other rural families to reduce migration to



-24-
urban areas.  This component will finance about 2,500 - 3,000 loans for Low
and medium income families. The total amount of lending under this component
(US$14.8 million) would represent about 32 of total lending.
Institutional Development
5.09     CNCA Physical Infrastructure.  The component would finance a two year
phase of the Borrower's program of construction and rehabilitation of CNCA's
branch offices to establish a more suitable environment for banking operations
that would facilitate physical access of farmers to CNCA's banking facilities
for credit and deposits operations. In addition, the loan would finance the
foreign exchange part of the costs of the new CNCA headquarters in Rabat. The
new construction will permit a centralization of CNCA's operations from their
present locations, scattered throughout the city, in one efficiently designed
building.  The total cost of this component would be US$7.5 million or about
1.5Z of total lending.
5.10     Establishment of the MIS and of the Planning System.  This component
would finance soft and hardware computer facilities and the procurement of
about 150 microcomputers to speed up and improve processing of accounting and
administrative operations in about 125 branch offices and agencies and the
establishment in CNCA of a budgeting and planning system.
Technical Assistance Component
5.11     To assist implementing Project objectives, the Project would finance
technical assistance by providing: (a) a total of 40 man/months consultants
to complete the establishment of the MIS (para. 6.07); (b) 14 man/months of
c.onsultants services to define proper budgeting and medium- and long-term
planning for CNCA policy and activities including the setting of targets for
lending, savings and deposits collection, banking activities (para. 6.05);
(c) 10 man/months of consultant activities to supervise CNCA's headquarters
construction and rehabilitation (paras. 6.09 and 6.10).
D. Project Cost Estimates
5.12     Total Project costs are estimated at DH 7,203.0 million (US$720.3)
30% of which, or about US$221.4 million, would be foreign exchange. Cost
estimates include taxes and duties of about DH 782.7 million or 112 of Project
cost. Base costs are estimated at June 1986 prices. The Project credit
component is established in financial terms on projections calculated on the
basis of historical lending and on the increase in lending expected to take
place as a consequence of the new credit policy being applied by CNCA
-(para. 6.11).  Physical investment targets have been only approxir.ately
estimated, therefore only price contingencies have been calculated for this
component."' For the Institutional Development component, contingency

5.14     The proposed Bank Loan of $120.0 million would be made to CNCA to
finance part of its lendiag operations (US$115.5 million), of the development
of its physical infrastructure (US$3.0 million), of the installation of data
processing facilities and the provision of technical assistance to assist
Project implementation (US$1.5 million). The Government would guarantee the
debt service of the loan and share the foreign exchange risk with CNCA in
accirdance with a formula established by the Government under the ITPA II Loan
and further developed under the Project (para. 6.20). The loan would be for
20 years including a 5 year grace period, at the Bank's variable standard
interest rate. Funds recovered by CNCA in repayment of subloans not then=
needed to service the Bank loan would be recycled for additional agricultural
loans.
5.15     The balance of foreign exchange requirements (US$101.0 million)
would be provided in the following manner: the African Development Bank
(US$67.0 million), KFW (US$35.0 million). Local currency cost would be
financed by sub-borrowers' equity contribution (US$212.3 equivalent) and by
CNCA's own resources (US$288.0 equivalent). Assurances to this effect were
obtained at negotiations. With regard to the Project credit component, the
table below provides a slmnary of lending terms and conditions of the
cofinanciers as well as their contribution to each of CNCA's sublending

Cofinancing of the Project credit component including the Bank loan would
amount to the equivalent of US$216.5 million and would cover 100% of the
foreign exchange requirements. The Bank loan would also finance 43% of the
total cost of CNCA's infrastructural development over the Project period, and
100% of the cost of microcomputers and of technical assistance. Conclusion of
the KfW loan agreement would not be required before April 1987; consequently,
only conclusion of the ADB Loan Agreement and satisfaction of conditions
precedent to CNCA's right to withdraw the ADB Loan would be a special
condition of effectiveness.

5.17     Investments financed by CNCA's Loans.  The range of goods and civil
works to be financed under the Project for on-farm investments is varied and
would not be suitable for bulk procurement.  There are private dealers in
Morocco who sell and service a large variety of tractor makes and other farm
equipment and implements well representing the international suppliers market
as well as private contractors. Competition is keen and prices competitive.
Sub-borrowers would therefore purchase agricultural machinery and equipment of
their choice and commit civil works through existing local channels. As in
the case of other Bank-financed IDF projects in Morocco,-I procurement for
the agroindustry componert would also be undertaken through existing local
channels and according to normal commercial practices in Morocco, where the
inherent self-interest of entrepreneurs has led to almost universal
competitive bidding or shopping. Contracts for goods and civil works for the
construction of the headquarters Z/ would be awarded under ICB except that
certain items supplied through a limited number of suppliers estimated to cost
less-than $1 million equivalent in the aggregate could be procured through
limited international bidding (LIB). Civil works for new construction and
rehabilitation of CNCA's branch offices would be undertaken all over the
country and executed through small contracts of an average unit cost of about
1/ Eighth and Ninth BNDE Projects (Loans 1428-MOR and 2037-MOR).
2/ The estimated total cost is US$4.4; the time slice financed under the
Project would be US$2.2 million.



- 28 -
US$0.3 million. These works, valued in total at about US$5.3 million, would
not be of interest to foreign contractors and would be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding advertised locally (LCB). A sufficiently large and
representative number of construction firms are operating in Morocco to ensure
competitive prices under LCB procedures. In order to ensure that LCB
procedures are in conformity with Bank requirements:
(a)  all bids would be opened in public;
(b) no bidder may be requested or permitted to alter his bid after bid
opening;
(c)  the advertising period would be of a sufficient length, but not less
than 30 days, to enable bidders to obtain documents and prepare and
submit responses;
(d) bidders be required to submit price offers in their bids instead of a
discount on the price established by the Government; and,
(e) goods required for civil works may be obtained from any source
eligible under the Bank's procurement guidelines.
5.18     MIS Microcomputers.  Contracts for the purchase of electronic data
processing equipment for the CNCA's Management Information System valued at a
total of about US$1.0 million would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines.
5.19     Technical Assistance.  Contracts for 64 man-months of technical
assistance to CNCA at a total value of about US$0.5 million would be awarded
in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the use of consultants.
5.20     Review of Bid Documents and Contracts.  Bidding packages for CNCA's
works estimated to cost US$400,000 equivalent or more each would be subject to
the Bank's prior approval. Prior Bank approval would also apply to the first
two contracts for civil works regardless of cost and to the purchase of
goods. This would represent prior review by the Bank of about 602 of total
contract value. The other contracts would be subject to random post-review by
the Bank after contract award. Assurances were obtained at negotiations, that
the above procurement procedures would be followed.
G. Disbursement
5.21     Disbursement Schedule.  The proposed Bank loan of US$120 million
would be committed over a three year period (September 1986 - August 1989) and
disbursed over a period of four fiscal years. This is consistent with the
historical disbursement profiles of EMENA and Moroccan agricultural credit
projects which indicate that for a three year project, disbursement requires
an average of four years. Bank loans for the three most recent agricultural
credit projects were or are being committed over a three year period and
disbursed on average in four-five years. The expected detailed schedule of
disbursements is given in Annex 4 and summarized below:

be made against ( -.ified statements of expenditures. Full documentation for
these statements ot expenditures would be retained by CNCA for review by Bank
supervision mission ond the external auditors (para. 6.25).  Prior Bank review
and approval would be required for agroindustrial sub-projects having a total
cost of over $500,000 (para. 6.13). Disbursements for physical infrastructure
and technical assistance would be made on receipt of full standard



- 30
documentation except for works relating to the construction and rehabilitation
of the headquarters or of the branch offices involving costs not exceeding the
equivalent of US$400,000. In such cases, the Bank would finance against
certified statements of expenditures. Disbursement of all funds under each of
categories 5 (a) and (b) would be conditional on the Bank receiving an adequate
economic and technical justification of the proposed investment from CNCA.
Retroactive financing to July 1, 1986 would be permitted up an aggregate
amount not to exceed $12 million, so as to avoid disruptions in CNCA's lending
program once the fifth line of Credit iz fully disbursed.  The loan closing
date would be March 31, 1990.
5.24     The Revolving Fund.  To permit a timely implementation of the Project
the Bank would, at CNCA's request, deposit after effectiveness an initial
amount of up to US$10.0 million equivalent (about 4 months estimated CNCA's
disbursements on average) in a special account at the Central Bank.
Maintenance of the account in Dirhams would be permitted.
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
6.01     CNCA would be fully responsible for implementing the Project using
its existing organization and network of agencies. CNCA is basically fully
capable of implementing the Project as shown under the previous five credit
lines. However, to improve efficiency under the Project, CNCA would pursue
a number of institution building activities, some of which were initiated
during CNCA V, including specifically: (a) tne establishment of an effective
management committee to determine the long-term policy objectives; (b) the
establishment of an overall management information system; (c) the
rehabilitation and extension of its branch offices network; (d) the adoption
of new lending policies; (e) the development of CNCA banking activities; and
(f) the training of CNCA's staff. The Project completion date would be
September 30, 1989.
A. CNCA Institution Building Activities
Strengthening CNCA's Institutional Structure
6.02     CNCA has demonstrated good operational and financial performance in
the last few years. It lacks however some managerial tools of a rapidly
growing, dynamic, and effective enterprise. In particular: (a) its board of
directors is composed of junior members of Government institutions who change
every year and are inadequately acquainted with its activities and problems.
As a result, no overall policy statement or long-term strategy has ever been
developed; and (b) CNCA's management committee, which by law is composed of
eight representatives of the key supervising ministries and of the Central
Bank, suffers from similar problems, as it is staffed by junior members who do
not provide the board with adequate support and experience.
6.03     To address these constraints the following measures have been or will
be taken: (a) CNCA's present management committee is being upgraded with
senior representatives of the Ministers of Agriculture, Finance, Interior and
of the Central Bank, rather than with junior representatives, to serve as
active members of the committee.  Because of their position in Government they
would bring experience and responsibilty to the task so that their



-31-
recommeudations on CNCA's policie and operational procedures would have
considerable weight; and (b) CNCA will establish adequate budgetting and
medium and -long term planning techniques to develop strategies for reaching
CNCA's objectives and provide support services for the Management Committee.
6.04     The responsibilities ef the management committee have been enhanced
by CNCA's Board and now include: determining CNCA's internal organization,
financial and operational policies, policies on recruitment and staff
remuneration, annual budgets and medium- and long-term development plans.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations from CNCA that it would maintain
its management committee with membership and terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank and with the reponsibilities described above. Regarding CNCA's
long-term development, assurances were obtained that the Guarantor would (a)
establish by January 1, 1987 a task force to deve.op proposals to enhance
CNCA's development an agricultural financing institution and to enable CNCA
effectively to meet the needs of Morocco's agricultural sector and (b)
exchange views by January 30, 1987 on the task force's program of activities
and thereafter annually on the task force's progress.
6.05     CNCA's medium and long-term planning development would imply
developing an overall planning system, to satisfy staffing, training,
infrastructure and financial requirements for consideration by the management
committee in order to: (a) consolidate and extend CNCA's medium- and
long-term agricultural lending; (b) assert CNCA as a significant institution
in the capital market and as a provider of financial services; (c) develop a
strategy to maximize the mobilization of internal resources for investment
lending; and (d) promote CNCA's participation in equity investment.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that CNCA would present to the
Bank an action plan for the development and implementation of its budgeting
and planning system by December 31, 1986. IL carrying out this activity CNCA
would be assisted by consultants as necessary.
Establishment of the Management Information System (MIS)
6.06     CNCA's present management information system is no longer adequate to
provide prompt control of operations.  It is mainly based on manual
bookkeeping operations at braach office level, which generates considerable
errors, requires multiple controls, and entails delays in operations and in
the flow of information to Headquarters. CNCA management started under CNCA V
to overhaul the entire management information system. Under the present
Project, the establishment of the MIS would be completed. The main objectives
of this component would be:
(a) the full adoption by CNCA branch offices of Morocco's new "Plan
Comptable Bancaire", eXcpeeted to be completed by December 1986;
(b) the establishment of a decentralized EDP system that would permit
lending administration by computer processing in 48 CRCAs and 77
CLCAs. This would be accomplished gradually by commencing
utilization of the system in at least 3 branch offices by January
31, 1987 and continuing thereon gradual installation of EDP
facilities in all planned branch offices;
(c) the transfer and consolidation at Headquarters of end of period (day,
week, month, year) cash balances of branch offices and of other



- 32 -
information relevant to lending administration such as preparation of
monthly budgets.  The establishment of a management control unit
under the direct supervision of the general manager that would be
responsible for monitoring of financial performance by December 31,
1988; and
(d) the continued employment of a team of system engineers at
Headquarters and CRCAs. They would adapt software packages, develop
new software for users' needs and provide users with technical
assistance. They would also prepare and update the computer
operational manual and gradually establish in CRCAs data processing
centers for customers' services.
6.07     Under CNCA V, CNCA has alrcady prepared a plan of action encompassing
all the above mentioned activities and it is working with a team of
international and national consultants on the initial phase of the MIS
implementation. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that CNCA would:
(a) continue to employ consultants with qualifications, experience and
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank and in accordance with
Bank guidelines, to assist in introducing the MIS; and
(b) ensure that the internal management control unit is operational by
December 31, 1988 and that the MIS system is introduced in three
CRCAs by January 31, 1987.
Rehabilitation and Extension of Branch Offices and Headquarters Construction
6.08     During Project implementation, CNCA would construct or rehabilitate a
number of CRCA's offices and CLCA's agencies. CNCA has prepared its
constructiou and rehabilitation program for the Project period with phasing
of activities and estimated costs (Annex 3). The new CRCA buildings would be
constructed and equipped in such a manner as to permit the development of new
banking activities, particularly the collection of deposits and the use of
checking accounts. Assurances were obtained that to supervise construction
and procurement activities for branch offices and the headquarters, CNCA would
employ on its staff a qualified and experienced architect and a qualified and
experienced civil engineer. They will among their responsibilities (a) set up
a detailed program of requirements for each regional office (space for
archives, reserves, etc); (b) review the designs and specifications of each
building; and (c) supervise construction activity and the activities of newly
appointed staff; (d) review construction contracts. Also they would establish
a cost control system in CNCA to assure optimum cost efficiency construction
standards. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that each branch office
would be constructed or rehabilitat:ed only after CNCA had submitted an
economic and technical justificatioa analysis thereon acceptable to the Bank
and the Bank had approved the activities (para. 5.23).
6.09     With regard to the construction of the new headquarters CNCA would
recruit consulting services to (a) prepare a cost-benefit analysis of this
investment including an estimate of savings in rental costs of the seven
buildings in which presently CNCA operates, in transportation expenditures,
and in estimated increases in staff productivity; (b) prepare technical
specifications for the new building and supervise construction.  Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that CNCA would (a) employ such consultants with



- 33 -
qualifications, experienre and term-s and conditions of employment satisfactory
to the Bank and in accordance with Bank guidelines, and other consulants,
satisfactory to the Bank to assist in this component; and (b) construct the
headquarters only after CNCA had furnished to the Bank the plans for its
construction and the cost benefit analysis thereof, and the Bank had approved
such plan.
New Lending Policies
6.10     The extent of CNCA credit penetration in the rural areas is
illustrated in Table 4.3.  It is estimated that about 1.5 million farmers
are eligible for credit-in Morocco, but that only about 550,000, or 372, are
beneficiaries of institutional credits. Of these about 423,900 or about 77%
of total beneficiaries, are clients of CNCA. About 364,000 of them have farms
of 1 to 15 ha and an estimated fiscal income under DH 6,000. These farmers
are located throughout the country, mostly in rainfed areas and are by
definition small farmers, clients of the 99 CNCA's local agencies (CLCAs).
The low level of institutional lending is due to the fact that the majority
(90X) of farmers do not nave documented land titles proving their ownership of
the land they cultivate, and tierefore receive limited credit. Up to present,
these small farmers' credit needs were based on very conservative estimates of
farmers' fiscal income. Up to December 1984, when the King declared an
agricultural tax holiday until the end of the century, the tax authorities
determined annually each farmer's taxable income by applying potential revenue
norms to the number of hectares, livestock and fruit trees owned by the
farmer. Farmer's debt repayment capacity was then determined by CNCA as a
multiple of their "fiscal income". This system usually resulted in the
extension of low credit amounts because of the farmers' tendency to declare
low incomes for fiscal purposes, and it is having a negative impact on
agricultural production and development. Further, fiscal income estimates
after the issuance of the royal decree are no longer made by the tax
authorities. To achieve new and more reliable estimates of farmers'
investment credit needs CNCA has introduced under two Bank financed rural
development projects, Fez-Karia-Tissa (Loan 1602-MOR) and Oulmes Rommani (Loan
2217-MOR), new loan appraisal procedures based on the farmer's direct
assessment through a technical, financial and economic methodology provided by
CNCA. of the productivity (t/ha) of the land he or she cultivates and of his
overall credit worthiness. The farmer's assessment is then cosigned by a
Guarantor of his loan and closely reviewed by CNCA's staff against-available
fiscal income statistics. In a large number of cases (30%), CNCA undertakes
random field reviews and if its findings are not consistent with the farmer's
assessment part of the credit is withheld and if need be the entire loan is
recalled. This system nas in general had a positive outcome as it has
resulted on the average in tripling the amount of medium- and long-term credit
extended, and also in the improvement, of the credit recovery rate.
6.11     CNCA now aims at introducing these new procedures country wide.
However, as this can only be done gradually because of the high demand on
CNCA's staff and expertise, under the Project CNCA will introduce the new
system in the two highly productive regions of Meknes and Settat which account
for about 40X of all CNCA's lending. Assurances were obtained that CNCA would
introduce the new system in Meknes by June 30, 1987 and in Settat by June 30,
1988.
6.12     Furthermore to improve farmers' credit worthiness and to reduce
lending risk, CNCA intends to cooperate with the office of the cadastral



-34
authority of tbe Ministry of Agriculture "conservation fonci&re" to facilitate
acquisition of land titles in the following manner :  (a) extension of credit,
through CLCAs to farmers to finance legal and administrative expenditures to
obtain provisional land titles; (b) upon the farmer's application for a land
title, provision by CNCA to the cadastral authority of all pertinent
information in its client's file.
Financing of Agroindustry
6.13     Project lending to agroindustry would continue to be oriented
primarily toward small- and medium-scale agroindustries processing Moroccan
agricultural products. The main subsectors of intervention would be on-farm
storage of cereals, and cold storage of vegetables, milk collection and
processing, poultry, dairy, flour milling, olive oil processing. The
following lending criteria would be retained for subloans made under the
Project:
(a)  agroindustrial interprises would conform with the definition of small
and medium enterprises adopted under the Industrial Investment Code
dated January 17, 1983 (investment in equipment alone of less than
DH 5.0 million for new enterprises);1/ provided that up to $5.8
million equivalent in subloans could be made under the Project to
enterprises not falling within this definition.
(b)  sub-borrowers would be required to have adequate input supply and
marketing plans as well as a satisfactory administrative and
financial structure for their enterprise, and the investments would
have to be technically and financially viable; and
(c)  subprojects would be justified in terms of their economic return to
the country, with minimum economic and financial rates of return of
12Z each. A ceiling of $500,000 equivalent would be kept for total
investment cost of each sub-project above which the subloan would
require prior approval by the Bank.
6.14     To promote further small and medium agroindustrial development under
the Project, CNCA would select two additional pilot provinces with a sizeable
but still untapped potential for agroindustrial development. In each CRCA of:
such provinces CNCA would establish a unit of its agroindustrial department
with terms of reference and staffing satisfactory to che Bank. The first such
unit in each of the two selected provinces would be opened respectively not
later than December 31, 1986 and June 30, 1987. Assurances on these points
were obtained at negotiations.
Lending for RurX  Housing
6.15     CNCA has been lending for rural housing on a mod(   scale (DH 30-50
million, US$3 - 5 million) in 1984 and 1985 and would like - expand this line
of credit, as the demand for such credit is unmet and CNCA is particularly
well placed to service rural clients. Borrowezs for rural housing receive a
6% or 7% Government rebate on the 14% interest rate charged by CNCA.
I/ This limit roughly corresponds to total investments of about DH 15.-0-20.0
million (US$1.5 - 2.0 million) when land, building and working capital are
included.



- 35 -
Projections are that the demand would increase by 1987/88 to about DH 90
million per year. It is estimated that over the Project period, about DH 148
million (US$14.8 million) would be loaned for construction and improvement of
rural houses.
6.16     Because this is a relatively new area for CNCA, this component would
be considered as a pilot effort and the total lending-by CNCA for rural
housing would be limited to DH 200 million during the period of September 1986
through Aujast 1988. Assurances to this effect were obtained from CNCA during
negotiations. Assurances were also obtained from CNCA that subloans for rural
housing would be made in accordance with agreed criteria (see Annex 7) and
that specialists, whose qualifications, experience and terms of reference are
satisfactory to the Bank, would be employed by October 31, 1986 to assist CNCA
in appraising and supervising the investments. Finally, assurances were
obtained from the Guarantor that the rebate on interest rates for such lending
would be reduced so that borrowers of these loans made on or after October 31,
1986 would pay effective rates of 8% and 9% (depending on whether the cost of
the facilities to be financed is below or above DH 100,000), thereby bringing
these rates in line with lending by CIH for urban housing.
CNCA's Profitability and Projected Financial Performance with the Project
6.17     As a result of the project, the overall cost of CNCA's financial
resources is expected to increase only slightly, due to its present low
overall cost of capital and to the relatively low blend cost of foreign
borrowings. Because of the projected sharp growth in lending, provisions
for bad debts are expected to increase during Project implementation from
the present level of about DR 220 million to DH 410 million in 1988.
Administrative costs are also expected to increase because of the recruitement
of new personnel but savings in overheads are also expected by the introduction
of computer facilities to carry out accounting and administrative activity.
CNCA's profitability has increased through the last two years to the level of
DH 71 million in FY85 mainly because of the measures taken during CNCA V to
increase medium-term interest rates to the present level of 13% on average for
CLCA and 14% on average for CRCAs. If current interest rates are maintained,
profits are projected to rise to about DR 99 million in 1987 and DH 110
million in 1988.1' This would assure return on equity of above 12% as
required under the Fifth Credit line. However, to protect CNCA's financial
performance and viability, the following assurances were obtained at
negotiations:
(a)  Before June 30 in each fiscal year, starting FY 1987, CNCA would
review the adequacy of its interest rates and/or fees on all its
loans, and would take the appropriate measures to achieve the
following objectives: (i) the weighted average of interest rates on
CNCA's loans is positive in real terms, that is at least equal to the
inflation rate as mesured by the annual producer price index
published by the Central Bank; and (ii) CNCA earns a minimum annual
return of 12% on equity; and
I/  Part of the profits would be contributed to a foreign exchange risk fund
as explained in para. 6.20 below.



- 36 -
(b) CNCA would maintain separate accounts for its CLCA operations and
take the appropriate measures to maintain total revenues from its
CLCA operations sufficient to. at least cover all their (i) operating,
and administrative expenses (including adequate provisions against
bad and doubtful loans made by CLCAs); and (ii) debt service
requirements.
The provisions of 6.18 (b) will be of increased significance under the Project
given that CNCA now expects that the largest number of new borrowers will come
from among the smallest category of farmers (DR 50 - DH 1,500).  Interest rate
increases to safeguard profitability may eventually become necessary for this
group to maintain CLCA profitability.
6.18     To assist CNCA in maintaining a prudent financial structure and
liquidity position, assurances were obtained that:
(a) CNCA medium- and long-term debt (over 18 months) would not exceed
eight times its equity;l'
(b) CNCA's current assets would be equal to at least 1.2 times its
current liabilities; 2/ and
(c) CNCA's total financing (loans, guarantees, investments not secured by
Government or other acceptable institutions) to a single beneficiary
would not exceed 20% of CNCA's equity.
Gradual Elimination of CNCA's Preferential Treatment on the Financial Markets
6.19     CNCA plays a major role in financing agricultural production
throughout the country, often at relatively high costs due to the large number
and thie small size of individual loans, and to the scattered nature of its
operations. As a result of its mandate, CNCA has received a number of
financial privileges not available to other specialized institutions or to
commercial banks and other private financial institutions. Because of its
satisfactory financial performance in recent years such preferential treatment
should be gradually removed to encourage a better market orientation of CNCA.
The most important privilege is that commercial banks are required to invest
up to 3.51 of the aggregate amount of their deposits at the Central Bank in 3%
1 year CNCA bonds. The aggregate amount of such deposits so invested as of
August 31, 1985 was about DH 900 million, or about 14% of CNCA's total
financial resources. Assurances were obtained that CNCA will carry out a
study to develop and implement a program of measures to increase its access to
other funds so as to enable it to meet the needs of the agriculture sector and
gradually eliminate its recourse to the above mentioned commercial bank funds;
complete the study by June 30, 1987; and after discussing it with the Bank,
carry out its recommendations. One of the CNCA's objectives is to increase
the amount of customers' deposits from the present 14% to at least 201 of its
total financial resources. In addition, assurances were obtained that CNCA
would establish a special provision by depositing each August 30 an amount
1/ As of August 31, 1985 CNCA's Debt/Equity Ratio was 5.1; CNCA V required a
6:1 DiE ratio.
2/ As of August 31, 1985 CNCA's current ratio was 1.4.

equivalent to 1% of the amount then outstanding of these 3% bonds to cover
losses due to nonpayment under loans as a result of special natural
conditions, such as drought.
Contribution of CNCA on the Foreign Exchange Losses
6.20     It is the Government policy supported by the Bank to eventually make
CNCA's borrowers fully responsible for the foreign exchange risk. This is in
contrast to preceding policy under which Government has suported 100% of
CNCA's foreign exchange losses.  In support of this new policy, under the
Project, the treasury will transfer to CNCA and its subborrowers a significant
part of the foreign exchange losses incurred on CNCA's external borrowings, in
the following manner:
(a)  Government has recently established a system1' under ITPA II
whereby specialized financial institutions such as CNCA would bear an
increased part of the foreign exchange risk on foreign loans. The
system works as follows: (i) CNCA bears full cost of the foreign
exchange losses incurred from variations of up to 2% in the foreign
exchange rate on its foreign borrowings; and (ii) a foreign exchange
risk fund in the name of the Treasury is maintained on CNCA's books
into which CNCA deposits (a) the excess of CNCA's average lending
rate (11%) over the concessionary interest rates on new foreign
borrowings (for example from KFW) plus a margin to assure adequate
profitability (5.5%); and (b) the proceeds of a commission of 1% to
be charged on new medium- and long-term loans with the exception of
loans to small farmers; and
(b) in addition to the ITPA II formula, under the Project, CNCA would on
August 31 of each year contribute to the foreign exchange risk fund
1% of the principal amount of the then outstanding CNCA 3% bonds held
by commercial banks.
Assurances were obtained that CNCA and the Guarantor would maintain
arrangements satisfactory to the Bank to protect CNCA against the risk of
losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuations in its operations, and that
CNCA would take the measure described in (b) above.
Table 6.1 shows that during FY87 and FY88, the two years-of Project
implementation CNCA's contribution to the foreign exchange risk fund is
expected to be DR 27.4 million and DH 37.0 million or about 27% and 37% of the
annual estimated level of foreign exchanges losses (DH 100 million) on foreign
borrowings. As regards foreign exchange losses under the proposed loan, it is
estimated that if the dirham devaluation would not be higher than 10-15% the
above system would cover the full amount of the foreign exchange losses.

6.21     Treasury Arrears in Reimbursing Previous Foreign Exchange Losses to
CNCA. The amortization of CNCA's foreign borrowings is done directly by
CNCA. The Treasury which is bearing the largest part of the foreign exchange
risk on past loans has incurred long delays in reimbursing foreign exchange
losses to CNCA which have become of increasing importance with the recent
devaluations of the dirhams. As of May 1986, cumulative arrears amounted to
DH 155 million. This constitutes a heavy burden on CNCA's liquidity and has
required CNCA to incur additional interest charges. Assurances were obtained
that Government would (a) reimburse these arrears in accordance with a
schedule satisfactory to the Bank (i.e., in 4 installments, the last one
payable by December 31, 1987); and (b) in future reimburse CNCA any foreign
exchange losses due within six months of the time they are incurred.
Monitoring and Evaluation
6.22     The monitoring and evaluation system established in CNCA under CNCA V
is intended to provide better characterization of clients of CRCAs and CLCAs
through the collection, during loan application, of data on a selected number
of parameters, improved supervision of loan utilization through detailed field
enquiries of at least 52 of its medium- and long-term borrowers reasons for
default in loan repayment, and analysis of financial rates of return to
various on-farm investments. The M&E unit has been collecting and analyzing
data on the use of credit and rates of return, but is awaiting the installation
of the MIS system to process the data on clients. The management of CNCA
would use the unit, which is well staffed with sufficiently experienced
personnel, to monitor CNCA's portfolio, to assess the pattern of defaults, to
analyze the impact of CNCA's policies on sound lending practices and good loan
recovery.

Reporting
6.23     Assurances were obtai.led at negotiations that CNCA would provide (a)
semi-annual reports to the Bank on project progress, within three months of
the end of each semester; these would include disbursement data by purpose and
category of beneficiary, loan recovery data, CNCA's financial situation,
liquidity position, profitability, changes in lending policies and procedures
and progress being achieved in the implementation of the institution building
activities; and (b) annual reports on the operations of its subloan monitoring
system within 6 months after the end of each year. CNCA would prepare and
submit to the Bank a Project Completion Report not later thpn six months after
the closing date. Copies of consultants' reports would be provided to the
Bank as and when prepared.
B. Accounts and Audit
6.24     CNCA has a reliable and satisfactory accounting system.  CNCA
accounts and financial statements have been in the past and would continue
under the Project to be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank. Statements of expenditures sent to the Bank from time to time
for disbursements under the Bank loan would be audited by the independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank to ensure that actual CNCA disbursements under
the project are consistent with statement of expenditures submitted to the
Bank. The special account would also be audited. Audit reports of adequate
standard are being received by the Bank for CNCA. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the auditor's annual reports would continue to be sent to
the Bank within six months of the end of each CNCA fiscal year under the
present project.
C. bIvestment Code Study
6.25     CNCA has become responsible, as of January 1, 1986, for handling
subsidies for on-farm investments (through credit) provided by the Government
under the Agricultural Investment Code. In order to ensure that CNCA is
adequately compensated for the work, assurances were obtained at negotiations
from the Guarantor that the commissions to be paid to CNCA for the
administration of this agricultural development fund would be of a sufficient
level to cover CNCA's related administrative costs. The Government plans to
review these subsidies, their incentives to production, the economic
desirability of gradually removing the subsidies and the implications for
production levels.
VII PRODUCTION. MARKETING AND PRICES
A. Incremental Project Production
7.01     Estimates of incremental production under this Project must be
considered as orders of magnitude, as they derive from projected uses of
credit and are based on cropping patterns that will likely shift with changes
in prices and incentives during the project period and beyond.



- 40 -
7.02     Types of investment include purchase of pure bred or improved cattle
or sheep and associated infrastructure, irrigation equipment, equipment such
as tractors and associated implements, and investments in land improvement and
in tree crops plantations (olives, citrus fruit). The investments serve to
shift cropping patterns to more intensive cultivation or to reduce fallow land
as well as to increase yields (tractors, as an example, allow early and better
ploughing and sowing and result in better moisture infiltration and storage,
thus causing higher yields). Investments in improved breeds of livestock
would result in incremental meat, milk and wool mainly from better yields, and
investment in the local breed and in related infrastructure would also result
in incremental ptoduction from a greater attention to feed and health
requirements of the animals. Estimates of the quantities of assets financed
under the Project are in Annex 1, and the assumptions on yield changes by
model type and the effects of the on-farm investment in the aggregate on
incremental production are in Annex 9 in the Implementation Volume. The
indicative results are shown in Table 7.1 below and compared to average
production in the country during the period 1980-1984:
Table 7.1: INCREMENTAL PRODUCTION

/a  Full development would be from 1990/91 onwards.
7;03     These figures of estimated incremental production due to the
availability of credit are consistent with projections on previous credit
projects, as well as with performance reports on these projects. Credit
projects seem to have their largest impact on milk and vegetables production,
where the demand for livestock, particularly dairy cattle, and for irrigation
equipment is strong. In addition, thte data on actual production show that the
overall trend for milk has been fairly steadily upward over the last fifteen
years, except for th,e drought year 1980/81 when a good portion of the
livestock herd was lost. This credit Project should be seen as contributing
in an important way to the continued rebuilding and upgrading of the national
dairy herd. For cereals, pulses, and meat, the Project is estimated to make
more modest contributions, which is also consistent with previous projects.
While the estimated number of farm families making on-farm investments (in
draft animals and tractors and implements) that would affect production of
cereals and pulses is important (at about 52,000 borrowera), the estimated
incremental acreage and incremental yields are modest (Annex 9). The
incremental production of cereals and pulses would be reduced, in fact, by the
switch out of cereals into the more profitable vegetables in the farms making



-41
investment in irrigation equipment; the net impact of the Project would thus
be an estimated 9% and 4% of current levels of pulses and cereals production,
respectively.
B. Markets
7.04     Major commodities to be produced as a result of Project investments
are cere'ls, vegetables, and milk products. Morocco has been a net importer
of cereals and dairy products for a number of years and projections show that
this pattern is likely to continue in the medium- and long-term. Thus, the
incremental project production of these commodities will be used to satisfy
domestic demand. Cereals are marketed both in local markets at free market
prices and by the official public enterprise ONICL at Government outlets
(SCAMS/CMAS) at official support prices. About 1Q2 of total production has
historically been sold through official channels,'' so the support prices
for cereals have not been highly effective, most particularly for soft wheat,
but under agreements reached in the ASAL, Government is planning to expand its
cereals marketing activities in order to assure producers the established
floor prices. Milk is sold either to private operators or to cooperatives for
processing and distribution. Due to the growth in production and consumption
and the expanded network of cooperative milk collection centers, the industry
has recently processed a record of 35-402 of total domestic production. '
Problems have arisen during the peak season with the inability of the
processors to use the raw milk for producing long-duration products, and thus
in 1983/84 20,000 liters had to be refused for processing. Under the ASAL,
Government is taking measures to encourage a better inter-seasonal distribution
of production and to remove disincentives or legal restrictions on producing
long-duration products. These measures will be sufficient to ensure that
project output would be adequately processed. Vegetables, fruits, meat and
pulses are marketed both domestically and exported. Meat and pulses are
exported in very small amounts, while vegetables and fruits are exported in
rather more substantial quantities, both fresh and canned or processed as
juices. Domestic demand for fruit, other than citrus, and vegetables is
projected to grow faster than supply increases so that most of the incremental
production would probably be sold on the local markets.
C. Prices
7.05     Prices of inputs distributed through Government agencies are directly
subsidized. On-farm investments is also subsidized through a system of
rebates to suppliers of equipment and machinery. The subsidy levels are now
being reviewed under various studies connected with the adjustment program and
Government is committed to adjusting the subsidy levels to reduce the
budgetary burden. For the financial analysis, 1985 financial prices paid by
1/ Privately marketed surplus amounts to about 30% of total production, the
remaining 60% is consumed as subsistence food.
2/ In L983, the private sector processed about 160,000 liters and the
cooperatives about 100,000 liters of domestically produced milk. Total
production was estimated at 655,000 liters.



- 42 -
farmers were used as a basis of calculation. This means that for fertilizer
and certified cereal seeds subsidized prices were used. The impact of subsidy
reduction was tested through sensitivity analysis in the calculation of the
economic rate of return. For animal feed, however, the prices used were those
reported by farmers and reflected unsubsidized, market prices.L'  The
economic analysis (Chapter IX) uses unsubsidized, converted prices for all
on-farm investments and inputs. See Annex 9, Tables 6 and 7 for the list of
financial and economic input prices.
7.06     Producer prices for cereals, oilseeds, cotton, milk, sugar beet and
cane are fixed or supported at minimum fixed levels and have generally been
maintained at or above world market levels at the official exchange re'e. For
soft wheat, however, the official prices are not usually available to farmers
(para. 2.18) while for hard wheat, the actual prices are usually above the
support price. The farm-gate prices of cereals used were thus averages of
actual market prices over the last three years. For the crops where the
official floor prices are received by the farmer, the 1985/86 announced prices
were used. For other crops such as mint, potatoes, vegetables, milk, meat and
wool, market forces determine their prices and the financial prices used here
were those reported by farmers in 1985. The financial and economic prices
used are in Annex 9 in the Implementation Volume, Tables 4 and S.
VIII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Farmers Benefits
8.01     To quantify the returns to sub-borrowers under the Project, five farm
models were chosen to represent the range of investments that would be made.
The farm models are based on actual farms in representative regions; the
information on input levels, farming techniques and yields are based on actual
results of a CNCA survey of these farms over the period 1982 to 1985 and on
Bank discussions in the field with farmers, extension agents and CNCA
personnel. In practice, of course, many combinations of these model
investments and other cropping patterns would exist under the Project. The
results in Table 8.1 are therefore illustrative only. A more detailed
description of the models and assumptions on cropping patterns and yields,
without and with the Project, is in Annex 9.
8.02     The effect on farmers' incomes would be substantial at full
development. Incomes are estimated to increase by about a fifth for investors
in draft animals to several fold for investors in pure bred dairy cattle,
measured in 1985 constant prices. Incremental income, as indicated in para.
7.02, is expected from more intensive cultivation and reduced fallow
(irrigation equipment and draft animals), increased yields (all models),
switching to higher value crops (irrigation equipment), and from upgrading the
quality and yield of the livestock through purchase of pure bred or improved
cattle and sheep and better animal feed and health. In the case of new
tractor owners additional income would be experienced either by reducing
operating costs because of higher productivity of the new tractor, or by doing
contract work for others.
1/ Although Government subsidizes bran and sugar beet pulp by 30b and 45b,
respectively, the subsidies are at the point of production or distribution.
Thus, a parallel free market exists and the livestock owners in the sample
used here as the basis of this report's analysis paid free market prices.

/e Including income from renting tractor and implements.
8.03     The financial rates of return, along with sensitivity analysis, are
in Table 8.2. They indicate that the incentives to invest are adequate,
although the rates of return are quite sensitive to assumptions on costs and
benefits. Nevertheless, the return to dairy cattle is particularly attractive
and investment in these animals has historically reflected this by the demand
for credit for this purpose. The popularity of other types of investment also
reflects their high returns, except for irrigation equipment, which is limited
to farmers with proper land holdings to make full use of the irrigation. For
tractors, it is important that the owner rent out the spare capacity of the
tractor to other farmers to make the investment worthwhile. Only about 3,700
loans will be made for tractors under this Project, compared to the estimated
75,000 loans for livestock (complete investment packages; other credits would
be granted for stable construction alone, for example).

B. Financial bnPact on CNCA
8.04     Actual and projected balance sheets and income statement for years
1981182 to 1987/88 are shown in Annex 6. CNCA's total assets would increase
by 36% from 1985/86 to the end of the Project, up to DH 8,802 million. CNCA's
medium- and long-term portfolio would increase by 45S over the period (about

21% p.a. rate of growth) to reach DH 5,500 million by the end of FY87188, or
62% of total assets. The details of the impact of the partial coverage by
CNCA of foreign exchange losses are described in para. 6.21. Table 8.3
presents the current and projected data on CNCA's major financial structure
and performance indicators over the Project period. The table shows that CNCA
is expected to preserve a satisfactory liquidity position and financial
structure throughout the Project period. CNCA's net worth would increase from
DR 750 million at end-1986 to DH 900 million as of August 31, 1988 through a
policy of capitalizing retained earnings. Income from loans would increase
slightly from 9.5% of average loan portfolio in 1984/85 to 10.82 in 1987/88.
As a result, annual net profits would remain above 122 of CNCA's equity and
about 1.2Z of total assets. CNCA's estimated contribution to the FE risk fund
(para. 6.21) would be deducted from net profits. For CNCA to implement the
Project is thus financially justified.
8.05     Projected sources and uses of funds during the Project period are
shown in Annex 6, Table 3. With a projected increase in domestic savings,
CNCA's total resource gap during the two year period would be about DR 2.000
million. The contributions of the cofinanciers amounts to US$221 million or
DR 2,200 million, equival-nt to the foreign exchange requirements of the
project.
C. Financial Implications for Government
8.06     The impact on the Government's finances would come from the subsidies
on incremental amounts of inputs and of on-farm investments and from taxes on
incremental imports and farm assets. The subsidies on selected inputs are to
be phased out gradually up to 1990; under the Project, investment subsidies
are estimated to equal DH 619 million, or about 9% of the total Project cost.
Import duties and other taxes are estimated to amount to about DH 792.7
million and would more than cover this subsidy cost. The detail of subsidies
and taxes on investments, including inputs, is shown in Annex 2, and
summarized in Table 8.4 below.

IX. PROJECT BENEFriS AND JUSFIFICATION
A. Eeoqnmie A9b*- -
9.01     An economic rate of return (ERR) has been calculated for each typical
farm model.  The results are presented in Table 9.1 below.  These results have
not been aggregated into an overall ERR for the Project as a whole, because
the distribution of loans among these types of investment or among variations
of the models will depend on changing relative prices and attractiveness of
alternative investments and land use.
9.02     Benefits include all incremental production of crops, milk, meat and
wool as a result of increased yields and increased cropping intensity. Costs
include all capital costs, incremental working capital requirements and
incremental operating costs. All taxes and subsidies have been excluded.
Economic prices for tradeable inputs and outputs have been derived from the
Bank's commodity price projectionsL' and adjusted for transport and handling
to and from Morocco and, where appropriate, processing in Morocco. Prices for
non-traded inputs and outputs have been taken from market prices and adjusted
by the appropriate conversion factor. The calculations and summaries of
economic input and output prices and conversion factors are in Annex 9.

9.03     The differences between the ERRs and FRRs shown in Table 9.1 are the
result mainly of Government price intervention, subsidies and taxes. Where
the FRR is greater than the ERR, as it is for all the models except the
tractor models, Government is subsidizing the farmer through the program of
investment and input subsidies. Where the ERR is greater than the FRR, as it
is in the case of the investment in model 4, the tractor and implements, price
interventions introduce net distortions against the investment.  Although the
purchase price of the equipment and seeds and fertilizers are subsidized, in
the case of this model, the econoiaic prices of the output are higher than
their financial prices by a sufficient amount to offset the subsidies, and
this causes the ERR to exceed the FRR.  The Bank's current work on Agriculture
Prices and Incentives Study is addressing the issue of input subsidy and a
forthcoming study of on-farm investment subsidies will analyze the implications
of various policy alternatives for production and consumption levels,
Government budget, income distribution and welfare.
9.04     Sensitivity analysis shows the switching values of costs and
benefits, or the amounts the costs or benefits would have to increase or
decrease (respectively) to bring the net present value to zero at a discount
rate of 122 or to bring the ERR below the opportunity cost of capital (in this
case, l2%) and thus render the investment uneconomic. The switching values in
Table 9.1 show that fairly large increases in either investment or operating
costs and similarly large decreases in benefits are necessary for most of the
models to render the models uneconomic.  The exception is model 2 for sheep
whose economic viability is more susceptible to a small decrease in benefits.
As this model is in a relatively marginal farming area, it is possible that in
some years animal fodder would be more scarce or more expensive and that the
growth of the herd or the weight of the lambs would decrease, thus causing a
dip in benefits. The investment in sheep can be justified, however, on the
grounds that the investors are primarily the smaller farmers (CLCA clients) in
more marginal areas whose main source of increased income must come from
livestock. In addition, because of the flexibility inherent in a line of
credit, if one tyoe of investment or one crop becomes economically unattractive
and this is tran6lated into a decreased financial return, farmers will have
options to make alternative, more attractive investments or to switch to more
profitable cropping patterns. Thus the economic viability of the Project
should not be threatened. The risks of drought, decreased yields, and reduced
ability by farmers to repay their loans are discussed in the next section.
B. Proiect Risks
9.05     The major risk in this Project has been identified and discussed in
previous credit projects, not only in Morocco but in other countries as well.
It is the threat of severe drought Jnd/or sustained drought conditions which
Morocco has experienced recently, in 1980/81 in particular and in 1983/84 as
well, to a lesser degree. The adverse climatic conditions translates into
decreased yields and livestock output, farmers' lower incomes and decreased
ability to repay their loans. The farm models have accounted for these
droughts which seem to occur historically in one year out of five and the
yields are at conservative levels. In addition, the reduced ability to repay
has not noticeably affected CNCA's loan recovery to date, which has been at
constantly respectable levels.



- 48 -
9.06     Most recently the drought of 1983/84 might have affected CNCA's loan
recovery particularly of short term loans, but USAID and EEC have lent CNCA
funds of (US$13.5 and an equivalent US$29 million, respectively), at
concessionary terms. This has allowed CNCA to roll over the short term debt
into a medium term rescheduled repayment for those farmers most affected by
the drought (in certain geographic areas). While such financing cannot be
counted on in the future for adverse conditions, CNCA's liquidity to date has
not been seriously affected. Government is committed to CNCA's continued
functioning and it should be expected that in the event of future droughts or
climatic problems the Government and CNCA would make every effort to mobilize
resources to avoid a liquidity crisis.
9.07     A second risk, which could have substantial negative effects on
CNCA's performance in the longer term, is the failure to strengthen
sufficiently CNCA's management committee (paras. 6.02 - 6.06) or the failure
by the committee, because of lack of attendance or interest in assisting CNCA,
to develop its financial, operational and recruitment policies and development
plans. This risk has been reduced by the recent decision of CNCA's Board of
Directors to broaden the powers and responsibilities of this committee.
X. AGREEMENTS REACHED
10.01    Agreements were obtained at negotiations from CNCA that it would:
(a) undertake procurement of goods and services under the Project in
accordance with procedures specified in paras. 5.17 through 5.19 and
submit to the Bank, for prior review, bidding packages as required in
para. 5.20;
(b) maintain its management committee with membership and terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.04);
(c)  carry out the infrastructure component of the Project only after the
Bank has approved the investment (paras. 6.08 and 6.09); and
(d)  implement its MIS with the assistance of consultants in three CRCAs
by January 31, 1987 and establish an internal management control unit
by December 31, 1988 (para. 6.07);
(e) present by December 31, 1986 an action plan to develop and implement
its budgeting and medium- and long-term planntng system and recruit
for this purpose consultant services as needed (para. 6.05);
(f) apply the new appraisal procedures for lending based on the direct
assessment by CNCA of the farmers' income potential and credit
worthiness, as they are presently applied in Oulmes Rommani (para.
6.10), to CNCA's branch offices of two regions by June 30, 1987 and
June 30, 1988, respectively (para. 6.11):



- 49 -
(g) for lending to agroindustry: (i) submit to the Bank for prior review
and approval any subproject with an investment cost exceeding $500,000
equivalent; (ii) lend only to small- and medium-agroindustrial
enterprises (provided that $5.8 million in subloans could be made to
other enterprises); and (iii) select two pilot provinces where it
would open, in one of its CRCA offices, no later than December 31,
1986 and June 1987 respectively, specialized offices of its
agroindustrial department for promoting its agroindustrial activities
in the provinces (para. 6.13 - 6.14);
th) employ (i) on its staff a qualified and experienced architect and a
qualified and experienced engineer to supervise the construction and
rehabilitation of CNCA's branch offices and headquarters; (ii)
consulting services to assist in carrying out the construction and
furnishing of its headquarters; and (iii) specialists to appraise and
supervise the rural housing program (paras. 6.08 and 6.16, Annex 7);
(i) (i) limit CNCA's lending for rural housing to DH 200 million during
the period September 1986 through August 1988; and (ii) make subloans
for rural housing in accordance with agreed criteria (para. 6.16 and
Annex 7);
(j) (i) carry out by June 30, 1987 a study to develop and implement a
program to increase its access to funds o.her than the 3% CNCA bonds
in which commercial banks are required to invest, so as to enable
CNCA to eliminate its recourse to such funds; and (ii) establish a
special provision equivalent to 1% of these bonds to cover bad loans
resulting from natural conditions such as droughts (para. 6.19);
(k) maintain arrangements with the Guarantor to protect CNCA against
foreign exchange losses and deposit on August 31 each year in the
foreign exchange risk fund an amount equal to 1X of the outstanding
balance at that date of 3X CNCA bonds held by commercial banks (para.
6.20 (b));
(1)  review before June 30 in each fiscal year, interest rates and/or fees
on all its loans and take the appropriate measures to achieve the
following objectives: (i) the weighted average of interest rates on
its loans is positive'in real terms, that is, at least equal to the
inflation rate as measured by the Central Bank's producer price-
index; and (ii) annual net profits are sufficient to protect the
value of CNCA's equity from inflationary erosion by assuring a
minimum annual return on equity of 12% (para. 6.17 (a));
(m) maintain separate accounts for CLCA operations and take appropriate
measures to maintain annual total revenues from CLCA operations
sufficient to at least (i) cover all CLCAs operating and
administrative expenses (including adequate provision against bad and
doubtful loans made by CLCAs); and (ii) debt service requirements
(para. 6.17 (b)); and



- so -
(n) maintain a prudent financial structure by maintaining (i) medium-
and long-term debt (over 18 months) at or below eight times its
equity; (ii) a ratio of current assets-over current liabilities equal
to at least 1.2 to 1; and (iii) total financing to any one
beneficiary at 202 of CNCA's equity or less (para. 6.18).
10.02   Assurances were obtained from the Guarantor that it would:
(a)  enable CNCA to set interest-rates consistent with obligations entered
into by CNCA under para. 10.01 (k), (1) and (m) (ii);
(b)  pay CNCA an adequate fee-to cover CNCA's costs for the administration
of the agricultural development fund (para. 6.25).
(c)  reduce the rebates on rural housing loans so that borrowers of such
loans made on or after October 31, 1986 would pay effective interest
rates of 81 or 91 p. a. depending on the costs of facilities to be
financed (para. 6.15);
(d)  maintain arrangements with CNCA to protect CNCA against foreign
exchange risks and pay all outstanding foreign exchange losses due by
it to CNCA in accordance with a schedule satisfactory to the Bank and
all subsequent such losses within 6 months of the incurrence of such
loss (paras. 6.20 and 6.21); and
(e)  establish by January 1, 1987 a task force to develop proposals to
enhance CNCA's development as an agricultural financing institution,
exchange views with the Bank by January 30, 1987 on the task force's
program of activities and thereafter annually on its progress in
carrying out such program (para. 6.04).
10.03    As a special condition of effectiveness all conditions precedent to
the right of CNCA to withdraw the ADB loan would have to be met (para. 5.15).
Retroactive financing of $12 million to July 1, 1986 would be allowed.
Disbursement against the infrastructure component would be subject to Bank
approval of investment justifications (para. 5.23).
10.04    Subject to the above assurances, the Project would be suitable for a
Bank loan of US$120.0 million to CNCA with the guarantee of the Kingdom of
Morocco, for a term of 20 years including a five-year grace period.

in appraisal and supervision of these involvements, and in particular, to:
(a) review the overall designs and cost estimates of the houses, and
select loan beneficiaries;

PERFORMANCE UNDER PREVIOUS AGRICULTURAL CREDEr PROJECTS
A. First and Second Agrcultural Credit Proiects
(Loan 433-MOR; Loan 861-MOR and Credit 338-MOR)
1.       Under the First Project, a Bank loan of US$10.0 millionL' helped
finance CNCA's lending program for the period 1966-b9. It financed
investments undertaken by about 6,000 medium and large farmers and farm
equipment purchased by a State company (CGEA).2' The Project was audited by
the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) ' which attributed the Project's
mixed results to CNCA's shortage of qualified staff and to Government's
interference in CNCA operations by directing CNCA loans to small farmers,
which was not envisaged under the Project. Under the Second Project, the Bank
provided a Loan/Credit of US$34.0 million to CNCA to finance medium and large
farmers' investments over the 1973-76 period. About 17,000, mostly large
farmers, benefitted from the Project. Based on the experience of the First
Project, the Bank's concern related to CNCA's institutional problems
including: (a) the need to introduce separate accounts for CLCA operations;
(b) the strengthening of CNCA capital structure; (c) the need to increase
profitability of CNCA's operations; and (d) the need to increase the
reliability of financial data. According to the Project Performance Audit
Report (PPAR) issued June 15, 1979, results were positive. CLCA accounts were
separated in l972 and the increase in capital was made effective in 1973.

Following Bank insistence, interest rates on medium-term loans were increased
to 7% for cooperatives and 8.52 for CRCA clients. Auditing of CNCA's accounts
was begun by independent external auditors.
EL Third Adiultural Credit rolect (Loan 1361-MOR)
2.       The Third Agricultural Credit Project, which became effective on
August 11, 1977, financed medium- and large-farmers, farmer pre-cooperative
groups, and small farmers, the latter in view of the good results obtained by
cNCA. The Bank loan of US$35.0 million was disbursed on-schedule. According
to PPAR No. 3248 dated December 23, 1980, the Project achieved its objectives
in terms of expansion of lending activity and farmer coverage, and of
financing investment having a positive impact on beneficiaries income (high
financial rates of return), employment creation (about 52,000 man-years of
employment were created) and the Moroccan economy (high economic rates of
return).
C. Fourth AMricultural Credit Project (Loan 1704-MOR)
3.       The Fourth Agricultural Credit Project included all CNCA lending to
individual farmers through Headquarters, CRCAs and CLCAs; to Agrarian Reform
Cooperatives and Pre-cooperatives Associations; and to small and medium scale
agroindustries. Also included was technical assistance to assist CNCA in
improving its monitoring and evaluation system. The Project covered CNCA
lending over the period September 1979 to August 1982. Total Project costs
were estimated at US$737.2 million equivalent, with the World Bank Loan of
US$70.0 million, a loan from KfW of the Federal Republic of Germany of US$50.0
million equivalent and a loan from the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD) of about US$25.0 million equivalent financing 582 of the
Project estimated foreign exchange cost (US$250.0 million). The Loan was
fully disbursed by August 25, 1983. The OED report No. 731 of December 7,
1984.described it as a successful operation on account of (a) substantial
increase in the number and amount of lending to small farmers, though
maintaining very satisfactory credit recovery rates; and (b) a satisfactory
financial performance of CNCA.
D. Fifth AMicultural Credit Prolt (LOAN 2367-MOR)
4.       The Fifth Agricultural Credit Project is expected to be fully
disbursed by July 1986. This Project continues to finance the components as
in the Fourth Project, with further emphasis on: (a) agroindustrial
development through the establishment of special agroindustrial lending office
at one CRCA, Office (Meknes); (b) institution building through financing the
establishment of a management information system (MIS) and attention to
training; and (c) on domestic resource mobilization by encouraging banking
activities in branch offices. Project implementation started on September 1,
1983. As of May 1986, about 90S of loan proceeds had been disbursed. CNCA
has kept with the strict financial standards required under the loan Agreement
and is emerging as a strong expanding financial institution which is making a
major contribution to sectoral development.

5.       The combined impact of the Bank-financed projects up to now have had
a strong institutional impact which resulted in strengthening CNCA's capital
structure, improving loan collection performance and assisting CNCA to become
an efficient development credit institution. In addition, while the value of
agricultural production has increased modestly in the 1970's and 80's, the
volume of production, particularly in the irrigated areas, has shown a steady
growth (with the important exceptions of cereals and pulses). In fact, output
from these areas has grown at 5.5% p.a. over the last fifteen years and
availability of credit through CNCA has, according to OED reports and to field
observations over the years, contributed to this trend.
