Resettleent Action Plan
Objectives of the RAP and the Definition of
Resettlement Terminology.
This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is prepared according to the Laws and
Regulations of PRC, and local Regulations as well as the Guidelines of the
World Bank (Operational Directive for Involuntary Resettlement OD 4.30).
'The purpose of this document is to set out an Action plan for the Resettlement
and Rehabilitation of the Project Affected Persons (PAPs) to ensure that they
will benefit from the project and their standards of living will improve or at
least be restored after the project impact.
Acquisition of land and other assets for the project will adversely affect the
livelihood of persons who live, work or earn their living on the land that will be
acquired for the project. PAPs are defined as those persons whose income or
livelihoods will be adversely affected by land acquisition for the project. PAPs
include the following categories:
a) persons who have a title, right, interest, in structures (houses, enterprises,
shelters, or public buildings), land (including residential, agricultural, and
grazing land)or any other asset acquired or possessed, in full or in part,
permanently or temporarily;
b) persons who use the structures, land or assets described above; or persons
whose business, occupation, work, place of residence or habitat adversely
affected; or
c) persons whose standard of living is adversely affected as a consequence of
land acquisition.
A definition of PAPs is given below:
Definition of the PAPs: "Affected Persons" means persons who on account of
the execution of the project had or would have theirs:
a) standard of living adversely affected; or
b) right, title or interest in any house, land (including premises, agricultural
and grazing land) or any other fixed or movable asset acquired or
possessed, temporarily or permanently; or
c) business, occupation. work or place of -residence or -habitat adversely
affected, and "affected Person" means individually all those who qualify as
"Affected persons:'
PAPs may be individuals or legal persons such as a company, a public
institution.
Definition of PAPs is -not limited to their legal Tegistration or permission to live
or conduct business in the affected location, or their -title to property Thus, it
1



Resettlwnt Actio Plan
includes:
a) all those affected by ihe project regardless of their legal rights or absence
thereof to the assets being taken; and
b) persons without residential permit to live in a certain area.
Therefore all such persons who are affected will need to considered and
recorded as PAPs, regardless of their legal connection to assets land or location.
If there are more than one person, family or household using or holding a title
to the same land or property that is acquired, they will be compensated and
rehabilitated according to the loss they suffer, their rights, and the impact on
their living standards. The definition of PAPs is linked directly to the adverse
effect of the project, regardless of legal rights title or interest.
All PAPs are entitled to the improvement or at least restoration of their
standards of living, and compensation for the material losses they suffer.
Compensation for assets will cover replacement cost. No deductions or
discounts will be applied to the compensation amount for depreciation or other
reasons. All PAPs deriving an economic benefit from the affected land and
property are entitled to receive rehabilitation benefits in addition to the
compensation for their assets lost. Those PAPs without title, authorization or
legal permission to reside, conduct business, cultivate land or construct
structures are eligible for rehabilitation of their livelihoods and compensation
for their assets on an equal footing with those with formal legal title,
authorization or permissions to the assets.
The term RESEITLEMENT includes:
a) the relocation of living quarters;
b) finding acceptable new employment for those whose jobs are affected;
c) restoration (or compensation) of affected productive resources such as land,
workplaces, , trees and infrastructure;
d) restoration of other adverse effect on PAPs' living standards (quality of life)
through land acquisition (such as the adverse effects of pollution);
e) restoration of or compensation for affected private and public enterprises;
f) restoration of adversely affected on cultural or comrnon property.
Rehabilitation means: the restoration of the PAPs' resource capacity to
continue with productive activities or lifestyles at a level higher or at least
equal to that before the project.
The objective of this RAP is to provide a plan for the resettlement and
rehabilitation of the PAPs so that their losses will be compensated and their
standards of living will be improved or at least restored to the pre-project levels.
.2



Resettlwnt Actio Plan
To achieve these objectives the plan provides for rehabilitation measures so
that the income earning potential of individuals are restored to sustain their
livelihoods. Affected productive resources of businesses (enterprises including
shops) and public property. Infrastructure and cultural property will also be
improved or at least restored to their pre-project levels.

1. 4GENERAL
1.1. Project Background
Since launching of the economic reform, the national economy in Zhejiang
Province has developed in a rapid pace. In 1990, the GDP of the province
was 89.8 billion Yuan (1990 price, same as below), and in 1995, that was
215.2 billion Yuan., with an average annual increase rate of 19.9%. During
the first two years of the Ninth Five-year Period, the annual average
increase rate was 11.34% and the GDP of the province reached 2667.8
billion Yuan. The economic increase gears up the development of power
industry of the province. In the Eighth Five-year Period, the power load and
power consumption of the province increased at an annual rate of 13.28%
and 13.81% respectively; while in the Ninth Five-year Period, the annual
increase rate in the first two years reached 7.52% and 7.88% respectively. In
1997, the power loads and power consumption of the province were
respectively 8.15 million kW and 5.12 million kWh.
According to the plan of the provincial power grid, it is predicted that the
power load and power consumption of the province will be increased by
9.3 1% and 8.45% respectively, and in the year of 2000, the power load and
power consumption of the province will be 11.0 million kW and 6.60
million kWh. In the Tenth Five-year Period, the power load and power
consumption of the province will be increased by 8.45% and 8.23%
respectively; in 2005, the power load and power consumption of the
province will be 16.5 million kW and 9.8 million kWh.
Limited by the natural separation of the Qiantang River and the unfavorable
surrounding conditions for building large-sized power plants, it is predicted
that the Zhejiang Power Grid will turn to be in a pattern in which large
power tide will run from the north to the south and from the east to the west
during the period of 2000 - 2005. In order to satisfy the power demand for
industrial and agricultural production and people's living of the province as
well as safe operation of the whole power grid, some power transmission
projects should be constructed.
The substations and power lines under this project are part of the 5OOkV
transmission projects to be built to fulfill the purpose above mentioned.

1.3  Project Design and Approval
Among the corollary transmission works for Tongbai Pumped Storage
Project, the 500kV Yuyao substation is designed by the East China Electric
Power Design Institute, the other project components are designed by
Zhejiang Provincial Power Design Institute. During selection the substation
sites and line routes, the design units envisaged several alternative
substation sites and line routes along with deep-going techno-economic
study, and conducted alternative comparison in terms of the project impact
on local social economy, land requisition, relocation and resettlement,
geological structure, hydrology and meteorology, topography and
geomorphology, transportation for large equipment, maintenance of the
lines and substations, and project economic justification, and finally
decided the project construction blueprint. The project owner has worked
on the project package for approval.
1.4 Measures for Reducing Project Impact
A. Reducing quantity of land requisition and resettlement
Construction of the substations and transmission lines will cause acquisition
of certain amount of arable lands and housing removal, which will
inevitably affect the livelihoods of the local people and local production
conditions. In order to minimize the quantity of cultivated land to be
requisited and resettlement to a possible extent, the design units have
adopted various measures during design as followings.
(1) During design, the design units had made every effort to arrange the
substations and line routes at open areas and away from residences, by
7



Resettlet Actiri Pla
optimizing the layout of substation and outgoing line and equipment
arrangement. The staff later substation operation residential area will be
arranged at the urban district, thus resulting in even less cultivated land
to be requisitioned.
(2) The double-line single pole arrangement can reduce the quantity of land
to be used for line route and number of houses to be relocated.
(3) During the line positioning, the design units had carried out analysis on
line routes and reasonably added more turning-angle towers to avoid
households from being affected.
B. Decreasing local impact caused by construction
When requisition and resettlement is inevitable, following measures will be
adopted for decreasing the local impact caused by the construction.
1) Enhance basic data acquisition procedures, analyses on local socio-
economic status, and formulate practicable action plans with due
consideration of actual situation, thus ensuring that the standards of
living of the resettlers will not be decreased.
2) Strengthen internal and external independent monitoring activities,
establish highly efficient and smooth channel for information feedback,
reduce information processing period, thus ensuring that problems can
be resolved timely.
3) During construction, use of local materials such as bricks, sand and
gravel, etc., will be given priority as well as local transportation means
and labor force, thus resettlers can obtain benefits from the project.
4) Optimize construction design, reduce construction period, cooperate
fully with the local government at different levels, arrange housing
removal and construction in reasonable period such as during farm slack
season, so as to decrease the project impact on local production.
1.5 Preparation of Resettlement Works
1.5.1 Determination of Relocation and Resettlement Scope
The criteria and method for determination of scope of land acquisition for
each different objective is described as below.
A. Substations
The land acquisition scope is only for the main structures of substations
excluding the land for outgoing lines. Based on the general layout of the
substation provided by the design institutes, the exact boundary of land
requisition is defined on site.
8



?ttlllent Action Plan
B. Transmission Line
The design institute determines the land acquisition scope for the
transmission line by 1/10000 maps, and defines the boundary on site based
on the drawings. The scope of housing relocation for the transmission line
is in 30m of central line on two sides. Based on the preliminarily
determined line route, the design institutes went to the site to make
measurement and set the boundary lines, draw the cross sections of the line
route and housing location map, and determine the land requisition scope.
The land requisition scope at this stage of design is the max. control scope
and the actual scope of land requisition will be reduced as the design gets
into more and more details. The final land requisition scope will be staked
out based on the field measurement by the design institutes according to
Technical Specifications for Overhead Distribution Line Design (SD206-
87). The land area within the four foots of the towers will be the base for
calculating the tower base land requisition. (Actually, the land beyond the
places occupied by the foots of the tower can be still used by the farmers
after construction.. Refer to the photo below).
After resettlement and power line construction, cultivated land under the
transmission lines can still be farmed; and the agricultural income of the
concerned farmers will not be affected. However, under the transmission
lines, no houses or other structures should be constructed.
1.5.2 Demography and Inventory Survey
From the last ten-day of July to the middle ten-day of August 1998,
Zhejiang Provincial EHV Transmission Construction Company, who was
entrusted by the project owner, organized several survey teams formed by
design units, M&E unit and local power supply bureaus to investigate item
by item the affected inventory and PAPs. The survey was greatly supported
by the local government and village committees. The project impact
9



Resettlonnt Actirm Plan
includes land acquisition, house relocation, scattered trees, and relocation of
infrastructure and population affected.
Statistics of the land to be requisitioned was carried out household by
household on the basis of the land contracts.
Statistics of the housing relocation was based on measurement of each
house to be relocated according to the house location map provided by the
design institutes.
Scattered trees to be cut was calculated by the empirical number.
Statistics of the affected infrastructures was based on the actual situation
and counted one by one.
The survey on PAPs was carried out household by household.
1.6.   Resettlement Preparation
1.6.1 Establishing of Organization
Before compilation of the RAP, Zhejiang Provincial Electric Power
Corporation had already organized relative departments and its
subordinate power bureaus to establish resettlement organizations.
Meanwhile, Zhejiang Extra-High Voltage Construction Company will
also entrust East China Investigation and Design Institute with the M&E
works.
1.6.2 Legal Framework
In order to carry out the resettlement work smoothly, and correctly
dispose of the benefits between state, collective and individuals,
determine the compensation standard rationally and make the
resettlement plan tally with the actual situation, the project owner had
entrusted, in the stage of preparation, relative units to collect the relative
resettlement policies of the state and the Word Bank, on which the legal
framework for the RAP is based. The RAP preparation mainly follows the
laws and regulations as below:
A. Land Administration Law of the People's Republic of China
B. Implementation Method of Land Administration Law of Zhejiang
Province
C. Administration Method of Wood Land of Zhejiang Province
D. Implementation Method of Land Administration Law of the People's
Republic of China
E. Notice On Adjustment of Farmland Occupation Tax
F. Several Rules For Policies Implementation For Transmission Line

1.6.3 Social Economical Survey of Project Impact
From the last ten-day of July to the middle ten-day of August 1998, before
compilation of the RAP, the project owner organized the relative
departments to carry out social economic survey of project impact. The
main contents for social economical survey include the local social and
economical status before construction and the impact degree for the local
social economical development and the households affected by the project.
Combining collection of local recent social-economic information and on-
site survey, the project social-economic survey was carried out. The detailed
information of the household affected by land requisition was collected
household by household.
1.6.4 Public Participation and Collecting Social Opinions
In order to encourage public participation and solicit the opinions from the
society and the affected population, in the preparatory of RAP, the project
office and the resettlement office had adopted various means including
meetings participated by the local cadres at all levels and the affected
persons to the relative resettlement policies and publecize relevant Word
Bank' policies, solicit opinions on how to reduce the project impact and
make the resettlement and compensation standard for different area, and
extensively consult -with local government and resettlers. All of these are
included in this report.
1.6.5  Preparation of RAP, Monitoring and Evaluation
Under the support of -the local governments at various levels, the
preparatory work for resettlement action program is organized by Zhejiang
Provincial EHV Transmission Construction Company and the power supply
bureaus in the affected prefectures and cities, and -participated in by the
design institutes and monitoring and assessment units involved in the
project(The persons who are invoved in RAP preparation are listed in
Attachment 4 hereinaftes). East China Investigation and Design Institute
provides technical instruction service. The work which have been
completed since March 1998 includes establishment -of the resettlement
offices, defmiing the project impact scope, land requisition affected
inventory survey, social and economic survey, policy study, formulation of
resettlement schemes, Tesettlement compensation budgetary, and etc. With

2.3 The Social Economic status of affected Towns and villages
Due to small influence to the local production caused by land acquisition
for transmission lines and big impact caused by land acquisition for
substation, the measures for production arrangement are certainly different
from each other. Usually, for the transmission line land requisition, the
restoration for the producting and living situations of the people whose land
will be requisitioned should be realized based on land adjustment and the
cash compensation. But, such measure for land acquisition of the substation
project is not sufficient, it should be well planned and adopt specific
measures. So the information collection of social and economic status for
transmission lines and substations is different. The information collection
for transmission line route is based on general conditions, while that
substations, should include aspects of the social and economic status. By
the survey results, the social and economic status of towns and villages
affected by substations is shown in Table 2-2, Table 2-3, Table 2-4, and the
social and economic status of affected towns and villages along transmission
lines is shown in Attachment 2.

3 PROJECT IMPACT
Among the corollary transmission works for Tongbai Pumped Storage Project,
the extension of 500kV Wenzhou Substation and 5OOkV Ningbo Substation is
to be carried out in the original land acquisition area, and without land
acquisition and relocation. As a result, the land acquisition and relocation are
only for five new projects, i.e., 500kV Xiaoshan Substation, 500kV Zhuji
Substation, 5OOkV Yuyao Substation, Ningbo-Wenzhou transmission line and
Tongbai-Zhuji transmission line.

Note:Population affected by housing relocation includes 36 people whose enterprise will
be dismantled by Yuyao substation.
3.1 Land Acquisition
The land acquisition for this project includes permanent land acquisition and
temporary land acquisition. A total of permanent land acquisition will be 717.8
mu, including farn land 439.2 mu, garden land 35.0 mu, 10 mu cemetery, 5.0
mu housing plot, and other -non-cultivated land, while temporary  land
acquisition will totally be 255 mu cultivated land. The permanent land
acquisition for substations (on villages basic) is shown in Table 3-2. The
permanent land acquisition of transmission lines (on counties basic) is shown
in Table 3-3, and the permanent land acquisition for transmission lines (on
villages basic) is shown in Attachment 3.
The quantity of the lands temporarily requisitioned for construction will be
based on the actual occupation of the land during construction. Usually, no
temporary land acquisition for substation construction is required. By the plan
of construction for Ningbo-Wenzhou transmission line, it required 52 drag

areas and tensional areas; calculating by three mu for each area on average,
156mu land is required for construction. And, it required 6 material storage
areas for whole lines, calculating by four mu for each area on average, 24mu
land is required for temperory acquisition. By the plan of construction for
Tongbai-Zhuji transmission line, it requires 63mu for 21 drag areas and
tensional areas and 12mu for 3 material storage areas for the whole line. The
temporary land acquisition of transmission line is shown in Table 3-3.

3.2   Affected House
There is no house relocation for Xiaoshan substation.
The affected houses at Zhuji substation and Yuyao substation sites are
determined by the land acquisition scope. The house relocation scope for
transmission line is determined in this stage by the maps, together with on-site
investigation. Site survey was carried out for the inundated inventory. The
house relocation includes main house and auxiliary houses.

3.3 Affected Population
The project affected population here means their living level affected directly
by house relocation or land acquisition, therefore, they are divided into two
parts, i.e., population affected by house relocation and those affected by land
requisition.
A. Population Affected by House Relocation
The population affected by house relocation means those whose main houses
will be dismantled due to construction of the substations and transmission lines.
The number of such people is counted by field survey (household to
househould), details are shown in Table 3-5.

B. Population Affected by Land Requisition
lThe people affected by land requisition include those directly affected by land
acquisition and the rural population to be resettled as calculated according to
Land Administration Law of the People's Republic of China. The people
actually affected by the land acquisition refer to those who will lose at least
part of their farmland due to land is requisitioned. The number of population
affected by land requisition for three substations was determined by detailed
field survey among individual households within the land acquisition scope.
According to a actual field survey (see Table 3-6), a total of 145 househoulds
and 626 people will be actually affectly by the land acquisition for all three
substation, including 39 households and 147 people for Xiaoshan Substation,
68 households and 341 people for Zhuji Substation, and 38 households and
138 people for Yuyao Substation. The population affected by the tower base
land acquisition along the transmission lines weren't investigated household to
household because of slight impact on the land contracted households, (tower
base requiring about 100 m2 land for each and scattered), though the affected
population are in a considerable number along the whole transmission lines.

Note:  Because the tower base land requisition is small in quantity and scattered,
which results in a less impact on the production and living of -the
households, there is only 1-2 person in each village by average, so the
affected households is not taken into account.
According to the current Land Administration Law of People's Republic of
China, the agricultural people in excess to will be calculated by the cultivated
land to be requisitioned divided by the cultivated land holding per agricultural
people before land acquisition. Following the formula of the Land
Administration Law, total number of agricutrual people in excess for the
project is listed in Table 3-7, with 617 people, including 199 people for
Xiaoshan Substation. 151 people for Zhuji Substation, and 118 people for
Yuyao Substation, 71 people for Ningbo-Wenzhou Transmission line, and 78

3.4 Affected Infrastructures
Because the transmission lines of the project, generally to be erected spanning
over other objects, will mostly pass through the hilly regions, runmning parallel
and far apart from the highway, and adopt good conductor for earthing along
the whole lines, they will have little influences on the infrastructures of local
regions. However, the substation land acquisition and project construction
certainly will affect some local infrustructures. The details of the affected
infrastructures are shown in Table 3-8.

Guanhu Village and Yuyao Substation will affect 30 pits scattered tombs
including Tongguan Village 25 pits and Zhongjiamen Village 5 pits and
Tongguan-Village-owned cemetery which occupied 10 mu land.
In addition, among three substations, only construction of Yuyao Substation
will affect three small village enterprises, including one small hardware factory,
one stone-processing factory and one tea-making factory. All of them are
collectively owned by Tongguan Village, and are currently being contracted to
indiciduals to operate by renting the spaces owned by Tongguan Village
collective.
For the hardware factory, it has 25 employees and occupies 350 square meters
of spaces; for stone-processing factory, it has 5 employees and occupies 40
square meters of spaces; and for the tea-making factory, it has 6 employees and
occupies 830 square meters of spaces. All such spaces were owned by the
village and will be demolished along with land requisition. The amounts of
spaces for these three enterprises were included in the total structures to be
demolished by the project. The details of other facilities to be affected are

B. Land Acquisition for Substation Site
Considering large and centralized area to be requisitioned for substations
which will bring large impact to local economy, the compensation standard for
cultivated land will be 65,988Y/mu, more than that for transmission line,
(including land compensation, laborer arrangement allowance, subsidy of
standing crops, associated facility fee for constructions of towns and villages,
guarantees for land redevelopment, ploughable land occupation taxes, reserved
funds for local departments, administrative expenses for local departments ).
The compensation standard for garden plots (or tea.field) will be 65,988Y/mu,
the same as that for cultivated land. The compensation standard for non-
cultivated land (including land for cemetery land) will be 5076Y/mu, the same

C. House Plot
The house plots along the transmission line will be re-cultivated and the house
will be relocated to other designated places; therefore, only re-cultivation fees
and administrative fee are required. In the case that the old house plots are not
suitable to re-cultivate, the compensation criteria of house -plots is same as that
for tower bases land acquisition along the transmission line, but deducting the
reserve fund and administrative expenses for local departments, i.e., 9300
Y/mu. This part of compensation will be listed in the reserved fund. Because
the house plots within the substation land acquisition scope cannot be re-
cultivated, they must be compensated at the compensation criteria 65988Y/mu,
same as that of cultivated land.
D. Temporary Land Acquisition for Construction
The areas of the land temporarily requisitioned for construction will be
calculated based on the actual occupation of -the land during construction.
Compensation criteria are different based on the 4ifference of the land using
period and purpose of using. Because -the drag areas and tensional areas will
only affect one crop on the land and not damage cultivated conditions, the
subsidy of standing crops is calculated on 500Y/mu. The using period of the
material storage areas is longer (generally for two years), and will exert more
adverse influence on the Tre-cultivating conditions, so the compensation
standard is higher, calculated on 7200Y/mu (including 2000 for guaranteeing
land redevelopment, 3000 for cost of land redevelopment, 1100 Yuan x
2=2200 for loss compensation).

5.2.2 Compensation Standard for Housing and Auxiliaries
In order to determine adequate compensation level for the lost houses.,
detail investigation and analysis were carried out. From such investigation,
the replacement cost for brick concrete houses was found to be from 300
yuan to 340 vuan per square meter among different cities. (with 327.8 yuan
for Taizhou City). In order to ensure adequate compensation for relocated
families. a unified compensation standard will be adopted. They will be
based on the upper range of housing replacement cost for different
categories of structures. which include 340 yuan for brick-concrete
structure. 300 vuan for brick wood structure, 280 yuan for board wood
structure and 260 yuan for earth wood structure. For those houses with
recently complete decoration. additional compensation will be provided
through with affected families. For a detailed analysis of the repacement
cost for houses of brick concrete structure, see Table 5.4, and see Table 5-5
for the compensation standards for housing and its auxiliaries.

6.   Plan for Resettlement and Production Restoration
Due to small influence to the local production caused by land acquisition
of transmission line and big impact caused by land acquisition of
substation, the measures for production arrangement are certainly different
from each other. Usually, for the transmission line land requisition, the
production rehabilitation should be realized to restore affected persons'
livelihood levels based on land adjustment with cash compensation. But,
such measure for the substation land acquisition is not sufficient, it should
be well planned and adopts specific measures. Therefore, this chapter will
mainly introduce the rehabilitation plan for the substation land acquisition.
6.1 Pprinciples of Planning
A. The resettlement plan should give due consideration to the overall plan of
local land use, the social-economic and social development.
B. The benefits between state, collective and individuals should be
consideration in an overall plan and taking all factors into account.
C. Resettlement plan should be based on inundated inventory and the
compensation standards, it should also be prepared in accordance with
development strategies and overall plan for increasing or at least recovering
resettlers' living conditions as before resettlement. The construction scale
and its standards for resettlement items should reach the original scale and
standards before resettlement. According to the planning requirement, no
surplus, investment will be made in the plan. The investment needed for
regional development, enlarging scale and raising standards for the
relocated structures, or for the future development, etc. should be raised by
the relative local govemments and departments concerned.
D. Resettlement plan should be suitable for the circumstances, fully utilize the
resources in the local comity.
E. And, the plan should be beneficial to production and facilitating the
resettlers' living.

(1) Analysis of impact of land requisition on villages
Land acquisition for Xiaoshan substation involves Chengjiao village 55 mu
and Wulian Village 82 mu in Chengxiang town. After land acquisition, it will
cause a certain influence for economic development especially for agriculture
production in above two villages. The detail analysis shows in Table 6-1 based
on the national economical statistics data in 1997.

Note: The indexes of the items stating "after acquisition" in the above table is forecast indexes.
(Same as the tables below.)
Referring to the above table, the total population in Chengjiao Village is 1782
persons with the total labor force 1156 persons, among which the agricultural
laborers are 239 persons, accounting for 20.7% in total labor force; the total
cultivated land is 1223 mu. The total population in Wulian Village is 1908
persons with the total labor force 1145 persons, among which the agricultural
laborers are 398 persons, accounting for 34.8% in total labor force; the total
cultivated land is 1311 mu. The land to be requisitioned accounts for 4.5% in
Chengjiao Village and 6.3% in Wulian Village. The cultivated land per capita
from 0.69 mu before acquisition will be reduced to 0.66 mu after acquisition in
Chengjiao village and from 0.69 mu to 0.64 mu in Wulian village. Total grain
output before acquisition is 954 ton and 1 100 ton respectively, and the grain
holding is 535 kg and 577 kg per capita Tespectively in the two villages. After
land acquisition, total grain output will be reduced to 911 ton and 1031 ton,
and the grain holding to 511 kg and 540 kg per capital respectively, which still
can meet the grain requirement by the population in the two villages. Being
impacted by the acquisition, the agriculture income will be respectively
reduced by 80000Yand 130000Y, accounting for 4.09% and 4.83% of the
agricultural income in the above two villages, so land acquisition will cause a
certain influence on agricultural production in -the above two villages.
However, considering the total income and net income per capita, the imnpact
caused by land acquisition of the substation is little. According to Table 6-1,
the total income will respectively reduce 0.26% and 1.22% in the above two
villages , 0.25% and 0.36% for net income per capita. By analyzing on the
above, combined with social and economic statues of two villages, it is known
that town- and village-owned industry is very developed, income of industry
and sideline industry accounts for a considerable proportion of the total income
in the above two villages, and agriculture is no longer main production activity
there.
The cadres of Chengjiao  village and Wulian village introduced that
town(ship)-owned and village-owned industry and sideline industry are
developed , these two villages are both located in countryside of Xiaoshan city,
S1



Resettluaent Action Plan
there are laborers in numerous of families working in town-owned or village-
owned enterprises all the year round. Because of lower agriculture production
income, local residents are not willing to cultivate contracted responsibility
land but grain ration land. Recently, there are some residents returning
cultivated land to the village committee. The two villages have cancelled
villager groups, and the whole cultivated land in villages is administrated by
the village committee. During the period of the project survey, it was found
that 84mu among 410mu contracted cultivated land had been retumed to
Chengjiao village and 442mu among 548mu in Wulian village; and at present
these retumed cultivated land is the reserved collective-owned land, the two
village committees have contratted them to farmers from other villages, with
contracting period of two years .
(2) Analysis of impact of land requisition on affected households
The survey on the land-contracted households within Xiaoshan substation site
shows that there are 39 cultivated land contracted households affected by the
substation land acquisition, with a total of 147 persons. Through statistic
analysis, the affected households have features as below.
Features of PAPs
The survey and analysis show that the persons at age between 17 - 35 account
for 29.9% of the total population affected by the substation land acquisition,
the persons at age between 35 - 50 account for 313%, the persons who have
received education above junior high school account to 37.3%, those below
primary school account for 62.8%.
---- Features of affected households
From the analysis on the 39 affected households at Xiaoshan substation site, it
can be seen that most of them are formed by two generations (one couple with
children) and three generations (or more), accounting for 89.7% of the total.
Generally, such family have three or more members, with two or more laborers,
accounting for 89.8%. According to the survey, more than one of the laborers
in such families is involved in non-agricultural work all the year round,
gaining a stable income for the family. The impact on such families caused by
the land requisition is slight.
-- Income features of affected families
The average net income of the 39 affected households is 3637.4 yuan per
capita. There are 34 households which have their net agricultural income
below 40% of the total family -net income, accounting for 87.2% in the
households affected by land acquisition. This indicates that not all of the
affected families have their incomes sourced from agriculture excerpt for the
52



Resettlement Action Plan
households planting grain in large scale, thus it can be seen that the substation
land requisition does not affect the main income source of the affected
households.
Features of affected laborers
The data of the annals of two villages indicate that proportion of agri-laborers
in rural actual labor force is 20.1% in Chengjiao Village and 34.8% in Wulian
Village. Also, the cadres in the village introduce that local industry and
sideline are developed, especially, there are many camlet-making factories in
the local region, where there are four large-scale ones, with staffs of 250
person-time. Generally, rural laborers works in these enterprises indirectly or
directly. About 30% among the existing labor force collect feather for the
enterprises in the town and village and another 40% work in the enterprises all
the year round. Other places' persons account for a certain proportion in local
enterprises, for example, in a chemistry company, 30 employees come from
other places. The analysis and survey indicate that there are 34 families among
the affected households, which have one or more laborer engaged in either
non-agriculture production or the secondary and tertiary industries, accounting
for 87.2%. So the substation land acquisition affected these families slightly.
B. Resettlement Plan
Xiaoshan substation is planned to requisition cultivated land of 55mu in
Chengjiao Village and 82mu in Wulian Village. The on-site investigation
shows that 10mu among the requisitioned 55mu cultivated land is grain ration
land in Chengiiao village, and llmu is contracted land for their own native
villager, and the remaining 34mu is reserved cultivated land returned to the
village by farmers; 20mu amnong the requisitioned 82mu cultivated land is
grain ration land in Wulian village, and 5Omu is contracted land for their own
native villager, and the remaining 12mu is reserved cultivated land returned to
the village by farmers. Because impact on economic income of the two
villages and affected households, caused by the land requisition for Xiaoshan
substation, is slight, the following three resettlement measures are adopted for
affected households and laborers after consulting with the two villagers and
soliciting opinions from local government:
a. Re-adjusting cultivated land to meet standard of 0.4mu grain ration land
per capita. Before construction of the substation, and after expiration of
contracting period of the village-owned reserved cultivated land, the village
committee will take back the reserved cultivated land, part of which will be
allocated to affected persons as grain ration land. In Chengjiao village,
1Omu will be drewn from the remaining 5Omu reserved cultivated land as
grain ration land and 20mu from the remaining 430mu in Wulian village.
53



Rosettl_nt Action PMao
b. Re-adjusting cultivated land to satisfy the villagers' requirement on
contracted land. The village committee will take back the reserved
cultivated land, part of which will be given to land affected households so
as not to reduce their original contracted-land areas, thus 1 Imu will be
drewn from the remaining cultivated land as residents' contracted-land in
Chengjiao village, and 5Omu from the remaining land in Wulian village. If
the households having previously returned contracted land require land, the
Village Committee will take out parts of cultivated land to them from
village-owned reserved cultivated land or other returned land, according to
the PAP's will.
C. Use of Land Compensation
After consulting with cadres of the villages, it is primarily decided that the
land compensation will be used for the following aspects:
a. Construction of the infrastructure facilities to improve local residents'
living -and investrnent environment, such as cable TV, parts of village-
village roads, water supply network and extension of electric power, are
planned construction project by two villages.
b. Construction of production projects such as for flood control and irrigation,
improving low output farmland, farmland standardization zone, and
building associated facilities of-mechanization.
c. Construction of public utilities to improve living level of local residents,
especially living level of old persons.
Use of the land compensation fees must be decided by -illage Committee
and Village Economy Cooperation Committee. Use of non-production
expenses more than IOOOOY must be approved by Chengdong Office (the
agency of local government), Use of the compensation will be made public
to the villager once half a year. Besides use for the above measures, the
remaiing compensation fees will be administrated in a plan as a whole by
the Village Committee, and increasing resettlers' income by taking interest.
D. Forecast of Income
For Xiaoshan Substation, before the land requisition, annual per capita
income will be 5,032 yuan for Chengjiao Village and 4,818 yuan for
Wulian Village. After resettlement. it is expected that the per capita income
of two villages will increase to 5,060 yuan and 4,844 yuan respectively,
which is higher than that before the move. For detailed analysis of income
change of for Xiaoshan Substation, see Table 6-2.

infrastructure facilities, 100,000 yuan for production projects such as flood control and irrigation, improve
low output farmland and buildine associated facilities of mechanization, 50,000 yuan for public utilities.
Area of low output farmland to be improved is based on one third of the remaining village land or 400 mu,
Assuming income per mu will be increased 100 yuan, the total return could by 40,000 yuan.
** Wulian Village will invest 300,000 yuan, including 100,000 yuan using for construction of the
infrastructure facilities, 150,000 yuan for production projects such as flood control and irrigation, iprove
low output farmland and building associated facilities of mechanization, 50,000 yuan for public utilities.
Area of low output farmland to be imnproved is about 410 mu, based on one third of the remaining farmland
from the village. If income per mu will increase by 100 yuan after land improvement. the total profit can
increase 4 1.000 yuan.

Land acquisition for Zhuji substation involves Guanhu village of Wanjiajin
town. The total land to be requisitioned from  the village is 15Omu, including
paddy land 50mu, dry -field 67.5mu, village-owned tea-hill 30mu and
residents' house plot 2.5mu. After land acquisition, it will cause a certain
influence on economic development especially on agriculture production in the
village. The detail analysis shows in Table 6-3 based on the national
economical statistics data in 1997.

Referring to the above table, the total population in Guanhu Village is 1051
persons with the total labor force 782 persons, among which the agricultural
laborers are 530 persons. The total cultivated land in the village is 818mu, the
cultivated land to be requisitioned is 117.5mu, accounting for 1436% of the
village's total existing cultivated land in the village. The cultivated land per
capita will be reduced from 0.78mu before acquisition to 0.67mu after
acquisition. Total grain output before acquisition is p584 tons, and the grain
holding was 556 kg per capita. After land acquisition, total grain output will be
reduced to 500 ton, and the grain holding to 476 kg per capita, which can still
56



Resettlent Action Plan
meet the grain requirement of this village. Being impacted by the land
acquisition, the agricultural income will be reduced by 178000Y, accounting
for 14.35% in the agricultural income of the village, so land acquisition will
cause a certain influence on agriculture production of the village. However,
considering the total income and net income per capita, the influence caused
by the substation land acquisition is slight. Referring to Table 6-2, the total
income will reduce by only 1.50% after land acquisition, net income per capita
decreased by only 0.99% in the village. According to the analysis above, and
considering social and economic statues of the village, it shows that income
from industry and sideline industry accounts for a considerable proportion of
the total income in the villages, and the agri-income is no longer main income
source.
According to on-site investigation, above 90% of income come from building
industry in the village.There are thirteen large- and small-scale individual
construction enterprises, among which three enterprises earn their yearly
income over 1 million Y. Most of the laborers in the village are working in
these enterprises. Because of lower agricultural production income, and
developed industry and sideline, local residents are not willing to cultivate
contracted responsibility land but grain ration land. Recently, the village
committee found it more difficult to carry out land-contracted responsibility
system. More and more cultivated land in the village is getting barren. The
village committee has canceled villager group. The cultivated land of the
village is administrated by the village committee, which will be cultivated by
arranging a few large-scale grain planting households.
(2)   Analysis of impact of land requisition on affected households
The survey on the land-contracted households within Zhuji substation site
shows that there are 68 cultivated land contracted households affected by the
substation land acquisition, with a total of 341 persons. Through statistics and
analysis, the affected households by the substation land acquisition have
features as below.
---- Features of PAPs
The survey and analysis show that the persons at age between 17 - 35 account
for 30.5% of the total population affected by the substation land acquisition,
the persons at age between 35 - 50 account for 27.6%, the persons who have
received education above junior high school account for 64.8%, those below
primary school account for 3 5.1%. The figures here indicate that a greater part
of the population in the affected households are middle-aged and young people,
they have received comparatively higher education and are active in thinking
57



Resettlmnt Action Plan
and have rather strong adaptability to the social environment. Therefore, they
possess a rather stronger advantage in being employed in the non-agricultural
industry. After resettlement, they can receive more chance to be employed and
will quickly get used to the new work. So, the impact caused by the land
acquisition will be more easily mitigated.
- Features of affected households
From the analysis on the 68 affected households, it can be seen that most of
them are formed by two generations (one couple with children) and three
generations (or more), accounting for 73.5% of the total. Generally, such
families have three or more members, with two or more laborers, accounting
for 89.7%. According to the survey, one or more the laborers in such families
is involved in non-agricultural production all the year round, gaining a stable
income for the family. The land requisition impact on such families is slight.
---- Income features of affected families
The average net income of the 68 affected households is 5630 yuan. There are
55 households which have their net agricultural income below 40% of the total
family net income. This indicates that the affected families have their incomes
mainly sourced from the secondary and tertiary industries not from agriculture
excerpt for large-scale grain planting households, thus it can be seen that the
substation land requisition does not affect the main income source of the
affected households.
Features of affected laborers
The cadres in the village introduce that local building industry is developed,
there are many individual contractors who contract building projects in the
local region. Generally, local rural laborers are involved in these companies
and engaged in houses building in different regions all the year round. The
survey found that 62 families among the affected households have laborers
involved in either non-agriculture production or the secondary and tertiary
industries, accounting for 91.2% of the affected households. So the project
affects such families slightly.
B. Resettlement Plan
Because impact of the substation land requisition on economic income of the
village and affected households, is slight, -the following two resettlement
measures will be adopted for the affected households and laborers after
consulting with the villager and soliciting opinions from the local government:
a. Re-adjusting cultivated land to reduce influence on a few large-scale grain
planting households. After land acquisition, there will be 700.5mu
cultivated land remaining (paddy land 686mu and dry land 14.5mu). For
58



Besettlemwt Action Plan
maintaining meeting grain ration standard of 0.4mu cultivated land per
capita, the village committee decides to distribute the remaining 280mu
cultivated land among the large-scale planting grain households on their
willing, so as to guarantee their contracted-land areas to be restored.
b Raising resettler' income by developing land and multi-operating business.
It is introducted by the cadres of the village that there is 1 SOmu barren hill
to be developed. After land acquisition, the village administration plans to
develop this hill-land as orchards, taking advantage of original two small-
scale reservoirs as water source. It is primarily estimated that the general
investment for the plan is 750,000Y, including 100,00OYfor heightening
the original reservoir dams, 50,000 Y for building a 1000-meter-long
concrete irrigation channel, 150,000Yfor ground leveling, soil and stone
excavating and backfilling, and 3000Yper mu for planting trees and
irrigating. The village committee will contract the new orchards to
villagers.
C. Use of Land Compensation
After consulting with cadres of village, it is primarily decided that the land
compensation be used in the following aspects, besides developing land.
a. Construction of the communication facilities to improve local traffic. The
existing traffic facilities are poor now, and there is only one tractor road
linking the village with other places. After finishing access road to the
substation, the village will build a 5OOm-long Grade HI highway
connecting the access road to the substation, the investment being 250,000
Y, which connect with the access Toad to the substation.
b. Construction of the electricity facilities. The survey shows that local
electricity facilities are very out of date, and the reliability rate of the power
supply is not high. After land acquisition, the low-voltage transmission
lines will be upgraded properly in the village.
c. Construction of public utilities to improve living level of local residents,
especially the living level of the old persons.
Use of the land compensation fees must be decided by Village Committee
and Village Economy Cooperation Committee, and use of the
compensation will be made public to the villager once half a year. Besides
use for the above measures, the remaining compensation fees will be
administrated in a plan as a whole by the Village Committee, and mainly
59

used for annual production such as irrigation and improving low output
land etc.
D. Forecast of Income
For Zhuji Substation, before the land requisition, annual per capita income
will be 3,851 yuan for Guanhu Village. After resettlement, it is expected
that the per capita income for the same village will be increased to 4,338
yuan. higher than before the resettlement. For detailed analysis of income
change for Zhuji Substation, see Table 6-4.

ReferTing to the above table, the total population in Zhongjiamen Village is
1108 persons with the total labor force 605 persons, among which the
agricultural laborers are 325 persons. The total cultivated land is 866.3mu. The
total population in Tongguang Village is 978 persons with 570 laborers, among
61



Resettlawet Actiw Plan
-which the agricultural laborers are 241 persons. The total cultivated land is
1225 mu. The land to be requisitioned accounts for 5.5% and 5.7% of the total
land respectively in Zhongjiamen Village and Tongguang Village. The
cultivated land per capita will be reduced from 0.78mu before acquisition to
0.74mu after acquisition in Zhongjiamen Village and from 1.25mu to 1.18mu
in Tongguang Village. The total grain output before acquisition is 545 tons and
584 tons with 492 kg and 597 kg per capita respectively in the two villages.
After land acquisition, total grain output will be reduced to 515 ton and 551
ton with 465 kg and 563 kg per capital respectively, which can still meet the
grain requirement of the above two -villages. Being impacted by the substation
land acquisition, the agricultural income were respectively will be reduced by
189000Yand 244000Y, accounting for 5.7% and 5.7% in the total agricultural
income in the above two villages, so the land acquisition will cause a certain
influence on agricultural production of the above two villages. However,
considering the total income and net income per capita, the impact caused by
the land acquisition is slight. Refening to Table 6-3, the total income will be
reduced by only 1.00% and 1.06% in the above two villages, net income per
capita decreased 0.300% and 0.48%. According to -analysis on above, and
considering the social and economic statues of the two villages, it is shown that
the income from industry and sideline industry accounts for a considerable
proportion of the total income in the above two villages, and agricultural
production is no longer main production activity.
The introduction by the cadres of the two villages shows that most families
have laborers working in the county enterprises. The two villages locate at the
suburb of Yuyao city, there are many job chances for the rural laborers.
Because of lower agriculture production income and developed local industry
and sideline industries, local residents are not willing to cultivate land but
grain ration land. Currently, the two villages both have canceled villager group,
and the whole cultivated land -in village is administrated by -the village
committee. The survey indicates that the two village committees have
contracted the cultivated land (except the grain ration land) to the large-scale
grain planting -households or farmers from other villages.
(2)  Analysis of impact of land requisition on affected households
The survey on the land-contracted households within Yuyao substation site
shows that there are 38 land-contracted households affected by the substation
land acquisition, with -a total of 138 persons. Through statistics and analysis,
land acquisition affected households have features as below.
-- Features of PAPs
The survey and analysis show that the persons at age below 35 account for
62



Resettlownt Action Pl1
55.1% of the total population affected by the substation land acquisition, with
15.2% persons at age above 50. The figures indicate that local population tends
to be younger. Among the affected population, the persons who have received
education above junior high school account for 51.4%, with 48.6% below
primary school. The figures indicate that most laborers have received high
education.
Features of affected households
From the analysis on the affected households, it can be seen that among the 38
affected households, most of them are formed by two generations (one couple
with children) and three generations (or more), accounting for 81.6% of the
total. Generally, such families have three or more members, with two or more
laborers, accounting to 89.5%. According to the survey, one (or more) of the
laborers in such families is involved in non-agricultural production all the year
round, gaining a stable income for the family. The impact on such families
caused by the substation land acquisition is slight.
- Income features of affected families
The average net income of the 38 affected households is 4470yuan. There are
13 households which have their net income per capita below 3000Y. 28
families among the affected households have their agricultural income below
40% of the total family income, with agricultural income per capita being less
than 700yuan. But 5 affected households have their agricultural income above
80% of the total family income, with agricultural income per capita being
5260yuan. Analysis on the laborers employment and features of affected
families shows that local affected families fall into two groups: those in the
first group are few in number and working on large-scale grain planting or
working in industry and sideline industry successfully, the laborers of such
families are young and energitic and have received high education. Income of
such families is high. Those in the second group are simple in employment
structure,and their laborers have received little education and are rather old.
Total income of such families is lower and they possess a rather worse
situation in employment competition.
Features of affected laborers
Land acquisition for Yuyao substation is in the suburb of Yuyao City, so local
rural laborers can generally work in the county enterprises. According the
survey, there are 31 affected households which have laborers involved in non-
agriculture production, accounting for 81.6% of total affected households. And
there are 17 families have their laborers employing in non-agriculture,
accounting for 44.6% of the total affected households. It is -also indicated that
most of families have part (or whole) laborers engaged in the secondary and
-63

tertiary industries. So the project will affect such families slightly.
(3) Analysis of impact of land requisition on affected enterprises
The construction of Yuyao Substation will affect three village-owned
enterprises, including one small hardware factory, one stone-processing factory
and one tea-making factory. These three affected enterprises will not be
interrupted for production due to relocation, since the village could provide
them alternative spaces within the village for them to continue operation. After
consultation with relative departments. cash compensation will be adopted for
the loss of the enterprises due to relocation. And all employees of these three
enterprises will not lose jobs due to relocation, and maintain their wage income
during the relocation. Subsidies for employees during relocation, and subsidies
for moving are included in the compensation package paid to the enterprises.
B. Resettlement Plan
Construction of Yuyao substation will requisition 48mu cultivated land in
Zhongjiamen Village and 69.3mu cultivated land in Tongguang Village.
According to the on-site investigation, 13mu among the 48mu requisitioned
cultivated land is the villagers' grain ration land and contracted land in
Zhongjiamen Village, and the remaining 35mu is village-owned reserved
cultivated land. The overwhelming majority of the 69.5mu requisitioned
cultivated land is native villager' grain ration land and contracted land in
Tongguang Village, including contracted land of the large-scale planting grain
households in native village. If calculated by original cultivated land holding
per capita, 57 laborers whose living mainly depends on agriculture production
will loss their contracted land. Since the substation land requisition induces
little impact on the income of the villages and the households, the below
resettlement measures will be adopted for affected households and laborers
after consulting with the village and soliciting opinion from the local
government.
a. Before starting construction for Yuyao substation, the village committee will
re-adjust cultivated land. After meeting O.4mu grain ration land per capita, the
remaining cultivated land will be distributed to the large-scale grain planting
households and to those households with their labor employment structure
being simple and with a rather worse situation in the employment competition
on a voluntary basis, so as to restore their original contracted-land areas.
b. According to the local resources (favorable for planting arbutus) and
geographical location (nearby the highway from Yuyao to Ningbo),
developing -tertiary industries. The two villages have long planned a 2700-
square-meter ground near the Yuyao-Ningbo highway for building a free
64



Resettlmnt Action Plan
market. The investment is estimated to be 600,OOOY to build a 2000-
square-meter shed and arranging 80 stands for selling agricultural and
sideline products such as fruits and vegetables etc.. It is estimated that
annual income per capita will reach about 6000Y. After getting the land
compensation, two villages will jointly build the free market. Privilege will
be given to the surplus labor force in the two villages and the market will
be administrated by the two village.
c. Scientific farming and adjusting the cropping pattern. So far as grain ration
per capita is met, vegetable and fruilt production will be well developed by
taking advantage of the land resource, so as to raise the residents' income
level .
C. Using for Land Compensation
After preliminary discussion by the cadres of the village, the village will
use the remaining for the below some aspects, besides for the use for the
above aspects.
a. Construction of the infrastructure facilities to improve local residents'
living environment.
b. Construction of public utilities to improve living level of local residents,
especially living level of old persons.
Use of the land compensation fees must be decided by Viliage Committee and
Village Economy Cooperation Committee, and will be made public to the
villager each half a year. Besides the above measures, the remaining
compensation will be administrated in a plan as a whole by the Village
Committee, some for production such as controlling flood, irrigation and
developing fruit garden such as arbutus etc., and the others for subsidy being
distributed to resettlers as to increase their income by taking the bank interest
every year.
D. Forecast of Income
For Yuyao Substation, before the land requisition, annual per capita income
will be 5,758 yuan for Zhongjiamen Village and 5,647 yuan for Tongguang
Village. After resettlement, it is expected -that the per capita income of two
villages will increase to 5,858 yuan and 5,756 yuan respectively, which is
higher than that before the move. For detailed analysis of income change for
Yuyao Substation, see Table 6-6.

6.2.1.4. Ningbo-Wenzhou and Tongbai-Zhuji Transmission Line
The land to be requisitioned for the transmission line only accounts to less than
1%woo of the land of the villages along the lines, which affects each village very
slightly, (details are shown in Table 6-7 and Table .6-8) and has little impact on
the agriculture. If proper land adjustment in the villages is taken, the
households affected by land requisition can continue to farm on cultivated land
and their job position will not be changed. Transmission line land Tequlsition
mainly occur at the tower base, small in area and scattering in many villages;
the impact is small with only less than one laborer in each village on average.
After consultation with local governments, land adjustment plus cash

Resettlment Action Plan
6.2.2. Housing Relocation Plan
In the Transmission Line Component of Tongbai Pumped Storage Project,
some households within the substations and along the transmission lines
(only excerpt for Xiaoshan substation) will be relocated, including 1740
square meter houses from Zhuji substation, 1885 square meter houses from
Yuyao substation and 20134 square meter houses along the Ningbo-
Wenzhou and Tongbai-Zhuji transmission lines. After fully consulting with
local government at all levels and resettlers, the house removal and
rebuilding will be carried out in accordance with the following principle
and methods.
A. As only few houses need to relocate and these houses are rather
scattered in different administration villages along the transmission
lines, and impact of the land acquisition is small for local production,
the inhabitants can still engage in their production in the original
villages; therefore, the new house will be built in the original
community area (the original villages) with in the distance not more
than 0.5 to 1.0 km from their old houses, thus facilitating their farming
production. Respecting the will of most of the Tesettlers, the houses
removal and rebuilding will be carried out by the relocated households
themselves. Before project construction, the householder (the owner or
the representative of the houses) will be responsible for the houses
removal, and this work will be supervised by the local resettlement
organizations or institutions;
B. Since the houses to be relocated are mainly within the substations sites,
the village committee will allocate new house plot to the resettlers on
their desires after consultation with the resettled households. The houses
will be removed and reconstructed by the resettlers' themselves. Before
project construction, the householder (the owner or the representative of
the houses) will be responsible for the houses removal, and this work
will be supervised by the local resettlement organizations or institutions;
C. The resettlers can freely make selections about first removal then
construction or first construction then removal. If they select the later,
before completion of the new houses, the resettlers can stay in their
original houses, no one allowed to force them removal before the
deadline of removal.
D. According -to "Law of Land Administration", the location and quantity
of the resettlers' new house plot will be jointly arranged by the
town(ship) government, village committee and village groups. Selection
of house plots outside of the arranged places should be approved by the
village committee, while the village committee distribute the house plots
to the resettlers on their desire;
69



Resettlent Actim  Plan
E. Three months prior to building new  houses, the resettlers will receive a
notice for house construction, at least more than four months will be
allocated to -them to build their new houses. During house building, the
relative authorities will consult with the resettlers, and may prolong the
building time based on actual requirement. The compensation subsidies
for relocation and for working hours losing should be timely paid to
resettlers,
F. During  resettlement,  resettlement  organization  will adopt  efficient
measures to help families which has the old, weak, sick or disabled
peoples, and the women-headed families. For these resettlers, the
township resettlement group or village committees will be in charge of
helping them build new houses and help them remove to new houses;
G. All relocated households will get the compensation fees at house
replacement price, the salvageable materials of the old houses can be
used for new house free of charge. Prior to the house construction, the
compensation fees should be paid to resettlers at one-time or in
installment by the project owner through local resettlement
organizations. If the compensation paid in installment, the last payment
should be paid before the new house completion.
6.2.3. Infrastructure Restoration Plan
Infrastructures affected by the project need to be rebuilt, except the tractor
roads at Xiaoshan substation site. After consulting with the relative
departments, it is decided to make one-time cash compensation for the
resettlement. Local village committee will rebuild the facilities at other places
by themselves. The details for the plan of the infrastructure restoration are
shown in Table 6-9

Resettlement Action Plan
6.2.4. Restoration Plan for Other Facilities
Other affected facilities at the substation sites are mainly tombs and industrial
enterprises, none of them along the transmission lines. It is decided to adopt
cash compensation for the scttered private tombs, which will be moved to
other places by the owner themselves. The affected cemetery will be
compensated by actual investment, which will be rebuilt at other places or
other cemeteries nearby by Tongguang Village and Lusheng Real Estate
Company. The affected village-owned enterprises have been contracted to
individuals. Both village and contractors have vacant rooms which can be used
for resettlement. After consultion with relative departments, it is decided to
adopt cash compensation for housing, removal and loss caused by stopping
production; the enterprises can build by contractors themselves. Such
enterprises should complete resettlement before the project construction, and
workers still work in the original units, so there will be no problem of laborers
resettlement.
