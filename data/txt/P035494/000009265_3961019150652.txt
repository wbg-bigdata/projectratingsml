MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE DOMINICAN
REPUBLIC FOR A SECOND BASIC EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Dominican Republic for US$37.0 million equivalent. The loan would be repayable over a
period of 20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable rate. The project
would also be assisted by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) through parallel financing in an
amount of US$52.0 million equivalent.
2.    Sector Background. The Dominican Republic's 1991-1995 economic stabilization program
and policies to enhance external trade and investment have improved prospects for the alleviation of
poverty through export-driven growth. However, these prospects are dimmed by low levels of human
capital accumulation. The average Dominican worker, including 1994 entrants to the labor force, has
completed only four years of school; and, one person in five over the age of 15 is illiterate. The costs of
low human capital formation, coupled with low average earnings and a high degree of income
inequality, are reflected in the current poverty rate of some 20 percent of the population.
3.    Deficient basic education services contributed to the country's human resources constraints.
After a decade of mixed progress in the 1970s, the quality, coverage, and efficiency of basic education
(one year of preschool, six years of primary and two years of lower secondary school) deteriorated
sharply. Insufficient financing was a principal reason for the collapse in the public sector, which is
responsible for nearly 80 percent of enrollments in basic education. Public expenditure on education
fell from 1.9 percent of GDP in 1982 to 0.9 percent by 1991. Real per student expenditure on basic
education in 1990 represented about 40 percent of that of 1980; at US$32 per primary school student,
recurrent expenditure ranked with that of Haiti as the lowest in the hemisphere. Teachers' salaries
dipped below the public sector minimum wage to US$50 per month per shift (nearly two-thirds of
teachers work two shifts daily). Meager salary and non-salary incentives combined with inadequate
working conditions to spur teacher absenteeism, strikes, and departure of formally qualified teachers
from the profession. Between 1986 and 1991, applicants to the country's teacher training schools
dropped from 2,400 to less than 600; and, in 1992, 15 percent of practicing teachers were untrained
secondary school graduates retained to fill the gap. Facilities development and maintenance, as well as
provision of appropriate curriculum, student and teacher learning materials, lagged far behind needs.
A high level of centralization and poor management capacity within the Secretariat of State for
Education and Arts (SEEBAC) exacerbated the problems.
4.    By 1991, only 16 percent of five year olds were enrolled in preschool classes, the majority
housed in public primary schools lacking the requisite space and materials. An estimated 90 percent of
the relevant age-group was enrolled at the primary level; this group was equally divided between girls
and boys. However, only half of the 950,000 children enrolled in public primary schools could be
expected to complete the primary cycle. Average annual repetition and dropout reached 18 percent and
21 percent, respectively. The lowest participation and completion rates were found among that 65
percent of the student age-group living in rural and peri-urban areas. Private, mainly urban schools,
which accounted for 20 percent of students enrolled at the primary level, and 30 percent of students at
the lower secondary level, grades 7 and 8, increased their share as a response to the crisis in the public



2
sector. However, many of these schools, which serve lower income students, also lacked adequate
resources.
5.    Faced with an educational crisis, the business community, NGOs, the teachers' union, and
major political parties engaged in a consultative process which led to government adoption of the Ten-
Year Education Plan in 1991. For basic education, the Plan aims to expand service coverage, raise
student achievement levels, and strengthen sector management. Included are specific objectives to: (a)
increase public spending on basic education; (b) promote a set of national education standards; (c)
provide appropriate educational materials and teacher training; (d) strengthen and deconcentrate
SEEBAC's management; and (e) stimulate community participation in school development and
management. To support the execution of the Plan's first phase (1991-95), the Bank approved the
Primary Education Development Project (Loan 3351-DO, US$15 million) in 1991, in parallel with a
complementary operation supported by the IDB (Loan amount US$29 million).
6.    Plan outcomes and implementation achievements to date have surpassed expectations. During
1991-94, overall enrollments in basic education grew by 9 percent, with the preschool enrollment rate
rising to nearly 30 percent. Based on preliminary data for 1994, the SEEBAC reports a 92 percent
enrollment rate for the relevant age group (7-14 year-olds) in grades one through eight and significant
reductions in rates of repetition (to 13 percent) and dropout (to 11 percent) since 1991. The overall
completion rate at the primary level rose to 60 percent.
7.    The improvements were achieved in tandem with increased public expenditure on basic
education, which rose from 0.9 to 1.9 percent of GDP. Notably, salary and other monetary incentives
for teachers and administrators rose on average threefold since 1990, and applicants for teacher-
training increased to pre-crisis levels. Other notable achievements under the Plan center on curriculum,
materials, student assessment and human resources development, and include development of
management capacity for basic education.
8.    A revised curriculum for basic education which focuses on participatory techniques in the
classroom, encourages inquiry among students, and promotes parental involvement was completed
during 1994 for introduction during 1995-97. Based on the anticipated content of the revised
curriculum, 45 percent of the teachers in grades one to eight received, or are receiving, six months of
training; and, technical support and supervision for teachers was reinstated. Textbooks and workbooks
were provided for all public school students, with a nominal charge for workbooks. In an innovative
approach to cost-recovery, these materials were also sold to private school students for a small profit,
and the earnings were used to finance complementary materials and workbooks for low-income
students in public-schools. A national assessment system was also introduced, incorporating public
and private schools, to begin systematic measurement of student achievement. In addition, nearly
5,000 classrooms (almost 25 percent of basic education classrooms in the public sector) were upgraded
or replaced, and a school nutrition program serving low income rural and peri-urban students reached
some 200,000 children under the Plan
9.    The Plan further initiated a process of deconcentration of responsibility to regional and district
offices of the SEEBAC, provided training for SEEBAC administrators and technical staff, and
supported development of key information systems (e.g., for personal management and educational and
facilities statistics). The most notable management advance, however, centers on the establishment of
parents associations for each public school providing basic education. Initial success in involving these



3
associations in the distribution and care of education materials, school maintenance and nutrition, and
on a pilot basis, monitoring of school performance (e.g., teacher and student attendance) has prompted
the SEEBAC to consider expanding participation of the parents associations.
10.   Despite the successful implementation of the first phase of the Ten-Year Education Plan,
educational equity and effectiveness remain comparatively low in the Dominican Republic. Further
improvements in quality will require widespread support for the introduction of the new curriculum,
which will in turn require revisions in teacher training, educational materials and the assessment
system. For these inputs, special needs for preschool education and for multigrade teaching' not
previously addressed, will need to be met. A permanent SEEBAC educational materials entity is
needed. Classroom hours are also low, at about 700 hours annually for basic education compared with
a regional average over 1,000 hours, and need to be increased. Some 4,000 additional teachers are
estimated to be required for basic education in line with targets for increased student enrollment and
retention for 2005.
11.   Quality and coverage gains will necessitate systematic facilities upgrading over the near-term
to replace, improve or alter for preschool use, about 30 percent of some 21,000 existing SEEBAC
classrooms. Construction of new classrooms will be required to support increased enrollments due to
improved participation and completion rates. Community input into maintenance, which has proved
cost-effective on a limited basis, needs to be expanded and regularized. The SEEBAC will also need
to expand school nutrition interventions and strengthen related monitoring, evaluation and targeting.
12.   Further management support will be needed to continue the process of gradual deconcentrafion
of responsibilities, as well as general strengthening of planning, budgeting and implementation capacity
in the sector. In particular, new information systems developed under the Plan need to be introduced
and adapted at all administrative levels. While early results are promising, involvement of parents
associations in decision-making and resource provision needs deepening to enhance accountability and
effectiveness at the school level. Additional support is required to ensure the continuing involvement
of the full spectrum of stakeholders in the basic education development process A new and broadly
representative National Consultative Council, incorporating the SEEBAC as well as private, church
and political groups, should contribute to this end. Finally, the monitoring and evaluation of basic
education, in particular the cost-effectiveness of inputs supported by the Plan, e.g., preschool
education, teacher training, programs, educational materials, community participation training, etc., will
need to be strengthened to ensure effective use of resources. Further innovations, including support for
private schools serving low-income groups, and related measurement of cost-effectiveness, should be
introduced.
13.   Government Strategy. During 1996-2000, the second phase of the Ten-Year Education Plan,
the Government plans to further strengthen basic education based on consolidation and deepening of
the improvements introduced during 1991-95, and incorporating the proposed project to be assisted by
the IDB and the IBRD. The KfW is also planning to extend a loan (of the order of US$10 million
equivalent) to support facilities improvement under the Plan. A new and central strategy target would
be achievement of further, sustained increases in public expenditure on education, which would rise
from 9 percent to about 16 percent of total public expenditure, and from 1.9 percent to 2.9 percent of
I Approximately a third of all schools, located primarily in rural and peri-urban areas, have multigrade classrooms where two
or more grades are taught in one classroom by one teacher.

GDP, by 2000 (to match real 1970 levels). Based on a model employing conservative assumptions on
GDP, population, and employment growth, fiscal policies and debt servicing capacity, this level of
financing is considered feasible and sustainable.2 The strategy also incorporates strengthened priority
and criteria for targeting low income beneficiaries, adds 70 hours of classroom time to the school
calendar, and supports strengthened stakeholder involvement in Plan monitoring.
14.   Project Objectives and Description. The proposed project, designed with assistance of a
PHRD grant as well as IDB technical assistance funds, would support the Government's development
and investment program for basic education under the Ten-Year Plan for the period 1996-2000.
Objectives would be to (a) improve the quality of basic education; (b) increase enrollment and,
especially completion rates, with priority directed to children from low income families; and (c)
strengthen technical and resource management capabilities of the SEEBAC and parents associations.
The first two objectives would be pursued through the Educational Development Component and the
third, through the Management Development Component. The majority of the project would be
implemented nationwide. However, particular subcomponents --School Nutrition, Complementary
Student Materials and Supplies, School Upgrading, Expansion and Maintenance, and Private School
Support-- would be targeted to poor rural and peri-urban areas using poverty indicators and the results
of a nutrition survey financed under the current Bank loan.
15.   Educational Development Component (US$ 82.8 million). This component would include
the following subcomponents:
(a)    Curriculum and Educational Materials and Resources (US$ 15.8 million) would:
(i) assist the SEEBAC in promoting and introducing the revised national curriculum
(US$3.4 million); and (ii) establish a permanent educational materials agency and
provide educational materials, including textbooks in each core subject and workbooks
for all students in grades 1 to 8 in public schools, special preschool materials, materials
designed for use in multigrade classrooms, and teacher and complementary materials.
These materials would be sold to the private sector to finance materials and workbooks
for low-income students in public schools (US$12.4 million).
(b)   Human Resources Development (US$ 8.6 million) would: (i) provide training and
on-the-job supervision and follow-up in subject matter and teaching techniques for
some 11,000 practicing teachers not reached during the first half of the Plan; (ii)
provide pre-service training for some 1,300 individuals planning to become teachers;
(iii) assist the SEEBAC to coordinate design and delivery of teacher training centered
on a new certificate as the minimum credential for service and other postsecondary
programs offered through local universities.
(c)    Student Assessment (US$ 3.1 million) would adapt and improve the quality of the
national student assessment system to be used to measure and help improve student
achievement.

(d)   School Nutrition (US$ 3.5 million) would: (i) strengthen SEEBAC's capacity to
design, deliver and coordinate cost-effective school nutrition programs, incorporating
ricronutrients and deparasitation; (ii) expand coverage of nutrition programs to
300,000 children in rural areas bordering Haiti and in peri-urban zones; (iii) promote
sound nutrition at the school level; and (iv) identify cost-effective, local food products
for school use.
(e)    School Facilities (US$ 48.1 million) would: (i) fund rehabilitation, replacement and
expansion of about 2,070 classrooms and repair of about 5,100 classrooms, including
creation of 25,000 new places and upgrading of 15,000 existing places for preschool
students; and (ii) provide financing for preventive maintenance for nearly 5,000
recently upgraded classrooms based upon a cost-sharing arrangement between parents
associations and the SEEBAC.
(f)    Private School Support (US$ 16.7 million) would assist, on a pilot basis, private
schools serving low-income students by providing materials, facilities rehabilitation and
staff training, primarily through participation in Plan activities.
16.   The Management Development Component (US$16.7 million) would include technical
assistance and equipment to: (a) strengthen procedures for deconcentrated planning, budgeting and
program implementation, including related training for SEEBAC administrators (US$3.6 million); (b)
improve and extend to decentralized levels SEEBAC communications and newly developed
information management systems (US$4.0 million); (c) build the capacities of parents associations to
contribute to school planning, performance and financial monitoring, and support small school
improvement projects under parents associations, and provide related training for the SEEBAC's
community participation agents (US$2.5 million); and (d) support monitoring and evaluation of basic
education and selected studies on the future development and financing of basic education. Included
would be baseline data on effectiveness of Plan inputs, including each project subcomponent, and
systematic monitoring of key indicators of Plan impact (para. 26), to enable follow-up and adjustment
as warranted (US$2.1 million). The project would also finance project coordination (US$4.5 million)
and an IDB supervision and inspection fee (US$0.5 rnillion).
17.   Project Implementation. To promote integration and coordination under the Plan, the two
existing (separate) coordinating units for the IDB and Bank-assisted projects would be integrated under
the Secretary, SEEBAC, to guide project management. Direct management responsibility would be
assigned to the relevant SEEBAC entity and administrative level (central, regional district) for
coordination of implementation of each project subcomponent (e.g., student assessment, teacher
training, etc.). Minor school repair, purchase of maintenance materials, and other cost-sharing
activities, however, would be managed by parents associations, in accordance with current procedures,
with independent supervision contracted by the SEEBAC for works. All SEEBAC entities would be
supported with technical assistance provided through the new project coordination unit.
18.   Costs and Financing. The project cost is estimated at US$100.0 million. The Bank loan
would provide US$37.0 million. The IDB would finance US$52.0 million. The Bank loan would
finance 37 percent of total project costs net of taxes, the IDB loan would finance 52 percent, and the
Government, 13 percent. A breakdown of estimated costs and financing are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements are shown in schedule B. A timetable of key

processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Dominican Republic are provided in
Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 14963-DO, dated October 17,
1995, is also attached.
19.   Lessons of Experience. The Bank supported two projects during the 1970s and 1980s which
incorporated basic education  components.   Both were implemented  with mixed results.
Implementation of the Bank-assisted components of the current Plan (teacher and supervisor training;
MIS development; student assessment and community participation activities; school maintenance and
nutrition) has proceeded smoothly. Loan disbursements, at over 80 percent at the end of three years of
implementation, have been ahead of schedule and closing is anticipated two years early, in mid-1996.
Mid-term reviews of experience under the ongoing Bank and IDB projects were completed in February
1995. The main lessons drawn from the reviews and earlier project implementation experience center
on the importance of broad support among project stakeholders, appropriate technical designs,
adequate and cost-effective use of financing resources, and efficient implementation arrangements.
20.   The success of the ongoing projects assisted by the Bank and the IDB stems from strong
government commitment and heavy investments in consensus-building by sector stakeholders. A
relatively stable macro-economic environment also has contributed. These elements were lacking
during implementation of the earlier projects, which foundered mainly on political differences and
unreliable counterpart financing. The proposed project would benefit from the momentum established
under the Plan and would maintain broad participation and consensus among practitioners, community
authorities and other stakeholders (para. 12).
21.   Early technical lessons emerged from implementation experience with the ongoing projects.
Central among these was the need to ensure appropriate curriculum, materials, teacher training and
facilities to account for the special needs of preschool education and multigrade classrooms. These
inputs are incorporated in the relevant components of the proposed project. Initial results also
confirmed the need for more strategic use of new information systems, including the student
assessment, to strengthen sector planning, monitoring and evaluation. The management component of
the proposed project addresses these needs.
22.   The importance of adequate and sustained financing for basic education was also confirmed in
early Plan outcomes. While expenditures rose consistently over the period, some 30 percent derived
from discretionary, off-budget sources. The proposed project would help to develop procedures for
incorporating these resources in overall planning and budgeting for education, as a step towards
institutionalizing the use of such resources. Experience further highlighted the potential for supporting
private schools serving low-income populations as a cost-effective means to reduce inequities in
provision of basic education. The proposed project incorporates pilot support for these private schools.
23.   The Bank and IDB-assisted projects represented a significant share of Plan activities and
investment expenditures during 1991-95. Competent project coordinating units, in turn supported by
local UNDP and IDB staff, respectively, contributed to successful implementation. While substantial
transfer of management experience and skills to the SEEBAC has been achieved, implementation has
depended heavily on the coordination units. Future sustainability will require a further build-up of

dated December 1994.



7
SEEBAC management capacity --at the central, regional and district levels.  Further, to ensure
coordination and avoid duplication of effort, a single coordination authority is needed. The proposed
operations will thus be coordinated by a single unit which would support and draw increasingly on
regular SEEBAC managers and staff for decision-making and implementation management.
24.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. Consistent with the Bank Group's Country Assistance
Strategy for the Dominican Republic, discussed by the Bank's Board on May 2, 1995, the
Government recognizes that continued improvement of social services in general, and basic education
and health services in particular, is essential for laying a sound foundation for social stability, sustained
economic growth, and the alleviation of poverty. Based upon the success to date of the Ten-Year
Education Plan, the Bank and the IDB are currently supporting development of a health reform strategy
based on broad participation and support. In view of the Bank's experience with the first phase of the
Plan and its experience elsewhere in the basic education subsector, the Government has requested
continued Bank, as well as IDB, involvement. The project would represent less than 15 percent of
projected government expenditure on basic education during 1996-2000; therefore, the particular
value-added of further Bank and IDB participation would lie in support for consolidation of policy and
Plan implementation efforts to date, with a focus on assuring adequate educational quality, and overall
subsector efficiency.
25.   Actions Agreed. During negotiations, the Government agreed to take all necessary measures
to achieve a set of key Plan and project expenditure and performance targets, incorporating targets for:
the share of GDP and per student expenditure for public, basic education, including adequate
remuneration for the teaching force, student enrollment, repetition, and completion rates in basic
education; the number of yearly class-hours in basic education; and improvements in student
achievement. At negotiations the Government also agreed to: (a) prepare for, and undertake annual
reviews of project advances and shortfalls, jointly with the Bank and IDB, including an in-depth mid-
term review of the project and Plan; and (c) establish the educational materials agency within 12
months of loan effectiveness.  As conditions for effectiveness, the Government should have
completed the following measures in a manner satisfactory to the Bank: (a) formally appointed a head
of the project coordinating unit (individuals acceptable to the Bank are currently performing these
functions) and other key staff, (b) finalized and introduced the project's operational manual,
incorporating implementation responsibilities and processes by subcomponent, financial flows and
control mechanisms, procurement arrangements and standard bidding documents, and targeting and
cost-sharing criteria, as relevant; (c) established and initially funded a project account and confirmed
availability of the budget required for the first year of project implementation; and (d) adopted a
satisfactory internal accounting system for the project.
26.   Environmental Aspects. The project would enhance environmental conservation through
introduction of environmental themes in the basic education curriculum and has a "C" environmental
rating.
27.   Poverty Category.  The proposed project falls under the program objective category of
poverty reduction and incorporates a program of targeted poverty interventions.  The preschool
expansion, school supplies, school nutrition and facilities rehabilitation and expansion components
would target poverty groups based on income and nutrition data.



8
28.    Participatory Approach.  The proposed project focuses heavily on use of participatory
techniques at all levels, e.g., from involving a broad spectrum of interest groups in Plan design to
supporting parents participation in management at the school level. Mid-term results under the current
project confirm that this participation accounts largely for the Plan's early success and that continued
broad support and local participation will be important components of the proposed project.
29.    Project Benefits, Economic Justification and Sustainability. Investment in basic education
generally has a high economic return and is recognized as a prerequisite for improving labor
productivity and eaming capacity.  In line with results obtained elsewhere, evidence that basic
education warrants investment is strong for the Dominican Republic. Using 1991 data, rates of return
for basic education were estimated, yielding a social rate of return of 18 percent for individuals
completing grade 4 as compared with those with no education, and a 14 percent return for those
completing grade 8. Private rates of return relative to individuals without any education were: 20
percent for those completing grade 4 and 15 percent for those completing grade 8. In view of
favorable prospects for medium-term growth and anticipated improvements in quality of basic
education, the average rates of return could be expected to continue or improve in the future. The
proposed project therefore aims to strengthen and extend basic education coverage. While all children
in the relevant age-group stand to benefit from the program, the greatest share of benefits will accrue to
the poor, who would also benefit from preschool, school feeding, school upgrading and complementary
school supplies and materials inputs. This group represents about 400,000 children, or some 35
percent of anticipated enrollment in public basic education during project implementation. Reaching
the project's management development objectives would further contribute to improvements in overall
resource management at the central and local levels, while enhanced stakeholder participation in Plan
monitoring and community participation at the school level could be expected to help sustain improved
educational quality and efficiency.
30.   Cost-effectiveness. Systematic analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the particular investment
inputs selected for the project versus altemative inputs, was not undertaken owing to a lack of data.
However, project inputs would build largely on those provided through the Plan during 1991-95.
These inputs have contributed substantially to the efficiency and quality gains achieved over that
period, as evident in a reported 35 percent reduction in student repetition and a 125 percent increase in
the student completion rate for grades I - 8. Based upon IBRD and other experience, the proposed
project inputs represent economical solutions to providing goods and services considered to be
effective for raising the quality and internal efficiency of basic education. Included are the large
educational materials, teacher training and facilities upgrading programs, as well as the student
assessment system. The student assessment, together with the community participation and continued
stakeholder involvement at the national level, would serve to enhance accountability and promote
effective use of resources. The project would establish the requisite baseline information to monitor
the cost-effectiveness of project inputs in the future. Specific tradeoffs, which were considered in
project design, centered on teachers: Optimum levels of training and a significantly extended school-
day were traded, based upon affordability, for lower-cost solutions for the medium-term.
31.   Risks. The main risks to further, effective execution of the Plan center on political and macro-
economic uncertainties, potential financing constraints, and continuing weaknesses in technical capacity
of the SEEBAC. A risk exists that opposition parties and the teachers union would reduce support for
the Plan prior to, or after elections, currently planned for April 1996. The risk of a decline in funding
for basic education, through diversion of discretionary funds, could also result from political change.



9
These risks are reduced by continued emphasis on incorporating all political and other stakeholders in
the educational development process and the likelihood that future govemments would continue to give
priority to basic education. While the risk of a macro-economic downturn cannot readily be mitigated,
the small share for project costs in total basic education expenditure should not present an undue
burden. A final risk exists that SEEBAC's technical capacity may not be sufficient over the near-term
to support efficient execution of the project. This risk will be minimized through the design of
technical support to facilitate the transfer of skills to the SEEBAC. Continued improvement of
incentives for administrators should also help attract increasingly qualified personnel to the SEEBAC.
