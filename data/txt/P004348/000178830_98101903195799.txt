PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report contains the appraisal of an Agricultural Develop-
ment project, made up of four sub-projects, for which an IDA credit of
US$ 5.0 million equivalent is proposed.
ii.       The economy of Papua and New Guinea is almost completely agri-
cultural with its indigenous population mainly involved in subsistence
agriculture, and expatriates dominating commercial production. Although
the project allows for a small investment in coconut produetion, the
Territory's chief export crop, it is aimed mainly at diversification in-
to oil palms and livestock, enterprises well suited to the country and
which the Government is now actively encouraging. There is an abundance
of undeveloped and underdeveloped fertile agricultural land which can
and should be economically exploited.
Aii.      In 1967 a development bank, the Papua and New Guinea Develop-
ment Bank (PNGDB), was established to provide lending facilities for all
farmers in the country. A small number of farmers have already availed
themselves of these facilities but lack of finance restricts the acti-
vities of this organization. Since both PNGDB and the government depart-
ments have adequate numbers of technical and administrative staff to
organize and supervise agricultural investments, assisting PNGDB to make
timely investments will further strengthen the roots of agricultural de-
velopment in the Territory.
iv.       The project, comprising four sub-projects, involves the follow-
ing:  the planting and replanting of 10,000 acres on existing coconut
estates; the development and stocking of 150,000 acres of private beef
cattle ranches and the improvement of government services to the beef
cattle industry; the construction of a wharf at Kimbe in New Britain to
serve an area being developed for oil palm production; and the second
stage of a project recently financed by the Association (PEG-137) which
would provide for 980 smallholders to grow 7,840 acres of oil palmd.
V.        The total cost of the project is US$ 8.8 million, and the im-
port component of US$ 5.0 million would be covered by the proposed IDA
credit of US$ 5.0 million. The borrower would be the Administration of
the Territory of Papua and New Guinea.  Lending to farmers through the
PNGDB would be at interest rates of not less than 6% to oil palm small-
holders and 6-3/4% to coconut producers and beef cattle ranchers; after
July 1st, 1970 interest rates to cattle ranchers would be not less than
7%.
vi.       The first IDA Credit (US$ 1.5 million equivalent) to Papua
and New Guinea was made in January 1969 (PNG-137) for the development
of smallholder oil palms, a new enterprise for the Territory. The



- ii -
smallholder project represents the combined efforts of the Government,
PNGDB and a joint estate/factory company, the New Britain Oil Palm De-
velopment Ltd. (NBPOD), formed between Government and Harrisons and
Crosfield (H & C). The latter company is -one of the world's leading
organizations in the oil palm industry and they are the body responsi-
ble for managing NBPOD. To date, the development of the initial oil
palm project has been very satisfactory and the proposed Phase II sub-
project would .function under the same oper-ational and managerial 8syB-
tems.
vii.      The livestock and coconut subprojects would be the joint
responsibility of Government, in -particular the Department of Agri-
culture, Stock and Fisheries (DASF) and PNGDB.  Present operations in
both these sectors are being well handled. 'The Australian.Depart-
ment of Public Works, which has adequate and competent staff, would
have fall responsibility for supervising the construction of the
proposed wharf.
viii.     Both Government and PNGDB would be required to keep separate
accounts for the project so that items eligible for IDA reimbursement
vould be readily ascertainable. Government accounts are audited by
the Commonwealth Auditor-General's Office-and a special sector -of the
office, devoted to accounts and records of banking institutions,,:au-
dits PNGDB accounts.
ix.       The economic-rates of return from investment in the sAb-
project are: the coconut subproject - 9%; the livestock subproject
- 11%; the oil palm subproject - .15%; and-the Kimbe wharf - a$mini-
mum of 15%.
x.        The Project is suitable for an.IDA credit of US$ 5.0D-million.
The balance of project costs vould be provided by the Territ.ory-of Papua
and New Guinea, and local participating farmers.



PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Administration of the Territory Of Papua and New Guinea
(Government), through the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia,
has requested the Association's help in financing the following:
(a) planting and replanting about 10,000 acres of existing
coconut estates;
(b)  developing and stocking some 150,000 acres of private
beef ranches and the improving of Government services
to the beef cattle industry;
(c) implementing the second stage of a smaTllholder oil
palm development project which would provide for 980
smallholders to grow 7,840 acres of oil palms.  A
first stage of the project (4,600 acres) is being fi-
nanced by the Association under credit PNG-137; and
(d) constructing a vharf at Kimbe, Nev Britain, mainly to
support nearby oil palm development.
1.02      Sub-projects (a), (b), and (d) together with the first stage
of the  allholder oil palm project were examined originally in January/
February 1968 by an Association mission U/. A credit of US$ 6 million
for these four sub-projects was negotiated in early September 1968 but
with the reservation that it would not be considered by IDA until suf-
ficient funds became available.
1.03      In January 1969, the Association approved a credit for US$ 1.5
million to cover the highest priority item, the New Britain Smallholder
Development Project, vhich consisted of the development of 4,600 acres of
smallholder oil palms.
1.04      In May/June 1969 a mission comprised of Messrs. Storrar and
Grosjean visited Papua and New Guinea to re-appraise the coconut, live-
stock, and Kimbe wharf elements of the initial request and to appraise
a second stage of the New Britain Smallholder Development Project.
This report is based on the mission's findings.
U/   Mission members were Messrs. C. P. McMeekan (Consultant), S.D. Eccles,
P. G. Nelson, M. Palein (IDA) and T.A. Philips (Consultant).

II. BACKGROUND
2.01      The Territory of Papua and New Guinea (Territory) comprises the
eastern half of the island of New Guinea (mainland); nine major islands
including New Britain in the Bismarok Archipelago; and a large number of
smaller islands (see Map 1). Total land area is about 184,000 square
miles, of which about 85% is mainland. Much of the Territory is mountain-
ous, with ridges on the mainland rising to 15,000 ft and on the islands to
8,500 ft. Total population is about 2.2 million including about 30,000 ex-
patriates.
2.02      Papua, formerly a British Protectorate, and New Guinea, formerly
German and now a UN Trust Territory, are administered jointly by Australia.
The capital is Port Moresby. Australia which is actively preparing the
Territory for Independence continues to spend large sums on its administra-
tion and development. In 1967/68, vhen total Government expenditure was
$A 131.1 million, Australian grants-in-aid totalled $A 77.6 million.
2.03      The Territory's economy is predominantly agricultural.  Agricul-
ture earns nearly all export income, engages more than half the people in
paid employment and most of the self-employed. The economy includes an
exceptionally large non-monetized sector in which a majority of the popu-
lation engages almost exclusively in various agricultural activities for
obtaining the basic necessities of life. The real Gross National Product
(GNP) of the monetized sector was unofficially estimated at .6% .of the
total GNP and to be rising rapidly at an annual rate of over 10%. For
the economy as a whole, the total real GNP, including that of the non-
monetized sector, has been rising at 6% per annum in the last five years.
Total GNP amounted to about $A 400 million (approximately US$ 450 million)
in 1966/67 and per capita average for the indigenous population, about
US$ 100.  In the monetized sector, agriculture (including livestock for-
estry and fisheries) accounts for one-third of the GNP, most of the rest
comes from Government services. Exports have risen steadily in volume
and their annual value bas increased from about $A 28 million in 1960/61
to $A 59 million in 1967/68. Copra and coconut product exports are worth
about 36% of the total, coffee, 24% and cocoa. 20%.
2.0o4     A 1967 Bank Economic Mission recommended further encouragement
of coconut, cocoa, rubber and cattle production through a strengthening
of extension services and the provision of credit.  It endorsed Govern-
ment efforts to develop oil palms, pyrethrum and tea, crops which had not
previously been grown in the Territory on a comercial scale. Government
was, and still is, anxious to diversify and increase the production of
crops for export and for import substitution, so that, on Independence,
the Territory will be in a better position to pay for the imports neces-
sary for continued economic development.
2.05      Increased coffee production is limited by the International Cof-
fee Agreement; cocoa has suffered a disease setback; and fluctuating prices



-3-
have tended to discourage further rubber development. Government bas, how-
ever, succeeded in interesting private enterprise in oil palms, ten, pyre-
thr-um_and livestock.                 '                      __
C/ - -
2.06      Coconut is the most important crop but many palms are old and
overdue for replanting.  Some estates have small parcels of unplanted land,
and  a few of the larger ones are planting and replanting.  However, coco-
nuts take seven to eight years to come into production and costs are rising
so that in the absence of a specific program of assistance the smaller es-
tates have little incentive to develop.
2.07      By the end of World War II the Territory's cattle herds had
been decimated.  Since then meat has had to be imported and demand has    I
grown steadily, reaching some 40,000 carcass equivalents costing near-
ly $A 5 million in 1968.  The large natural resource of 8 to 909mi2 on
acres of grassland has been little used so far, although capable of ef-
ficient exploitation by livestock.
2.08      Prewar experience with Government farms, private estates, and
mission stations established the feasibility of cattle raising in the
Territory. Government has used two approaches to re-establish the indus-
try postwar; first, it has developed four ranches under its own control,
in the lowland plains of the Markham Valley, in the Highlands and in the
Sepik area; and second, it has leased land to Australian cattlemen for
the development of 12 ranches in both highland and lowland zones. At the
beginning of these developments, there were virtually no breeding cattle
available in the Territory and breeding cattle had to be imported at land-
ed costs 60% to 80% higher than in Australia. In view of the technical
and political risks involved, Government subsidized 2/ the cost of freight
and disease control on all approved imported breeding stock. This subsidy
will be discontinued in about 1973 if the status of the industry then war-
rants this. Government has provided still further encouragement to the
new industry by building abattoirs at the two main producing centers, in
order to foster efficient marketing. Despite these features, development
of the industry has been slow and the total cattle population_is_still only
about 50,000 head though rising steadeily-o accelerate development, Gov-
-6iFi-e   h n   deided to make long-term credit available to the private
sector through PNGDB, as recommended by the 1963 Bank Economic Survey
Mission.
2.09      Government followed up the 1963 mission's suggestion that a fi-
nancial institution suited to the specific conditions of the Territory be
organized to provide long-term development credit, and the Papua and New
Guinea Development Bank opened for business in July 1967. Its credit
services would be made use of in the project which this report describes.

2.10      In January 1969, under Credit 13T-PNG, IDA made U5$ 1,500,000
available for a first stage of smallholder oil palm development on the
island of New Britain.  Under the project 580 smallholders are establish-
ing 4,600 acres of oil palms together with food and other cash crops.
Provision is also made for related infrastructure. Progress to date in
carrying out this project has been excellent. This is the only agricul-
tural project financed by the Bank Group in the Territory.

III. TEE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The project consists of four subprojects:  coconut estate new
planting and replanting; beef cattle production; the planting of 7,840
acres of oil palm by 980 smallholders; and the construction of Kimbe
wharf. Important features of each subproject are summarized in the fol-
lowing paragraphs. Fuller details of the subprojects are given in An-
nexes 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. PNGDB would provide credits to parti-
cipants in the coconut estate, beef cattle production, and oil palm projects.
PNGDB Lending Program
3.02      The total on-farm development program is estimated to cost $A 4.8
million (us$ 5.4 million) and the PNGDB would lend approximately 80% of this
total or $A 3.8 million (U.S.$4.25 million). The lending program would be
as follows:

B. Detailed Features
The Coconut Subproject
3.03      The coconut subproject comprises a five-year tranch of a ten-
year program of lending by PNGDB to existing estates for the planting and
replanting of about 10,000 acres of coconuts.



-6-
3.04      New planting involves clearing, nursery and cover crop estab-
lishment,, planting, fertilizer and pesticide application, and construc-
tion of access roads. Replanting would involve similar activity except
that instead of clearing unplanted land, unproductive coconuts would be
cut out, and there would be no need for additional access roads.
3.05      Participants.  The coconut planters vho would participate
in this program are mainly expatriate and Australian with wide expe-
rience in managing coconut estates of about 1,000 acres. -With Sub-
stantial long-term finance available from 'PNGDB it is estimated that
at least 10,000 acres would be developed under the subproj ect.  A
survey conducted in late 1967 indicated that about 25 grover.s-would
be definitely interested in borroving for the purposes of :replanting
2,000 acres and new planting 8,000 acres. Enquiries made .in May
1969 by the reappraisal mission.indicated that grower interestt re-
mains strong and applications for credits had already been-:mad- to
PB;GD.B.in May 1969 to the amount of US,146,000.
The Beef Cattle Subpro,1ect
-3.06     The subproject is an integral part of Government -plan= for
the development of the beef cattle industry and comprises:
(a)  in the private sector: -provision of credit to .quali-
fied ranchers to purchase.additional imported breeding
_tock and pay for associated on-farm development on
about 100,000 acres of partly developed existing-ranch-
es, and about 50,000 acres of additional grazing land
for new.ranches.
(b)  in the -ublic sector:  completion of development.of
two Government cattle breeding ranches, and the-,pro-
vision of training in cattle management for -indi-ge-
nous farmers.
3.07T     The objectives of the subproject are fivefold:
(a) to initiate the development of large unused'.land re-
lb)  to help replace high-cost Imports;
c)  to provide a source of.locally adapted cattle at eco-
nomic prices to permit widespread participation by in-
digenous farmers in a nev system of land use;
(d) -to train indigenous -farmers in livestock husbandry; and
(e) to ensure a continuing and adequate supply of:animal
protein to the population.



-7-
3.08      Participants.  Existing ranches and new ranches included in the
project would be developed by cattlemen already in the Territory, or by
qualified cattlemen who have experience elsewhere in a tropical environ-
ment. Government has already arranged for the purchase of land needed for
the new ranches and leasing arrangements for 30,000 acres out of the pro-
posed 50,000 acres to be developed as new ranches are now being made, and
the remaining 20,000 acres will be purchased as soon as practicable. It
is estimated that the owners of existing ranches will be interested in
further development of some 100,000 acres.
3.09      Field Development.  For estimate purposes, two 10,000 acre ranch
models have been used; one for existing ranches (Annex 2, Tables 3 and 4)
and one for new ranches (Annex 2, Tables 5 and 6). It is forecast that in
the case of existing ranches, 50,000, 30,000 and 20,000 acres would be dev-
eloped successively in the first three years; and in the case of new ranches,
20,000 and 30,000 acres in the second and third years of the subproject.
This would require the import of about 5,500 head of breeding stock over a
three-year period, associated on-farm development and a limited amount
of pasture improvement.
3.10      Beef production by indigenous farmers is in its early stages
and cannot progress satisfactorily until more locally adapted stock are
available, and interested farmers are trained in cattle management. By
providing additional classrooms and equipment on Government ranches,
training in cattle management for these indigenous farmers would be ex-
panded; these ranches would also supply livestock to the newly trained
ffamers.
3.11      Government Services.  The subproject involves further develop-
ment of two Government cattle ranches at Baiyer River and Urimo (see Map 1),
including the importation of TOO breeding cattle and associated on-farm
improvements. Both ranches would produce yearling cattle for sale to in-
digenous farmers and Baiyer River would provide cattle management training.
The Freight and Disease Control subsidy would continue to be paid tempora-
rily on all imports of suitable breeding stock (see para. 2.08). During
negotiations, Government agreed that it would consult with the Association
before December 31st, 1972, with a view to terminating the Freight and
Disease control subsidy by December 31st, 1973 or as soon thereafter as
the development of the cattle industry in the Territory shall permit.
The Smallholder Oil Palm Subproject
3.12      Oil palm cultivation in the Territory started at Hoskins in
New Britain in 1967 with the implementation of Phase I of an oil palm
development prograi7- Phase I consists of:
(a) a nucleus estate of 3,000 acres of oil palms,



(b) a palm oil mill with a capacity for processing 15 tons
of ffb/hour 1/;
,(c) a settlement scheme under which about 580 families are
being provided with holdings of 15 acres, on which,
within a three-year settlement period, eight acres of
oil palms are being established. The settlement scheme
will result in about 4,640 acres of oil palms being es-
tablished; and
(d)  necessary physical and social infrastructure for the
project area.
3.13      In January 1969, the Association made a credit of US$.1..5 mil-
.lion equivalent (PNG-137) to finance part of the cost of items (c) and
(d) of Phase I of the development program.  The development of this phase
vas well advanced by the time the IDA Credit was approved andl the main
plantings will be completed in 1970t/71. The Government has already sur-
veyed the area for Phase II and development of this sector commenced in
July 1969.
3.14      Progress of Phase I has been excellent and the Government now
proposes to embark on Phase II which would involve:
(a) the planting of a further 5,000 acres of oil palms on the
nucleus estate;
(b)  the extension of the oil mill processing capacity from
15 tons ffb/hour to 45 tons/ffb/hour;
(c)  the settlement of an additional 980 smallholders-on 15
acre holdings over a three-year period;
(d) the planting of 8 acres of oil palms on each holding over
the first three years of settlement, resulting in a total
of 7,840 acres of oil palms by 1974/75; and
(e) the expansion of the present supervisory and credit facil-
ities provid !                .       tihe nec': ^7 t:h- -,b -
project.
3.15      The nucleus estate and the oil mill are owned by Ne Britain
Oil Palm Development Ltd. (NBPOD). NBPOD is owned in equal shares by
the Government and an experienced plantation company, Harrisons and
Crosfield (Australia and New Zealand) Ltd.. The nucleus estate is being
1/   Fresh Fruit Bunches.  The saleable product of the oil palm:  one
cluster of individual fruits. Each fruit consists of a unit con-
taiing the palm kernel surrounded by a flesh containing palm oil. 



-9-
developed by NBPOD's vholly-owned subsidiary, Mosa Plantations Pty Ltd.,
and the oil mill by another wholly-owned subsidiary Mosa Oil Mill Pty
Ltd.   Planting of the nucleus estate started in 1968 and construction of
the mill began in September 1969. NBPOD is under contract to Government
to supply planting material to the smallholders, and to collect and process
the harvest of their oil palms.
3.16      The sub-project, which is the subject of this report, consists
of items (c), (d), and (e) in para. 3.14 above.  Full details of the sub-
project appear in Annex 3.
3.17      Land Tenure. A Land Ordinance governs land tenure in Papua and
Nev Guinea and it specifically allows Government to acquire land by negotia-
tion or compulsory purchase. The land required for the sub-project has
already been purchased by Government from the local tribe, and it can now
be leased to individuals on a 99-year basis according to criteria explained
in para 3.23. Leases have already been issued to over 300 smallholders
in the Phase I development. Lessees are normally given six months'
grace in which to confirm or reject the offer of a lease; if rejected,
the lease is reallocated. Such a practice has led to delays in the plan-
ned planting program and Government is now reducing the grace period to
three months.
3.18      Land Clearing.  On each holding, eight acres of forest would be
cleared for the planting of oil palms within a three-year period. Merchan-
table timber would first be removed, and the Government, through the project
authority, would then fell six acres of forest on each holding. The set-
tler would stack and burn the felled material to complete the clearing
operation himself, and subsequently fell, stack and burn both the area
required for his food crops, and a further two acres for oil palms.
Forest clearing is traditional work in the Territory and no problems
are anticipated in meeting the projected targets.
3.19      The overall clearing program of the project would be as fol-
lows:

3.20      Planting Program. High yield potential oil palm see.& will be
obtained from Malaysia. by NBPOD which would be. under contract: to Government
to supply suitable planting material to smallholders, as is th.e case with
Phase I.
3.21      Each mallLholder would plant three acres of oil palm- ix his
first year of occupation, three more in the second and two in.thee third
year, giving a total of eight acres.  Should substantial areas of the
smallholder's plot not be properly planted by the smallhol&er, project
staff would arrange to complete planting.

3.23      Settler Selection.  Settlers are recruited by public invitation
and are selected by the Land Board, assisted where necessary by the District
Commissioner and Department of Agriculture, State and Fisheries (DASF) staff.
The Land Board considers the applicant's background in farming and planta-
tion work, physical fitness and the ability of his family to help him. The
applicant, to be successful, must be cleared with PNGDB to ensure that he has
a clean credit record.
Kimbe Wharf SubproJect
3.24      Port facilities are required at Kimbe (see Map 2) to serve that
section of New Britain including the area being developed under the oil
palm program. A link road and bridge is being constructed between the
port and the palm oil mill mainly to serve the project area.
3.25      Section 4.01 of the Development Credit Agreement PNG-137 re-
quires that the Administration of Papua and New Guinea construct an over-
seas wharf capable of handling the export of the NBPOD palm oil mill at
Hoskins and to have the wharf operative not later than June 30, 1971.
During negotiations of the Credit, the Association stated that it would
consider the financing of this vharf provided that the plans of the wharf
were satisfactory to the Association.
3.26      Plans for the wharf have been submitted to, and approved by, the
Association. Related estimates show that the total cost of the wharf would
be US$ 1,000,000, inclusive of a contingency of US$ 120,000. Details are
shown in Annex 4, page 2.
3.27      Supervision of construction of the wharf would be the responsi-
bility of the Australian Department of Works, which is well qualified to
handle this role, and tenders for its construction would be let under in-
ternational competitive bidding.
C. Cost Estimates
3.28      Total project costs, including contingencies, are estimated at
A$ 7.8 million (us$ 8.8 million) of which US$ 5.0 million (57%) would repre-
sent the cost of imports into the Territory but not specifically foreign ex-
change because of the monetary union of Papua and New Guinea with
Australia. Cost estimates by subprojects are as follows:

D. Project Financing
3.29      An IDA credit of US$ 5.0 million would be made to the Adminis-
tration of the Territory of Papua/New Guinea, guaranteed by the Common-
wealth of Australia. The proposed financing plan would be as follows:
Oil             Beef
Palm  Coconut  Cattle  Wharf  Total    Total    Percentage
Ö---------- )0                        (US$ 000)
Producers              190     750      -      940    1,100          13
Government  1,600      470     120    220   2,410    2,700           30
IDA Credit  1,920      300   1,580    670   44T70    5.000           57
Total    3,520      960   2,450    890   7,820    8,800
3.30      The proposed IDA credit is equal to the import content cost
of the overall project. The contribution by farmers to overall costs
is variable; smallholders have no funds of their own and their contribu-
tion to the total cost is negligible; on the other hand, ranchers will pro-
vide 30% of the total cost of the beef cattle subproject whilst cocohut
farmers will meet 19%. Under the circumstances prevailing in the Territory
these contributions are considered reasonable.
I?A/'v3 31       There is considerable variation in the terms of the proposed
~~è;PB4ending to the three main farming enterprises. Coconuts are a very
long term investment (50 years) and the terms indicated below are in
line with the projected cash flows (see Annex 1, Table 2). Beef cattle
development has a shorter gestation period and is more remunerative ,
(see Annex 2, Tables 4 and 6) than coconut development; therefore high-
er interest rates together with shorter repayment periods would be ap-
propriate for ranchers. However, it is important to note that beef 'de-
velopment in Papua depends heavily on the investment of private capital
from Australia and that too strigent financial terms would militate
against the proposed beef development program. The terms of lending
for the smallholder oil palm sub-project remain substantially the same
as for Phase I development.
Terms of Proposed Lending
Interest Rate       Grace      Years Repayment        Total
Coconut                6-3/4%           11               9                20
Beef Cattle            7% I/             5               7                12
Oil Palm               6%                5               7                12
g/   6-3/4% up to July 1, 1970.,



3.32      With initial loans for coconuts and beef cattle being made over
two years from the start of the proJect, complete repayment by farmers to
PNGDB in these subprojects would not be made until years 211an-d-13 respec-
tively; settlement of smallholders on the oil palm subproject would take
place over three years, hence loan zietyments to PNGDB would not be complete
until Year 14.

IV.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01      The carrying out of the three agricultural subprojects would be
the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries
(DASF) in conjunction with the Papua New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB).
Both organizations are well staffed, mainly with expatriates of Australian
origin. The construction of the Kimbe wharf would be implemented by the
Australian Department of Public Works.
4.02      In the case of coconuts and livestock the major responsibility
would lie with the PNGDB which would accept applications, appraise and dis-
burse loans; DASF would help with the preparation of farm plans and technical
supervision.
4.03      Responsibility for development of the smallholder oil palm sub-
project lies with a Project Coordinator (Headquarters) in Port Moresby,
reporting to the Assistant Administrator of Economic Affairs. The Project
Coordinator has administrative control of all Government expenditure con-
nected with the subproject. A Project Coordinator (Field) seconded from
DASF controls all staff working at field level in the subproject area and
they can communicate only through him to the Project Coordinator at Head-
quarters. Work connected with roads and social infrastructure (e.g. Health,
Education, Roads) is done by the appropriate Government departments in
accordance with plans approved by the Project Coordinator (HQ). Phase I
development has been administered in the manner indicated above. This has
proved successful and would be continued in this subproject. (see Annex 3
Chart 1)
Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries (DASF)
4.04      The DASF is a conventional type of government department made
up of professionally qualified staff of Degree and Diploma level. Head
Office, in Port Moresby, has a number of specialist officers responsible
to the Director whilst general extension officers operate at Regional
and District level. For development projects, such as palm oil, suitably
experienced staff are detached from DASF for special duties in the field.
Papua New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB)
4.05      Details of PNGDB and of its financial position are in Annex 5,
Tables 1 and 2. It was formed as a body corporate by special Ordinance in
1966 and began operations in July 1967.  One of its main purposes is to
provide longer-term finance for primary production "not otherwise available
on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions" with "due regard to the
stability and balanced development of the Territory and the advancement of
the indigenous population". PNGDB lending policy is based on supervised
credit rather than on the holding of collateral.



- 16 -
24.o6     PNGDB is controlled by a Board of 12, appointed by tbe:.Governor-
General of Australia, and is staffed by competent and experienced&:bank-
I ing personnel. For its initial operations, it has temporarily-seconded
technical agricultural staff from DASFI. More permanent technicalappoint-
ments will be made as soon as the volume.-:.of business justifies-.
4.07      PNGDB is being financed by equity capital in the.forum-of interest-
free non-repayable appropriations.from .the'Territory budget.: This .will
continue-to be PNGDB's principal. source of.funds until it_is. -more ffrmly
established- and profit-earning; this.-may take.another three- to 'four-yearss.
Quite recently PNGDB took over the assets- of 'the Ex-Servi-ce.ments Find;..and
the Native Loans Fund, and in doing so' it will have no liability-for:-losses
incurred-due to non-repayment.  Audited-accounts were available-.at the time
of appraisal for 1967 and 1968 and details ;of 1968 operations-are4in Annex
5, Tables 1-and 2.                             -
4.o8      The accounting procedures aad_controls set up by-PNGDBare satis-
factory and are subject to the close:scrutiny required by Australian-bank-
ing law. Actual and five-year forecast balance sheets and profft :and. _
loss accounts are ir- Annex 5, Tables. l and-.2.  They show that-after mak-
ing provision' for bad debts at 5%' of loans--outstanding (excludihg--loans.
administered for and- guaranteed by Governrent), PNGDB expects -to;make .a,
small profit in 1971- and-to achieve aw-overall cumulative profit: by-1973.
The provision for bad-debts and the profit.forecasts appear:'reasonable.
4.09      In this initial stage of its- operations PNGDB needs..to;build up
reserves.  Consequently, any increase in-PNODB borrowing-cost-s-would have
to be financed by Government.  For this-reason', Government wouldLonlend-
IDA funds to PNGDB at 1-1/4%, the co,t-tto-G6vernment plus akms;ll..margin.
On repayment by' PNGDB borrowers, Government intends to allow PIGDB to revolve
the IDA funds for fur-ther agricultural,.lending.  Government would.-seek-
repayment of the IDA credit from PNGDB-in 25" years.
4.10      PNGDB's lending rates up to ,October 1969 were 6% for7'loans over.
A$3000 and 4-3/4% for loans under A$3000; since October 1969, wherr the
Trading Bank rates it-Australia were raised; PNGDB increased-:its.lending
rates in sympathy to 6-3/4% for loans over':A$3000 and to 5-1/4%.for loans.
under this amount.
4.11      PNGDB has loan' procedures suitable for lending under:the.-project
and has- adequate legal powers.' It would not be practicable totchannel.-
IDA funds through the commercial banks, as-originally proposedfby-Govern-
ment, because the comierIcial banks are-unwilling to depart from^th-eir
policy of lending only on short term. Hovever, a very satisfActory-re-
lationship exists between the commercial-banks and PNGDB and.they- could be
relied upon to receive- applications for PR&DB loans and make an-assessment
of the creditworthiness and managemett ability of applicants.
4.12      A condition of' effectiveness: for the proposed IDA credit- would
be the conclusion of a new subsidiary Loan-Agreement between..the G6vern--
ment and PNGDB satisfactory to IDA. This-'agreement would be similar to the



- 17 -
one concluded for the credit PNG-137 and would specifically provide:
(a) the interest rate charged to project borrovers would not be less
than 6% in the case of oil palm and coconuts 1/ and not less
than 7% in the case of the beef cattle subproJect except for the
period up to June 30th, 1970 when beef cattle loans will be at
6-3/4%.
(b) net funds arising from repayment of project loans would be relent
for agricultural development.
Appraisal Procedures
4.13      Coconut and Livestock Subprojects.  PNGDB would be primarily re-
sponsible for the credit aspects of these two subprojects and DASF for
the technical aspects. PNGDB staff would first check the land title of
each applicant and, in cooperation with the applicant's commercial bank,
his financial standing. DASF would study the technical problems associat-
ed with the proposed loan, and in many cases would help the farmer pre-
pare his farm plan and application for credit. PNGDB staff would then
check the farm plan, the forecasts of income and expenditure as well as
the cash flow, and recommend loans where feasible. In its Head Office
DASF would make available two officers, one with special responsibilities
for livestock loans and one for coconut loans; not only would these of-
ficers help with appraisal but they would technically supervise partici-
pants for four or five years after a loan is made.
4.14      Smallholder Oil Palm Subproject.  The loans for smallholders are
geared to a farm plan devised by DASF and the standard plan provides for
the planting of 8 acres of oil palm and 2 acres of food crops on each
holding. Appraisal is only possible therefore in the selection of set-
tlers and this selection is carefully done by the Land Board of Papua/
New Guinea with the help of District Commissioners and the PNGDB which checks
the credit listing of the applicant wherever possible. The farm plans de-
vised for Phase I development are considered sound.
Security of Loans and Repayment
4.15      Coconut and Livestock Subprojects.  The PNGDB would secure loans
against the land titles of the individual farmers or companies and, in
addition, loans would be repaid in fixed annual installments by standing
orders on the borrower's commercial bank.
4.16      Smallholder Oil Palm Subproject. This is a supervised credit
scheme and the smallholder can offer no collateral other than the labor
he provides to his holding during the first five years of the scheme.
However, repayment of the loan would be made by deductions made from the
value of deliveries of ffb to the factory for years 5 through 12. As
there is no other outlet for ffb than the one factory at Hoskins, debt
collection should be a simple process. Also, legal provision is made on
the standard loan agreement in case of default on payment.
1/   Participants borrowing more than A$ 3,000 would pay 6-3/4%.



- 18 -
Procurement
W 1 4.17      Contracts for construction of the Kimbe wharf would be put out
to international tender.  International competitive bidding would not be
appropriate for procurement of other project items because they are either
'-.--   too small and can be obtained competitively through regular comercial
channels or do not lend themselves to this procedure (e.g. staff costs).
Estates and ranchers would purchase imported farm items (except cattle)
from Territory suppliers representing international manufacturers. Breed-
ing cattle would be purchased., by Government or ranchers, from Queensland
which is the nearest, and virtually only, source of suitable disease-free
stock. Other Government purchases would be subject to Government's re-
gular tender procedures, which would be acceptable to the Association.
Disbursement
4.18      The proposed IDA disbursement is closely related to -the
import component of each subproject. Disbursement would be arranged, as
from July 1, 1969, to make a contribution to each of the Main categories
of expenditure, i.e. on-farm inveatment; Government services;.and infra-
structure. Disbursements would be made against certified statements of
agreed expenditure on eligible items supported where appropriste by docu-
ments (e.g. invoices for equipment; ihipping documents for cattle), pre-
pared by DASF and PNGDB and authenticated by the Territory Treasury for IDA
reimbursement.
4.19      Disbursement would be-made against the following expenditures;
36% of PNGDB loans to coconut planters, 100% of PNGDB loans tto ranchers and
84% of the cost of government support services for the beef cattle sub-
proJect, 64% of the total cost of the oil palm subproject and 68% of the
cost of Kimbe Wharf. US$ 415,000 out of the total credit of US$ 5,000,000
would be unallocated.
Accounts and Audit
4.20      PNGDB and DASF would be required to keep separate accounts for
project lending so that items eligible for IDA disbursement could be
readily ascertained.  The Department of the Tr azury -ould ke?ea  ser-.-e
accouazt...,_  the KZi.- e     .   -    -  purpose.
4.21      PNGDB accounts are audited at least once a year by a special sec-
tion of the Australian Commonwealth Auditor-General's Department devoted
to the accounts and records of banking institutions. Government .accounts
are also audited by the Commonwealth Auditor-General, who has an office
in the Territory. No change will be-made in audit arrangements without
prior consultation with IDA.

V. YIELDS MARKETS AND PRODUCER BENITS
Production
5.01      Some 10,000 acres of coconut estate land, 150,000 acres of ranch
land and 7,800 acres of oil palms would come into new or increased produc-
tion as a result of the project. This would take place on some 15 ranches,
25 coconut estates and 980 oil palm smallholdings. Additional annual pro-
duction from the project, at full development, is estimated at 6,000 tons
of copra, 10,200 head of cattle, and 14,000 tons of palm oil plus 3,100 tons
of palm kernels.
Coconut Subproject
5.02      It is estimated that coconuts established under the project
would yield an average of 12 cvt copra/acre at maturity (Annex 1, para
16) or a total volume of 6,000 tons of copra, all of which would be ex-
ported. This amount represents 0.2% of world production of copra. '
5.03      The Bank's Economics Department forecasts that prices for co-
pra will weaken from their current level of about US$ 200 per ton cif
European ports to about US$ 160 by 1975. The latter price is equivalent
to a farm-gate price of about A$ 96 per ton (see Annex 1, Table 1).1 Co-
pra is sold through the Copra Marketing Board, a statutory body which
serves all producers.
Beef Cattle Subproject
5.04      It is estimated that the local price of beef to the farmer would
fall gradually with increasing production, from a present average carcass
equivalent value of $A 137 to $A 110 by 1980, which is closer to the fore-
cast value of beef on the international market.
5.05      The herd development of a model 10,000 acres existing ranch
is shown in Annex 2, Table 3. A typical ranch of this size would double
its herd size of about 1,400 by the fourth year, and increase the total
herd to nearly 3,700 by the ninth year. In line with this, annual sales
would increase from 330 head without the development enabled by the sub-
project, to nearly 900 with development, and annual farm revenue from
approximately $A 32,000 to a little over $A 70,000. The herd development
of a model 10,000 acre new ranch is shown at Annex 2, Table 5. Its herd
would reach about 1,000 head by the fourth year, and annual sales would
be about 330 head, worth approximately $A 32,000, from a stabilized herd
of about 1,400 head in the ninth year.
5.06      The volume of sales from the subproject, at maturity, would be
10,200 head, all of which would be absorbed domestically. Small abat-
toirs, near the main consuming centers will adequately handle slaugh-
tering.

Oil Palm Subpro,lect
5.07      Conditions for oil palms in.the Territory appear as favorable
as in Malaysia but, in the absence of commercial experience, yields
somewhat lower than Malaysia have been forecast: up to 9 tons of ffb per
acre at full development with a 21% oil extraction rate yielding 1.9 tons
of palm oil and 0.32 tons of palm kernels. (Anmex 3, para 40). The annual
volume of production at maturity would be 14,000 tons which represents 1%
of the world's production at the present. time.
5.08      Prices for palm oil and palm kernels are expected to decline
from the averages for 1969 of US$ 175 and US$ 182 per long- ton respective-
ly. The Bank's Economics Department anticipates that by the mi&-1970's
prices for palm oil will be in the range of Us$ 155 - US 165/long ton
cif European port and those of palm kernels in the range of US$ 134 -
US$ 138. Consequently, in project projections the following cit prices
are used:  palm oil. - US.$ 160/long ton-, palm kernels - UB$.136/long ton.
Annex 3, Table 1 shows that at these prices. smallholders would receive.
$A 14.00/ton for their ffb. An. agreement has already been signed between
NBPOD and Government for Phase I development providing that the price
paid to the smallholder for ffb would. be determined by a specifiz and
agreed formula (See Annex 7).  Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that this agreement would be amended to cover production from.Phase II
development.
5.09      Settlers' ffb would be processed., and the producta mar.keted,
by NBPOD, which has already been contracted by the Government; tQ provide
this service throughout, the economic. life of Phase I. It wo.uld.be neces-
sary to expand the capacity of the mill now being constructed. by-NBPOD on
their nucleus estate, and this expanslon would be required.by 19T4 to
handle the processing of the production. from the proposed subproject.
NBPOD has already indicated its willingness to extend the present proces-
sing and marketing agreement to cover production from the subproject.
To provide adequate processing, mill capacity would have to be increased
by 15 tons ffb/hour to give a total of 30 tons ffb/hour. However, an
additional planned increase in planting- on the NBPOD nucleus estate from
the 3,000 acres under Phase I to 8,000 acres, will call for further expan-
sion of the mill to 45 tons ffb/hour by 1977. The basic design and founda-
tions  _ x41' ..o  -Wt    0.1.-o:-5  v  ,-Fo  of      tan 4t,  >,-tcnz-
A condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit would be the amendment
of the existing agreement between NBPOD and the Government, guaranteeing
processing and marketing for the production of the subproject. Assurances
were obtained from Government during unegotiations that if NNBOD was unable
to fulfill its obligations in processing and marketing thez. Government would
provide alternative processing and marketing facilities.
Producer Benefits
5.10      The project would increase farm incomes on existing farms and
provide good.incomes on new ones in relation to the background Of the
participants (on the one hand expatriates in the case of coconut estate

and beef ranches and on the other indigenous settlers in the case of oil
palms). Average net incomes without development and at full development,

VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The project would increase production on 10,000 acre  o  coco-
nuts, 150,000 acres of ranch land and T,800.acres of forest land suitable
for palm oil. It would also introduce 980 smallholders to a.cash-economy
in a previously undeveloped area and provide a significant number of job
opportunities, particularly in services-and oil. milling.
6.02      Not only would the. project increase.- production, but: i.t- would.
make a positive contribution. to the.. development. of two relatively--new
lines of agriculture, livestock and. oil. palms.. The potential. fory these:
two types of enterprise in this underdeveloped-country is" relatively
large; indeed livestock development could&be extended to..some. ten million
acres of natural.grassland which is at present unused. There. is; .also
substantial scope for:oil palm development, market prospects permitting.
,6.03.        The oil palm. subproject, represents- the continuation' of- a. highly
O')   Asuccessful first phase- development;,, and further contributes to. thee much
needed involvement of'the. indigenous. population in agricultural development.
; ' .- The rate of return on- the- combined. Phase.: I. and Phase II development, is 15%
compared with 9.5% on. the. first phase alone...
6.o4      Although the livestock project is. Justified on purel,-economic
grounds, it will also make an important impact in providing!reasonably priced
and locally adapted livestock for: indigenous.farmers.
6.05'     The Kimbe Wharf is a necessary development for the oil. palm
industry in the Hoskins:-area of New Brit-.ai_.¢ In addition, it, wil.lpro-
wide general facilities for the local administrative centre atKibmbe and
encourage further development in an area. which has had restricted commu--
nications with the remainder of the country;.
6.o6      The internal,rates of return of the.various subprojeets.:are
coconuts 9%, beef cattle. 11% and oil palm including the Kimbe Whar.f 15%.
Further details on benefits and Justification are in Annex 1, page 5

VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During credit negotiations agreement was reached on the following
principal points;
(i) that Government would consult with the Association before
December 31st, 1972, with a view to terminating the Freight
and Disease control subsidy by December 31st, 1973 or as
soon thereafter as the development of the cattle industry
in the Territories shall permit (para 3.11);
(ii) that the agreement between NBPOD and the Government on
the prices to be paid to smalIholders for ffb production
in Phase I would be amended to include ffb production
from Phase II (para 5.08);
(iii) that the agreement between NBPOD and the Papua and New
Guinea Government, which provides for the processing
and marketing of the crop for Phase I of oil palm sub-
project, would be amended to include Phase II (para. 5.09);
and
- I3X  that should NBPOD be unable to fulfill its obligations in
processing and marketing the smallholders' ffb production,
then Government would provide alternative facilities
(para 5.09);
(v) that net funds arising from repayment to PNGDB of project
loans would be relent for agricultural development (para 41.12).
7.02      Conditions of effectivess of the loan are the signing of the
following agreements in a form satisfactory to IDA:
(i) the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between Government and PNGDB
(para 4.12);
(ii) the agreement between NBPOD and Government guaranteeing
the processing and marketing of the production of the oil
palm subproject (para 5.09).

PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
COCONUT SUB-PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        Coconut is the principal crop, and copra the main export of
the Territory. Of the 500,000 acres planted, mainly in the coastal'
areas, approximately half is grown on large estates and the balance on
inmallholdings. Most of the production from the large estates is export-
ed, while the major part of the smallholder production is consumed in
the Territory.
2.        Exports rose steadily between 1960 and 1966 from about 65,000
tons to over 80,000 tons; and 1967 and 1968 exports were T4,000 and 75,000
tons respectively. The value of copra and coconut product exports dur-
ing the last five years has varied between A$15 million and A$21 mil-
lion; in 1967 they were worth A$16 million and in 1968 A$21 million.
3.        A few of the larger estates have been replanted but, because
of increasing costs and the long period it takes - 10 years - for crops
to reach full maturity, the smaller estates (i.e. those under 1,000
acres, comprising 90 per cent of total estate acreage) have stopped
development. Until recently, there has been no long-term credit avail-
able and planters have been doubtful about the political future of the
Territory. In its efforts to maintain coconut production, and hopeful-
ly to expand it, Government has carried out trials which prove the value
of fertilizer on the two most important soil types, and it has provided
roads and infrastructure (notably in the island of Bougainville) which
have made it easier to barvest and market the crop.
4.        The coconut palm is easy to grow and once mature it needs
little maintenance.  Diseases are few, little labor is required (one
man for 10 to 15 acres) and the process of drying copra is simple. The
first harvest is seven years after planting, and bearing continues for
upwards of fifty years (some of the highest yielders in Bougainville
are more than seventy years old). The well drained tropical coastal
lands of the Territory are suited to coconuts, and yields are about 10
cvt of copra per acre.

II.  THE SUBPROJRCT
A. ProJect Definition
5.        The subproject consists of the first five years of a ten-
year program of lending by the Papua and Now Guinea Development Bank
(P10DB) to existing coconut estates for small amounts of nov planting
and some replanting, totalling about 10,000 acres.
6.        Participating estates already have substantial fixed assets
in the form of housing, transportation and processing equipment; and
adequate management and stff is available to handle the proposed de-
velopments without increasing overheads. Now planting woul& be car-
ried out on small parcels of land, adjacent to mature coconuts, and
replanting would be part of a continuous process of replacing' uneco-
nomic trees.
T.        PNGDB, vhich has staff capable of appraising, disbursing and
supervising loans, would decide, in conjunction with the Department of
Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries (DAB?), the amount of new planting
and replanting it would be prepared to finance in each case. It is
estimated that with the substantial long-term finance provided by PNGDB,
at least 10,000 acres would be developed under the subproject and 25
individual applications would be received. Ten applications are ex-
pected in year 1 and 15 in year 2.
8.        Nev planting involves the clOaring of secondary growth, nurs-
ery and cover crop establishment, planting, fertilizer and pesticide
application and construction of access roads. Replanting inputs would
be similar except that instead of clearing unplanted land, old palms
would be cut out and there would be no need for new access roads.
9.        After preparing a development plan, in conjunction with DASF,
planters would apply to PNGDB through their commercial banks for develop-
ment finance. The coxmercial banks would advise PN0DB on the creditwor-
thiness of the applicant, whilst PNGDB staff would check assets and lia-
bilities, verify that land title was clear, and satisfy themselves that
the development proposals were financially sound.
10.       Successful applicants would be lent up to 80% of on-farm
costs at a minimum interest rate of 6-3/4%. Because of the time it takes
for coconuts to reach full maturity, the first payments would not be
made until year 12 after planting; so that an adequate cash surplus
would be left after debt service (Table 2), loan repayments would be
spread over a maximum of 8 years thereafter.
11.       PNGDB would disburse against evidence of agreed expenditure ei-
ther to the planter or directly to the supplier.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
12.       Repayment of the loan would be made by deductions from the
proceeds of the copra crop of the entire estate; either by an order
through the Copra Marketing Board (the sole purchaser of copra) or by
a standing order on the borroVer's commercial bank.
B. Cost Estimates
13.       The subproject is estimated to cost, including contingencies,
A$ o.96 million (US$ 1.1 million) (Table 3). The import component would
be approximately 31%. The following is a breakdown of estimated sub-
project costs:

C. Proposed Financing
14.       The total subproject costs of A$ 0.96 million, or US$ 1.1 mil-
lion equivalent, would be financed by the producers, PNGDB and IDA as fol-
lows:
(a) Producers - Approximately 20% of estimated on-farm
development costs, or about A$ 190,000 which is
19% of the total subproject costs.
(b) PNGDB - Approximately 80% of remaining on-farm costs,
or about A$ 770,000, of which A$ 300,000 would
be met from the proposed IDA credit; plus a small
amount (A$ 47,000) to cover the cost of PNGDB services.

Total:            915            4          962       100
During the development period producers would have to find a ftrther
A$ 130,000 to meet interest payments.
III. YIELDS. PRODUCTION AND PRODUCERS' BENEFITS
16.       Coconut yields on average soils are estimated at::
Year After Planting:  7    8    9    10    11    12    13    14,  15
--------------Cwt copra per acreÖ----------
1    2    4     6      8     9    10    11.   12
17.       These yields are based on the present Territory average of 10
cwt copra per acre on mature plantations. One ton (20 cvt) of copra per
acre is possible on the very best estates under optimum conditions.
18.       Copra prices, according to a recent forecast by the Bank's
Economics Department, are expected to fall gradually from recent levels
of around US$ 200 per long ton cif European port to about US$ 160, a
farm-gate equivalent of about A$ 96 per ton (see Table 1).
19.       The net annual income to producers, using the above forecast
price, on 100 acres of new planting costing about A$ 13,000 (A$ 130 or
US$ 150 per acre) to establish would be about A$ 2,500 by the 15th year.
20.       Territory copra is purchased by the Copra Marketing Board, a
statutory body which serves all producers and pays them the world market
equivalent price less Market Board expenses (approximately A$ 3.50 per ton).
Marketing arrangements are satisfactory. The Board accepts st:anding
orders to pay proceeds to designated banks (including PNGDB) vhich facil-
itates collection of loan repayments.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
IV. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
21.       At maturity (about 1984) the subproject would lead to produca-
tion of about 6,000 tons of copra annually worth about A$ 700,000, all for
export.
22.       The average annual net return to the economy of the Territory,
discounted over the life of the project, would be approximately 9% (see
Table 4).

ANNEX 2
PAPUA AMD NEW GUINEA
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
BEEF CATTLE SUB-PROJECT
I.  BACKGROUND
A. General
1.        The Territory's cattle population is approximately 50,000 head;
of these 80% are owned by expatriates on ranches or mixed farms, 14% are
on Government ranches, and 6% are owned by indigenes who have only re-
cently begun to keep cattle.
2.        There are up to 10 million acres of land suited to cattle graz-
ing in the Territory, and the Bank Economic Mission in 1963 estimated
the Territory's potential carrying capacity at two to four million head,
depending upon the intensity of stock and pasture management. Perform-
ance of cattle is good, provided they have a proportion of Zebu (Bos
indicus) blood; this is particularly important in the lower wetter areas.
3.        Cattle health in both the tropical lowlands and temperate high-
;lands, i remarkably good. To maintain the national herd free from dis-
eases such as rinderpest, foot and mouth, and tick-borne fevers Govern-
ment imposes rigorous control on all cattle imports. The Animal Industry
Section of the Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries (DASB) has
adequate veterinary staff to serve the industry, and the needs of the
proposed sub-project.
B.  The Cattle Industry
4.        The cattle industry, mostly devoted to beef production, com-
prises the following sectors:
(a) Private (expatriate) - Twelve large herds of between
1,000 and 3,000 head and about 300 small herds averag-
ing about 70 head and run on mixed farms.
(b)  Private (indisenous) - Nov about 400 smallholdings,
the first of which was established in 1960. These
smallholdings were intended to hold 20 to 25 head
but a shortage of suitably adapted cattle has re-
stricted stocking to about 10 head per holding.



ABNEX 2
Page 2
(c)  Public - Four Government ranches, currently handling
about 7,000 head and selling yearling heifers and
steers to smallholders at near commercial prices.
5.        The cattle industry has developed largely because of Govern-
ment incentives. Government has encouraged Australian cattlemen to in-
vest in the industry and has acquired about 120,000 acres of suitable
land for leasing to selected graziers at nominal rents. Leases are for
99 years, have development conditions attached, and are transferable.
Government has also introduced a Freight and Disease Control subsidy to
cover the cost of transporting disease-free breeding stock from Australia.
6.        The purpose of the subsidy is to encourage the development of
foundation herds by experienced cattlemen. The on-farm cost of imported
breeding cattle is 60% to 80% higher than the price in Australia and,
without a subsidy, private cattlemen are reluctant to import foundation
stock. The subsidy which has a maximum of A$ 70 (US$ 78) per head will
be discontinued in about 1973.
7.        Government's objectives in encouraging the development of the
beef cattle industry are to initiate the development of a large unused
land resource; to replace high-cost imports of meat and to provide a
source of locally adapted cattle at economic prices. It will also assist
indigenous farmers to play a larger part in the cattle industry and help
to ensure a continuing supply of animal protein for the people.
8.        To encourage participation by local people, most of whom have
little experience with cattle, Government has organized cattle manage-
ment training, and a supply of locally adapted stock at near commercial
prices.  These small farmers are now able to purchase immature-cattle
from Government provided they satisfy DASF of their ability to manage
cattle, and that they have sufficient pasturage available.
C. Beef Marketing
9.        Cattle are either slaughtered, dressed and refrigerated on-
farm, and then air-freighted to retail markets; or they are taken to pub-
lic abattoirs for slaughter. Government recently decided to establish
five small public abattoirs over a five-year period to supplement private
slaughtering facilities. Two are already in operation in the main centers
of Port Moresby and Lae, see Map 1; and others will be built as demand
requires.
10.       The principal vholesale buyers are five leading retail firms
who operate mainly in the coastal towns, where they have cold storage for
their meat import trade. The principal retail market is in the expatri-
ate sector, but a groving number of indigenous people are buying fresh
meat, especially in the Central Highlands.

D. Beef Consumption
11.       Consumption of fresh and chilled carcasses continues to in-
crease, while the consumption of canned beef is slowly decreasing, as
shown below.
Total Consumption in Carcass Equivalent
1963                         1968
Canned Beef                        27,000                       26,000
Fresb and Chilled Carcasses         7,000                       1&,000
Production of local carcasses is increasing and in 1968 33% of all fresh
meat consumed, came from local ranches.
E. Development Plans
12.       By 1980, Government plans to increase the cattle population to
300,000 - about 60% will be owned by indigenes - with an annual slaugh-
ter rate of 30,000 to 40,000 head. Although these targets are probably
optimistic, appreciable progress should be made, encouraged in partic-
ular by the Freight and Disease Control subsidy and the availability of
long-term credit through the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB).
Government also plans to provide more grazing land for the private sec-
tor; to derelop further its abattoir program; to widen the scope of cat-
tle ovnership by indigenes and increase the training of local people in
cattle management.
II. THE SUB-PROJECT
A. Definition
13.       The sub-project is an integral part of Government plans for
an expansion of the Territory's beef cattle industry. It comprises:
(a) In the private sector:
Provision of credit to qualified ranch owners to purchase
imported breeding stock and pay for associated on-
farm development required for:
(i) improvement of about 100,000 acres on partly
developed ranches;



ANNEX 2
Page 
(i1)  development of about 50,000 acres of additional
grazing land (partly-:new ranches and partly ex-
tensions to existing.ranches); and
(b) In the public sector:
(i)  completion of dev,elopment of two Government cat-
tle. ranches at Baiyer River and Urimo (see Map l1)
by the addition -of -turther fencing, yards and
water points, -some-pasture improvement :and -the

(ii)  provision -of classrooms .and equipment for -tran-
ing in cattle management of indigenous 7fsarmers
-at Baiyer River, -where some facilities :alreaTy
exist, and at Urimo and one other -ranch., --where
-new -training-centers vvould be established.
B.  Cost Estimates
14.       The cost of -the subproject,. inciuding allowances 2for zcontin-
:geacies, is estimated .at A$ 2.45 million tus$ 2.7 -illion) wVtthma:for-
ei-gn -exchange component -estimated at .bout A$.1.5 -million (CiS$ 227 -mil-

D. Proposed Financing
15.       The total subproject cost of A$ 2.45 million, or US$ 2.75 mil-
lion equivalent, would be financed by ranchers, PNGDB, Government and IDA
as follows:
(a) Ranchers, up to 20% of the on-farm development costs
on existing ranches, up to 30% in the case of new
ranches; plus ranch operating co8ts and the cost of



ANNEX. 2
Page 6
breeding stock retentions, totalling about A$ 750,000
or 30% of subproject cost. They would also finance
loan interest during development, which is not. in-"
cluded in the above cost8.
(b) PNGDB, the balance of on--farm development costsa on pri-
vate ranches, total about- A$. 960,000 or 40% of over--
all cost, which wouldL be' met f-om the propose. ID
credit; and-
(c) Government, the cost of Government on-farm development.,
the support services; totaL about A$ 7T0,000 or 30%.
of overall cost, of which-. A$ 620,000 would be: met. from
the proposed IDA credit.

Procurement
17.       Ranchers would purchase breeding-stock from Queensland., the
most convenient and suitable source.  Sufficient animals are expected.
to be available from this source at.the- prices used in the cost'esti-
mates. Importation of livestock required for the subproject would- be
controlled.by DASF.
18..      The. volume of other imports under- the subproject is: too. small
for bulk purchasing under international. competitive bidding.. Ranchers.
would purchase their own requirements (subject to PNGDB approval.) on.the-
local market, where. there is a high degree.s of international. competition-.
Government would.obtain its requirements-through. exi.sting. tender proce-
dures which, are-. satisfactory to IDA.

20.       PNGDB and DASF would submit their statements of expenm1ture to
the Territory Treasury with evidence of expenditure on ellgible' 1.tems2.
Treasury would auathenticate these statements and seek reimbursement from
IDA. Proceeds of the credit relating to PNGDB loans would be on-l=en  di-
rectly to PNGDB; and for Government operations to DASF.
III. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Loans to Sub-borrowers
Credit for Rench Development
21.       PNGDB would make loans to qualified private ranches for the
specified costs of on-farm development, such as imported breeding
cattle, fencing, water, cattle yards, pasture improvement, farm build-
ings and equipment. The ranches would meet internal operating costs,'
interest costs during development, eud, in the case of existing ranch-
es would bear the cost of retaining the additional breeding stock
needed for the development program.
22.       Ranchers would apply for a PNGDB loan through their own commer-
cial banks and would be encouraged to seek the assistance of DASP ia
preparing ranch development plans to accompuay their loan applications.
The commercial bwnk would make recommendations on the creditw'orthines
and managerial ability of the applicant. PNGDB would appraise tach sub-
borrower's financial soundness and technical and commercial cotutence.
PNGDB has an efficient staff of loan officers and DASF has competent staff
available for technical supervision.
23.       PNGDB would disburse its loans against evidence of approved ex-
penditure or pay suppliers directly on authenticated receipts in the case
of agreed items.
24.       DA8F would be responsible for Government operations ei'd would
also have a coordinating function. It would be responsible for the im-
portation and inspection of cattle required for the project and for o7er-



ANNEX 2
Page 8
coming shortages or difficulties in the supply of other farm inputs.
DASF would appoint an officer in the Animal Production Section -specifi-
cally to cover these responsibilities.
B. Government Operations
25.       DASF ranch managers would be responslble for 'further develop-
ment of the Baiyer River and Urimo ranches.  Additional training-facil-
ities would be established at Baiyer River, Urimo and Erap.end training
would then come under the control of the cattle training officers.
C. Accounts and.Aud.it
26.       PIGDB would keep separate accounts for each sub-borrower financed
from proceeds of the 'IDA credit.  The number would be small (probably not
more than 20). DASF would keep separate accounts for its raznch opera-
tions, and training facilities financed by IDA.
27.       PNGDB and DASF accounts are audited by the Commonwealtb of
Australia Auditor-General' s Department., vhich has an office in the Ter-
rltory.
IV. RANCH OPERATIONS AND FINANCES,.BENEFITS AND MARKETIN
A. Ranch Operations
28.       A typical ranch sub-borrower would be a small limited company
leasing 10,000 acres from Government. The principal shareholder would
be an Australian entrepreneur who, with his family, would manage the
ranch. His family and friends would probably have provided :financial
backing in the form of share subscriptions and loans, and short-term
credit would have been made available usually from commercial banks.
29.       Ranch development would normally pass through two-phses.  A
rancher in the first phase (new ranch) would develop a herd of about
1,000 head after four years. The herd would stabilize at about 1,.400
after nine years and annual offtake would be about 330 head vorth approx-
imately A$ 32,000. During this phs, ena-ranch development would be lim-
ited to fencing and the provision of water points (see Tables 3 through
6).
30.       A rancher in the second phas:e (aexisting ranch) would double
his herd of about 1,400 head by the fburth year and increase his total
herd to about 3,700 head after nine years. During this period annual



ANNEX 2
Page 9
sales would increase from an average of 330 head to nearly 900 and an-
nual ranch revenue from approximately A$ 32,000 to over A$ 70,000.
During the second phase a skilled stockman would be engaged and some
pasture improvement would be introduced to increase carrying capacity.
31.       After nine years the subproject would result in an additional
annual offtake of about 7,000 head valued at about A$ 800,000. The value
of imports saved would be about A$ 920,000 (US$ 1 million). Additional-
ly, young stock worth about A$ 36,000 (Us$ 4o,000) annually would be pro-
duced on Government ranches.
B. Ranchers' Financing and Benefits
32.       Ranchers would borrow from PNGDB up to 80% of the costs of on-
farm development for four years for existing ranches and up to 70% for
new-ranches. Existing ranches would be lent a higher proportion because
they would have a proven record and offer more security. The loans would
be for up to 12 years including five years' grace at interest of not less
than 6-3/4% up to July 1st, 1970 and thereafter not less than 7%.
33.       The credit would be used for first phase development of 50,000
acres of new or extension ranches and for second phase development of
100,000 acres of existing ranches. To estimate the financial position
and the return to ranchers, models have been prepared for 10,000 acre
units of each stage of development, the basic data for which is shown in
Table 3. Table 3 shows the model for an existing ranch and Table 5 for
a new ranch. The following table shows the investment costs and the per-
centage which would be met by the rancher in each case:

* Including expenditure incurred prior to the project.
34.       The models show that the financial position of the ranchers
should be satisfactory. New ranches should be generating an operating



ANNEX 2
Page 10
surplus after meeting interest by year 5 and thereafter they should pro-
duce an adequate cash surplus after meeting loan repayments. Existing
ranches should produce substantial cash surpluses, after meeting debt
service, throughout the life of the project. The discounted rate of
return on the investment in new ranches is estimated to be about 9% and
on existing ranches about 11%.
C. M
35.       C.ttle for slaughter would be sold on the local market through
existing ch .nnels, augmented by the new slaughtering facilities being
established/by Government.  The Territory's market for fresh beef is in-
creasing at an estimated annual rate of 7% and, even when the subproject
reached fill production, meat imports would still be required. No mar-
keting/problems are, therefore, expected. Live yearling cattle would be
sold to indigenes at a price related to slaughter value.
V. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
36.       The subproject would increase beef production from some 100,00o
acres of partially developed ranch land and bring into productive use
50,000 acres of new pasture. It would lead to a reduction in meat im-
ports, and increase the number of locally adapted breeding cattle, thus
-making it easier for local people to participate in the beef cattle in-
dustry, and assisting their integration into the cash economy. With the
for local people to participate in the cash economy assume increasing im-
portance.
37.       The average annual net return to the economy of the Territory
would be about 11% (Table 7).

PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
Agricultural Development Project
Smallholder Oil Palm Sub-Project
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The sub-project comprises part of the second phase of a program
of oil palm development on the north coast of New Britain. Part of the
first phase of the program is being financed by an Association Credit.
(PNG-137). The sub-project is located on the north coast of New Britain
(at latitude 5.26∞S) between Talasea and Hoskins (see Maps 1 and 2). The
program of oil palm development is being carried out by the Government -
through the Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries (DASF) which is
responsible for smallholder aspect. of the program, and New Britain Palm
Oil Development Ltd. (NBPOD) which is responsible for development of a
nucleus estate and processing facilities. NBPOD is owned in equal shares
by Government and Harrisons and Crosfield (Australia and New Zealand) Ltd.
(H&C), which is one of the world's largest plantation companies and espe-
cially experienced in oil palm cultivation. The project area has a small
resident population, fertile volcanic soils and easy agricultural topo-
graphy, and H&C have described conditions for oil palms in the project
area at least equal to the best conditions in Malaysia. The first planted
oil palms in the area are now 15 months old and show very healthy growth.
2.        Annual rainfall is between 100 and 170 inches, well distributed
over the year. Sunshine is expected to appr8ach an annual average of 2,000
hours; temperature ranges between 70∞ and 80 Fahrenheit. These are good
climatic conditions for oil pa3ms.
3.        The natural vegetation is tropical rain forest.  Marketable tim-
ber has been and will continue to be felled under a logging contract. Good
supplies of vater are available.
Communications
4.        Hoskins has an airstrip for medium aircraft and has good radio-
telephone communications. An all-weather road connects Hoskins with the
sub-project and a bridge is being constructed over the Dagi River to con-
nect Hoskins with the proposed Kimbe Wharf, the outlet for oil palm pro-
ducts. Timber and heavy materials are at present shipped by rafting to
and from vessels anchored off shore.
Health
5.        Malaria was a principal cause of sparse population but has been
largely controlled. Government continues to issue free malaria suppressants.

II. THE SUB-PROJECT
A. Project Definition
6.        The fub-project includes:
(a) The settlement of 980 smalTholders (380 in 1970/71,
300 in 1971/72 snd 300 in 1972/73) on 15 acre plots.
(b) The planting of 8 acres of oil palm on each holding
over the first three years of settlement to give a
total of 7,840 acres of oil palms by 1974/75.
(c) The provision of suitable supervision and agricul-
tural credit facilities.                        1
7.        Under the sub-project, smallholders would repay all on-farm deve-
lopment costs and the subsistence allowance that would be paid to them du-
.ring development of their holdings. Loans for the above purposes would be
made by the Papua and New Guinea Development Bank (PNGDB) and repayments
would be deducted at source from the sales -proceeds of settlers' oil palm
produce.
Infrastructure
8.        Government has already provided finance for the construction of a
bridge over the Dagi River and an all-weather road linking the project area
with an ocean wharf site at Kimbe. One of the sub-projects of the Agricul-
tural Development Project is the wharf at Kimbe, see Annex 4. With comple-
tion of the Kimbe Wharf the major infrastructure required for the sub-project
will be in place.
Land Tenure
9.        The Land Ordinance (1962-1966) governs land tenure in Papua and
New Guinea. Apart from some freehold titles issued during the German admi-
nistration of New Guinea, land may be owned only by the natives or by the
Government. All land to which the Government cannot show rightful title is
considered as "native land". The Government can acquire "native land",
either by negotiated or compulsory purchase, and may lease land to private
individuals or companies for periods up to 99 years. The land needed for
the project has already been purchased by the Government from the local
tribe, which owns large tracts of land that are more than sufficient for
its needs in the foreseeable future. Recent experience has shown, however,
that where a lease has been offered to an individual and has had to be can-
celled due to the lessee not taking up residence during the mandatory six
month period, considerable delays occur in effecting reallocation. The
government is now reducing the option period to three months.

B. Development Schedule
Land Clearing
10.       Most of the saleable timber would have been removed from the
forest covering the settlement area. Clearing of the remaining timber is
relatively inexpensive and government pre-clearing (felling only) costs
about A$12.50 (US$14) per acre. Government would fell six acres on each
holding prior to the settler taking up residence. The settler would stack
and burn the felled material to complete the clearing operation himself.
Six acres would be planted with palms during the first two years. Subse-
quently, the settler would have to fell, stack and burn, two acres for
his third year's planting and the 1 or 2 acres needed for his food garden.
Pre-clearing is being carried out by contract labor brought in from out-
side the settlement area and many of them are eventually allocated a hold-
ing. Forest clearing is traditional work in the Territory and the existing
settlers are having no difficulty in dealing with this work. The overall
clearing program for oil palm planting would be as follows:

Planting Program
11.       Each settler would plant three acres of oil palms under supervision
during his first year of occupation, three more during the second and two in
the third, making eight in all. Consequently, the oil palm planting program
for the project is as follows:

C.  Oil Palm Establishment
Planting Material
12.       NBPOD, under contract to the Government, would supply dura x
pisifera hybrid seedlings to the smallholders.  NBPOD would continue to
obtain its seed supplies from Harrisons and Crosfield estates in Malay-
sia.  At the time of appraisal sufficient planting material was on site to
complete the 1969/70 planting program and plans had been made to supply
seedlings for the 1970/71 expanded programi. No problems are eavi,saged in
obtaining supplies to complete the overall planting program.  Cover crop
seed would also have to be imported, and Malaysia would be the most suita-
ble source.  H & C has alreadr made plans to establish a small oil palm
seed producing estate at Hoskins, which. will eventually eliminate the
Territory's reliance on outside sources of seed.
Fertilizers and Pesticides
13.       The fertilizer requirements of oil palm in the project area are
unknown. Hovever, experience with oil palms elsewhere, and with coconuts
in the project area, indicates that despite the high initial fertility of
the soil, fertilizer might well improve, yields after the trees have been
in bearing for some time. Allowances are made in project costs for ferti-
lizer use by the farmers. It is anticipated that Dynastid beetle and bag
worm attacks might cause limited damage and provision is made in project
costs for their control.
Pollination
114.      Pollination vould be needed to obtain maximum yields in the first
four to six years of production, and would be provided as a central settle-
ment service.  Suitable supplies of pollen can be obtained from Malaysia.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
D. Palm Produce Processing
15.       Settlers' ffb 1/ would be processed, and the products marketed, by
NBPOD, which has already been contracted by the Government to provide this
service throughout the economic life of Phase I. It would be necessary to
expand the capacity of the mill now being constructed by NBPOD on their
nucleus estate and this expansion would be required by 1974 to handle the
processing of the production from the proposed sub-project. NBPOD has al-
ready indicated its willingness to extend the present processing and market-
ing agreement to cover production from the sub-project. To provide adequate
processing mill capacity would have to be increased by 15 tons ffb per hour
to give a total of 30 tons ffb per hour. However, an additional planned
increase in plantings on the NBPOD nucleus estate from the 3,000 acres un-
der Phase I to 8,000 acres will call for further expansion of the mill to
45 tons ffb per hour by 1977. The basic design and foundations of the mill
allow for a final capacity of more than 45 tons ffb per hour. A condition
of the effectiveness of the proposed credit would be the conclusion of an
agreement, satisfactory to the Association, between NBPOD and the Govern-
ment guaranteeing processing and marketing for the production of the sub-
project.
E. Cost Estimates
16.       Total project costs, including capitalized interest on PDB loans
to settlers, are estimated at A$3.5 million (US$3.95 million). The table
below gives a summary of the cost estimates. Further details are in Table 3.

17.       The estimated import component of total investment expenditure is
54% or about A$1.92 million (US$2.15 million). Since most of the imports
would come from continental Australia and since the Territory's monetary
and banking system is an integral part of the Australian system, the term
"import component" rather than "foreign exchange component" is used to
describe funds required for this purpose.
F. Proposed Financing
18.       An IDA credit of US$2.15 million would be made to the Administra-
tion of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea.  The total project cost of
A$3.5 million (US$3.95) would be met as follows:
A$'000       us$'ooo        %
Government                      1,600         1,800        46%
IDA                             1,920         2,150        54%
3,520        3,950       100
The proposed IDA participation represents about 54% of the expenditures
expected to be incurred on the project after July 1, 1969 and this is
equivalent to the estimated import component of those expenditures (see
para. 17).
19.       The Government contribution of A$1.6 million (US$1.8) would be
used directly by Government Departments concerned with project development,
particularly the Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries and by PNGDB
to finance loans to settlers.
20.       IDA's contribution would be used to provide PNGDB with part of the
funds required for the financing of the smallholders' loans, and to meet
part of the expenditures made by DASF on the project. The part which would
be employed by PNGDB would be on-lent to PNGDB by the Government at 1 1/4% in-
terest to be repaid within 25 years (see Annex 5, para. 6) under the terms
of a subsidiary Loan Agreement already approved by the Association.
21.       The smallholder's contribution includes labor not recompensed by
the living allowance paid as part of the PNGDB long-term loans (para. 28).
The amount is small, but ultimately smnalholders would pay for all on-farm
investment costs by loan repayments made out of crops proceeds from year 6
to year 12 after settlement.
Procurement
22.       The Government's regular tender procedures for purchases Of goods
required for settlers and its own services are acceptable to IDA; the amounts



ANNEX 3
Page 8
involved are too small to warrant procurement by formal international compe-
titive bidding. All Government services, including land sub-division, crop
extraction, road construction, agricultural extension and social services,
can be adequately carried out by Government staff.
Disbursement
23.       Disbursement of the proposed credit would be completed by June 30,
1974, although investment expenditures on the project would continue for a
further two years (see Table 3). However, the investment costs in those two
years is estimated to be only A$75,000 (us$84,ooo).
G. Accounts and Audit
24.       PNGDB accounts would be audited by the Auditor General of the Com-
monvealth of Australia,. under the terms of the Papua and New Guinea Develop-
ment Bank Ordinance, 1965. Direct expenditures of the Government, which
would be kept as separate accounts to facilitate IDA disbursement, are also
audited by the Commonwealth's Auditor General.. These arrangements are sa-
tisfactory and assurances have been obtained for Phase I development that
audit arrangements satis.factory to IDA would be employed at all times.
Assurances were obtained during credit negotiations that these arrangements
would cover Phase II.
III.  SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES, ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMNT
A. Settlement Policy
25.       The successful policy adopted in the smallholder project financed
under Credit 137-PNG would be continued for the proposed new sub-project;
this policy includes physical help by government in the early stages of
establishment, the provision of social services at the inception of settle-
ment, the availability of competent technicians in the project area and re-
course to disciplinary action where settlers breach credit and lease agree-
ments. Organizational and management details are outlined below.
B. Settler Selection
26.       Settlers are recruited by public invitation and meetings are held
to explain the scheme fully.  The ILnd Board, an agency responsible for re-
cruiting settlers for land development schemes, visits recruitment areas to
interview applicants. District Commissioners and local DASF staff usually
make some informal preselection but, although the Land Board may consult
them, it makes its own independent recommendation to the Administrator.



ANNEX 3
Page 9
In making its recommendation, the Land Board considers the applicant's
background, particularly in farming and plantation work, his physical
fitness and willingness to move his home, and the availability of family
labor to help him. Before final acceptance, names are checked vith PNGDB
to ensure that applicants have a clean credit record. No difficulties have
been encountered in selecting the 580 smallholders now being settled and no
problems are foreseen for the expansion period.
C. Titles and Leases
27.       Ninety-nine year leases for the 15 acres holdings are issued to
all settlers at the outset. Key conditions of the lease are as follows:
-  that eight acres of oil palms are planted in a "----good
and husbandlike manner...." within three years--three in
the first, three in the second, two in the third year--
with at least eight acres kept so planted and ",.. .harvest-
ed regularly in accordance vith sound commercial practice
****", and
-  that the lessee shall reside on the holding within six
months of the date of the commencement of the lease and
shall continue to reside there for a minimum period of
seven years.
The size of holding has been fixed at 15 acres because smalIholders, with
the assistance of their families, may wish to expand the area of their ac-
tivities in the future. Expansion beyond 8 acres of oil palm per family
is not expected for some time to come, but, as there is no problem of land
shortage, other residents of the country are not suffering from this rela-
tively generous policy of land issue. The annual rent paid to the Govern-
ment by the settlers is A$20 per holding.
D. Credit Arrangements
Loans to Settlers
28.       Cash savings of most settlers selected for the scheme will be
insignificant. Consequently, PNGDB would provide loans up to 100% of
the costs incurred by each settler and his family, during a four-year
development period. These loans would cover moving to the project site,
establishing eight acres of oil palms, building a house and purchasing
household utensils. Pending the establishment of subsistence crops, which
takes about six months, the loan would also cover food purchases for this
initial period. The PNGDB loan would be disbursed in kind, except for the
cash "living allowance" of A$8 per month per family, and would be channelled



ANNEX 3
Page 10
through the project administration. Interest at 6% would be capitalized
during the first five years; in the sixth year sufficient interest would be
capitalized to leave the smallholder with a minimum cash income of A$8 per
month from on-farm production. The loan agreement, vhich each settler would
sign on being selected, would entitle him to incur expenditure against his
PNGDB loan account up to a total of A$2,151. The estimated make-up of this
loan is shown below.

Total:                                         2,151
29.       As settlers arrive, project staff would prepare individual record
cards itemizing all goods and services used by each settler and the costs he
must repay. The costs of these goods and services would be met initially by
the Government. Subsequently, and on the basis of the record cards, PNGDB
would reimburse the Government, and debit individual settlers' loan accounts.
Settlers' loans would be repaid by deductions from the value of deliveries
of the ffb to the NBPOD. The amount deducted would be 50% of the value of
deliverie6, subject to a minimum payment of A$8 per month to each settler
until the loan is repaid. On the basis of the yields and prices predicted



ANNEX 3
Page 11
in paras 40,41 and 42, this would allow full repayment of the average
settler's loan by the twelfth year after planting out his oil palms --
effectively a twelve year loan vith five years grace -- and would leave
the settler with a reasonable cash income at all times (Table 2).
30.       As settlers would have no other market for their ffb, the method
to be used for collecting loan repayments should keep bad debts to a mini-
muM. There would be adequate means of redress in the case of non-repayment
or unsatisfactory performance by individual settlers. Firstly, PNGDB would
arrange with the project administration for suspension of the living allow-
ance to any settler whose performance during the establishment period was
below standard. Secondly, the standard loan agreement between the settler
and PNGDB provides remedies in case of default both during the establishment
period and thereafter. Finally, the standard lease contains "good husbandry"
and "residence" clauses (para 27).
31.       PNGDB loan procedures are suitable for lending to sub-project par-
ticipants and PNGDB has adequate legal powers to ensure the recovery of its
loans. An agreement, satisfactory to IDA, has been made between the Govern-
ment and PNGDB vhich provides for the on-lending of proceeds of the credit
to PNGDB and to settlers.  It specifically provides:
-  that the interest rate charged to settlers would not be
less than 6%, and that no increase beyond 6% would be
made in this rate without prior consultation with IDA;
and
- that net funds arising from repayment of project loans
would be relent for agricultural development.
E. Harvesting and Collection of Settlers' FFB
32.       Ffb would be harvested throughout the year, with peak month har-
vests reaching 12.5% of the annual total. To keep the factory operating
efficiently, it would be necessary to coordinate fruit deliveries from the
NBPOD nucleus estate and from the umallholders. Thus settler ffb harvesting
and collection would be organized on a project basis; project staff would
prepare an overall harvesting and delivery schedule in consultation with
the factory and estate managements, and would be responsible for establish-
ing and maintaining suitable harvesting schedules with individual settlers.
Since the timing of harvesting is critical for the qaantity and quality of
oil extracted from ffb, project staff would arrange for the harvesting with
hired labor of holdings where, for a good reason such as ill health, the
settler is incapable of doing this himself. In such cases the costs of har-
vestizng would be deducted from the settlers' revenues.  NBPOD would provide
ffb collection vehicles, and settlers would be paid the value of their ffb
at roadside pick-up points (para 44).

F. ProJect Organization and Management
Development Phase   1969/70 - 1974/75
33.       The first phase of smallholder development financed under Credit
137-PNG was too small to warrant an autonomous settlement authority. As an
alternative a system of organization with a high level of coordination be-
tween the Departments concerned in settlement development was adopted by
the Government. This is shown at Chart 1. This system which has worked
very well would be used to carry out the sub-project. It gives responsibi-
lity for development of the project to a Project Coordinator (Headquarters)
in Poit Moresby, reporting to the Assistant Administrator (Economic Affairs).
The Project Coordinator (HQ) has control of all Government expenditure for
the project, and allocates funds to the various Departments for programs
which he has approved.
4.        A Project Coordinator (Field), located at the project site, plays
a similar role to the Project Coordinator (HQ) but at the field level and
exclusively for this one project. Staff of the various Departments working
on the project site are responsible to him and, except for purely technical
matters, can communicate with their headquarters only through hiw-ns
35.       A Project Manager is responsible to the Project Coordinator (Field)
for the administration of the non-technical aspects of the project, such as:
- pre-clearing;
- temporary accommodation of settlers on their arrival; and
- distribution of supplies.
36.       A Project Field Supervisor, who is a technical officer of DASF,
is responsible to the Project Coordinator (Field) for supervising agricul-
tural development at the settlement. He is supported by an Agricultural
Officer and an Assistant Agricultural Officer for each of the three settle-
ment blocks, and one Agricultural Assistant for each 40 settlers.
37.       The settlement's infrastructure would be developed by the appro-
priate Departments -  Public Works, Public Health, Education and others --
in accordance with plans approved by the Project Coordinator (HQ). Highest
priority is being given to schools, both because school buildings would be
used as temporary accommodation for the settlers, and because experience
has shown that settlers will not send for their families until satisfactory
educational facilities are available.
Operational Phase : after 1975
38.     i With the onset of the operational phase, direct responsibility for
the various aspects of the project would revert to the Government Departments
concerned. The two Project Coordinators would cease to operate, DASF would



ANNEX 3
Page 13
reduce its staff to the numbers required for a purely advisory function,
and the services of the other Departments would be operating on a routine
basis. The Project Manager would be retained, however, his principal re-
sponsibilities being the coordination of ffb harvesting and collection with
the needs of the processing factory (para 32), and the supply of on-farm
inputs.
Staff
39.       There have been no problems in obtaining sufficient trained staff
for the Phase I project. The posts of Project Coordinator (HQ), Project
Coordinator (Field), and Project Manager are already filled satisfactorily,
and the full staff requirement for Phase I has been met. No difficulties
are envisaged in recruiting staff for Phase II.
IV. YIELDS, MARKETING AND SMALLHOLDERS' INCOMES
Yields
4o.       Although growing conditions for oil palms at Hoskins appear very
favorable, the yields used in report calculations are about 10% below those
obtained in Malaysia, as follows:
Year     4     5      6     7     8      9     10-20/
ffb per acre - tons          3.5   6.o   7.5   8.5   9.0   9.0       8.5
Oil - per cent of ffb         17    18    19    20    21    21        21
Kernels - per cent of ffb   3.25  3.25  3.50  3.50  3.50  3.50    3.'50
1/   Yield then decreases 5% per annum until the end of the palms' produc-
tive life in Year 25.
Marketing
41.       NBPOD would process settlers' ffb, and market the resulting palm
oil and kernels. An agreement has been concluded with the Government, co-
vering a minimum of 4,640 acres of smallholder palms for the period 1971
through 1996. This agreement provides that the price to be paid for small-
holder ffb would be determined by a formula, which would take account of
current world prices, the costs of processing and marketing, and a reason-
able profit to the mill company. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that this agreement would be revised to cover a minimum of 12,480



ANNEX 3
Page 14
acres up to year 1994. Assurances have been obtained from the Government
that alternative processing and marketing facilities would be provided for
Phase I development if NBPOD was unable to fulfill its obligations, and these
assurances will be amended to cover production from the Phase II project.
42.       NBPOD has already entered into a marketing agreement with H&C, a
company with extensive experience in marketing oil palm produce. No diffi-
culty is expected in marketing New Britain production, which would be a
negligible proportion of the world trade in these commodities    about 1%.
Prices
43.       Annex 6 examines market prospects for palm oil and palm kernels
on the world market. It concludes that during the life of the project the
average cif Europe price for palm oil will be in the range of US$155 to
Uß$165 per ton, and that for kernels.in.the range of US$134 to.US$138. For
the purposes of this report the following prices are assumed fbr palm product
exports: palm oil US$160 per ton cif Europe; palm kernels US'$136 per ton
cif Europe. These prices compare with an average cif Europe price for oil
of US$222 per ton in 1967, one of US$178 in 1968, and an average of US$175
for the first ten months of 1969. In the same periods the cif prices of
palm kernels were US$167, US$150 and US$151 per ton respectively.
44.      I The increasing rate of extraction of palm oil and palm kernels as
smallholders' palms mature (para 40) will mean that the farm gate price for
the smalIholders' ffb will rise from about A$10 per ton in the fourth year
after planting by.about A$l per ton each year, levelling off.at about A$14
per ton in the eighth year after planting. The linkage between these farm
gate prices, the world prices for palm products forecast in para 43 and
the extraction rates given in para 40 is shown in Table l. Annex 7 con-
tains further details of the method used to establish smallholder prices.
45.       A cash flow for a typical smallholding is shown at Table 2.  Du-
ring establishment the cash income would be maintained at A$96 (us$108)
per year by the living allowance loan (para 28). Over the following six
years, while loans are being repaid, the annual income would rize to about
A$370 (us$400). At full production and after loans are fully paid, that is
from the 12th to the 25th years, income from the eight acres of oil palm
should exceed A$750 (US$830) per year. In addition, all settlers would be
able to grow food crops. Such incomes compare favorably with A$600 (US$700)
per per year from 15 acres of coconuts or with a plantation worker's average
earnings of A$400 (US$450).
-V. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
46.       The sub-project would make land available for nearly.1,000 fami-
.lies, bringing them into a cash econony and resulting in higher net incomes
(US$830) than normal estate labor (us$4oo).



ANNEX 3
Page 15
47.       It would open up previously undeveloped fertile land and provide
a partial solution to the problems of population pressure in other parts of
the country.
48.       The techniques being developed in this project will serve as a
model for larger settlement schemes which are likely to develop in the fu-
ture as one means of increasing the country's agricultural productivity.
49.       At maturity the sub-project will produce annually about 14,000
tons of palm oil and 3,100 tons palm kernels. The fob value of this pro-
duction is estimated at US$2.0 million annually.
50.       The internal economic rate of return to the economy from invest-
ment in the combined first and second phases of the New Britain oil palm
development program is about 15% 1/; the incremental rate of return from
investment in the second phase of the program is about 20% (see Table 4) 2/.
Since the nucleus estate (8,000 acres), smallholders' farms (12,500 acresT,
palm oil mill, and infrastructure are interrelated and mutually beneficial,
the above rates of return would apply also to the Kimbe wharf sub-project,
see Annex 4.
U/  The rate of return on Phase I development was calculated at 9.5%.
g   This would assume that investment in Phase I of the program was sunk.

ANNEX 4
PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
KIMBE WHARF SUB-PROJECT
1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
1.        The sub-project provides for the construction of a new deep-
water wharf in the San Remo Bay of New Britain.  The site would.be west
of Hoskins,.and near the newly founded administrative center of Kimbe
(see Maps 1 and 2).
2.        The proposed vharf consists of:
(i)  a jetty extending some. 400 feet from the coast and
terminating in a.wharf of some 200 foot width and
40 foot depth;
(ii)  a transit shed - including offices for port and.
customs. administration,. wharf amenity buildingsu,,
and facilities for labor;
(liii) necessary roads, parking.places, open storage.and
sorting areas; and
(iv) provision-of utilities (water, electricity, a'nd
se1werage).
3.        The wharf would have a berthing length of 370 feet' of which 200
feet would be reserved for ocean going vessels, and 170 feet for coaster
and barge traffic. The wharf would handle all the oil palm products from
the nearby oil palm development area, and.also general cargo entering and.
leaving the developing town of Kimbe.  In.addition, it is expected that
the wharf would be use,& for coastal passenger services as no' roads join
the Kimbe area and the. rest of the island of New Britain.
4.        At maturity, the oil palm development program would- produce some.
55,000 tons of oil and.approximately 5,000 tons of kernels a yesar. The oill
would be handled through a pipeline. The wharf would have sufficient
capacity to cope with the cargo traffic generated during the life'of the.
palm oil project.  Once in operation., it is. intended that the portvwould
be manage'd by the Harbor- Board of Papua and New Guinea.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
II. SUB-SOIL AND SEA CONDITIONS
5.        Extensive borings have been made at the port site and good
sub-soil has been found for the foundations. As the jetty is located
in deep water, no dredging will be necessary. The report of a recent
UNDP study entitled "Transport Survey in Papua and New Guinea" 1/ rec-
ommends the construction of port facilities at Kimbe.
III. COSTS AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS
6.        The total cost of the vharf is estimated at A$ 890,000 (US$ 1
million), the foreign component of which is A$ 670,000 (US$ 750,000).
The cost of the sub-project has been based on known costs of labor and
material and on bids received in 1968 for the construction of similar
installations at Rabaul.
7.        The breakdown of project costs is estimated as follows:
Summary Project Cost
Costs
A$'000---Total---US$'OO0
Jetty                             356               398

Total                       890               997
8.        The costs of engineering, and supervision of the construction,
which would be responsibilities of the Department of Public Works (DPW)
of the Commonwealth of Australia are not included in project costs.
Construction and Procurement
9.        DP  has prepared designs and tender documents for the sub-
project and acceptable plans have been submitted to the Association. All
1/   The Bank was executing agency for the UNDP study.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
the contracts for construction and equipment supply would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Associa-
tion's guidelines.
Disbursement
10.       Proceeds of the credit would be made available to the Admini-
stration of the Territory, and on presentation of the necessary docu-
ments the Association would disburse 75% of the amount expended on the
sub-project.
11.       The wharf would be completed by June 30, 1971; and disburse-
ment is estimated to take place as follows:
1969/70    1970/71    Total
Ö_________US$ 000     Ö
IDA                      400        350       750
Government               200         47       247
Total               600        397       997
IV.  BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
12.       This wharf is required to handle the produce from the oil palm
development in the area, some 55,000 tons of palm oil and 5,000 tons of
kernels annually. In addition, it will serve the general needs of the
community, particularly the new government station at Kimbe.
13.       The economic rate of return of the wharf is calculated at 15%,
the estimated rate of return of the combined Phase I and Phase II oil palm
development projects. The rate of return takes no account of benefits
which will accrue from activities other than oil palm development.






ANNEX 5
PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT AND THE PAPUA AND
NEW GUINEA DEVELOPMENT BANK
A. Credit in PaPua/New Guinea
The Commercial Banks
1.        The monetary and banking system of Papua and New Guinea is, to
all intents and purposes, part of Australia's and there is no separate .
central bank. Following the British pattern, branches of Australian com-
mercial banks in the Territory receive funds on current and deposit account
and lend short-term, usually on overdraft. They have provided some develop-
ment finance to the agricultural sector but relatively short-term -- usually
for not more than five years and generally on the security of real estate.
Livestock mortgages (loans against security of livestock herds) are very
rarely accepted. The commercial banks also make regular short-term loans,
usually for less than one year, on the security of harvested crops or cattle
ready for market. Current commercial bank interest rates vary between
5-3/4% and 8%.
2.        In the Government submission to IDA, it was suggested that com-
mercial banks might lend long-term in the private sector and rediscount
their loans with a Government bank; Australian commercial banks however do
not customarily lend long-term and they are unwilling to change their pre-
sent policy. The Commonwealth Development Bank, financed by the Australian
Government, has made some longer-term loans in the private sector, but its
lending in the Territory is very small and it does not lend in the small-
holder sector. The 1963 Bank Economic Survey Mission recognized the need
for medium and long-term credit and recommended the organization of a fi-
nancing institution suited to the Territory.
Formation and Function of PNGDB
3.        The Papua and New Guinea Development Bank was formed in 1965 as
a body corporate under an Ordinance passed specially for the purpose, and
it was officially opened on July 6, 1967. PNGDB provides finance for primary
production (and for industry and commerce) vhich is "not otherwise avail-
able on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions" with "due regard to
the stability and balanced development of the Territory and the advancement
of the indigenous population".



ANNEX 5
Page 2
B. Control and Management
Board of Directors
4.        PNGDB is controlled by a Board of twelve comprising the Managing
Director, the Deputy Managing Director, the Territory Treasurer and nine
other members, of vhom not less than four must be residents of the Terri-
tory. The Board is appointed by the Australian Governor-GeneraL. The
Managing Director and his Deputy may be so appointed without reference to
other.members of the Board. While this is a powerful safeguard, specific-
ally introduced by the Australian Government to prevent misdirection of
PNGDB, its effect upon PNGDB autonomy would. need to be considered when the
Territory's political status is changed.  The present Board.includes an
Australian industrial consultant, two long-term Territory residents,. the
Chairman of the Melbourne Stock Exchange, a local solicitor, the Secretary
of.the Federation of Cooperatives (Papuan), a cocoa farmer (New Guinean.),
the Secretary of the Commonwealth Department of Territories and.the Vice-
Chancellor of the Australian National University.
Staff
5.        PNGDB is staffed by competent and experienced senior banking person-
nel, mostly seconded from Australian commercial and development banks.  It
has not yet recruited permanent technicala gricultural staff but has. tem-
porarily seconded personnel from the Territ.ory Department of Agriculture,.
Stock and Fisheries (DASF). PNGDB has recruited suitable subordinate staff
and foresees no difficulty in future recruitment required for the project.
C. Financing
Financing
6.        PNGDB is financed by equity capital in the form of interest free
non-repayable capital appropriations from the Territory budget (provided
indirectly by the Australian Government) and net profits will.be added to
a. general reserve available for further, Lending.  $A6.5 million had been
appropriated by the Government by June 1969. PNGDB has also taken over the
assets. of the Ex-Servicemen 's Fund (A$6.15 million) and the latfva Loan.
Fund (A$0.4 million). Additional funds required by PNGDB for pro'Ject lend-
ing would be provided.by Government fromr the proposed IDA credit and added
to PNGDB capital.  Since, in. its initial stages, PNGDB needs ta build up re-
serves, and since any increase in. PN ,D borrowing costa woui& need tQ be. fi-
nanced by Government at; least for a few more years, Government proposes to.
on-lend IDA, funds to PNGDB at 1-1/2%, the, cost to Government plus a small
margin. On. repayment by its borrowers., PNGDB vould. relend. the IDA. funds for
further agricultural purposes.  To encourage. PNGDB to build up reserves out



ANNEX 5
Page 3
of earnings, however, Government proposed to seek PNGDB repayment of its por-
tion of the IDA credit in 25 years. It would be a condition of an IDA credit
that net funds arising from repayment of project loans would be relent by
PNGDB or Government for agricultural development.
D. Leading Policy
Lending Policy
7.        The lending policy of PNGDB is based on ability of its borrowers
to repay from profitable production generated by investment. Loans may
be drawn by installments, and repayments are arranged to suit the partic-
ular circumstances of the enterprise. Thus grace periods can be allowed,
during which interest only is payable, with annual (or quarterly or half-
yearly) repayment installments expressed as a percentage of crop proceeds;
or a proportion of principal; or an equated annuity; in all cases related
to the generation of annual cash surpluses from the productive resources
financed. The present general PNGDB lending rate is 6%, the rate currently
charged by the Commonwealth Development Bank. PNGDB has taken over the
assets of the Native Loans Board and Ex-Servicemen's Credit Board, see
para 6, and now administers the loans made by Government at concessional
rates through the two Boards. The Government guarantees PNGDB against
any loss of capital arising from defaults in these portfolios.
E. Project Loan Procedures in the Private Sector
APplications
8.        PNGDB would normally receive applications for project loans in the
private sector (excluding smallholders) through the commercial banks. The
commercial banks have agreed to give every assistance to the project and
to provide PNGDB with their confidential assessment of the creditworthiness
and mnagerial capacity of potential borrowers who are their customers.
Appraisal
9.        PNGDB would appraise loan applications with its own field staff,
but would be able to call upon DASF for technical information and for an
opinion of the technical performance of applicants. Farm development plans
and financial projections would be attached to each application and would
be checked by PNGDB field staff (who would visit each applicant's property)
and by loan officers. -Many applicants in the private sector would be able
to prepare these details but would be encouraged to seek the assistance
of DASF staff.



ANEX 5
Page 4
Disbursement
10.       PNGDB would satisfy itself that borrowers had sufficient funds to
meet their proportion of agreed development expenditures and their working
capital requirements. In some cases, PNGDB would require deposit of these
funds by enforceable assurances.  Loan disbursement would be id,e either
by reimbursement of approved expenditures on production of satisfactory
evidence thereof, or by direct payment to suppliers on authenticated receipt
of agreed items.
Repayient
11.       Loan repayment in the private sector would normally be by stand-
ing order to pay the agreed interest and installments, drawn on the bor-
rower's bank. Failure to provide funds to meet these orders would be an
act of default under the loan agreement. PNGDB would seek orders on the
Copra Marketing Board to pay, directly to PNGDB, the proceeds of copra sold
for its coconut estate borrowers.
F. Project Loan Procedures for Smallholders,
Applications
12.       For smaliholder loans, PNGDB would rely upon DABF and the Lands
Board to select applicants according to agreed procedures. Provided PNGDB
clears the credit worthiness of the applicant, the final selection would
give a smallholder on the Oil Palm sub-project the automatic right to
borrow from PNGDB upon his acceptance of a loan agreement.
Disbursement
13.       For disbursement purposes, DASF would record for each smallholder,
and authenticate for PNGDB payment, the supply of -
(a) building materials, tools and local purchases, and
(b) planting material, goods and services provided by
Government, including a monthly cash allowance.
These expenditures would be in accordance with a standard sample budget
attached to every smallholder's loan agreement. The sample budget would
show the maximum amount each smallholder could borrow, and the loan
would be in the form of drawing rights up to this amount. PNGDB would pay
suppliers and DASF and debit the individual smallholder's account.
Repayment
14.       The standard smallholder loan would be for twelve years, includ-
ing five years' grace. Repayment would be made by deduction of up to half



ANNEX 5
Page 5
the proceeds of the borrower's crop.  Smallholders would be bound by the
loan agreement to deliver their fruit to Mosa Oil Mill Pty Ltd (Mosa), the
factory company in which Government and Harrisons and Crosfield (H&C) have
an equal interest. Mosa would enter into an amended agreement with PNGDB
that it would deduct up to half the.proceeds of each individual smallholder's
crop and pay them to PNGDB.
G. Loan Supervision
15.       PNGDB staff would supervise loans until repayment is completed.
In the case of the smallholder loans, P0GDB would rely mainly upon DASF
to advise when smallholders were falling behind in maintenance of their
plots or harvesting their crops.  It would, however, be for PNGDB to take
action against smallholders in default, which the loan agreement em-
powers it to do, by dispossessing them and reallocating their plots, if
necessary.
H. Accounts and Audit
16.       It is estimated that after making allowances for possible bad
debts and other provision, PNGDB would make a small profit in 1971 and elim-
inate the accumulated deficit by 1974.
17.       The accounting procedures and controls set up by PNGDB are satis-
factory and PNGDB'u annual accounts are audited by the Auditor-General for
the Commonwealth of Australia who is represented in the Territory. The
Auditor-General has a special section devoted to the auditing of the
accounts and records of banking institutions.
I. Conclusion
18.       PNGDB has adequate legal powers and is subject to the close scru-
tiny imposed by Australian banking law. It has established procedures
suitable for lending under the project. While it would not be practicable
to channel IDA funds through the commercial banks, a very satisfactory
relationship exists between PNGDB and the commercial banks which can be
relied upon to give responsible assessments of PNGDB loan applicants when
required.

MARKET PROSPECTS FOR PALM OIL AND PALM KERNELS
1..-      A paper on. the fa       oils sit        lius currently under pre-
,zparation within the Bank, and wil   eel  detail, inter alia, with the
'm&rket-prospects for palm oil and    m  ernels.  Progress on the paper
has reached the stage where it    possibre to draw some conclusions about
palm oil and palm kernels, + ich are set out' t.ow; while these conclusio         \
must be considered tent tfve pending the publication of the more general
paper, no major change-ae-anV-c4zaed.
Palm Oil
2.        Trends in supply and demand for individual fats and oils are far
more difficult to judge than those for the total market, particularly
since most of the major oil products are produced either as Joint products
or by-products. Thus, as in the case of soybeans, the production of;spe-
cific oils may be determined, not only by trends in the oils and fats mar-
ket, but also by the demand for the joint or related products. Another
feature which also has to be considered in reviewing the market for a
particular oil product is the amount of substitution possible between
different fats and oils. Within a broad range, on technical considerations,
one oil can be substituted for another. Currently, the bulk of palm oil
is used in the food industry.  Here it meets its strongest competition from
soybean, oil, and fish oil and lard. Fish oils are at a disadvantage com-
pared with palm oil, owing to the high processing costs involved in making
them usable for this purpose.
3.        Usually, the associated product of the marine and vegetable oils
is a protein-rich cake or meal. The oil palm, however, compared with some
of its competitors, produces a very low proportion of protein cake to oil,
and the cake is the by-product of palm kernel oil, rather than palm oil.
The overall ratio of palm and palm kernel oils to cake is about 9:1. In
comparison, the soybean produces oil to meal in the ratio of 1:4 in terms
of weight.
4.        Palm oil is produced almost entirely in four developing countries:
Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia and Malaysia. Table
I indicates the production situation in these and other countries in recent
years. Compared with other major fats and oils (Table 2) the growth rate
for world palm oil production has been low, up to recent years amounting
to only 1.3% per annum. The only really significant expansion took place
in Malaysia. However, in a number of countries, particularly Malaysia, a
considerable further expansion in production is planned for the future.
Some of these plans have already been put into operation. If these devel-
opments go according to achedule, total world production will amount to



ANNEX 6
Page 2
approximately 2.5 million tons between 1975 and 1980. This would repre-
sent a growth rate of slightly more than 5% between 1965-67 and 1980,
compared with a yearly rate of increase of 1.3% between 1954-56 and 1965-
67. The share of palm oil production on total fats and oils.production
would increase to approximately 5%, compared with about 3% in 1965-67.
5.        Many of the developments are export-oriented and a considerable
share of the additional supplies will have to be absorbed by the inter-
national market. Oil palm exports increased very slowly during the last
decade, largely owing to the slow growth in production rather than market-
ing difficulties. Actually, in the period from 1954-56 to 1965-67, palm
oil exports declined slightly (Table 3). It is estimated that by 1975
palm oil exports will amount to approximately 1.2 million tons, compared
with 550,000 tons in 1965-67. Consequently, the share of-palm oil exports
on total trade will probably increase to 9% in 1975, compared with 5.4%
in the earlier period.
6.        The palm oil economy thus faces two major problems in the future.
Firstly, it will have to face declining world market prices, a phenomenon
that is shared by nearly all major fats and oils. Secondly, it will have
to increase its share as an ingredient in the total usage of fats and oils.
Considering the fact that palm oil does not have all the quality charac-
teristics enjoyed by some of the other oils (e.g. coconut oil), this could
only be achieved through price declines larger than those expected for some
other oils.
7.        It is in food uses where palm oil will have to increase its mar-
ket share. In the past, this was only possible to a certain degree, mainly
because of limitation in availabilities. Among other factors, this ap-
parently prevented processors from undertaking the necessary reseach into
the technical and economic difficulties which would have to be overcome if
palm oil is to be incorporated as a major ingredient in food products.
One major difficulty, particularly at the relatively high palm oil prices
of the past, appears to have been the disposal at remunerative prices of
the inedible portion resulting from palm oil processing, which would make
large-scale processing feasible.
8.        The Chart (IBRD-4199) indicates that palm oil prices have gen-
erally followed the trend of all fats and oils prices, declining to a low
level in 1962 and experiencing a sharp fall after the high 1965 prices.
Of particular importance is the narrowing of the large price difference
between soybean oil and palm oil which prevailed in the 1950'E. Since
1963, prices for both products have moved closely together, which indi-
cates that their future fortunes will also be tightly knit.
9.        In the second half of 1968, palm oil prices dropped sharply
reaching a low point of approximately $140 per ton, compared-with $222
per ton in 1967. The steep decline was caused by large shipments of soy-
beans and soybean oil and unusually large exports of sunflower seed and
fish oil. This was a relatively short term situation and prices recovered
towards the end of 1968. The average for the whole of 1968 was $172 per



AKNEX 6
Page 3
ton and for the first ten months of 1969, the price averaged nearly $175
per ton.  In view of the large anticipated exports and the technical
difficulties mentioned previously, however, it is unlikely that they will
reach the 1967 levels.  Future prices have been estimated to fall by the
mid-1970's into a price range between $155-165 per m ton c.i.f. Europe.
10.       These projections have to be seen in the light of the uncertain-
ties which surround any price forecast and of fats and oils in particular.
For example, if soybean exports under P.L. 480 are reduced or cease al-
together without compensating changes in U.S. production policy, the above
price forecast may prove to be optimistic. On the other hand, if only
part of the large requirements that would be needed to meet the needs of
fat deficit developing countries could be turned into effective demand,
the forecast may be pessimistic.
Palm Kernels
11.       The fruits of the oil palm contain two separate sources of oil:
the fleshy and fibrous exocarp (pulp) from which palm oil is obtained and
a nut kernel in a hard shell from which palm kernel is extracted. The
pulp of the fruits deteriorates rapidly after harvest and extraction has
to be carried out in producing areas. Palm kernels, in contrast, deter-
iorate very slowly. Also, their processing into oils is a relatively more
complex operation. Extraction is, therefore, usually performed in large
crushing mills, mainly in the importing industrialized countries. Only
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have palm kernels have crushed
on a large scale and the country's exports consist almost entirely of oil,
rather than kernels.
12.       Wild palm fruits have a low proportion of pulp and a high pro-
portion of kernels. In plantations now in the process of development,
however, the ratio of pulp to kernel is expected to increase. Thus, the
future expansion in palm oil output will not be matched by a commensurate
increase in palm kernel oil output.
13.       Palm kernel oil, unlike palm oil, is a lauric oil and as such
closely resembles coconut oil. These types of oils are regarded in many
countries as a desirable ingredient of margarine and shortening, and for
use in confectionary and bakery products. Lauric oils also possess special
qualities which make them an essential constituent up to a certain minimum
in soap manufacture; they also have a wide variety of other industrial uses,
such as in the manufacture of synthetic detergents.
14.       All these factors account for a more inelastic demand greater
than for most other fats and oils. This became very apparent in 1967-68
when prices of nearly all major fats and oils decreased. Prices of lauric
oils, including palm kernel oil, remained high, mostly because of short
supplies, but also because of the limited degree of substitutability.
Presently, there are some indications that new industrial processes will
make it possible to produce synthetically the special component of the
lauric acid oils which are the cause of the inelastic demand. This, of



AM=X 6
Page 4-
course, would limit the special role theme oils play in the market. How-
ever, so far no definite information is available which indicates that
industrial manufacture of lauric oils vill be undertaken on a large scale.
15.       The price, production and trade situation for palm kernels and
palm kernel oil are indicated in the Chart and Table 4. It is assumed
that palm kernel oil, in line with other fats and oils, will follow a
downward trend in the future, and it is estimated that a price range of
$134-138 per m ton for palm kernels will prevail in the mid-1970's.

ANNEX 7
PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
OIL PALM SMALLHOLDER FFB PURCHASE PRICE FORMULA
The basic principles to be followed by the Mosa Oil Mill Pty and
the Government to formulate the purchase price for fresh fruit bunch pay-
able by the Mosa Oil Mill Pty to the smallholders would be as follows:
(a) Each calendar month, the Government would gazette a local
fob equivalent of the European main port cif price for
palm oil and palm kernels as of an agreed date in the
preceding month, less agreed freight, insurance, commis-
sions, normal wastage and overseas port rates.
(b) An agreed deduction would be made for wharf handling
charges and for running the Mosa Oil Pty's oil pumping
and storage facilities at the wharf to determine the
"in-tank" value of palm oil and the "in-store" value
of palm kernels.
(c) To cover the cost of financing bulk storage, a deduction
of three month's simple interest at 0.5% per annum over
the Mosa Oil Mill Pty's bankers' current lending rate on
commercial advances would be allowed on the said "in-tank"
and "in-store" values of oil and kernels.
(d) An agreed deduction would be made for transportation of
palm oil and palm kernels from factory to wharf and for
bulk handling, bagging, handling and storage of palm
kernels to determine the factory tank value of palm oil
and the factory store value of naked palm kernels.
(e) The ex-factory value of the derivatives of a ton of small-
holders' fresh fruit bunch would be derived from the factory
tank value of palm oil and the factory store value of naked
palm kernels by:
(i)  first, deducting an agreed amount, per ton of
palm oil and per ton of naked palm kernels, in
lieu of profit, depreciation and working capital
charges and standard company tax;
(ii) second, deducting any levies, ceases, export or
other charges or duties imposed by any taxing
authority of the Government, other than standard
company tax; and then

the basis of monthly 4%wrctory tests satisfactory
to the -Government.
(f)  The purchase wrice of -fresh .rxift bunch payable by the

factory -value of the derivattiyes of a ton of smaIlholiders'
