PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ALGERIA - SNMC EXPANSION PROJECT
(LOAN 1185-AL)
PREFACE
This report covers the SNMC Expansion project supported by Loan
1185-AL. The Loan was made to the Societe Nationale des Materiaux de
Construction (SNMC), the state enterprise for building materials in Algeria.
Part of the Loan was onlent by SNMC to the Societe Nationale de Comptabilite
(SNC), the state accounting and auditing firm. The Loan of US$46 million was
approved in December 1975 and became effective 6 months after approval. It
formed the Bank's first direct industrial operation in Algeria since lending to
the country was resumed in FY 1973. The Loan was closed in December 1981, when
US$ 18.1 million or 39% was cancelled.
The project under review consisted of 3 main components: (a) erection
of a new 500,000 tpy cement plant near Saida away from the coast in the rural
south; (b) strengthing of distribution planning and facilities for building
materials in Algeria; and (c) a technical assistance program to SNC. The Bank
Loan financed civil works (US$7.1 million) and equipment and services (US$20.8
million).
The project completion report was prepared by the Industry Department of
the Bank based on desk research of project data available in the Bank. No
comments were received from the Borrower.
This project was not audited by the Operations Evaluation Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ALGERIA - SNMC EXPANSION PROJECT
(LOAN 1185-AL)
HIGHLIGHTS
The main objective of the SNMC expansion project was its institution
building effect on the building materials industry in Algeria. The project
would assist SNMC in addressing organizational and financial problems created by
an ambitious investment program which aimed at making Algeria self-sufficient in
cement and other building materials during the 1970s. It would help SNMC meet
its production and distribution targets as well as maintain financial discipline
and cost control. Concerning the overall SNMC company, the project was geared
to improving the company in three critical areas: (a) financial structure: to
set SNMC on a sound financial basis and to establish SNMC as a financially
self-contained enterprise; (b) accounting, financial planning and auditing; and
(c) distribution planning and facilities.
The project has not met its institutional objectives regarding SNMC.
SNMC's financial situation did not improve during project implementation and
SNMC still incurred heavy losses by the early 1980s and was in a poor financial
position. The Algerian Government undertook steps on several occasions to
improve SNMC's financial situation including price increases and financial
restructing measures that, however, did not lead to substantial improvements.
As a result, the compay did not meet the agreed financial covenants. The main
reasons for the company's poor financial performance are inherent to the
environment under which state enterprises operated in Algeria during the 1970s
and early 1980s, including insufficient price levels, a lack of incentives and
financial discipline, financing of investments primarily with debt, and lack of
financial planning and control systems.
Concerning SNMC's financial and accounting organization, the project's
impact has been below expectation due to the weak underlying financial and
management systems of SNMC and the limited progress of the program implemented
by SNC, the state acvounting firm, to address these weaknesses. Furthermore,
the distribution component of the project's institutional package for SNMC,
which included both studies for distribution planning and distribution hardware,
was not implemented. Finally, the dialogue between the Bank and the SNMC on
further cement capacity expansion as foreseen under the project was very
limited.
The construction of a new 500,000 tpy dry-process cement plant near
Saida formed the largest single project component. The plant was implemented
under a turn-key contract with a Japanese equipment supplier, with ciVil works
construction carried out by a local firm. Construction of the plant took almost
40 months from the start of civil works until mechanical completion as against
23 months foreseen at appraisal, and cement production started in January 1979,
11 months behind schedule, but ahead of the full completion of the plant. The



(v)
main change in project scope was that the rail way link of the plant with the
main rail network was not implemented. The longer than expected implementation
period was almost solely caused by delays in civil works due to the poor
performance of the local civil works contractor.
The final cost overrun of fixed plant costs (excluding the railway
link) is estimated at 12%, mostly due to overruns in civil works and training
and technical assistance. Financing of the project was secured by the Bank
loan, a Japanese supplier's credit and local financing. Local funds financed
the cost overrun and were partly provided in the form of short-term bank
overdrafts. Technical performance of the cement plant has been quite
satisfactory, but cement production has been below appraisal estimates, due to
(a) insufficient regional cement demand in the west of the country; (b) lack of
qualified staff to operate the plant; and (c) lack of an adequate transportation
link to evacuate the plant's production. The staffing constraint in the plant
is partly alleviated by a technical assistance contract with the Japanese
turn-key contractor. Financial perfcrmance of the plant is estimated to be
substantially below expectations as a result of the combined effects of
insufficient capacity utilization, inadequate cement prices and the increased
capital cost. It is therefore estimated that the financial rate of return which
was already very low at appraisal (3.7%) has become negative. In much the same
way, the economic rate of return is now estimated at about 5%, down from the
appraisal estimate of 10.3%.
The third major component of the project, the SNC technical assistance
program was geared to improving the general standard of accounting, budgeting
and cost control in Algerian state enterprises, including SNMC, by developing
SNC's capabilities in external auditing, modern management accounting techniques
and implementing basic accounting systems. The program has not met these
objectives. Its implementation suffered from a number of problems, including:
lack of sufficient SNC staff caused by unattractive working conditions,
management problems, and insufficient SNC clientele. These conditions seem to
be related to the uncertainty of SNC's position in Algeria, which was never
clearly established as the main institution to lead the Algerian accounting and
auditing profession. Furthermore, in retrospect, the program was focussed too
much on strengthening SNC's audit capabilities rather than on consultancy work
to strengthen basic financial and accounting systems in Algerian state
enterprises.
Disbursement of the US$46 million Bank Loan amounted to US$27.9
million, with remaining US$18.1 million cancelled by December 31, 1981. Apart
from the amount for the cement plant railway link (USA$6.8 million), US$8.9
million designated for the development of SNMC's distribution systems, and
US$2.4 million for the SNC technical assistance program were cancelled.
In conclusion, the main objective of the project, namely institution
building in the Algerian building matertal industry, has not been achieved.  In
retrospect, SNMC was not the right vehicle for achieving organizational and
financing strengthening in the Algerian state enterprise system. It now seems



(vi)
that this objective should have been dealt with on a broader level, possibly
through an analysis of the public enterprise system to improve efficiency and
incentives, followed at a later stage by the implementation of specific measures
at the enterprise level. One of the main lessons for similar projects is
therefore that it should be clear at the outset whether the project entity in
question provides the right vehicle for ac1teving the project objectives,
particularly when it concerns public enterprises that operate under close
Government supervision. Therefore, the environment in which the enterprise
functions should be carefully analyzed to determine whether improvements can be
achieved through measures at the enterprise level or if intervention at a
broader level is required. Furthermore, the project left too many studies,
which were to be carried out in preparation of further measures under the
project, rather ill-defined at project appraisal. Most of these studies were
not undertaken or were much delayed. Therefore, to avoid delays in project
implementation, such studies should be identified early on in project
preparation and be carried out along with overall project preparation and
appraisal. Finally, poor working conditions (salaries, housing, etc.) proved to
be a serious problem for implementing both the cement plant and the SNC
technical assistance program. In future projects, it should therefore be ensured
that working conditions for project staff are adequate.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ALGERIA - SNMC EXPANSION REPORT
(LOAN 1185-AL)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the SNMC Expansion Project supported by Loan
1185-AL. The Loan was made to the Societe Nationale des Hateriaux de Construc-
tion (SNMC), the state enterprise for building materials in Algeria. The Bank
loan of US$46 million to SNK  would help finance:  (a) part of the ongoing
expansion of SNMC through erection of a new 500,000 tons per year (tpy) cement
plant near Saida away from the coast in the rural south; (b) the expansion of
the company's distribution network; and (c) a technical assistance program to
the Societe Nationale de Comptabilite (SNC), the state accounting and auditing
company.
1.02      The Loan formed the Bank's first direct industrial operation to
Algeria since lending to the country was resumed in FY 1973. The loan which
financed civil works, equipment, and consulting services, was appraised in April
and July 1975, approved in December 1975 and became effective in June 1976.
Eleven supervision missions visited the project during 1976-81. The loan was
closed in December 1981, when US$18.1 or 39Z of the loan was cancelled.
1.03      The report is based on desk research of project data available in the
Bank. Since the preparation of the report has not been accompanied by a project
completion mission to Algeria, some of the information and data normally includ-
ed in a project completion report were not available or have been included in
lesser detail. Furthermore, information on which the report is based is not
fully up-to-date as the last supervision mission visited Algeria in mid-1981 and
progress reports have not been received since then.
1.04      The report treats the three major components of the project
separately. Chapter II deals with the institution building aspects of SNMC as a
whole, Chapter III reviews the implementation of the Saida cement plant, and
Chapter IV addresses the SNC technical assistance program. Finally, the Bank's
role in the project, main conclusions, and major lessons to be learned for
similar projects are summarized in Chapter V.
II. SNMC - THE BORROWER
A.        Company Background
2.01      SNMC was established in 1968 as a state enterprise to promote the
development of the Algerian building materials industry and to manufacture,
import and distribute a wide range of building materials. At the time of
appraisal, the company included some 70 enterprises with employment of about
15,000, and accounted for more than 65Z of production in the building materials
industry (with a monopoly in cement). Industrial state enterprises, such as
SNMC, operate under the close supervision and guidance of the Government, which
defines corporate strategy, appoints senior personnel, formulates investment
programs, sets prices for products and controls the financing of such
enterprises through the provision of funds from Government-owned banks and by
the collection of surplus funds for reinvestment in the economy.l/ SNGC's
management efforts were dominated by the need to meet time schedules and fulfill
production and investment targets.
/ For a broader treatment of the Algerian state enterprise system, see Report
No. 2981-AL: Algeria-Enterprise Financing and the Banking System,
September 1980.



- 2 -
2.02      At the time of appraisal, SNMC was not a financially viable
enterprise. While sales increased rapidly, the company incurred heavy losses
which reached 27% of sales in 1974. This was largely due to low prices which
had not been adjusted frequently to reflect increasing operating costs and
higher prices of comparable imports, and the financing of cash short-falls by
short-term debt. Furthermore, the company's financial organization lacked im-
portant management tools such as proper budgeting, cost control and financial
planning systems. Also, SNMC's accounts were not audited in accordance with
Bank's standards. The company's liquidity problem did not have a serious impact
on its operations as it had unlimited access to further credits through the
banking system. However, such a system does not promote financial independence
and discipline or the optimal allocation of resources.
B.        Project Objectives for Restructuring
2.03      The main objective of the SNMC expansion project was its institution
building effect on the building materials industry in Algeria. The project
would assist SNMC in addressing organizational and financial problems created by
an ambitious investment program which aimed at making Algeria self-sufficient in
cement and other building materials during the 1970s. It would help SNMC meet
its production and distribution targets as well as maintain financial discipline
and cost control.  Concerning the overall SNMC company, the project was geared
to improving the company in three critical areas: (i) financial structure: to
set SNMC on a sound financial basis and to establish SNMC as a financially
self-contained enterprise independent of subsidies in the long run; (ii)
accounting, financial planning and auditing; and (iii) distribution planning and
facilities.
2.04      To establish SNMC on a sound long-term financial basis, the Government
and the company agreed to implement the following measures: (i) an anuual re-
view and setting of prices of all SNMC's products so that these would cover unit
costs and debt service associated with the products; (ii) SNMC would meet
certain financial covenants, including a debt service coverage of 1.1, and the
maintenance of sufficient current assets to meet current liabilities as they
fell due; and (iii) the Government would refinance SNMC's losses through
December 1975. To supplement the above measures and to improve SNMC's financial
systems, the project included a provision for strengthening SNMC's accounting,
financial planning and auditing. SNGC therefore agreed to furnish to the Bank
for comment and to implement thereafter: (i) a plan for strengthening of its
general accounting and financial planning systems (to be submitted by end 1976);
(ii) a plan for improvement of its cost accounting capability (to be submitted
by end 1977); and (iii) a plan for strengthening budgeting and cost control by              a
cost centre (to be submitted before the end of 1978). Furthermore, SNMC agreed
to have its accounts examined by an independent audit firm. SNC, the state
auditing and accounting firm, would carry out such audits. As part of the
project, SNC staff was trained to perform audits consistent with Bank
requirements (para 4.02).
2.05      The third major institutional measure concerned the improvement in
SNMC's distribution planning and facilities, which had become vital due to the
rapid expansion of SNMC's production by the mid-1970s. To assist SNMC in this
respect the Bank loan provided US$1 million for the financing of consulting
services to carry out several studies, including (i) a study to determine the



-3-
location and operating characteristics of SNMC's distribution facilities; (ii) a
detailed survey of SNMC's requirements for transportation equipment and
maintenance facilities; and (iii) a study on the development of an integrated
national production-transport-distribution system for cement. SNMC would
present to the Bank a detailed program of the studies by March 1976. In
addition to these studies, the Bank Loan would finance transport equipment to
help alleviate the cement transport problem in Algeria. US$8.1 million of the
Loan was earmarked for the purchase by SNMC of some 150 railway silo-wagons and
90 trucks. Financing for the remainder of the trucks and wagons, and for
related maintenance equipment and facilities would be provided through the
Government.
2.06      In addition to the above measures, the project provided for a dialogue
between SNHC and the Bank on further expansion plans in cement with a view to
alleviating expected cement supply/demand imbalances in the country. In this
regard, SNMC agreed to prepare by 1978 a detailed cement market study for
discussion with the Bank. Furthermore, SNMC would consult with the Bank on
preparatory studies for any new cement projects.
C.        Project Execution and Results
2.07      As described above, financial rehabilitation of SNHC was one of the
main objectives of the project. Judging from the actual financial result6 this
objective was not achieved. Annex 1 contains the financial statements of SNMC
during the implementation of the project, of which some selected indicators are
given below.

Debt Service Coverage              neg.   neg.   neg.   neg.   0.16   0.23   0.31
As shown, SNMC's financial situation has not improved during 1974-80, and SNMC
still incurred huge losses by 1980 (DA 800 million or 32% of sales) and was in a
poor financial situation.
2.08.     The Government on its part has taken steps on several occasions to
*         alleviate SNMC's financial situation.  Government-controlled prices of cement
and other building materials were raised on several occasions,2/ but remained
inadequate to meet costs and were below import prices of comparable products in
many cases.3/ Furthermore, the Government approved quite important financial
restructuring measures to restore SNMC's financial health. In 1976, the
Government introduced the framework for such restructuring which was geared to
establishing a sound financial basis for the state enterprises and which
2/ Cement prices were raised in 1976 and 1979 by 40%.
3/ In 1979, the Bank proposed a new system of cement pricing whereby prices
would be based on operating costs of plants operating at 80% of capacity
with a provision for price increases following increases in the elements of
operating costs. Such a pricing system would therefore cover operating
costs and remunerate efficient plants.



- 4 -
included three types of measures: (i) financial rehabilitation, including price
increases, rescheduling of existing loans, and loans for past losses; (ii)
financing of permanent working capital by medium and long-term loans; and (iii)
financing of start-up losses of new plants by medium and long-term loans. For
SNMC, the Government approved such restructuring measures in 1976-for a total of
DA 4.1 billion (conversion of short term overdrafts into long-term loans, and
rescheduling if other debt) and in 1979 for a total of DA 6.0 billion (including
conversion of short-term and long-term debt into equity and rescheduling of debt
to cover past losses, infrastructure and training costs and interest during
construction on new projects). However, as is evident from SNMC's financial
results, these restructuring measures did not lead to an improved financial
situation of SNMC. Both the Government and the company therefore did not meet
the agreed financial covenants on pricing, debt service coverage and current
ratio (para 2.04).
2.09      The main reasons for the company's poor financial performance are
inherent to the environment under which state enterprises operated in Algeria
during the 1970s and early 1980s. Apart from the insufficient price levels dis-
cussed above, such reasons included: (i) insufficient incentives for efficiency
improvements due to lack of competition and the heavy organization structures of
the enterprises, resulting in underutilization of installed production capaci-
ties; (ii) financing of investments primarily with debt, (iii) lack of financial
discipline due to an easy access to short term bank credits; and (iv) lack of
financial planning and control systems.
2.10      Concerning SNMC's financial and accounting organization (para 2.04),
the project's impact has been below expectations. Following the start of the
SNC technical assistance program in September 1977 (para 4.06), a SNC team under
supervision of its consultants, started to analyze SNMC's financial and account-
ing systems in order to carry out an audit of SNMC's accounts and to improve
SNMC's systems. Based on this analysis it was determined that SNMC's underlying
financial and management systems were too weak to be used as a basis for cost
accounting, budgeting and control systems. Therefore, in July 1978, SNC and
SNMC agreed on a program to improve these underlying systems and designed a
pilot project in SNMC's brick operations. This pilot project was executed
between the end of 1978 and the suspension of the contract between SNC and its
consultants in May 1981 (para 4.06). Even after this period not all the basic
systems were operational under the pilot project, and other sectors (e.g.
cement) had not been covered. Furthermore, the more sophisticated planning and
control systems foreseen under the project had not been implemented. Also,
because of the unreliable accounting system of SNMC, SNC did not carry out full
audits of SNMC's books as foreseen under the project, and SNMC stopped its audit
contract with SNC in 1980.
2.11      The distribution component of the project's institutional package for
SNMC (para 2.05) was not implemented and the US$9.1 million of the Bank loan
allocated for studies and equipment was cancelled. On several occasions, the
Bank discussed possible terms of reference for distribution studies with SNMC
but these were not finalized. SNMC's distribution problem became very pressing
in the late 1970s when an oversupply capacity of cement developed in the west of
the country while the east remained a deficit area (para 3.20). Following this
development, SNMC started the implementation of a distribution program including



the purchase of trucks and the construction of depots.  The Bank offered to
finance part of this program, but since SNMC did not follow Bank procurement
procedures, the Bank loan could not be used.
2.12      Finally, the dialogue between the Bank and SNNC on further cement
capacity expansion as foreseen under the project (para 2.06) was very limited.
In the context of supervision missions, SNGC's expansion plans were discussed in
general, but the Bank was not consulted on the development of 2 cement plants
(Bouira and El Asnam), and the cement market study to be prepared by SNNC in
1978 was not received by the Bank.
2.13      In the context of the project and sector work in Algeria, the Bank
discussed on many occasions possible reforms in the state enterprise system to
improve financial performance, efficiency and resource allocation. The fact
that the rather far reaching financial restructuring measures undertaken by the
Government on various occasions (para 2.08) did not improve SNMC's financial
position indicates that more drastic measures were required to reform the
system. In this respect, the Bank discussed with the Algerians the possibility
of splitting SNMC in smaller operating companies with a greater degree of
autonomy in their day-to-day operations. A committee for reorganization of
state enterprises in Algeria was also studying such reorganization. It was
learned that the Government decided in 1982 to restructure SNMC as a pilot
project under such reorganization by establishing regional enterprises
specialized in particular building materials. This decision foresaw the
establishment of 4 regional enterprises for ceramic products, 3 enterprises for
bricks and tiles, 4 enterprises for "hydraulic binders" (e.g. cement and lime),
and an enterprise for research and development that would be responsible for
project implementation also. Furthermore, the production of other building
materials would be reorganized and decentralized. These restructuring measures,
which are in line with the project's overall objectives, would be finalized by
the end of 1983.
III. SAIDA CEMENT PLANT
A.        Background, Objectives and Description
3.01      The largest single project component was the construction of a new
500,000 tpy dry-process cement plant near Saida to produce ordinary portland
cement and some special cement types. The plant formed part of the plans for
expansion of Algerian cement production capacity from about 1.6 million tons in
1975 to 7.5 million tons in 1978 under the Algerian Four-Year Plan (1974-77).
*        It also was an important component of the Special Development Program (1972-75)
for the Plateau Region, which aimed at fostering industry in Algeria's less
developed regions away from the coastal strip.
3.02      The plant was implemented under a turn-key contract and includes fully
integrated cement producing equipment including a kiln with a capacity of 1,500
tons per day (tpd) of clinker as well as other auxiliary installations,
workshops, laboratory and administration and social buildings. Dry process
technology was chosen because of its low fuel consumption. The plant is fully
automated, includes ample security margins in all but the kiln and cement
grinding departments, and its capacity can be doubled with a minimum of new
equipment and infrastructure. The project scope included the construction of



- 6 -
roads connecting the quarries (para 3.03) and the plant site and a 25 km railway
link to the main rail network. Finally, the plant was designed to meet
anti-pollutiou standards in line with requirements in West European countries.
3.03      Geological investigations had confirmed the availability of sufficient
reserves of limestone, clay and sandstone to operate the plant for more than 50
years. Limestone reserves and the clay deposit are about 1.5 km and 35 km
respectively from the plant site. Other additives are quarried by SNMC,
purchased locally or imported.
B.        Project Implementation
3.04      The project was implemented under a turn-key contract with a Japanese
equipment supplier and with a minimum involvement of SNMC technical staff.  The
turnkey contract included detailed engineering, supervision of civil works,
supply and erection of equipment, commissioning and training. Although the
turnkey contract did not include construction of civil works, detailed design
and site supervision for civil works were included. During the planning and
preliminary design stage, SNMC was assisted by a French consulting firm which
was responsible for comprehensive project design, preparation of specifications
and bidding documents, assistance in bid evaluation and contract negotiations.
During project implementation, the French firm provided assistance under a
technical assistance contract with SNNC, including checking of equipment design,
control of civil works drawings, supervision assistance of construction and
start-up assistance. Civil works were carried out by an Algerian construction
firm (SNHC's construction subsidiary) which was linked to a Belgian civil
contractor through a technical assistance contract.
3.05      Project management by SNMC was carried out by an Algerian mining
engineer who was responsible for overall project supervision until start-up.
Limited control was exercised by SNMC's engineering/development and production
departments due to the heavy workload of SNMC's technical staff in contracting
and starting up new plants and in ongoing operations of existing plants.
Limited cost control by SNMC probably contributed to civil works cost overruns
(para 3.13). Cost control in other areas was less critical because the turnkey
contract was fixed price. SNMC's main responsibilities during project
implementation included construction of off-site infrastructure (roads and
railway link), provision for power and gas supply, and contracting and execution
of civil works (excluding engineering and supervision which remained with the
turn-key contractor) and housing.
3.06      Construction of the plant took about 40 months from the start of civil
works until mechanical completion, as against 23 months foreseen at appraisal.
Further delays were experienced in finishing the workshops, administrative and
social buildings, and housing. Cement production started in January 1979, 11
months behind schedule, but ahead of the full completion of the plant. As the
main deviation from the original project scope, the railway link to the main
rail network was not implemented (para 3.11). The actual implementation
schedule compared with appraisal estimate is given in Annex 2 and is summarized
below.

3.07      The longer than expected project implementation was almost solely
caused by delays in civil works which amounted to 21 months (excluding some
support facilities and housing for which delays were longer). This was caused
in part by delays in finalizing contracts between SNMC and the local civil works
contractor, and between the local contractor and the Belgian firm for technical
assistance, but mainly by the lack of qualified Algerian personnel to manage
the works, inadequate site organization, and poor maintenance of construction
equipment, which problem was aggravated by the wide variety of equipment used by
the local contractor. These problems were compounded by the remoteness of the
site and the need to train a labor force with a mostly agricultural background.
The staff shortcomings were partly compensated by close site supervision of the
turn-key contractor. Furthermore, the turn-key contractor minimized delays in
erection by preassembling equipment. In order to avoid fu-ther delays in
start-up of the plant, SNMC decided in 1977 to phase the completion of the
plant, to allow an early start-up of clinker production facilities (November
1978), to be followed at later stages by cement grinding facilities (January
1979) and cement silos (June 1979). Such phased completion is quite a normal
occurrence for cement projects. Although cement production started in January
1979, final tests were not yet finished by mid-1981 and the definitive
handing-over of the plant was expected by September 1981, almost 3 years after
the firing of the kiln.
3.08      Procurement procedures for the Saida plant were initiated in November,
1973, when turnkey offers were invited. The turnkey approach, although normally
more costly than a package-by-package procurement approach, was believed to be
more appropriate in the Algerian context because it placed the responsibility
for achievement of completion dates, performance guarantees and costs on a



single contractor, and thus minimized the need for scarce qualified SNMC
technical staff. Following pre-qualification and international competitive
bidding (ICB) including two-stage bidding (technical and financial separate), in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines, a Japanese firm was chosen as the lowest
among two bids and a contract signed by April 1975 (i.e. before Bank appraisal
of the project). Under the contract, the Japanese firm would provide major
equipment items, but about 35% of the contract value would be supplied by
non-Japanese subcontractors.
3.09      Initially, SNMC invited bids for the turn-key contract on the basis of
performance specifications with a minimum of preparatory work, instead of
detailed tender documents. As it did not receive offers from suppliers on this
basis, the company hired French consultants to prepare plant design and
procurement documents. This firm also assisted SNMC in evaluating offers and
negotiating the turn-key contract. Therefore, SNMC lost time in proceeding
initially with bidding documents based on insufficient project preparation.
3.10      Procurement of civil works (excluding civil engineering and
construction supervision) was based on ICB procedures without prequalification
to meet the tight deadline of the turn-key contract. Due to limited advertising
as a consequence of Algerian procurement procedures, only 2 bids were received,
both from Algerian contractors, of which one was from SNMC's own construction
subsidiary. Bid evaluation was carried out by SNMC and its French consultant
and the Bank reviewed bidding documents and bid evaluation. SNMC's construction
subsidiary was selected as the low bidder. The contractor would execute the
works with technical assistance from a well-known Belgian civil works contractor
which included secondment of Belgian personnel to the plant construction site.
Due to delay in civil works procurement, start-up of civil works was about 3
months delayed from the initial schedule. Finally, the civil works contract was
only signed in October 1976, although the works had already started in March
1976.
3.11      Procurement for the railway link of the plant was initiated in March
1976, following the preparation of design and bidding documents by a French
consulting firm. Response was inadequate due to limited advertising, and
procedures had to be restarted later in 1976. Consequently, SNMC was slow in
bid evaluation so that initial bids were no longer valid. More importantly,
from 1978, SNMC claimed that it was not responsible for execution of off-site
infrastructure such as the rail link, but rather the Government. However, with-
in the Government, responsibility was contested between various Ministries, as a
result of which work on the rail link was not started. Due to the expected high
cost for the rail link, the Bank suggested from 1978 onwards to compare the
execution of a rail connection with a road. Such a study was not undertaken,
and, as a result, by 1981 the plant was lacking a proper connection to the main
road or rail network, which is expected to affect the performance of the plant
(para 3.23).
C.        Capital Costs, Financing and Bank Loan
3.12      The initial capital costs for the Saida plant were already on the high
side with fixed assets about 58% higher per annual ton of cement produced than
comparable plants. The reason for the high capital costs included: (i) built-
in overcapacity and excessive safety margins; (ii) capital intensive design
features such as a high degree of automation; (iii) guarantee requirements and



-9-
penalties exceeding the international norm; (iv) a premium paid for plant imple-
mentation under the turnkey contract rather than by separate package contract-
ing; and (v) the general Algerian procurement climate (difficult working
conditions and administrative red tape) which induced high priced offers so that
the normal cost-reducing effect of ICB was not realized. The Bank discussed
these high capital costs in great detail with SNMC, including studies comparing
costs of Algerian cement plants with foreign plants and recommending possible
cost reductions. Nevertheless, the Bank impact was very limited in this respect
and the Bank's comments on plant design, in particular over-capacities and high
capital costs, were not implemented by SNMC.
3.13      Due to the lack of reporting of SNMC on the Saida plant project and
the unavailability of detailed updated costs of the plant to supervision
missions, no final capital costs for the project are available to the Bank.
Nevertheless, based on information obtained by various supervision missions, the
capital costs of the project have been estimated and are given in Annex 3. For
the fixed plant cost, the cost overruns by main items can be summarized as
follows:

a/ Excluding railway link which was not executed.
3.14      The main reason for the 12% overrun of fixed plant costs are related
to civil works and training and technical assistance. The civil works overrun
was due to the poor performance of the local civil works contractor as explained
above (para 3.07). A proper evaluation of this overrun was never provided to
the Bank, despite several requests. The increased costs for training and



- 10 -
technical assistance reflect the substantially higher costs than foreseen for
start-up and operating assistance which was required because of delays in
recruitment and training of SNMC staff and a lack of qualified plant personnel
(para 3.21). If the railway link, which was not implemented, would have been
included, the overrun of fixed plant costs are estimated to increase to about
28% (Annex 3), which could be reduced if a road connection would be constructed
instead.
3.15      Financing of the project was secured by the Bank Loan, a Japanese
supplier's credit snd local financing. Based on the estimated capital costs of
the cement plant as shown in Annex 3, the financing of the plant was as follows:

The supplier's cre it was part of the turn-key contract, and covered 70% of the
contract's foreè.6a exchange cost. The local loans cover the balance of the
financing reguifrements. In 1976, the Algerian Development Bank authorized a
loan of DAA3O97 million for the project, for a period of 16 years including 4
years of grace and at interest of 5.5% per year. The availability of remaining
local fund's (about DA 54 million) has not posed a problem although at least part
of it has probably been obtained as short term debt in line with the practice in
Algeria of financing fixed investments through banks' overdraft facilities.
3.16      The Bank Loan financed:  (i) the remaining 30% of the foreign exchange
cost of the turnkey contract; (ii) a portion of the foreign exchange cost
(direct and indirect) of civil works; (iii) the foreign exchange costs of the
French consulting firm that carried out engineering supervision; and (iv)
operational technical assistance by the Japanese turn-key contractor (para
3.22). About US$ 25.7 million was disbursed for the Saida plant under the Bank
loan as compared to an appraisal estimate of US$30.8 million. The difference
was mainly accounted for by the cancellation of US$6.8 million that had been
allocated for financing materials and supplies for construction of the railway
link (para 3.11).

3.17      Overall, the disbursement of the US$46 million Bank loan for the SNMC
expansion project amounted to US$27.9 million, with the remaining US$18.1
million cancelled by December 31, 1981.  Apart from the cancelled amount for the
railway link (para 3.16), US$8.9 million designated for the development of
SNMC's distribution systems (para 2.05), and US$2.4 million for the SNC
technical assistance program (para 4.02) were cancelled.  Annexes 4 and 5 give
details on disbursement of the Bank loan by project category, and over time,
respectively.
D.        Early Operations and Training
3.18      As indicated above, clinker production started in November, 1978,
2 months ahead of cement grinding facilities, which started in January 1979, 11
months behind schedule. Actual cement production of the Saida plant as compared
to appraisal estimates was as follows.

a!  Estimate based on first 5 months production.
3.19      Ovherall, technical performance of the cement plant is quite satisfac-
tory. However, cement production has been far below appraisal expectations.
The main reason for this poor performance are: (i) insufficient regional cement
demand in the west of the country where a cement supply surplus exists; (ii)
lack of qualified staff to operate the plant; and (iii) lack of an adequate
transportation link for evacuation of the plant production.
3.20      Concerning the cement market for the Saida plant, cement production
and consumption in Algeria have not developed as foreseen at appraisal, as can
be seen in the following table. Furthermore, due to an imbalanced development
of cement production capacity, Algeria now has a serious excess of supply capa-
city in the western part of the country where the Saida plant is also located,
while a supply deficit exists in the east. As a result, and because of a lack
of a proper transport and distribution system for building materials in Algeria,
cement plants in the west are operating far below capacity, while in the eastern
part of the country cement is imported. The project included an important com-
ponent to develop SNMC's distribution planning and facilities which could have
addressed this problem of capacity imbalance. As described above, this com-
ponent was not implemented (para 2.11). Furthermore, the dialogue between the
Bank and SNMC on cement capacity expansion to alleviate some of these im-
balances, as foreseen under the project, did not materialize (para. 2.12).

meet projected cement demant on the high plateau around Saida and in the
Southern desert where it does not compete with any other cement plant.
Source: Cembureau statistics for actua'ls.
3.21      The staffing constraint of the Saida plaut concerns the lack of quali-
fied higher level staff. Overall, the olant is overstaffed with about 500
persons recruited by 1980, as compared to a requirement of 240 persons estimated
at appraisal. At higher levels, however, staff is underqualified and crucial
positions, both in production and maintenance, were still vacant by that year.
Recruitment of qualified personnel is difficult due to the lack of housing
facilities, generally poor living conditions in Saida and low salaries.
Construction of housing was far behind schedule. Apart from difficult working
conditions in Saida, the main reason for the staffing problem was the long
delay by SNMC to initiate recruitment and training of higher level personnel for
the Saida plant, which SNMC only started by the early 1978, some 2 years behind
schedule.
3.22      To compensate for these staffing constraints, SNMC signed a 5-year
technical assistance contract in 1979 with the Japanese turn-key contractor for
the training of personnel and operation and maintenance of the plant, which
assistance was partly financed by the Bank loan. The involvement of the
contractor is satisfactory as far as operation and maintenance of the plant are
concerned. However, transfer of technology was hampered by the lack of
qualified Algerian counterparts, and language problems with the Japanese.



- 13 -
Furthermore, the electrical equipment supplier (subcontractor) provided
technical assistance for maintenance and operation.
3.23      Finally, the lack of a proper road or railway connection will
seriously affect the ability of the plant to increase the production and
distribution of its cement. Without such connection, supply of some of the main
raw materials (clay, gypsum) and transport of cement takes place over an
existing narrow and winding access road to the plant that is inadequate.
E.        Financial and Economic Performance
3.24      The Bank has received practically no information on the financial
performance of the Saida plant. SNMC reported a substantial loss of DA 75
million for the first year of the plant's operations (1979) against sales
revenue of DA 45 million. Financial statements for the plant have not been sub-
mitted to the Bank as was envisaged in the Loan Agreement. However, financial
performance of the plant should be substantially below appraisal estimates due
to the combined effects of insufficient capacity utilization, inadequate cement
prices, and an increased capital cost. The insufficient utilization of capacity
is expected to continue in the near future unless SNMC would rapidly develop its
distribution network and would alleviate the plant's distribution problem
through the construction of a road or rail link. Due to lack of data, the
financial rate of return cannot be recalculated. It is estimated, however, that
the return, which was already extremely low at appraisal at 3.7Z, would almost
certainly become negative unless SNMC could address the above constraints suc-
cessfully.
3.25      In much the same way, the updated economic rate of return will be
lower than at appraisal when it was estimated at 10.3%. However, the economic
rate of return would be mostly affected by the low capacity utilization and in-
creased capital costs, as prices for the economic analysis are based on the
opportunity cost of importing cement for the Saida region. An analysis of the
economic prices for cement used in the appraisal report shows that these prices
when updated to 1982 prices are still valid and reflect present conditions of
importing cement in Algeria.

3.26      Therefore considering (i) an increase in capital costs of 15% from
appraisal estimates, based on a road connection from the plant rather than a
railway connection, (ii) production at only 75% of capacity until 1988, and 100%
thereafter, (iii) economic opportunity costs for cement in the Saida region as
shown in the above table, and (iv) an increase in operating cost to reflect the
higher opportunity costs of energy following the 1979 energy price increase,
which was not foreseen at appraisal, the economic rate of return for the project
is now estimated at about 5%.
IV. SNC TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
A.        Background, Objectives and Description
4.01      SNC was established by the Government in 1967 to reform and organize
accounting in Algeria and act primarily as external auditor to state
enterprises. The rudimentary development of financial and management accounting
in most Algerian companies meant that much of SNC's work had been directed at
meeting the preconditions for a successful audit, i.e. setting up basic
accounting systems, providing practical guidance to accounting staff and
offering management consulting services. SNC was believed to be a promising
vehicle for improving public sector financial responsibility since it operated
with different companies and, through its audit function, could introduce
changes in their financial systems.
4.02    The objective of the technical assistance program was to improve the
general standard of accounting, budgeting and cost control in Algerian state
enterprises, including SNMC, by developing SNC's capabilities in external
auditing, modern management accounting techniques and implementing basic
accounting systems. Regarding SNMC, the program would aim at making SNC fully
capable of undertaking SNMC's annual audit and at assisting SNHC in: (i)
improving its cost accounting system; and (ii) establishing methods for
financial planning and a budgeting and cost control system (para 2.04). These
objectives would be achieved through a 5-year collaboration between SNC and a
qualified foreign auditing and accounting firm. The program would include
course instruction, practical training of SNC personnel abroad, and joint
auditing/accounting operations in Algeria. The costs of the program were
estimated at US$7.4 million, and the Bank loan included US$4.6 million to
finance the foreign exchange costs. This portion of the loan was on-lent by
SNMC to SNC.4/ The residual financing of the program was to be provided by the
Government.
4/ An onlending agreement between SNMC and SNC, which was the only
effectivener; condition of the Bank loan, was finalized on
May 25, 2976.



- 15 -
4.03    At the time of approval of the Bank loan, the foreign consulting firm
which was to work with SNC had not been appointed yet, but the Bank had discuss-
ed and agreed with SNC on the detailed scope of the program. The Bank foresaw
difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff by SNC. Assurances were there-
fore obtained from SNC that it would make adequate arrangements to: (i) recruit
qualified personnel in adequate numbers; and (ii) appoint a qualified full-time
program director by mid-1976. The program was expected to start by mid-1976.
B.      Project Execution and Results
4.04    The actual start-up of the program was delayed by about one year.  By
July 1976 SNC had selected an internationally well-known accounting and audit
firm to provide assistance in the implementation of the program. The Bank had
been closely involved in defining terms of reference for the program and in
evaluating bids. The firm was selected from 10 proposals. Although the selec-
tion procedure had been satisfactory and timely and was in compliance with Bank
procedures, delays were experienced in finalizing the contract with the accoun-
ting firm and obtaining final approval from the Ministry of Finance. The
contract was signed by June 1977.
4.05    The scope of the program as defined in the contract was much the same as
envisaged at appraisal. It was based on a 5-year program to train some 200 SNC
staff in order to improve the number and quality of SNC's interventions in state
enterprises in the areas of accounting, external audits and the design and
implementation of modern management techniques. The program contained 3 main
components: (i) a program of seminars to train 200 SNC staff: (ii) on-the-job
training through supervision of SNC staff by the accounting firm of audit and
consulting work for SNC clients: and (iii) a program of overseas training of SNC
staff in foreign office of the accounting firm. Of the program, about 85% of
time was geared to improvements in SNC's external audit capabilities, and 15% to
its capabilities in consulting work for improving financial systems. Total
costs of the program envisaged under the contract were in line with the
appraisal estimate (para 4.02).
4.06    Work under the program started in September 1977 and was concentrated at
first on a program of seminars for SNC staff and the supervision of SNC's work
in SNMC. Initially, this work focussed on preparing and executing the audit of
SNMC's accounts for 1977. This also involved a review of SNMC financial and
accounting systems and by mid-1978, SNC and SNMC agreed on a program to improve
these systems. This program addressed the deficiencies in SNMC's basic
management and accounting systems and the establishment of further cost control
and budgeting systems (para 2.10).  Also in the following years, SNC's
workprogram in auditing and consulting and on-the-job training of its staff
remained heavily concentrated on SNMC. In the meantime, the program of seminars
and overseas training remained far below objectives as SNC had problems in
recruiting and retaining qualified staff. Finally, in 1980 SNMC did not renew
its audit contract with SNC as it wanted to establish first the appropriate
financial and accounting systems. SNC had not been able to attract sufficient
other clients to compensate for this loss. With the declining work program of
SNC and its staffing problems, SNC and the foreign accounting firm decided to
suspend their contract in May 1981 after less than four years. As a result,
only US$2.2 million of the Bank Loan was disbursed for the SNC technical
assistance program, as compared to US$ 4.6 million foreseen at appraisal. The
remaining US$2.4 million was cancelled with the rest of the loan (para 3.17).

4.07    An can be inferred from the above, the program has not met its
objectives. The following table gives some summary indicators on the
implementation of the program as compared with the original objectives of the
SNC contract with the foreign accounting firm.

4.08    The implementation of the program has suffered  from a number of
problems, including (i) lack of sufficient SNC staff, (ii) management problems,
and (iii) insufficient development of SNC clientele. The lack of sufficient and
qualified staff probably was the main constraint. This was mainly caused by the
unattractive working conditions offered by SNC, including low salaries as com-
pared to other state enterprises and the financial sector, and poor housing and
transport facilities. Both recruitment and retention of staff proved difficult
and staff turnover was high, thereby minimizing the impact and continuity of the
program. Management problems were related to the lack of a program coordinator
and a clear management structure for the program. Further, poor client develop-
ment by SNC led to an insufficient workprogram and a lack of exposure of SNC
staff to practical on-the-job training beyond SNMC. The lack of other clients
seems to have been caused by the rather poor reputation of SNC and its main
focus on audit work rather than consulting work for implementation of basic
systems. Furthermore, SNC's services were considered expensive in Algeria which
was aggravated by the fact that it used to pass on to its customers the cost
related to the program. This was necessitated by the fact that the Government
had not made available to SNC the funds to cover local costs for the program.
4.09    Many of the above constraints seem to be related to the uncertainty of
SNC's position in Algeria. SNC was never clearly established by the Algerian
Government as the main institution to lead the Algerian accounting, and auditing
profession. As a result, it never build up a favorable reputation to attract
qualified personnel or new clients, and was not able to establish with the



- 17 -
Government attractive working conditions for its staff. On many occasions, Bank
staff discussed the definition of SNC's position and the improvement of working
conditions but results were minor. Furthermore, in retrospect, the program
seems to have been focused too much on the strengthening of SNC's audit
capabilities. It became clear during project implementation that the primary
need of SNMC and other Algerian enterprises was for consultancy services to
establish and improve basic financial and accounting systems as a prerequisite
for external audits. During the project, SNC and the Bank agreed to increase
the allocation of the program for consulting beyond the 15Z foreseen in the
contract, but SNC did not develop the program for future work and staff
development as requested by the Bank in this respect.
4.10      Despite these problems, the program has generated some benefits,
particularly as it concerns the training of individual SNC staff and the
dissemination of modern management systems among SNC's clients, in particular
SNMC. In fact, SNMC indicated that it would continue its relationship with the
foreign accounting firm directly to complete the implementation of the systems
envisaged under the project.
V. BANK ROLE, CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS
A.        Bank Role
5.01      The allocation of Bank staff resources in preparing and supervising
the project has been substantial including numerous missions (see mission data
in basic data sheet). It was recognized early on that the Bank's involvement in
the project was mainly justified because of its institution building objec-
tives. In this respect, the main Bank role during project preparation and
implementation has been to discuss with the Algerian authorities the importance
of restructuring SNMC in order to make it a financially viable establishment.
In this respect, during project appraisal, the Bank discussed and agreed with
the Algerians on a package of organizational and financial measures.
Furthermore, during project implementation the Bank discussed the need for
regular price increases for SNMC's products, including a proposal for a new
cement pricing sys.em, and financial restructuring measures as well as the
importance of providing SNMC with more autonomy for its day-to-day operations.
Although Bank involvement in these areas mostly did not yield immediate results,
the continued dialogue during supervision has probably contributed to measures
of wider reform in Algeria's state enterprise system which are now taking place
(para 2.13).
5.02    Concerning the Saida cement plant, the Bank's impact on the project
design was very limited as project preparation and procurement of the turn-key
contract had been finalized by appraisal. Regarding procurement, the Bank's
involvement led to the acceptance by SNMC of the two-stage bidding procedure.
Furthermore, the Bank assisted SNMC in analyzing the high capital costs of the
Saida plant and of Algerian cement plants in general and proposed measures to
reduce overcapacities in the Saida plant, that were finally not implemented by
SNMC. Through the financing of the consultants' contract for implementation
supervision and the technical assistance contract following start-up of the
plant, followed up by frequent supervision missions, the Bank contributed to
adequate technical assistance arrangements for project implementation.



- 18 -
5.03    Finally, the Bank role in the SNC component was quite substantial.  It
was very closely involved in designing the program and in assisting SNC in
selecting appropriate consultants for its implementation. Generally, Bank
involvement in the overall project was hampered by the almost total lack of
reporting by SNMC and SNC on the progress of the project, the unavailability on
many occasions of key project data to Bank missions, and the frequent
replacements of SNMC's top management which hampered the impact and continuity
of project supervision.
B.      Overall Conclusions
5.04    The main objective of the project, namely institution building in the
Algerian building materials industry, has not been achieved. In retrospect,
SNMC was probably not the right vehicle for achieving organizational and                    4
financial strengthening in the Algerian state enterprise system. The project
tried to introduce some measure of financial independence ani efficiency
improvements for SNMC, through financial convenants and organizational measures,
within a broader state enterprise system in which effectively such independence
was difficult to achieve and which lacked the incentives for SNMC to improve
performance and efficiency. It now seems that institution building objectives
should have been dealt with on the broader level of the Algerian public
enterprise system. Bank involvement might have been more effective if it would
have focused initially on a thorough analysis of the public enterprise system to
improve efficiency and the incentive structure, including studies for measures
of improvement, and, following Government as well as enterprise commitment to
these measures, the possible financing of specific measures at the enterprise
level. On the positive side, one can argue that although the project did not
yield benefits in the short run, the Bank's involvement may have contributed to
the reforms which are now being initiated in the Algerian state enterprise
system and SNMC specifically (para. 2.13).
5.05    Furthermore, it seems that the project left too many studies, which were
to be carried out by SNMC in preparation of further implementation measures
under the project, rather ill-defined at appraisal and their execution until
project implementation (e.g. distribution studies, programs for improvement of
financial and accounting system, cement market study, training program for
cement plant). Most of these studies were not undertaken or were much delayed.
C.      Main Lessons for Similar Projects
5.06    One of the main lessons of the project is that the Bank should be clear
at the outset that the project entity in question provides the right vehicle for
achieving the objectives of the project. More specifically, before embarking on
a program of organizational improvements and restructuring of a public enter-
prise in a centrally planned economy such as Algeria, the Bank should carefully
analyze the environment in which the enterprise functions to determine if
improvements can be achieved through measures at the enterprise level only or if
intervention at a broader level is required. Measures at the broader level
could be supported by a sector loan.



- 19 -
5.07    Secondly, to avoid delays in project implementation, the Bank should
identify early in its own project preparation, the necessary preparatory
consulting studies that are required for implementing important project
components so that these studies can be carried out along with the Bank's
project preparation and appraisal, and the scope of the recommended measures
defined early. Such studies in a first phase could possibly be financed through
a Project Preparation Facility (PPF), or through a technical assistance or
sector loan. Their implementation can then take place alongside the rest of the
project.
5.0B    Thirdly, the poor working conditions proved to be a serious problem in
attracting and retaining qualified staff both at the Saida plant and the SNC
technical assistance program. The Bank should therefore ensure in future
projects that working conditions (salaries, housing, etc., for project staff are
sufficient particularly when it concerns project locations in a remote area.
