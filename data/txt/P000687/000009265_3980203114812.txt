PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ETHIOPIA - FOURTH EJUCATION PROJECT
(Credit 553-ET)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Fourth Education
Project in Ethiopia. The related Credit 553-ET was approved in May 1975 in
the amount of US$23.0 million.  The last disbursement under this Credit was
made on August 4, 1982 resulting in a total disbursement of the credit
proceeds.
A draft PCR was prepared by Unesco at the request of and with the
assistance of the Government of Ethiopia. This draft was extensively dis-
cussed with the Government in November 1982 and their comments incorporated
as deemed appropriate. Subsequent modifications have been made by the
Education and Manpower Development Division to comply with, inter alia,
regional guidelines for the preparation of project completion reports.
The Operations Evaluation Department decided not to audit the project
and sent the final draft PCR to the Government for comment on October 7,
1983. The comments received were taken into account by the Region in their
revision of the PCR, and are reproduced as Attachment I.

HIGHLIGHTS
The Project and its Objectives (Paragraph 1.18)
1.        The principal objectives of the Project were to expand
educational opportunities in rural areas (primary and secondary) plus
curriculum reviaion and radio back-up, provide rural training programmes,
meet rural development middle level manpower demand, and improve the
organization of higher education and research in social sctences.
Project Form.ulation (Paragraphs 1.12-1.16)
2.        This project was the first to be formulated after the Government
changes of 1974. It had distinct interlinkages with the Third Education
Project, Credit 417-ET (IDA III) and also with IDA V. The 21-month process
of forrmulation can be considered as being of high standard especially when
the new circumstances in the country are taken into account.
Project Components (Paragraph 1.19)
3.        Although three components were not constructed, through the use
of economic forms of construction an additional 213 rural schools were
built. This is one of the highlights of the Project in that it increased
direct education actions within rural areas. Only a small proportion of
the funds envisaged for technical assistance were utilized but the diverted
funds helped in equipping the additional schools.
Project Implementation (Chapter II)
4.        As indicated in the previous patagraphs, implemention was
basically very effective. The use of force account methods for the
construction of the majority of the schools provided an effective solution
to the problem of building a large number of small institutions scattered
throughout isolated rural areas. A good working relationship between the
Bank Group and the Borrower contributed to this success.
Project Cost (Chapter III)
5.        The Project cost was 8 percent less than originally estimated
and all funds were disbursed.
Project Outcome (Chapter IV - Paragraph 4.1 in particular)
6.        The Project achieved its objectives of expanding education and
providing a more balanced distribution of educational opportunities, based
upon a new curriculum, particularly for rural areas. Other components of
the Project greatly re-enforced this thrust towards rural development, In
one minor area (Cooperative Training) no actions were taken but the ol.her
middle level training components (Health and Forestry) acbieved the
original foreseen targets.



- vii -
7.        The construction of a College of Social Sciences following the
construction of the College of Science (IDA 111) has greatly strengthened
the University of Addis Ababa and now allows the University to meet more
closely the demand for specialised manpower in these two areas.
Bank Performance (Chapter V)
8.         In spite of a few minor criticisms of Bank Group actions it is
considered that the close working relationship that the Bank Group built up
with the Borrower was a major element in allowing flexibility, providing
quick action and other wise contributing to the success of this project.
In particular, the Borrower noted the constructive assistance provided by
the education section of RMEA.
Lessons Learned (Chapters IV and V)
9.        Major lessons learned by bothi the Borrower and the Bank Group are
that:
(i)   Motivation and involvement of the local populace in site
selection supply of materials and labour, together with a
general encouragement of local initiative and self-help,
can lead to the evolution of effective developmiental
strategies. In this Project, community participation gave
rise to substantial savings which the Governmient used
constructively on expanding educational facilities, thereby
accelerating their policy of equalization oi educational
opportunities in rural areas.
(ii) A multi-facet project involving various ministries raised
difficulties as regards implementation end supervision,
with the result that more remote areas lo not received the
required supervisory services. A furt1ier problem concerns
the difficult communication with loca. authorities located
in remote rural areas.
(iii) Flexibility by the Bank Group in response to changing
national developmental needs resul--ed in considerable
benefits to the projects, but suchl flexibility should not
lead to the weakening of practicrl safeguards at the
working level, which may impair efficiency - e.g. a lack of
derivation of satisfactory criteria for site selection
(paragraph 2.14).
(iv) The success of this Project 'basically as scheduled and
within cost estimates is a Sood example of what can be
achieved when (as in this case) a strong wc,king
relationship is establish.:d between the Bank Group and
Borrower.



CHAPTER I
PROJECT BACKGROUND
Soclo-Economic Settig
1.1       The total population of Ethiopia in 1980 was estimated to be 31
million, of which 86 percent live in rural areas. The population shows a
predominance of young people, 54 percent being below 20 years of age.
Between 1973 and 1977 the total population growth rate was estimated to be
2.5 percent per annum.
1.2       The country is divided into 16 major administrative areas.  Of
these, 14 are the Administrative Regions of Arsi, Bale, Eritrea, Gamo Gofa,
Gojam, Gonder, Harrarghe, Illubabor, Kefa, Shewa, Sidamo, Tigrai, Wello and
Wellega. The seat of Government is Addis Ababa, in the centre of Shewa
Administrative Region, with a population of about 1.25 million in 1980.
Addis Ababa has the status of an Administrative Region.   Aseb district is
now organised as a separate Administrative Unit.
1.3       In 1979/80, GDP at constant 1960/61 factor cost amounted to Birr
4,454 million, at eurrent factor cost Birr 7,625 million and at current
market prices Birr 8,470 million. GDP per capita was Birr 241 (or US$
117), but in real terms (at.1960/61 prices) only Birr 144.5 (or US$ 70).
Gross investment was around 10-11 percent while domestic savings were
around 6-7 percent of GDP.
1.4       Ethiopia's economy is basically agrarian with agriculture
providing the major part of national production, exports and employment. Of
the GDP of Birr 4,454 millic.  in 1979/80 (at constant 1960/61 factor cost),
46.3 percent was accounted 'or by agriculture, Crops amount to about 80
percent of the gross value of agricultural production and livastock
products for the balance. Coffee is the most important cash and export
crop. The manufacturing sector contributed only 5.3 percent of GDP,
handicrafts and 3mall-scale industries 4.5 percent. The share of trade
amounted to 8 percent, that of transport and communications to nearly 7
percent and building and construction around 5 percent.
1.5       The years since the 1974 Revolution have been marked by important
changes both in economic policies and in the structure of the economy and
institutions. The major objectives of the Government have been the
eradication of poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, hunger and disease,
the equitable distribution of economic benefits, the redressing of
regional disparities, the expansion of production to meet basic needs and
the building of a strong, self-reliant and independent national economy.



-2-
Sector Settingl/
1.6       In 1974, the primary level enrollment was about 18 percent of the
7-12 age group, and only 6 percent of the 13-18 age group were in secondary
schools. The curriculum was highly academic and educational vaterials were
greatly lacking. The internal efficiency of the system was low with
drop-out and repetition rates and a large proportion of the teachers at
secondary level were expatriates.
1.7       The 1974 Revolution brought about fundamental changes in the
social, economic and political development of the country. Education being
a vehicle for change, underwent dramatic changes in social concepts.
New educational policies, objectives and orientations have been developed
and disseminated with emphasis upon the development of knowledge, skills
and attitudes necessary for increased production.
1.8       It is in thi's context that education is being dramatically
developed and expanded with the aim of, inter alia, equalizing educational
opportunities among rural and urban areas.
1.9       In. order to efficiently implement the new programme, the
Government has:
-    decentralized the administration of education by giving the
regions, Awrajas, and Kebeles more responsibilities and
authority for the support and management of the educational
system;
-    established Awraja Pedagogical Centres, Primary Teacher
Training Institutes, Awraja Rural Development Centres
(ARDCs), Health Assistant Training Centres (HATCs),
Community Skill Training Centres (CSTCs), and other training
facilities;
-    strengthened the Department of Adult Education at the
reoional and awraja level;
-    expanded the use of educational radio;
-    strengthened the Continuing Educational Programme;
-    established a Commission for Higher Education for the
purpose of rationalizing, coordinating, and planning the
third level of education.
1/ A full description of the educational system is given in Appendix I of
the Staff Appraisal Report. The emphasis here is upon the factors
which influence the expansion and equalization of educational
opportunities.



1.10       The response to these changes has been positive: community
participation is a major factor responsible for succesa in the rapid
expansion and equalization of educational opportunities.
1.11       The number of children enrolled in primary education increased
from 959,400 in 1974/75 to 2,376,000 in 1981/82, i.e. nearly two and a half
time&' the number reached in 1975. Enrollment in lower secondary is now
more than double; that of higher secondary education has quadrupled that of
1975. Through the ongoing literacy campaign over 12 million adults have
been covered by courses in basic literacy. The literacy rate is now
estimated at 45 percent; it was only 7 percent in 1974/75. Primary
education has a gross enrollment of 47 percent, lower secondary 16 percent
and higher secondary nearly 9 percent.
Project Formulation
1.12       The Project was formulated over a period of 21 months.  It was in
some aspects a continuation of some components of the first three Bank
Group assisted projects. For example, the First Eduction Project, Credit
84-ET (IDA I) signed in 1966 and completed in 1972, assisted the expansion
of secondary, technical and teacher education and and the diversificqtion
of curricula at various levels.  The Second Education Project, Credit
243-ET (IDA II) signed in 1971 and completed in 1979, assisted teacher and
agricultural education and modest expansion of seconeary education while
improving its geographical distribution and quality. IDA III signed in
1973 and completed in 1980, provided assistance to rural education, the
teaching of science and the production of textbooks and teaching
matezials. This Project (IDA IV), signed in 1975 and completed in 1981,
helped the implementation of an education programme for the expansion of
basic and non-formal education, the training of specialized rural
development personnel and the consolidation of the teaching of social
sciences at the University.
1.13       A Bank Group Reconnaissance Mission assisted by FAO, was carried
out in September/November 1973, followed by an Identification Mission which
discussed the content and the,timing for preparation and appraisal with
relevant Government authorities between 18-22 Augt 4t 1974. As a basis for
discussion, the Reconnaissance Report together with the Policy Statement
issued by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in May 1974 on the implication
for human resources development taken from the council of Ministers White
Paper of April 1974, were used.
1.14       The preparation of the proposed Project by the Government and
appraisal by the Bank Group was carried out from 15 October to 13 November
1974, during which the project was modified as shown in Annex I.1. The
base cost of the project was about US$ 20 million plus contingencies of
about US$ 7-8 million, for a total project cost of ITS$ 28 million.
Negotiation was from 14-18 April 1975, followed by Board Approval, 27 May
1975 and Signing on 4 June 1975. The Credit beceme effective on 6 August
1975, two months before schedule.



- 4 -
1.15      Two points to be highlighted during project formulation are that:
(a) the Government had prepared the project well. The Bank
Group noted that "most items had been already prepared to
a degree which exceeded normal Bank Group requirements for
the appraisal of education projects"; and
(b)  at negotiation, upon the Governmen. ts request2/, the
earmarked amount of US$20 million which covered 68 percent
of the total cost was increased to US$23 million thereby
covering 76 percent of the total cost.
1.16      In retrospect, the identification was in harmony with Government
needs, objectives, and development strategy; the preparation inclu"'ed all
basic components except technical assistance; appraisal was thorough and
pointed out which items needed to be treated cautiously during negotiation
(some were eliminated at negotiation and even duri.si implementation). The
documents used a basis of discussion (paragraph 1.13) were well-prepared
and reflected both the Government and the Bank Group's riutual desire for a
well-conceived project. The Bank Group had confidence in the Govarnment's
administrative/implementation capacity, basing this upon the experiences
and outcomes of the previous projects.
Project Description
Justification
1.17      The Project provided financial and tec'nical assistance to enable
Ethiopia's education and training system to bec.ae 'an active, contributive
force" in national development. The shift of emphasis from urban to rural
areas with a view to improving income distribution, standards of living,
and expanding and equalizing educational, health and other opportunities,
was strongly supported by this Project.
Objectives
1.18      The overall objective of the Project was to assist Ethiopia's
education investment programme by:
(a) expanding opportunities for primary and secondary education
in the rural areas combined with curricula revision and the
expansion of educational radio;
2/ Major reasons given in support of the request were: (a) in the third
project 79 percent of project cost was covered; (b) lower coffee and
hide prices in international markets affected export earnings; (c) the
drought was spreading in other areas and relief and rehabili'tation
were expected to be carried on for sometime.

(b) supporting an integrated rural training programme through
the establishment of Awraja Administrative Units and
Community Skill Training Centres;
(c)  meeting manpower neeas for rural development by providing
training for foresters, home economics demonstrators, rural
health assistants and staff in cooperatives; and
(d) improving the organization of higher education and research
in the social sciences.

4/ Annual output is estimated at 10,000 since courses are short.
5/ The Home Economics Department will be an extension to the Ambo
Agricultural Institute.
6/ These will replace existing inadequate facilities.



-6-
(c) operational expenses for the curriculum development task
forces for: preparation of curriculum revisions, textbook
illustrations and cost of orientation workshops for the
training of school personnel in the use of revised textbooks;
(d) technical assistance consisting of about two man/years of
specialist services and ten-and-one-half years of fellowship
training for the Community Skill Training Centres, the
Cooperative Training Centre and the Home Economics
Department; and
(e) operational expenses for project administration.
Six amendments (Annex 1.2) were made and the Project, as
implemented, consists of the following parts:
(a) The Construction, furnishing and equipment of:
(i)    750 four-classroom schools (3,000 primary school
classroom units);
(ii)   22 junior secondary schools;
(iii) 14 senior secondary schools;
(iv)   3 Health Assistant Training Centres;
(v)    24 Awraja Rural Development Centres;
(vi)   1 Social Science Centre for tLle Addis Ababa
University;
(vii) 9 radio transmission stations including supporting
and servicing facilities; and
(viii) 100 Community Skill Training Centres.
(b) The revision of general education curricula, development of
textbooks and educational radio programmes and retraining of
teachers.
(c) The provision of two man/years of specialist services.
(d) Operational expenses for project administration and for
inital operation, including training and programme evaluation
activities, of the Alternative Technology Centre.
1.20      On 13 March 1980, The Bank Group approved the Government's
request to add 200 primary schools, 7 junior secondary schools (of which
one would be new and additions to six) and 6 senior secondary schools (of
which three would be new and three upgraded from junior secondary schools)
to the Project. The cost savings used for these additional facilities came
basically as a result of the construction of lower cost facilities and
liberal contingencies. Three different types of designs for the 550
primary schools were to be used, depending upon location. The Primary
Village School, the lowest design in cost, was used extensively. This
resulted in savings of about 36 percent of the original base cost of that
component.



-7-
Expected Benefits
1.21      The benefits expected from the Project, as originally envisaged,
fall under four principal categories:
(a) complete reform of the curricula in primary and secondary
schools with emphasis on practical skills and the provision
of additional school facilities in the rural areas to
ivprove educational opportunity;
(b)  tht provision of rural skill training facilites to enable
the rural population to improve its productivity and
increase its participation in the development process;
(c) the provision of the additional high and middle level
manpower required for development work in specialities such
as administration, health, forestry, home economics and
cooperatives; and
(d) the provision of facilities and trained personnel to
expedite the process of decentralizing Government
operations, including those of the MOE.

CHAPTER II
PROJECT IMPLEhENTATION
Changes in Project
2.1       Five major changes were made during project implementation, as
follows:
(a) addition of 220 Primary schools, 8 Junior and 6 Senior
secondary schools;
(b) deletion of the Cooperative Training Centre, the Forest
Ranger Training Centre, and 15 Health stations;
(c) transfer of the Home Econon!.cs Department equipment from
Ambo to Kotobe Teacher Train:..ng College;
(d) nonr-use of 10.5 man/years of fellowships; and
(e) purchase of nine radio transmitters.
2.2       The construction of the additional schools was due mainly to the
use of the lowest cost type of the three designs for the 550 primary
schools, as explained in paragraphs 1.20 and 2.19. The deletion of the
items in (b) above was due to the fact that post-secondary education became
the responsibility of the Commission for Higher Education, which indicated
that the Junior College of Agriculture at Debre Zeit already had a
specialized section on cooperatives, and therefore a new Cooperative
Training Centre was no longer needed (paragraphs 4.66-4.67. The Forest
Ranger Training Center case was similar in that a course had been started
in existing facilities at Wando Genet with instructors provided by Swedish
International Development Agency (SIDA) (paragraph 4.71). This decision
was taken after serious efforts had been made by the Bank Group to get
Borrower to have the item started. Sufficient Health Stations had been
built, assisted by a bilateral agency and additional ones were not needed
(paragraph 2.12).
2.3       With the reorganization of post-secondary education, the
Commission for Higher Education became responsible for the Ambo Institute
of Agriculture and related fellowships. It was decided that since home
economics education was being concentrated at Kotobe Teacher Training
College, the home economics equipment provided for the Ambo Institute be
transferred to Kotobe (paragraph 4.63). The request to use the fellowship
funds was made after funds had been reallocated for other purposes
(paragraph 4.63). Expected bilateral assistance (ODM) from the UK in the
form of nino radio transmitters was withdrawn and the Credit was amended on
16 June 1977 to include their purchase (paragraph 4.19).



-9-
Project Management
2.4       The Project Management established for the implementation of
previous IDA Projects iias also assigned Administrative responsibilities for
this project. In July 1975, the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)7/ which
was part of the Construction and Maintenance Department in the MOE was
merged with the MOE's E'lementary School Building Unit thereby forming the
Ethiopian School Building Unit (ESBU). On 17 July 1975, ESBU was
transferred to the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing and became the
Rural Projects Agency (RPA) through a proclamation of 22 April 1976. With
this reorganization, responsibility for coordinating all aspects of the
project implementation was transferred to the RPA.
2.5       In July 1980, the RPA merged with other agencies to form the
Ethiopian Building Construction Authority (EBCA), which is now under the
new Ministry of Construction.
2.6       Project implementation was administered by two successive project
managers. Key project staff were adequate and supported by sufficient
administrative and secretarial staff and the EBCA unit is adequately
accommodated in new facilities.
2.7       Project management was efficient.  The Project was basically
completed by the original Credit closing date, 31 December 1981, but
disbursement continued to 31 August 1982 when the last disbursement was
made.
2.8       Although project management was competent, a difficulty arose
over the monitoring and supervising of civil works in remote areas, due to
the fact that EBCA, which managed the Project, was also responsible for the
construction of other projects. Aspects of this difficulty are reflected
later in this Report under respective components.
Physical Implementation
2.9       Considering the large scale of the project, the dispersed nature
of sites (more than 700 different worksites in the first stage8/ covering
558 of the 572 Weredas of the country), the involvement of five ministries,
and logistical difficulties, the overall performance of the PIU has been
very good. Except for three items9/ deleted upon the Borrower's request,
7/ The PIU, providing ranagement services for IDA IV is not to be confused
with the Project Management Office (PMO), established within the MOE to
monitor the implementation of IDA V.
8/ At the time of completion and due to some changes within design and the
standard of construction utilizing local materials and techniques the
number of worksites increases to over 900 essentially due to new
schools added from savings.
91 The Cooperative Training Centre, the Forest Ranger Training Centre, and
the 15 health stations already built by the Government.



- 10 -
all the facilities were built and, in many cases, at a lower cost than
foreseen in the original appraisal estimates. EBCA constructed most of the
facilities by departmental forces using force account methods (para. 2.24).
2.10      Due to the dispersed nature of sites, transport problems occurred
in some cases and therefore delivery of materials and supervision presented
difficulties. For these reasons some of the institutions were not
completely finished (one Awraja Rural Development Centre in Assab, one
Junior Secondary School in Waka Limugenet and five CSTCs in remote areas)
at the time of the completion mission.
Sites
2.11      At the beginning of project implementation, some of the sitqs
were already selected and a list of criteria for selection of the remaining
places (Primary schools, Secondary schools, Cooperative Training Centre and
Coffmunity Skill Training Centres) was established. There was no problem in
land acquisition and consequently the starting of construction was on, or
before, schedule for various projectsl°/.
2.12      The original choice of sites for the HATCs was Yabelo (Sidamo),
Woldiya (Wollo) and Shambu (Wollega) but for reasons connected both with
internal administrative changes and technical reasons (proximity to
hlospitals for the clinical internship), the Borrower proposed and the Bank
Group agreed to site changes. The training centres were thus subsequently
constructed at Dessie (Wollo), Awass6 (Sidam'o) and Jimma (Kaffa). As in
each of the new locations health stations already existedll/, it was also
decided to omit the construction of new health stations. This change
caused a half a year delay in implementation.
2.13      Site selection for the Cooperative Training Centre and the Forest
Ranger Training Centre was pending during the entlre implementation period
due to some change in concept expressed by the Government and the
possibility of using existing facilities. No action was taken for the
implementation of those two items12/ and finally in March 1982 the
Government requested their deletion.  No official Bank Group reaction was
10/ Primary schools, Secondary schools, Radio stations, Awraja Rural
Development Centres and the Home Economic Department in Ambo. For ARDC
- Selection of sites was re-examined after having started the
construction of 6 out of the 24 items, due to changes in the use of
those centres, some becoming Regional Developrdeiit Centres. Thie
process took a long time and the remaining 18 centres were re-started
(second semester 1979) after agreement of the Bank Group.
_ / Provided by bilateral assistance, but without boarding facilities.

originally).

necessary since the Project has been completed and the Credit closed. The
construction phase for 100 Community Skill Training Centres was behind
schedule due to the fact that priority had been given to the completion of
such CSTCs in IDA, III (Bank approval September 1977).
2.14      The criteria for selection of sites for the Primary schools,
Secondary schools, and CSTCs were respected, but the basic criteria did
not, in all cases, pay sufficient attention to the availability of water or
electricity. Consequently there are some examples where equipment actually
delivered to Secondary schools cannot be utilizedl3/.
Design
21.5      Designs were produced by the RPA/EBCA14/ for all the items,
except for the Addis Ababia U de"sity Social Sciences Centre (AAUSSC).
This was carried out (as well as the site supervision) by a consulting firm
(as stated in the Credit Agreement) which was appointed on 16 February 1976
after a preselection on an international basis initiated in July 1975.
2.16      The architectural consultants have carried out their work on the
whole satisfactorily. The net areas provided for the AAUSSC are in
accordance with the working papers, or 9 percent more, taking into account
about 700 m2 of net area coverted into a store under the lecture theatres
towards the end of the construction period. The walling circulation area
at 27 percent of the net areas is in line with the 30 percent included in
the appraisal working papers.
2.17      Building materials untilized for external walls (concrete, stone,
ceramic) do not need any maintenance and the design "otibme internal and
external spaces is very pleasant. However, there is some problem with the
choice of some components (type of windows in administrative areas, chairs
with attached writing pallets in the lecture halls) which have entailed a
lot of maintenance beginning from the first year of use. The lack of
drainage in the various sanitation areas causes some problems; daylight
provided in the lecture halls is not sufficient and it is necessary to use
artificial light all the time; roofing materials (lacquer iron sheet) used
for the lecture halls produce considerable noise when it is raining. A
major problem is caused by insufficient drainage of the site (the Centre is
located in a denression on the campus) and the need to protect the library
from storm water.
2.18      For the remaining institutions, design has been carried out by
RPA and Is analyzed below.
13/ This problem is now being resolved. In some cases, communities are
collecting funds to provide electricity generator or running water
connections for Secondary schools; on the other hand, IDA V includes
funds to provide water supplies for 60 Secondary schools.
14/ RPA and EBCA were in charge of the Project implementation.

2.19      Design was done on the principle of using local constructicon
techniques and available building materials with the view of cost saving
and providing facilities which could be easily maintained by local
communitiesl5/. For the Primary schools the design specification provided
an integrateT skylight in the roof. The result is very good and provide
excellent space for full utilization. These techniques meant that the
accumulated savings allowed a further 200 Primary schools more than
originally estimated to be built. The only problem comes from the
over-hang of the roof; this is not sufficient to correctly protect mud
walls against the rain. This shortcoming in roof design was observed and
pointed out in the previous Project Completion Report. But at this date it
has yet to be corrected and the resultant rain damage is not always made
good by the utilizers, or communities, and thus the life span, of about 25
years, expected by EBCA seems to be very optimistic, unless the roof is
modified to provide sufficient overhang.
Radio Stations
2.20      For the construction of Radio stations, local stone and brick are
used for walling and the facilities are of good quality.
Other Institutions (Secondary schools, HATCs, Awraja Rural
Development Centres)
2.21      For all remaining institutions, RPA/EBCA deRign is based on a
standard scheme of pre-fabricated reinforced concrete columns with
interfixed concrete slabs, louvre windows, metal doors, eucalyptus
carpentry and corrugated iron roof sheets.
2.22      While the basic construction is of good design, some maintenance
problems have already arisen: such as cracks in walls and plaster, loose
hinges on the doors partially due to external opening doors, uncovered
electrical networks with poor quality sockets and switches.
2.23      A comparative figure between net and gross areas agreed at
Appraisal and Actual for each institution is shown in Annex II.1. The
walling circulation areas vary from 7 percent (for CSTCs due to compact
design without external covered circulation) to 33 percent (for the Awraja
Rural Development Centres due to their large external covered circulation)
instead of the more customary 17 percent foreseen in the agreed working
papers.
Constructioni
2.24      It was originally intended that construction would be carried out
by private contractors on the basis of international competitive bidding
except for the construction of Primary schools, Radio stations, CSTCs and
Rural Development Centres where the force account method would be utilized,
and that civil works contracts costing less that US$200,000 each would be

awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally. This
procedure was respected in a first stage but some changes were introduced
later. Local tendering was initiated in early 1976 for Secondary schools,
but the offer made by contractors far exceeded the amount allocated for
those civil works. Due to difficult internal conditions, scattered
locations and size of the works, contractors were reluctant to undertake
building activities. Therefore Government requested approbation of the
Bank Group to undertake all civil works by the force account method (except
the AAUSSC). This was agreed and the Credit Agreement was modified to
permIt this change on 23 July 1976.
2.25      For the MAUSSC construction work, advertisements were made in
local newspapers and through embassies. Six firms (three foreign and three
local) were finally shortlisted (prequalified) in February 1977. Tendering
was initiated in July 1977 and selection took place in October 1977 with
the cortract finally signed on 20 December 197716/ lone year be-hind
schedule) for an amount of Birr 6,426,294.35 anUTwith a constzuction period
of 650 calendar days. The work was completed by 29 September 1980 (one
year behind appraisal schedule and about nine months beyond the
construction period al.lowed in the contract).
2.26      On the basis of visits to the institutions and the opinion of the
architects' representative, the Completion Mission concluded that the
contractor produced work of high quality and provided excellent site
management during the entire implementation period. Implementation was
delayed for various reasons: inclement weather, shortage of local materials
(cement, timber) and fuel, with repercussion on t;:ansportation, loss of
imported steel bars (ship sinking) causing the contractor (and the
architect) to make continued needed adjustments and to work overtime from
the beginning of 1979.
2.27      For the other items under the Project, all construction works
were done by RPA/EBCA17/ own departmental forces.
2.28      Construction started generally on or before schedule and in some
cases (Radio stations, Home Economics Department, Primarv schoolsl8/) the
construction period began 6 to 18 months before the schedule provided in
the appraisal report. There were some important delays in completion of
16/ In fact, the contractor was on site end of October 1977 due to the
Addis Ababa University letter of intent.
17/ The only one exception is for 60 out of the 100 CSTCs undertaken by the
School Construction and Maintenance Services of the MOE which provided
construction materials and supervision to the communities for the
purpose of building those centres.
18/ Despite the fact that this item was increased from 550 to 750 Primary
schools.



- 14 -
Secondary schoolsl9/. Al. the time of the Completion Mission, all
Secondary schools had bcen handed over to the MOE except one in Waka
Limugene20/ (which was expected to be completed within three months).
2.29      For the 24 .4wiraja Rural Development Centres some delays were
introduced by re-def,.nition of the concept and at the time of the
Completion Mission there was on in Assab which was 90 percent completed and
was expected to be completed within two months. CSTCs construction started
almost five years behind schedule because of (a) re-definition of the
concept and (b) Xack of eagerness of the RPA/EBCA to undertake this work,
despite repeated request by Bank Group supervision missions; this
reluctance was due to the small size and widely scattered anture of the
items. At the time of the Completion Mission, 5 out of the 60 CSTCs for
which construction was undertaken by the School Construction and
Maintenance 'iervices Department (SCMS) of the MOE using force account
methods had yet to be built due to transportation problems (construction
aaterials are being kept in the relevant Ministry of Awraja stores),
2.30      In terms of costs and handing over, at ths time of the Completion
Mission visit, civil works was considered to be about 99 percent completed.
This result hae to be qualified by the following comments. Some of the
visited facilities actually in use are not completely finished. Some work
concerning electricity and water installations has to be done (in some
cases there are no sinks, or no taps, or sink and taps unconnected to
running water). Those problems could have been resolved by better
sipervision by the regional branches of RPA/EBCA and ailocation of
etsfficient funds to permit the availability of electricity or running
;water. This last point will be resolved for some of these institution in
the near future by IDA V in which funds are provided for installation of
water supplies in 60 Secondary schools.
Furniture
2.31      The PIU prepared all furniture lists except for the AAUSSC where
the UTniversity's Engineering and Maintenance Department was in charge.
AAUSSC's furniture was produced by the University workshop (with agreement
from the Bank Group) in order to stay within the available funds for this
sub-component. Furniture produced by AAU workshops (in wood and tubular
metal) is functional, sufficient and stronger than imported integrated
furniture included in the various lecture halls where part of the mobile
tablets have been broken in the first year of use. For the remaining
institutiorn, RPA, for economic reasons, produced furniture in its own
workshop, with Bank Group approval.. Furniture is generally of good
quality, functional and sufficient. Different models of table benches were
produced for the Secondary schools. The quality of the wood and the method
of assembling are in some cases causing maintenance problems.
19/ Delays due (a) to introduction during implementation of new
institutions in Credit Agreement on 13 M4arch 1980 and (b) to location
of some items where delivery of building materials and supervision were
very difficult (transportation and/or security problems).
20/ Civil works was about 85 percent completed.

Equipment
2.32      Each ministry involved with different components of the Project
was responsible for its own equipment list. All the equipment included in
the Project was purchased through ICB. RPA/EBCA was responsible for the
organization of purchasing all items except for the AAUSSC (for which the
University was in charge) and for the different items concerning the MOE
institutions2l/. For AAUSSC and the MOE's equipment, RPA/EBCA was in
charge of the supervision of the process of purchasing to ensure accordance
with agreed Bank Group Procurement Guidelines guidelines.
2.33      It was originally intended that part of the equipment for Radio
programmes development would be provided by Unicef and ODM. During
implementation, differences about timing and procurement procedures existed
betwean the Government and ODM and finally the former requested IDA to
purchase the nir.e radio transmitters under the project22/. Unicef
provided about 11,500 receivers in accordance with what was or4 inally
intended, and about 6,000 receivers were also provided by the Soviet Union.
2.34      There was no major problem about procurement of equipment.
Tendering took place from end 1977 to mid-1981 and the last contract was
signed at the end of 1981. This long tendering period was due to the fact
that retendering23/ had to be done in some cases and additional equipment
was tendered for7with funds saved. EMPDA had to cancel two contracts
because the firms refused to provide the goods, considering the small
amount awarded. For these cases, EMPDA has to proceed with the second
lowest bidder.
2.35      At the time of the Completion Mission all equipment had been
received and delivered on the different sites except from two
suppliers24/. For the latter, shipping documents were not sent in time
and the Bank Group agreed to extend the period for reimbursement to 31
August 1982.
Maintenance of Physical Facilities
2.36      Maintenance of buildings, furniture and equipm3nt is the
responsibility of the different ministries involved. Except for the AAUSSC
where maintenance is very efficient, there are problems for the other
institutions due to lack of sufficient budget and technical know-how.
Concerning MOE institutions, there is provision for a Headquarter Unit and
Regional Workshops for maintenance of furniture and capability of
21 The Educational Material Production and Distribution Agency (EMPDA) of
the MOE was responsible for purchasing MOE's equit :..
22 The Bank Group agreed to this change and the Credit Agreement was
amended on 16 June 1977 to permit the purchase of 9 transmitters.
23/ There were three tenderings for the procurement of mobile maintenance
vans for Mass Media Department due to offers exceeding the amount
allocated and changes in specifications.
24/ Part of the equipment not supplled by that time was actually in transit
for 7 Lower Secondary Schools and 6 Senior Secondarv Schools.

maintenance of facilities under IDA V Project which also includes purchase
of maintenance kits, the training of personnel for Secondary schools and
p%..chase of tools to help the community to conduct maintenance of primary
schools.
Technical Assistance
2.37      This component of the project was not utilized fully.  A radio
engineer who had been expected to be supported under bilateral technical
assistance (ODM) was funded for two man/years (Annex I1.2). In regards to
the three fellowships foreseen under home economics at Ambo Agricultural
Institute, this Institute was transferred under the new Commission for
Higher Education which identified the three female candidates but requested
their funding only after the funds had been reallocated for other purposes
(paragraph 4.63).
Covenants
2.38      The project was implemented with diligence and efficiency and in
full compliance with the covenants to the Credit Agreement, except for
Section 4.01 regarding (a) maintaining a separate account for the Project,
and (b) auditing accounts and financial statements (see Annex I1.3). The
first firm appointed as external auditor went into liquidation before
auditing the 1975/76 accounts. A second firm was established in Ethiopia
two years later and was appointed as auditors on 19 December 1978. An
Audit Report on the RPA/EBCA accounts25/ for the year ending 7 July 1976
and fiscal year 1977 was established aTn_d submitted to the Bank Group.
Auditing of 1977/78 accounts started in 1981. The remaining work will be
started as soon as the 1977/78 report is completed.
Risks Involved
2.39      The two major risks involved in the Project (Appraisal Report,
paragraph 6.04) were (a) the Bank Group's uncertainty of Borrower's
"long-term commitment to educational reform"26/ and (b) whether ESBU
could assume the additional task of an incre_ased school construction
programme in view of the fact that it was taking on other construction
responsibilities for other ministries.
2.40      However, in the event, (e) the Borrower's "long-term commitment
to education reforms" has been sustained throughout the life of the Project
and continues (see Chapter 1), and (b) the reorganization of the ESBU
(paragraph 2.4-2.6) enabled the PIU to implement the project in addition to
its other construction responsibilities.
25/ Auditing of accounts was undertaken for all the activities under
RPA/EBCA responsibility rather than being limited only to the Fourth
Project, due to misinterpretation by Borrower of the covenant. Because
of the practice of bulk purchasa by RPA/EBCA, it was easier and more
economical not to keep a separate account for IDA Projects. Concerning
IDA V, the Project Management Office in the MOE has started to keep
separate records concerning Project accounts.
26/ This basic statement is however qualified later in the text where the
Report indicates that the five-year education plan (1974-1979) was
largely based on a thorough study of Ethiopia's educational needs and
it is dotubtful therefore that any major changes would be made either in

CHAPTER III
PROJECT COSTS
Capital Costs
3.1       As implemented, the final cost of the Project, excluding
taxes27/, was Birr 57,506,500 - or about U:S$ 27,780,917 - equivalent to
eight percent less than appraisal estimates, excluding taxes.
3.2       Comparison of the Project costs and implementation schedule as
estimated at Appraisal and as actually implemented is shown in Annexes
III.1 and III.2. Total estimated costs including contingencies, taxes and
finanrial contributions by other agencies was Birr 71.79 million28/ or
US$34.;)8 million, or excluding taxes, Birr 62.69 million or US$30.28
million respectively. As agreed, the Bank Group financing of US$23 million
represented about 76 percent of the project cost net of taxes. The
financial participation of other agencies (bilateral) was limited to
US$415,700 in place of US$1,211,100, 65 percent less than originally
estimated.
3.3       A compar'son of appraisal estimates and actual cost by category
is shown in Annex III.3.
3.4       As compared with the original estimaves, including contingencies,
four categories (professional services, furnit re, equipment and project
adriinistration) had overrun costs, for which equipment was the most
slgnificant (+96 percent). The overrun for the equipment costs was based
on three factors; firstly, the inclusion of radio transmitters29/ as the
result of ODM's withdrawal; secondly, the resultant delay in piurchasing the
transmitters led to cost escalation; and thirdly, the addition of extra
schools to the Project meant that more equipment had to be purchased.
Professional services were 12.8 percent of construction cost (due to
overtime work) and 52 percent over appraisal estimates due to overrun cost
for AAUSSC civil works30/. The overrun cost concerning furniture (+27
percent) is reasonable given the increase of facilities constructed. The
cost increase for Project Administration (+15 percent) is explained largely
by the increase of work due to the introduction of the force account
27/ Different Government agencies or departments involved with the Project
have to pay taxes for their relative items. The amount of tax paid for
the Project was not available during the Completion Mission.
28/ Birr is the actual currency in Ethiopia in place of Ethiopian dollars
at time of Appraisal. US$ 1 = 2.07 Ethiopian dollars = 2.07 Birr.
29/ Amendment was made to the Credit Agreement for this point on 16 June
1977.
30/ One year behind schedule for starting construction work and price

method31/ for all institutions (except AAUSSC) and addition of recurrent
expenditures for the Alternative Technology Centre32/. The other
categories showed reduction. The reduced cost for Technical Assistance
(-83 percent) arose essentially from not using the expert and fellowship
fellowship funds as foreseen at Appraisal (paragraph 2.37); concerning the
Civil Works (-24 percent), the use of local construction technology for
primary schools and the extended use of the force account method, reduced
cost considerably.
3.5       In comparison with original estimates, the proportion of funds
spent on construction, furniture and equipment were as follows:
Percentage Allocation
Construction      Furniture      Equipment      Others
Appraisal Estimates         66%                7%             13%          14%
Actual Expenditures          55%              10%             20%          15%
Areas and Costs per Student Place
3.6       Average cost per square meter and cost per student place compared
with appraisal estimates are shown in Annex III.4 33/.
3.7       Comparison of gross areas per institution between appraisal
estimates and actual shown in Annex I1.1.
3.8       The cost per student place for Primary schools and CSTCs is 40 to
50 percent under appraisal estimates due to construction with greater use
of local materials and community voluntary efforts than originally
foreseen, and reduced cost of equipment. The cost per student place for
the remaining items constructed in concrete under the force account method
is 5 to 20 percent under appraisal estimates with costs in line for
furniture and costs, in some cases, under appraisal estimates for equipment
31/ Amendment of Credit Agreement on 23 July 1976.
32/ Amendment of Credit Agreement on 30 May 1978.
33/ A real comparison was not possible in some cases between appraisal
and actual costs per student place. For Secondary schools, the
figure takes only into account the schools built in the first stage
of the Project, excluding the facilities built in a second phase to
use the savings (data collected about these new facilities
concerned new schools. Service modules and upgraded schools and
could not give correct figures for costs per student place). For
the thrre Health Assistant Training Centres, the actual figure does
not inclued the 15 related Health Sta.tons which were already built
by the Government.



- 19 -
(-32 percent for CSTCs, -15 percent for HED). The cost per student place
for the AAUSSC was 35 percent above appraisal estimates due to
implementation delays and price escalation for civil works. In addition it
should be noted that the equipment costs for this institution were almost
double the original estimates (see Annex III.4) due to the addition of TV
equipment much later, this having not been included in the original list,
and late procurement.
Disbursement
3.9       All credit funds were disbursed.  Final disbursement was made in
August 1982. A comparison of the original and actual allocation of the
Credit proceeds by category is shown iii Basic Data page (iii).

CHAPTER IV
PROJECT OPERATING OUTCOME
General
4.1       Over the last 16 years the institution capacity building of the
Borrower has been enhanced through four IDA projects.
This Project has established a base for long term impact in terms
of increased educational opportunity for children coming from the rural
areas and provided an education based upon a new curriculum, and
educational materials, developed in the context of the Ethiopian society.
Through Educational Radio, this impact is greatly reinforced especially by
the use of a range of local languages, support to in-service primary
teacher training and expansion into out-of-school educational programmes.
The rural communities are also very closely associated with the
Community Skill Training Centres which are having an impact through
increasing skill levels (including agriculture skills), and also uplifting
the general education profile of the rural adults. Another item of
considerable value to rural development are the Awraja Rural Development
Centres which are providing the integrated administrative structure
necessary for implementation of developmental processes.
In terms of increased specialized manpower production mention
should be made, apart from teacher training, of the Health Assistant
training programmes, and the Forpec Ranger training; both programmes are
making large contributions to the supply of needed manpower, while at the
University level, the College of Social Sciences will in time be expected
to have a considerable long term benefit that it will provide high level
manpower for the public administration and other authorities.
Institutional Capacity Building
4.2       This Project must be reviewed in relation to the previous three
Bank Group financed education projects as well as IDA V. Over the years,
three major institutes have developed suitable infrastructure, recruited
and trained efficient administrators and support staff, and developed the
accumulated management expertise which now enables them to operate
efficiently and effectively.
4.3       The EBCA which was involved in the management of previous
projects (paragraphs 2.4-2.7), was also entrusted with the management of
this one in addition to other construction responsibilities. The overall
performance was very good (paragraph 2.7) and the PIU is capable of
implementing larger projects. Both EMPDA and The National Curriculum



- 21 -
Development Centre (NCDC) have emerged along similar lines by nature of
their compleraentary functions. With well developed planning and management
capabilities they are now endeavorouring to develop their Research
capacities. The implementation of IDA V and other projects should pose no
problem for them.
4.4       NCDC has become semi-autonomous with an efficient administration,
and proper financial control. The well organized Curriculum Division with
competent subject panels, has a permanent well trained staff, and has
obtained international recognition from the Science Education Programme for
Africa (SEPA), the African Curriculum Organization (ACO), and several other
bodies. It has suitable uquipment and adequate supplies for all
operations.
4.5       In the MOE, the Planning Division has become very efficient in
planning education investment projects. Consequently, a Project Management
Office has been established to manage IDA V, and from all indications the
Project is making very satisfactory progress.
Expansion of Educational Opportunities in Rural Areas
4.6       This major objective has been overwhelmingly achieved at all
three levels of education as reflected by the relative educational
indicators (Annex IV.1).
4.7       New schools have been built in all of the 14 regions and 102
Awrajas. There are 572 Weredas and schools were constructed in 558 of
them. Most of the schools were built in rural areas. This expansion of
educational opportunities is reflected in the table below.

4.03 of the Appraisal Report: "...through self-help and/or the
development of more inexpensive designs using local materials,
additional schools would be built."

supported by SIDA and including a high. level of community pa,.icipation.
The tables below reflect this expansion in enrollment ratio and average
growth rate.

seven years.  Of particular interest was the sharp increase in female
enrollment as had been anticipated at Appraisal (paragraphs 3.01 and 4.03).

35/ An additional 200 Primary schools, 7 Junior Secondary schools, and 6
Senior Secondary schools were built, under the amendment of 13 March
1980.
36/ The Appraisal Report does not indicate growth rate, but does state that
female participation rate was about 30 perceut of total enrollment
(paragraph 3.01) in 1973/74.



- 23 -
4.10      These 750 Primary schools, 22 Junior Secondary schools and 14
Senior Secondary schools in rural areas provided about 160,000 school
places (117,000 estimated at Appraisal) thereby helping to reduce
educational inequalities that existed between rural and urban communities,
as well as increased educational opportunities in the regions. This
detailed expansion in shown in Annex IV.2.
Comments
4.11      There are two shifts in most schools, as expected and noted in
the Staff Appraisal Report, and some secondary schools rotate the groups so
as to allow each to benefit from the climatic conditions.
4.12      Some major handicaps to student learning:
-    Shortages of dwellings or overcrowded Community Funded
Hostels (50 to 80 students to a hall);
-    Personal upkeep - students from afar go home on weekends for
a supply of food for the following week; late arrival or
absence on Monday is not infrequent.
-    Lack of electricity or other improved lighting causes the
students to study by candlelight and when off shift.
-    Some equipment is not yet being used because of the absence
of water and electricity; therefore, science teaching is
mostly theortical.
4.13      The MOE is undertaking a systematic evaluation of the cirriculum
(IDA V), and although it is much too early to give any reliable assessment,
the Completion Mission gained positive impressions of efficiency
including: very high enrollment and attendance record, growth rates and
transition ratio, low dropout, and high pass and low failure rates. The
Bank Group was conservative in its allocation of space per student and the
Government provided even less than allocated in the. project (Annex III.4).
Thus, primary school class sizes vary from 40-50, but according to
teachers, this size does not cause any deterioration in quality, or pose
any problem in teaching vis-a-vis quality of education.
4.14      At the secondary level, 70 percent of Junior Secondary school
graduates enter Senior Secondary schools; others enter Government
services. At the Senior Secondary level, entrance to the University is
mainly on achievement but with seats reserved to admit students from
backward areas; those not admitted enter specialized training institutions,
or work in local organizations.
4.15      Government sources, as well as bilateral agencies engaged in
educational projects, have expressed some concern that the quality of
education might not be at expected levels in view of the rapid quantitative



- 24 -
expansion. The Completion Mission, however, could not draw any conclusions
about quality because the samples of examiration results available were too
few for valid comparisons even though the results achieved were good.
Purthermore, it was not possible to comp're IDA IV project schools with
non-project ones. This is an area requiring a special study in the future
when all schools are fully equipped and adequately staffed.
4.16      On the basis of discussiouis held with Government authorities and
visits made to some schools, the Completion Mission concluded that certain
changes have occurred in Ethiopian society as to education demand and
opportunity. These changes include the desire of parents to send their
children to school and the expansion and improvement of education through
providing more student places and good facilities which has led to increase
enrollment notably among girls. Hand in hand with this expansion have
appeared certain social advances such as the following: improvement of
personal welfare through better health care and personal hygiene; higher
income per family; greater social mobility both vertically and
horizontally; and greater enthusiasm and participation in national
development.
4.17      It can therefore be concluded that the first uspect of the
objective (paragraph 1.18) of this project item - expansion of educational
opportunities in rural areas - was successfully achieved and the expected
benefit (paragraph 1.21(a))-improvement of education opportunity - was
attained.
Educational Broadcasting (Radio)
General
4.18      This project item was based on the expansion of radio
broadcasting from a small two-statitit system to a nationwide eleven-station
network. It foresaw the provision of buildings for transmission stations,
furniture, software, specialized equipment, mobile repair units and
programme production support. The item was to be supported by bilateral
assistance in the form of nine additional transmitters and from Unicef
through the provision of 15,000 radio receivers.
4.19      In December 1976, however, the bilateral source of assistance
withdrew its support. It was thereupon agreed that the Project be amended
to include the additional costs related to the transmitters and also to
cover the costs of expert servlces (a radio engineer previously employed by
UX technical assistance - Amendnent of September, 1978).
4.20      Due to rising costs, Unicef was unable to meet the full expense
of the 15,000 radio receivers. However, a bilateral source (USSR) provided
6,000 while Unicef funds provided 8,484 receivers. A further 3,000
receivers had been provided by IJnicef before the official start of the
Project.



- 25 -
Current Situation (Annex IV.4 for full details)
4.21      The Project provided nine transmitter stations, each station has
three small tranismitting studios, a 1-kw transmitter, tape recorder and
programme logger and acceptor/rejector unit. The buildings have been
desigried so that it will be possible at a later date to easily add two
further transmitting channels. Eleven antennae have been purchased and
rigged. Ten stations (nine new and one old up-graded) are broadcasting,
the elaventh (up-graded) at Asmara should be in operation in the near
future.  Programmes are produced centrally and then despatched (in tape
'oriax) to the transmitting stations for broadcasting. Some dis_-ussions are
on-going as to whether it might be feasible to decentralize a certain
p.riportion of the programme pros .ction (especially for non-formal
educational programmes).
4.22      Ten mobile repair vans have been purchased and will be allocated
on a regional basis for assisting in the maintenance of radio receivers,
televisions and other audio-visual equipment.
Comments
4.23      This project item has achieved its full objective (paragraph
1.18(a)) especially in the use of local languages in education (Annex IV.4
for details). One point however, is the lack of stand-by electrical
generators. Such generators are an essential emergency back-up to
brodcasting as one power failure at one transmitter during school
broadcasting time will disturb the whole sequence of programmes for the
semester. One such stand-by generator has already been donated (Unicef)
and is in place.
4.24      With hindsight, it appears that such a provision should have been
included in the Project and also that subsequent project savings should
have been diverted to the purchase of standby generators37/.
Curriculum Development
4.25      This component of the Project entails two aspects: (a) completion
of the writing and illustration of new textbooks, teachers' guides, and
other educational materials with emphasis on practical skills; and (b)
training and re-training of teachers in the use of (a) above. Both of
these elements have been successfully accomplished.
Textbook Development
4.26      The previous project funded the first cycle of curriculum
development which ended in August 1977 with the production of 175 titles.
The second phase, under this project, (IDA IV), concentrated on the
completion of writing and revision of textbooks and materials based upon
37/ Purchase of standby generators w&s discussed on several occasions.
However, due to limited funds, it was apparently decided to risk the
loss of power versus funding other priority items.

try-outs in 70 experimental schools with feed-back from teachers and
administrators, followed by summative evaluation by the staff of the NCDC.
On the basis of the satisfaction with the cirriculum as expressed by the
MOE authorities and the Completion Mission's inspection and understanding
of the English versions, the Mission concluded that the curriculum is
relevant and suitable to the Ethiopian society and is of acceptable
quality. Presently, 150 titles of textbook manuscripts have been produced
under IDA IV. These were subsequently printed and distributed to schools
in addition to teachers' guides and other materials by EMPDA. A table of
completed materials in both phases is shown in Annex IV.5. The NCDC is to
be expanded under IDA V especially in the area of science teaching.
Training and Re-training of Teachers
4.27      The second task of the NCDC after the preparation of materials
was to introduce the new materials to teachers through seminars ard
work6hops. Each seminar lasted from 10-15 days with the participation of
20,000 teachers. Workshops were shorter in duration and 5,082 teachers
benefitted from the experience. The use of the facilities and staff of the
Commission for Higher Education facilitated greatly the effectiveness in
this area.
Primary
4.28      Formal teacher education at the primary level is conducted
through in-service and pre-service programmes. The former takes 4-6
residential weeks at 11 Teachers Training Institutes (Annex IV.6) while the
latter is of a year's duration. In addition, teachers also receive
training at Awraja Pedagogical Centres where they have the opportunity to
become familiar with new instructional materials as well as new
instructional techniques. Here teachers are encouraged to be creative and
innovative and feed-back from them irnfluences the revision of materials.
Not only are teachers trained but so are potential administrators of
primary schools. This is a continuous process in which about 28,000
teachers have been trained to teach the new curriculum effectively^ The
list of subjects and distribution of periods per week at a Teacher Training
Institute is shown in Annex IV.7. The 'Table below reflects the
accomplishment in this endeavor:

4.29      The training of secondary school teachers is the responsibility
of the Commission for Higher Education. Junior secondary teachers receive
their education at Teacher Education Colleges to Diploma level while the
Addis Ababa University and Bahr Dar Teachers College prepare teachers for
senior secondary schools.
4.30      The new curriculum including teachers guides, student textbooks
and teaching aids are used at both levels of training. At the University
level resource persons from the Curriculum Department act as guest
lecturers. In order to liaise more closely with higher education
institutions, the NCDC has recently created a new post for the effective
performance of this important function.
4.31      During the last four years, 1979-1982, the following number of
secondary school teachers graduated from Pre-Service programmes in various
colleges and faculties as follows:
Degree (B.A., B.Ed.)                 Diploma (12 + 2)
Social Sciences           302        General                  1,491

4.32      In addition, the MOE administered it continuing education fo:
secondary school teachers (in-service programming) in which 2,538 degree
holders and 5,729 diploma holders participated; 918 diploma holders
graduated from the programme and therefore received their first degree
(Annex IV.8).
4.33      Therefore, 13,763 teachers received instruction in the teaching
of the new curriculum and its related materials. This project item
(paragraph 4.25) has therefo,re had a very successful outcome.
Emphasis on Practical Skills
4.34      At the primary level this aspect of the curriculunm is very
pronounced. Emphasis on handicrafts is given adequate attention in the
time table. The teaching of gardening is integrated into the teaching of
science with sufficient time for practical skills38/ in the field, and the
sale of garden crops provides supplementary funds7or school use39/; the
cirriculum is balanced, relevant4O/, suitable and is appropriateFto the
rural enviornment as expressed in paragraph 4.06 of the Staff Appraisal
Report.
4.35      At the secondary level, however, the anticipated 12 periods of
the 30 weekly periods to be devoted to practical studies have not yet been
implemented per se.  Although the new curriculum is being used, the
shortage of qualified teachers, lack of water and electricity in some
secondary schools, and late arrival of equipment at others, are major
reasons for the delay.
4.36      However, students do devote much out-of-school time to working in
the communities under the supervision of Peasant Associations, School
Management Committees, or in thr Kebeles4l/ where they learn additional
practical skills and also apply what they have learnt theoretically in the
classroom. A sense of community participation and the dignity of labour is
nurtured and developed through such activities. Thus the focus on
education for employrient and for wider participation in national
development is, in practice, achieved (Paragraph 4.06 of Staff Appraisal
Report).

Conclusion
4.37      Curriculum development over the last few years has been
systematic, and its transition from a pilot level to adoption nationwide
took into account the needed complementarities such as training and
re-training of teachers, development of textbooks and related educational
materUnls and provision of physical facilities. Through try-outs in
experimental schools, monitoring and revisions were made.
'.38      The curriculum appears to be succeeding in its emphasis on
changing Actitudes towards the current emphasis of society upon acquision
of knowledge, and the development of skills, all of which have been
developed in the environmental context of the students.
4.39      Although there seems to be a balance between theory and aractice,
this balance is adequately maintained at the primary level, but is mostly
absent at the secondery level where suitable physical facilities for
practical work have not been provided (paragraph 4.35).
The College of Social Sciences
Overview
4.40      This project component was very successful, and its three
objectives (a) consolidation, (b) integration, and (c) provision of
graduates for p.'blic administration were achieved. This success is in
harmony with Government policy and is as anticipated in the Staff Appraisal
Report. However, because of the nature of the component, time will be
required for full realization of the effective integration of the teaching
and research programme.
Consolidation
4.41      The consolidation of all social sciences under one roof and
administration has been completed very successfully (Annex IV.9) and the
administration of the College seems to be efficient.
Integration of Teaching and Research
4.42      The integration of teaching and research is making progress, but
will still require some time to become fully operational, mainly due to a
shortage Gf staff as a result of the closure of the University for two
years during which many expatriates and local senior staff went abroad.
4.43      However, presently there are about eight senior staff members
abroad on sabbatical leave in Italy and Great Britain conduxcting research.
Three professors are at the University doing part-time teaching and
conducting functional res!arch, having won Ford Foundation grants on a
industrial psychology re.'atins, productivity in government corporations,
and political science.



- 30 -
4.44      A few other staff members have been seconded to the Institute of
Development Research and also to the Research and Publication Office, where
the emphasis is upon the development of teaching materials.
4.45      In addition, a vigorous staff development programme is being
implemented.  Aft.r one year as a graduate assistant, fellowships are
awarded for recipients to pursue their second degree both at the local
level and abroad. Two persons under this programme returned in 1981 and
eight are abroad while five more were expected to go away in 1982. In the
meantime, 23 graduates are following masters programme at the Addis Ababa
University Graduate School. With such a promising programme it is
envisioned that the integration of teaching and research will progress and
become more coherent and effective in the future.
Provision of Graduates for Public Administration
4.46      Having started in these premises only a year ago, there were 505
graduates in July 1982, and of these 17 were graduates in public
administration. Registration for the 1982/83 academic year was taking
place at the time of the Completion Mission's visit and therefore it was
not possible to know what the new enrollment would be. However, the Dean
indicated that there appeared to be a rising demand for graduates in this
area, but there was a shortage of staff and enrollment was low.
4.47      In compliance with its policy of decentralization at the Awraja
level, the Government, through the Ministry of the Interior, recruited 14
of the 17 graduates as deputy administrators of Awraja Rural Development
Centres.  These young recruits are undergoing a 3-month on-the-job training
programme at the Regional Headquarters after which they will be assigned to
their new posts, as follows:

Total                        14                       14
4.48      The College of Social Sciences is therefore fulfilling a major
responsibility by supplying trained middle level local manpower capable of
planning and executing development projects.

Use of Facilities
4.49      At Appraisal it was estimated that about 700 students would be
enrolled in the regular day programme and about 5,000 in the Extension
Division Evening Programme. At the end of the last academic year (1981/82)
there were 2,303 students in the regular programme and 3,565 in the
Extension Division (2,000 admitted for 1981/82). These numbers are
expected to increase in the 1982/83 academic year (Annex IV.9).
4.50      All facilities are therefore fully utilized and scheduling of
classes is becoming taxing, especially multiple courses with multiple
sections.
4.51      Except for the Extension Division and Freshmen offices, which are
still located in the old Arts Building, all other programmes are located in
the New Facilities, as planned. Vacated premises are being used by other
programmes as agreed at Appraisal.
4.52      Efficient administration is enhanced by all offices being located
on the same floor (second) while classrooms and the library are on the
lower floors.
4.53      These new facilities have brought about increased enrollment,
provided opportunities for improvement of quality of education through
teaching and research, and stimulated a vigorous staff development and
research programme, all of which forecast a promising future.
Conclusions
4.54      This is one of the most successful components of the Project and
its impact upon the development of social sciences is already becoming
visible, but more time will be required for the full integration of
teaching and research and for a more complete assessment of impact.
Health Assistant Training Centres
General
4.55      The three project financed Centres were to produce health
assistants for staffing Health Stations and to offer short refresher
courses to existing dressers42/.  These Centres were to be constructed
with a capacity of 120 place7sand each Centre was to be supported by the
additional construction of five Health Stations.  These Health Stations
were each to be provided with residential accommodaLion for 12 trainees and
were also to be sited in close proximity to the HATCs.  As a result of an
agreed site change, it was found that sufficient Health Stations were
already available in proximity to these sites. The Borrower therefore
requested the deletion of these 15 Health Stations.
4.56      Course length for training was to be 18 months including a
three-month internship.
42/ A medical orderly with one year of first aid training after grade 8.



- 32 -
Current Situation (Annex IV.lO for details)
4.57      All three HATCs are in operation having each produced one batch
of health assistants, with the second batch due to qualify in December
1982. Detailed course structures have been prepared and are kept to. The
Centres appear to be adequately staffed and equipped. Due to the lack of
provision of residential accommcdation, some of the teaching space provided
has to be used for dormitory accommodation and for similar reasons some of
the residential accommodation constructed for teaching staff is also
utilized as trainee dormitories43/.
4.58      At Awassa no piped water is yet available and investigations are
being made into the possibilities of linking the H&TC to a town water
project currently being implemented.
Conclusions
4.59      The main problem for the HATCs is the lack of residential
accommodations for trainees. It is not clear why this need was not
foreseen at Apnr&'- .l since each HATC included residential accommodation
for six ''-'      u .erso This problem of student accommodation was raised
several  ^..       :g supervision missions, the last occasion being in June
1980. At this date it was decided that the savings incurred through not
building the specified Health Stations (paragraph 4.54) would not be
sufficient for constructing dormitories in all three HATCs but no mention
was made of possible transfers of other general savings (covering the who
project) to ensure that this item was adequately completed. In the event,
(despite the pleas of the Ministry of lealth), no subsequent action was
taken. The
result is that teaching facilities are being used for dormitories and
trainees are thus taught in large blocks o£ 80 per class instead of in
groups of 40 as proposed at Appraisal.
4.60      The question of future outputs of health assistants was not
sufficiently detailed in the Staff Appraisal Report. It can be noted that
the planned output of the Bank Group supported HATCs would be of the order
of 180 per annum plus in-service training of about 100 dressers while the
other HATCs will produce another 350, giving a national total output per
annum of around 520. The current number of Health Stations is 1,850 with a
proposed staffing of three assistants per station. At a five percent
wastage rate, only 277 replacement health assistants would be required per
annum, leaving a theoretical margin of enough production of health
assistants to cater for 100 additional Health Stations per annum.
43/ This solution still leaves the problem of kitchens and sanitary
facilities.

Home Economics Department
General
4.61      The project supported the establishment of a Home Economics
Department at the Ambo Institute of Agriculture which would be based on 40
female students following a two-year post-secondary course, and this was
subsequently constructed.
Current Situation
4.62      The Ambo Institute of Agriculture as a post-secondary institution
now comes under the Commission for Higher Education. This transfer of the
administrative control of the Institute (previously Ministry of
Agriculture) has resulted in a more integrated approach to post-secondary
level education. As a result, home economics education has been
concentrated to date at Kotobe Teachers Training College. Also since 1977
a Junior College in Agriculture which was established at Awassa has also
run a specialized course in Home Economics.
4.63      The result is that the buildings provided at Ambo are, except for
the dormitories, being used for purposes other than the teaching of Home
Economics. The equipment provided for the Department is currently being
used at Kotobe. It should be noted however that the buildings have allowed
for an expansion of enrollment at Ambo and that with the provision of
additional dormitories, girls are able to partake in the general
agricultural course. In addition, with the integrated approach to
post-secondary education a further twenty female students have followed an
agricultural teacher training course. This was a two-year course with the
first year being underteken at Ambo and the second year (which includes
Home Economics) being given at Kotobe. It is planned that Ambo will be
converted in the near future to include a strong Agricultural Education
Department which will provide a specialized course in Home Economics.
OCnclusions
4.64      One point which has not been given sufficient attention at
Appraisal was the impossibility of adding a specialized (and also single
sex oriented) subject to a general course. Ambo Institute of Agriculture
produced and still produces general agriculturists on a general course
basis coverine both male and female students. The solution to the problem,
namely a split course between two ins itutions was in reality the only way
out of such a non sequitur situation. The transfer of this project item to
the Cc;amission for Higher Education also gave rise to difficultA.es
regarding the take up of fellowships.  'hree fellowships had been foreseen
in Home Economics and the Commission for Higher Education selected two
female candidates and found places for them in July 1981. However, due to
the lack of funds at this late stage of the Project, the fellowshiips could
not be awarded (Annex II.2).

Forest Ranger Training Centre and the Cooperative Training Centre
General
4.65       The Forest Ranger Training Centre (FRTC) was to provide
post-secondary training on a two-year basis with a capacity of 40 student
places while the Cooperative Training Centre (CTC) was to provide a
post-junior secondary course for 80 students on a 10-month course. In the
case of the FRTC, additional support in the form of expert staff was to be
provided through bilateral assistance (UK) while in the case of the CTC,
fellowships were foreseen. In actuality, neither of these two institution
have been constructed.
Background
4.66      The background to the reasons for the non-construction of these
two centres, which constituted about 3 percent of the total original
estimated project cost, is complex.
4.67      The principal reason relates to the reorganization of
post-secondary education which was affected when the Commission for Higher
Education came into being as a result of Proclamation 109 of January 1977
and the resultant relationship with the Ministry of AgricuLture (at the
time of Appraisal the Ministry of Agriculture was to be responsible for
both institutions but the change meant that responsibilities for all
post-secondary education were transferred to the Commission for Higher
Education).
4.68      The Commission for Higher Education also established, in October
1977, a Junior College in Agriculture at Debre Zeit which included a
specialized section on cooperatives and the Ministry of Agriculture later
indicated that a new Cooperative Training Centre would thus no longer be
required (reported in Supervision Report of June 1978).
4.69      However, no formal action on the deletion of this item was taken
at this time and at a further stage (July 1980 Supervision Report), the
Commission for Higher Education indicated that they were again considering
establishing the Centre. In November 1980, it appears that the Supervision
Mission understood that the responsibility for cooperative training had
returned to the Ministry of Agriculture but at the same time, the
Commission for Higher Education was selecting and trying to place a person
for a fellowship in cooperatives. Finally, in August 1981, the Supervision
Mission and relevant Government officials decided, after discussion, that
insufficient funds were available for the construction of the Cooperative
Training Centre, or, for the Forest Ranger Training Centre. Although the
Ministry of Finance, in March 1982 requested the witthdrawal of these items,
as the Project was already completed, no action was necessary.
4.70      The question of the Forest Ranger Training Centre followed very
much the same pattern as above with the additional complications of the
withdrawal of the bialteral assistance component, and the fact that a



- 35 -
course was started for Forest Ranger Training in existing facilities at
Wando Genet with instructors provided by another bilateral source (SIDA)
and Birr 176,000 was withdrawn from the Credit for use in maintenance work,
small constructional alterations, and purchase of furniture at this Centre.
4.71      These changes Ln the project item were discussed by the
Supervision Mission of June 1978 and followed up by a letter from the Bank
Group (7 July 1978) which confirmed that costs of renovation, new
construction - as detailed by the Supervision Mission - and purchase of
pertinent equipment would all be eligible for reimbursement from the
Credit. It is curious therefore, to find that following supervision
missions, right up to the completion date of the Credit, kept insisting on
the construction of a new Forest Ran3er Training Centre especially as some
funds had been in fact disbursed against the Centre at Wondo Genet where
the output of Forest Rangers was also above the figure suggested at
Appraisal.
Comments
4.72      A reorganizaion of post-secondary education which effectively
brought together under one administration dispersed, multi-faceted and
previously uncoordinated unities, obviously requires considerable time and
study. Questions of duplication of effort, re-allocation of resources and
relationships to national manpower demand, cannot be immediately settled
and it would appear that in reality needs of the cadres of forestry44y a,pd
possibly those of cooperatives are being met, albeit in an ad hoc fasison,
despite the elimination of the two proposed training centres.
Awraja Rural Development Centres
General
4.73      The Project provided for 24 Awraja Rural Development Centres as a
base for the integration of rural development activities under a "self-
administration" approach for localized governmental activities in selected
Awrajas.
4.74      The first six of such ARDCs were constructed under this framework
but then internal political revisions operated to further change the
concept of "self-administration" and place it into a total national
programme.
4.75      Under the new programme a regional tier was introduced, and the
Borrower proposed and the Bank Group accepted, that five of the remaining
18 ARDCs be constructed as Regional Centres (May, 1979).
44/ The Centre at Wondo Genet, now termed the Forestry Resource Institute,
has a current capacity of 140 students on a two-year course with an
output of about 70 Rangers/annum cf. Appraisal output-20.



- 36 -
Current Situation
4.76      All 24 centres (19 Awraja and five regional) are constructed with
23 now operating. The 24th at Assab is expected to be fully completed and
operational in the near future.
4.77      Certain operating problems exist at the Regional centres, because
no modifications were made in the design, even though at the regional
level, more staff has to be provided for.
4.78      Due to the increased local involvemenit in rural development
activities, the hall is usually too small for larger meetings and in many
cases, local communities have built separate larger halls (NOTE: A hall was
not included in the project since it was expected that the community would
construct this space).
4.79      In-service courses are carried out and to date, 570 staff of the
Weredas have undergone training. Courses for Weredas45/ administrators
are planned for November 1982 (500 participants) and refresher courses are
planned for 102 administrators at Awraja level in early 1983.
Conclusions
4.80      Thse Centres, both at Awraja and regional levels, appear to be
functioning well and provide the necessary base for the coordination and
stimulation of rural development activities.
Centre of Alternative Technology
General
4.81      Support for this Centre (now officially termed the Appropriate
Technology Centre) was first provided by an amendment to IDA III. The
Centre also receives support from Unicef in the areas of expert assistance
and running costs. Originally IDA IV was to provide expert services and
fellowships for Community Skill Training Centres but in January 1978, the
Borrower requested that this element of technical assistance be deleted and
replaced by equipment, materials and running costs for the Approprite
Technology Centre. This request was accepted by the Bank Group.
Comments
4.82      The PCR for IDA III provided considerable detail on this item and
concluded that it was based on a very realistic practical approach to
important elements of rural development. An existing problem however,
relates to the need to develop a strong network for the diffusion of the
products of the Centre down to the. village level. It is thought that as
Community Skill Training Centres further develop, this problem will be met
as the findings of the Centres can be fed into the CSTC system.
45/ 35 Deputy Wereda administraLors were recruited from Ambo Institute of
Agriculture in 1982.

Community Skill Trair.ing Centres
General
4.83      The first mention of these Centres was in submission made through
the Planning Commission to the Association in June 1972 based on proposals
for IDA IV made by an Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee chaired by the
MOE. Such Centres, however, were not included in the project.
Subsequently an Appraisal Mission (October-November 1974) for IDA IV
re-discussed such centres and as a result recommended the inclusion of 100
centres into the IDA IV Project.
4.84      As a result of changed circumstances, the Borrower, in June 1976,
requested that funds previously provided under IDA III for the Orthodox
Church Training Centre be diverted to the funding of Community Skill
Training Centres. These proposals included a consolidated funding
programme for Community Skill Training Centres within the framework of IDA
1TI, IV and V covering 320 new centres.
4.85      Further action on this consolidated funding concept was taken in
October 1976 when it was formally presented as part of the proposals for
IDA V.
4.86      The Appraisal Mission for IDA V (January 1977) further discussed
the matter, but the Mission, while accepting that the centres were a very
good project item, maintained that with 100 centres (IDA IV) plus the 180
requested as an amendment to IDA III, sufficient funds were already
committed to the CSTC development. The IDA V subsequently supported only a
further 60 centres.
4.87      One difficulty over these CSTCs can be mentioned and that is
relative to the ordering of equipment. The Appraisal Report IDA IV clearly
stresses the practical skills training of rural craftsmen and refers to
supply of tools for skills training. In contrast, therefore, it is
difficulty to understand why, in June and July 1977, the Bank Group
commenting on equipment, gave the highest priority to overhead projectors,
film projectors and radios, while regarding tools for skills training
stated that "funds permitting, it would be useful to have sets of tools for
demonstration of useful skills". These comments were accompanied by the
criticism that the programmes offered reflected a shift in the direction of
manual skills as against communication skills - again a complete contrast
to the tone of the above-mentioned Appraisal Report.
4.88      This problem was subsequently resolved and the equipment lists
suggested by the Borrower were in essence accepted, as also were the
programmes.



- 38 -
Present Situation
4.89      Ninety-five of the 100 CSTCs financed under this project had at
the time of Completion Mission been constructed. The five awaiting
construction are in areas of poor communication but the necessary materials
are stored ready for construction. This means that a total of 381
established CSTCs are now operating.
4.90      At the time of tbe Mission, onr-going activities were minimal due
to the onset of harvest. (The programmes are scheduled to avoid peak
agricultural work seasons.)
4.91      A full discussion on the CSTCs was made in the PCR of IDA III
which concluded that the results obtained were most encouraging.The
education given depends most strongly on the demand and support of the
rural community, and the local Farmers Association appear to be strongly
committed. These points were ic-observed and re-inforced during the
current mission.
4.92      Thus in summary, the CSTCs are providing a very effective
approach to education in the rural areas. Beside their important role in
increasing skill levels, including farming skills, they provide general
educational uplift and will form an important vehicle for post-literacy
back-up.                                   . c
4.93      An evaluation excercise has been carried out by the Department of
Adult Education of the MOE, based on 12 CSTCs in five regions. The report
of this evaluation exercise is not yet fully translated into English but
some of the data collected are illustrated in Annex IV.L1, and snmmarized
below:

Lessons Learned
Borrower
4.94      The Borrower has developed effective developmental strategies
through motivation and involvement of the populace in site selection,
supply of materials and labour and through general encouragement of local
initiative and self-help. By motivating and mobilizing community
participation, savings have been accrued. The Government utilizes such
savings constructively in expanding educational facilities thereby speeding
up the process of equalization of educational opportunities in rural areas.
4.95      The maintenance of the project schools leaves much to be
desired. Both under IDA V and with SIDA support, funds are being provided
for maintenance of buildings and a maintenance kit will be left at each
school for instructional purposes as well as for continued maintenance.
Bank Group
4.96      Flexibility in determining the location of project institutions
as well as in the re-allocation of funds have enabled the Borrower to be
most responsive to national developmental needs. However, it is possible
that a more rigid set of criteria for site selection for certain
institutions (secondary schools and HATCs) might have eliminated the
problems of availability of water and electricity.
4.97      While library modules were constructed from the accrued savings
no funds were made available for the purchase of books.
Borrower and Bank Group
4.98      Because of the difficulty encountered in IDA IV regrding keeping
separate accounts for the Project, IDA V provides a specialist (TA) who has
assisted the PMO in organizaing the accounts at the start of the Project.
This will be a major achievemert of this Project, as it was such an
outstanding issue in IDA IV.
Recommendations
4.99      That an inventory be taken of all incomplete project items and
the Borrower should ensure that funds be provided to complete them.
4.100     That financial provisions be made by the Government to allow the
PMO and EBCA to provide continuous field supervision46/.
46/ A proposal for assistance under the African Development Fund will
provide funds for this task.



- 40 -
4.101     While flexibility by both the Borrower and Bank Group is
encouraged, greater consideration should be given to the availability of
water and electricity in close proximity to sites with due consideration to
the cost of connecting these to project institutions, since these serve as
serious impediments to the completion of many project facilities (paragraph
2.14).
4.102     That issues which seem unclear to the Borrower need to be
clarified at an early stage of project Implementation (e.g. technical
assistance, fellowships and the keeping of accounts-paragraphs 2.37 and
2.38).
4.103     In the absence of the above recommendations, the Completion
Mission suggest that there be a thorough mid-term review of ongoing project
implementation with a veiw to identifying and immediately correcting any
existing problems and shortcomings. The Government, however, feels that
this is not necessary and considers that ongoing Bank Group supervision
missions carry out the above mentioned functions effectively. A continuous
dialogue is always maintained with the Bank Group and thus the Government
feels that such a Review Mission would be superfluous.

CHAPTER V
BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE
5.1       The overall performance of the Bank Group was appropriate to the
circumstances prevailing at appraisal and implementation.
5.2       Details of the number and composition of the supervision missions
can be found under Basic Data. The Project was supervised by 13 missions
excluding the UNESCO Completion Mission.
5.3       The interval between missions was between five and eight months
with 33 percent in the six months bracket. A mission averaged two weeks in
the country. An architect participated in all the 13 missions, a general
educator in 11, a technical educator in 4 and an agricultural educator,
accountant and mass media specialist once each. Apart from the Completion
Mission (Unesco), other missions were all Bank missions but including in
some cases a FAO staff member47/ as agricultural educator, a Unesco staff
member as general educatory and a consultant as accountant.
5.4       The concept and design as approved and amended were appropriate
to Ethiopia's changing cultural and socio-economic conditions.
5.5       Major project modifications, such as having constructions work
carried out by force account (which worked very satisfactorily) instead of
private firms, building additional facilities and the purchase of nine
radio transmitters, were done with efficiency; also a good
working relationship has been established between Bank Group staff and
Government officials. In this context mention should be made of the most
apparent benefits of working through a Regional Mission. In this
particular case this led to good continuity of staffing of supervision
missions, with a resulting close understanding with the Borrower, and the
use of a regional structure could also be said to be a factor in the
constructive flexibility demonstrated by the Bank Group during the
implementation of the Project.
5.6       The complexity of the Project (i.e. its inter-ministerial
aspects) meant that an important part of the time devoted to supervision
was spent in Addis Ababa and often concerned the supervision of more than
one project. The result is that some institutions (Secondary schools and
Awraja Rural Development Centres) may not have been sufficiently supervised
in detail especially during the period towards the end of the building
stage, thus it is now found that some institutions are in fact not fully
completed.
47/ The Bcirower feels that, while such persons may provide valuable new
ideas, at the same time the lack of their subsequent involvement in the
Project leads to a break in the continuity necessary for effective
implementation.



- 42 -
5.7       As the Borrower changed its priorities, the Bank Group adopted a
flexible attitude in its attempt to assist the Borrower in meeting the
basic project objectives by approving changes in site selection,
reallocating proceeds among credit categories, and extending the
disbursement period.
5.8       On all major issues the Project ran smoothly and in global terms
communication between the Borrower and the Bank Group was excellent.
However, as indicated above in Chapter II, some minor issues were not
properly dealt with.  These issues contained an occasional, apparent lack
of clear communication and understanding between the Borrower and Bank
Group; for example, the questions of extending the Project to allow for
fellowships to be taken up, of Forest Ranger training and of Rome Economics
teaching at Ambo. However it must be emphasized that these were
exceptional cases and in no way detract from the overall picture of good
cooperation and understanding.
5.9       A further general issue concerns a possible lack of balance at a
late stage of the Project over the allocation of savings. There does not
seem to have been sufficient time allowed for discussion of the options
available i.e. would it have been better to spend the unallocated funds for
dormitories for Health Training Centres rather than for mobile radio repair
vans? Or even within the broadcasting section, would standby generators be
a better buy than the mobile vans? These questions are obviously placed
with hindsight but the point remains that at this date the general
impression received is that of a rather rushed operation towards the end of
the Project. The purpose of this was to ensure that all unallocated funds
be spent as rapidly as possible - irrespective of the fact that some
institutions would be left facing difficult problems e.g. the Health
Training Centres. A further minor point concerns possible inadequate
technical back up when audio-visual equipment was ordered out of such
savings for the AAUSSC.
5.10      The previous paragraph tends to illustrate a classical problem
connected to Project formulation. This Project contained items for a
number cf Ministries outside of the mainstream of educational activities;
it was difficult, at times, for supervision missions to contact all the
Mialstries involved in the Project; also when it came to the reallocation
of savings it was obviously difficult to balance the varied requests and
needs coming for all the separate administrative sources. The question can
therefore be posed, is it better to restrict projects to one main Ministry,
or Authcrity, and thus have a series of smaller projects, or, follow the
procedures of this project and have a larger but multi-ministry type
formulation?
5.11      In summary the overall performance of the Bank Group can be
considered as being good and an excellent working relationship was
maintained between the Bank Group and the Borrower. The Bank however could
have been more specific in certain cases in that it:



- 43 -
Did not include in the criteria for site selection detailed
requirements as to the availability of electricity and
water, even though it had a second chance to do this when
reselection of sites took place (paragraph 2.14).
Tended to over-emphasize the use of sophisticated equipment
for the Community Skill Training Centres. The resultant
long drawn discussions on this point led to delay in
ordering the equipment (paragraph 4.87).
Failed to timely explain to the Borrower that fellowships
could not be funded late in the Project due to the fact that
funds had already been reallocated.

AWRAJA RURAL DEVELOPMENT CENTRES
Since IDA IV was negotiated and approved both by the World Bank and
the Government of Ethiopia, the strategy and focal point for the coordination
of the development effort of the country has been changed to the Administrative
Region level. This was made clear and explicit by the National Democratic
Revolutionary Programme and by the Proclamation (October 29, 1978) that
established the National Revolutionary Development Campaign and Central
Planning Supreme Council.
Hence, the strategy for the integration and coordination of development
projects is executed at the regional administrative levels. To what effect,
Proclamation No. 156 of 1978 which established the National Revolutionary
Development Campaigr. and Central Planning, states the following regarding the
power and duties of the administrative regions:
1. <(To ensure the proper implementation of the development campaign
and plan;
2. To endeavor that the peasants acquire the inputs necessary to
increase production, and ensure that the marketable products
reach the market in time;
3. To ensure that peasants and workers discharge their duties with
zeal and in due time;
4. To ensure that the natural resources in the province get proper
care;
5. To compile and submit, to executive committee of the Supreme
Council, in accordance with the directives and on the forms given
to it, statistical and other information and reports concerning
the implementation of development campaign and the plan together
with recommendations and amendments proposals; and
6. To agitate and mobilize the financial, material and human
resources in the province.)>
As can be gathered from the above quotation of the power and duties of
the regional development campaign and planning executive committees the
function of ARDC has not changed in substance except that the focal point of
coordination is changed to the next higher stage of administrative units. Thus,
the Awraja as a central point of integration and coordination of development
projects has not been abandoned. It will in turn, play the role of a coordinator
for the activities of the fWoredas* under it. Therefore, ARDCs will eventually
be necessary in all Awrajas.
Priority, however, must be given to establishing Regional Administrative
Rural Development Centres (RARDC). Within the new organizational structure two
offices of Deputy Chief Administrators are created. The one dealing with
development is the senior deputy chief administrator. He coordinates all
development projects - a similar function to that of the Awraja administrator in
the ARDC programme..

Dear 4r. Kapur,
in genieral the report under reference gives the true picture
in proper perspective.  we have only a few comments which are
given below:
_age Lo. 0Para lio.                        Comments
-ii-    Basic ±uata          &mmount is 28.2 mill. SDRo
Credit 1141-ET      At Appraisal equalled 35 mill-US$
-vii-         8              Bank Performance.  'b4e feel that
the existence of a regional tV4ice
in £airobi helps a lot0 klentt.
may be made of this in the re;rrt.
-vii-    9(ii) Second        The problem is not that the local
sentence           authorities are not cognizant of
the agreement, 2hey know it.
l'he problem is the actual difficulties
in commuaication which is very real.
6        l.20 Last          PVC stands for Primary Village Schools.
but one sentence.   It is not "provisional"t.
2)        4T30               2he statement "tEBCA managed the
tLiree previous projects" is inaccurate,
because the first project and a good
part of the second project were
manaCed by t4O1E Departments.

22        4.8                 The Statement "as a result of this
ProJect". In fairness it may be
modified to include other projects?
particularly SIDA aided and commiunity
participation which provided
considerably for expansion at
primary level.
23        4'4I4               Statement "entrance to the University
is on quota basis".   Entrance to
University is mainly based on achieve-
ment. But, seats are reserved to
admit students from backward areas.
Apart from these comments of minor nature, we consider the
2-eport good.
Kind regards.
