MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR AN EDUCATION SECTOR REINFORCEMENT PROJECT
1. The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development credit
to Madagascar for SDR 30.4 million (US$ 39.0 million equivalent) is submitted for
approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years
maturity, and would help finance an education sector reinforcement project. The
project would be cofinanced by UNDP (US$ 1.0 million), OPEC Fund for
International Development (US$ 5.0 million) and the Federal Republic of Germany
(US$ 1.1 million). France, the African Development Bank, and the World Food
Programe are providing complementary support.
2. Back_round. Madagascar has a large public and private education system, with
public sector primary enrollment of 1,260,000. Primary enrollment (public and
private) is about 75 percent of the age group. There are 190,000 in lower
secondary public school; 50,000 in upper secondary; and 36,000 in the
universities. The private sector has 225,000 primary pupils, 80,000 lower
secondary, and 35,000 upper secondary.
3. Primary and Secondary Education. In the mid-l7?Os Government introduced
education reforms, with the themes of democratization, decentralization and
Malagasization. Rapid expansion produced high enrollment in basic education and
continuing academic and technical education for many; educational administration
was partially decentralized; Malagasy replaced French in primary and lower
secondary schools, and curricula were modified. However, the unplanned expansion
and weak administration seriously eroded quality. Education now faces major
issues of cost and quality. Although unit costs are extremely low, 252 of the
Government operational budget is for education (cf. the 18t African average),
mainly due to high enrollments. Spending is unevenly distributed, favoring
higher education. Teachers are untrained, and books and teaching materials
scarce; student achievement is poor and repetition rates high.
4. Higher Education. University facilities were expanded and regionalized in the
late 19708. However, low baccalaureate standards and open admission led to a
costly surge of ill-qualified students. Spending on student grants, housing and
feeding programs leaves too little for education quality, and academic standards
have fallen.  Fewer than 201 of students complete their studies, so that although
costs per student are low compared with other, similar countries, the cost per
graduate is comparatively high.
5. Education Reform. In 1985, the Government adopted new education policies,
with greater emphasis on French at secondary level, higher baccalaureate
standards, and some measures to limit university access. Following extensive
internal debate, it has now embarked on a long-term sector development strategy,
including (i) giving priority to education quality rather than to further
quantitative expansion of secondary or tertiary education, (ii) controlling
education costs, including by restricting flows of students through the system,
(iii) giving priority to primary education in resource allocation, (iv) improving
administration, and (v) reorganizing vocational and technical education. It is
addressing the politically sensitive problems of the universities.



6.  ationale for IDA Znvolvement. During the educatlon refors of the latf.70s,
Government dld not seek sector dialogue with IDA. In 1985 dialogua resumed, with
a UNESCO/Bank sector study. Znter-ministerial working parties, with IDA PPF
support, prepared sector rehabilitation proposals. Covernment seeks contlnued
IDA involvement in developing sector strategies, and meeting sector financial
needs, which exceed what can be expected from other donors. DA participation in
this sector is a vital part of the country strategy to Improve public expenditure
prograuming and civil service management, for which reform efforts are supported
by the Public Sector Adjustment and the EconomLc Management and Social Action
Projects (Credits 1941 and 1967-MAG). Satisfactory development of the education
sector is crucial to the country's needs for further economic diversification and
growth, it is also vitally important in facing longer term problems such as
population and environment.
7. Prolect Obtectivos. The project would comence a major sector reform, through
policy measures and quality improvements, to implement the first part of the
Government's long-term strategy to improve efficiency and qualLty of education.
Recurrent costs at all levels will be controlled, to free resources for quality
improvement and increased primary enrollment. A rolling three-year sector public
expenditure program (PEP) will be agreed anually, reflecting lncreased spending
on primary education and on quality at all levels.   Vocational education and
training will progressively be re-oriented to employment needs.
S. Policy Measures. Government strategy includes policies to increase Internal
and external efficiency and to Improve quality.  Among these ares   (a), for
,rimarv and secondary education, (i) reorganization of the Ministry of Secondary
and Basic Education (INESEB) to create a Pedagogical Unit responsible for
educational quality, and planing and statistics services, (ii) regulation of
student flows to concentrate resources on primary education, (iii) development of
progrems to improve administrative efficiency and use of personnel, (iv)
reduction of primary school repetition rates, (v) replacement of national service
temporary teachers by qualified staff; (b), for the universities, preparation of
action plans on cost and financing Issues, administrative reforms, and curricula
modernization; and (c), for vocational and technical training, establisbment of
an inter-ministerial coordination structure, with employers participating.
9. Proiect Description. The project would have three componentst (a) Strenath-
ening administration and Dlannin in MINESEB, including computer and office
equipment, studies, and training; (b) CLualitv imurovement of basic and lower
secondary education, includings teacher support services (training and travel
costs for inspectors, advisers, and head-teachers); pre-service and in-service
training for teachers (setting up 6 primary and one lower-secondary teacher
training colleges: and re-cycling existing teachers); producing and distributing
school books; upgrading secondary school laboratories; and (c) Strenathenina
hiQher level education: setting up two short-cycle higher technical training
institutes; establishing an employment information service for students;
developing action plans to modernize university curricula, and to improve
university administration and the cost/financing balance at university level.
10.     The project would be carried out over five years.  1te estimated cost is
US$ 48.6 million equivalent, net of USS 6.4 million taxes; foreign exchange cost
is USS 34.8 million (722). Detailed costs and the financing plan are in Schedule
A. Procurement details and the disbursement schedule are in Schedule B. A
timetable of processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in



-4-
Madagascar are in Schedules C and D. A map is attached. Staff Appraisal Report
No. 8026-M&G, dated January 11, 1990, is being distributed separately.
11.     Agreed Actions.  The conditions of effectiveness wvuld be that the
Pe?agogical ana Project Units become operational, that a special account be
established, and that co-financing be secured.   The three-year rolling sector
PEP, giving priority to basic education and to quality at all levels, will be
reviewed annually with IDA; that for 1990-92 has been discussed and agreed.
Government will ensure that when completed, the project-financed training
colleges function at full capacity.  Directives will be issued to teachers to set
targets for reduced primary school repetition rates. MINESEB will coordinate
nutrition, environmental and population education, and prepare programs to
integrate such concerns into public education; it will also prepare programs to
increase enrollment of girls. The universities will not be expanded at least
until mid-1993. A vocational training coordination structure will be
established. A condition of disbursement on sub-components for university
quality improvement, rehabilitation of three primary teacher training colleges,
and production of six out of nine text-books, would be agreement on action plans
for university reform, improved education administration, and appropriate cost
recovery for school books.
12.     Justification.  Both economic and educational benefits are expected.
The institutional measures will improve long-term resource allocation, allowing
strengthening of quality and increased enrollment to respond to demographic
pressures, within the education budget likely to be available. The project will
increase student achievements at all levels, and reduce costs by allowing
students to complete education more quickly. Improved basic education should
indirectly improve health, nutrition, fertility, and agricultural production,
while improved vocational training and university quality will strengthen
manpower resources. Sector PEP projections show that on the basis of CRESED
strategies, taking into account the recurrent expenditure impact of the public
investment program, real recurrent public expenditure on education would grow
between 2 and 3 percent annually in the medium term, an increase consistent with
Bank macro-economic projections.
13.     Risks.  The political implications of some of the measures, such as
reducing staff or proposing university reform action plans, make their
implementation risky. To reduce these risks, the project has been prepared by
local technicians, but continuing dialogue to ensure Government's commitment to
reform will be essential. Each sub-component will be implemented by the relevant
line agency, assisted by a small unit chaired by the Minister of Secondary and
Basic Education, who also coordinated project preparation.
14.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
