REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
SECOND PROGRAMMATIC FINANCIAL AND PUBLIC SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LOAN SUNIMARY
Borrower:                   The Republic of Tirjcey
Amount:                    US$1.35 billion
Terrns:                    US$550 million on standard IBRD terms, payable in 15 years
including 5 years of grace and level principal repayment, at six
months LIBOR for US Dollars plus variable spread for
Variable Single Currency Loans; and US$800 million on
special structural adjustment loan (SSAL) terms, payable in 5
years including 3 years of grace and level principal repayment,
"at six months LIBOR for US Dollar plus 400 basis points.
Front End Fee:              I percent of Loan amounts
Commitment Fee:            0.75 percent on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days
after signing, less any waiver on the US$550 million amount
on standard IBRD terms.
Objectives and Description:  The proposed Second Programmatic Financial and Public
Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL II) is the second Loan in
support of the Governnent's multi-year financial and public
sector reform program. It follows on the first Programmatic
Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan of US$ 1.1 billion
approved in July 2001 (US$700 million on standard I3RD
terms and US$400 million on SSAL terms). The main
objective of the proposed PFPSAL 11 is to support the next
phase of the Government's financial and public sector reform
priorities in response to the February 2001 financial crisis,
while continuing to ensure that social programs are adequately
funded. Key priorities include, in the financial sector: (i)
overhaul of the regulatory framework for banking activity, (ii)
institutional development of the new Bank Regulation and
Supervision Agency (BRSA), (iii) problem bank/bank failure
resolution, and (iv) state bank restructuring and privatization;
and in the public sector: (a) a further deepening of structural
fiscal policies in support of sustainable fiscal adjustment, (b) a
broadening  of  the  Governnent's  public  expenditure
management reform program including the implementation of
concrete improvements to the framework for budget planning
and execution, financial accountability, and public liability

management, and (c) implementation of the Government's
strategy to strengthen public sector governance including
adoption and implementation of a national anti-corruption
strategy and initial steps towards civil service reform.
Benefits:                   The principal benefits of the Loan will be to: (i) support the
Government's macroeconomic policy framework which aims
to overcome the affects of the February crisis and create the
conditions for renewed growth and disinflation, (ii) restore
confidence in the banking system; (iii) strengthen the
foundation for an efficient and sound banking system which
can be competitive in quality and performance at the
international level; (iv) reduce the vulnerability of the banking
system and enhance its capacity to withstand external shocks
and thereby reduce systemic failure risk; (v) position Turkey's
banking sector for accession to the European Union (EU) by
starting the process of aligning the prudential regime for the
banking system with applicable EU banking sector directives;
(vi) support structural fiscal measures to underpin the
sustainability and quality of the fiscal adjustment needed to
achieve macroeconomic stability while ensuring that social
spending is protected; (vii) lay the foundation for durable
improvements to public expenditure management and fiscal
transparency in line with international standards; and (viii)
raise the quality of public sector governance. The PFPSAL II
will provide essential budgetary support to help the
Government finance the costs of recovering from the crisis
while continuing to fund its critical social programs.
Risks:                      The risks associated with the Government's financial and
public sector reform  program  arise from  macroeconomic
factors, political considerations and institutional weaknesses.
The key macroeconomic risk is that real interest rates will
remain higher than projected which would delay the economic
recovery and affect public debt sustainability. A related
macroeconomic risk factor is Turkey's vulnerability to both
internal and external shocks as evidenced by the impact of the
September 11 events. The commercialization and privatization
of the state-owned banks is a major political and organizational
challenge for the Govermnent. The rapid restructuring of Halk
and Ziraat also has significant fiscal and social implications.
While the Government has so far been able to raise sufficient
resources to finance the restructuring of the state banks and the
resolution of the banks under the Savings Deposit Insurance
Fund (SDIF), the public debt has increased sharply as a share
of GNP. Continued tight fiscal discipline and further reform



actions to bolster the confidence of domestic and international
investors in Turkish sovereign debt instruments will be
essential. Finally, satisfactory and timely failure resolution
efforts by the SDIF (for already intervened banks) and
enforcement of capital restoration plans by the BRSA (for non-
intervened banks) are important; the risk that such efforts will
fall short of what is needed is related to the political pressure
that may be put on these agencies for a slowdown of regulatory
enforcement action and general regulatory forbearance. The
public sector reform agenda is politically sensitive and may be
jeopardized by resistance of vested interest groups that would
prefer to maintain the status quo. Capacity constraints and
crisis management efforts at key Government agencies may
also slow down the pace of the envisaged public sector
reforms.
Schedule of Disbursements:  US$450 million (US$184 million on standard IBRD terms and
US$266 million on SSAL terms), including a 1 percent fee to
be paid to the IBRD, immediately after loan effectiveness
expected in April 2002, a second tranche of US$450 million
(US$183 million on standard IBRD terms and US$267 million
on SSAL terms) after fulfillment of second tranche release
conditions, and a third tranche of US$450 million (US$183
million on standard IIBRD terms and US$267 million on SSAL
terms) after fulfillment of third tranche release conditions.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
SECOND PROGRAMMATIC FINANCIAL AND PUBLIC SECTOR
ADJUSTMENT LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
1.    I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
second Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL II) to the Republic
of Turkey for US$1.35 billion to continue the Bank's support for the Government's multi-year
financial and public sector program. This program aims to restore confidence in the banking
system and correct the underlying structural problems in the public sector that created the
conditions under which financial crises like those which hit Turkey in November 2000 and
February 2001 could occur. The proposed loan will be in US Dollar Single Currency, partly on
standard IBRD terms (US$550 million) and partly on special structural adjustment loan terms
(US$800 million). The loan will be disbursed in three tranches. The first US$450 million
tranche (US$184 million on standard IBRD terms and US$266 million on SSAL terms) will be
disbursed immediately upon effectiveness, and the second and third tranches of US$450 million
each (US$183 million on standard IBRD terms and US$267 million on SSAL terms) upon
fulfillment of the second and third tranche release conditions as long as overall progress with the
program is also satisfactory.
2.    The proposed PFPSAL II is the second in a series of programmatic loans to be
implemented over the 2001-03 period in support of the Government's comprehensive reform of
the financial and public sectors. Under the PFPSAL program, the World Bank intends to
disburse a total of US$2.45 billion in adjustment lending to meet Turkey's external and
budgetary financing requirements arising from the crisis, and to support its short and medium
term reform goals in the financial and public sectors. The PFPSAL II follows on the first
Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL) of US$1.1 billion
(US$700 million on standard IBRD terms and US$400 million on SSAL terms) disbursed in a
single tranche in July 2001. Bank support for sustained implementation of reform in the
financial and public sectors would continue in the high case lending scenario through a series of
further programmatic loans as described in the CAS Progress Report (Report No. 22282-TU)
discussed by the Board together with the first PFPSAL in July 2001. Specifically, two
Programmatic Financial Sector Adjustment Loans (PFSAL I and II) of US$500 million each and
a Programmatic Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PPSAL) of US$375 million are envisaged. A
second PPSAL is tentatively envisaged beyond the current CAS period.
I.    INTRODUCTION
A.    Recent Economic Developments
3.    Macroeconomic outcomes have been mixed since the first PFPSAL was approved in
July. The program put in place in May 2001 in response to the currency crisis of February 2001
was designed to help Turkey rebound from the February shock and quickly resume economic

growth and disinflation. It combined tight demand management-centered on a large primary
surplus-with a market-based approach to managing the growing public debt burden, accelerated
financial sector restructuring and a large inflow of external official financing. However,
outcomes deviated significantly from program targets and Turkey was hit by another external
shock following the events of September 11. The financial turmoil which followed the decision
in February to abandon the crawling peg exchange rate and float the Lira has been contained, but
this relative stability remains fragile. While the price spike following the initial devaluation in
February was fairly quickly absorbed, inflationary pressures remain significant. Interest rates
were brought down from crisis peaks, but remained above the original May program path
through the end of 2001, due in part to the higher-than-expected inflation. After falling below
1.6 million TL/USD in October 2001, the exchange rate stabilized by the end of the year, albeit
at a more depreciated level than originally projected. The external current account improved
sharply registering a surplus of about US$3.3 billion (2.2 percent of GNP) compared to the
deficit of US$7.6 billion (4.9 percent of GNP) in 2000 (Table 1). Preliminary data indicate that
the fiscal program met the 5.5 percent of GNP primary surplus target for the consolidated public
sector for 2001, but the fiscal cost of bank restructuring contributed to a sharp increase in the
public debt.

4.     The most immediate problem is that the economic recession has been much deeper than
projected and recovery has been delayed. A serious drought exacerbated the recession with
agricultural output contracting by some 3.2 percent through the first nine months of 2001. Real
credit to the economy contracted by about 30 percent during the year as banks cut back on
lending and enterprises reduced borrowing in the face of high real interest rates. Output
contracted by 8.5 percent in the 3rd quarter of 2001, compared to 11.4 percent in the 2nd quarter,
bringing the fall for the first nine months of the year to 8.3 percent. The combination of high
interest rates, large devaluation and deep recession caused the stock of public debt as a share of
GNP to rise significantly more than projected under the May program. This occurred despite the
disbursement of US$10.9 billion in combined IMF support (US$9.8 billion) and World Bank
adjustment lending (US$ 1.1 billion) between May and December. The ratio of public debt (net
of the net assets of the central bank) to GNP is now estimated to have increased from 57.4
percent of GNP at the end of 2000 to about 91 percent by the end of 2001, 12 percentage points
higher than originally projected in May.
5.     The costs of cleaning up the banking sector has added over US$40 billion to the
Treasury's debt in 2001, although about half of this represents losses on the books of the state
and SDIF banks before the crisis which were already included in the broader definition of the
public debt. The stock of Treasury securities issued for bank restructuring (including revaluation
of FX denominated securities) is estimated to have reached TL 60 quadrillion (33 percent of
GNP) by the end of 2001 (Table 2). While the Treasury has restructured recapitalization
securities held by the central bank and the state banks in order to lengthen maturities and reduce
interest payments, the risks to public debt sustainability will remain significant through the
medium term.

6.    When positive signs began to emerge by late summer, including the raising of new
syndicated loans by several large local banks, Turkey was suddenly hit hard as financial markets
reacted adversely to the terrorist attack in the United States. In the days following September 11,
secondary market rates on government securities increased by nearly 1,500 basis points, the
Istanbul Stock Exchange fell almost 20 percent and the exchange rate depreciated by a further 10
percent. This reflected in part the global impact on emerging markets, but it also highlighted
Turkey's macroeconomic vulnerability and perceived status as a frontline state in the struggle
against terrorism. The external shock arising from September 11 is expected to have a
continuing impact on Turkey's internal and external balances through numerous channels
including lower exports arising from the slowdown in Europe and lost tourism revenues. The
IMF has estimated that the impact of the shock on the balance of payrnents is in the range of
US$10 billion in 2002 and that Turkey faced a budget financing gap on the order of US$7 billion
in 2002 prior to the agreement on a new Stand-by Arrangement. Although Turkey's financial
markets quickly regained the ground lost in the immediate aftermath of September 11, this was
mainly due to investor expectations that the country would benefit from additional support from
official creditors to help overcome the negative effects of the shock.
B.    Turkey's Medium-term Macroeconomic Framework
7.     In December 2001, Turkey adopted a new medium-term macroeconomic framework in
agreement with the IMF and a renewed program   of structural reforms worked out in
collaboration with the Bank. The renewed program incorporates the three-pronged strategy
articulated by the Government last May: (i) macroeconomic policies Reared towards restoring
financial stability and growth, and resuming the disinflation process; (ii) structural policies
aimed at correctin,g the financial sector and public sector weaknesses underlving the crisis and
establishing a more sound basis for disinflation and growth; and (iii) strong social policies
including enhanced social dialogue to achieve price and wage policies consistent with
macroeconomic stability, and increased emphasis on the protection of the most vulnerable
groups of society.
8.    The renewed program aims to restore economic growth, albeit more gradually than
originally envisaged under the May program. Growth of three percent is projected in 2002,
rising to five percent in 2003-04 (Table 1). Exports and a return of private demand for
consumption and investment are expected to lead the recovery. The program targets a reduction
in inflation to 35 percent by the end of the year through tight monetary policies backed by the
introduction of inflation targeting during the course of 2002 if pre-conditions are met. Inflation
is projected to fall further to 20 percent by the end of 2003 and 12 percent in 2004. The program
aims to ensure sustainability of the public debt through stronger fiscal adjustment and additional
external financing for the budget. The primary surplus of the consolidated public sector is
targeted to increase to 6.5 percent of GNP in 2002 and to remain at this level in 2003-04. The
provision of additional external financing for the budget in 2002 is expected to reduce the
amount of government domestic borrowing and ease the pressure on domestic banks to roll over
their maturing government securities. The stock of net public sector debt is projected to fall to
81 percent of GNP in 2002 and to 69 percent of GNP by the end of 2004. Finally, the program
targets a rebuilding of international reserves to US$24 billion by 2003, slightly above the level
reached in 2000, through the provision of additional medium-term financing from the IMF



- 5 -
together with a recovery of private capital inflows beginning in 2003. Reserves would increase
further in 2004 under the assumption that confidence will continue to improve.
9.    Support for the program from the international community remains strong. The IMF's
Board of Directors approved on February 4, 2002 a new SDR 12.8 billion (US$16.2 billion)
Stand-by Arrangement for Turkey covering the 2002-04 period. This amount includes US$4.2
billion in undisbursed fumds from the previous Stand-by program in addition to US$12 billion in
new financing. This brings total IMF commitmnents for the program to over US$30 billion since
the original Stand-by was approved in December 1999. The new program has been prepared in
close cooperation with the Bank. The prior actions, performance criteria and structural
benchmarks for the new Stand-by are fully consistent with the Bank's Economic Reform Loan
(ERL) and the PFPSAL program. The World Bank has disbursed US$1.9 billion in adjustment
lending since 2000 and an additional US$3.4 billion is available under the current CAS high
case--including the proposed PFPSAL II, second tranche of the Economic Reform Loan (ERL),
and the adjustment components of the Agriculture Reform Implementation Project (ARIP) and
Social Risk Mitigation Project (SRMP)--assuming satisfactory outcomes for both
macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform. Total IFI financing for the budget deficit in
2002 is projected to reach up to US$10 billion of which US$7 billion would come from the IMF
and up to US$3 billion from the World Bank including disbursement of investment lending. The
external financing plan underpinning the new medium-term macroeconomic framework is
summarized in Table 14 in the risk section below.
10.   Markets have reacted favorably to the renewed program and the announcement of
additional external support. There are some indications that the recession may have bottomed
out. Capacity utilization was 72.3 percent in February 2002 up from 70.9 percent one year ago,
but below January's 74.1 percent. Interest rates on short-term bonds have fallen below 70
percent, in parallel with reductions in overnight rates set by the CBT, and are on a declining path
in line with the new macro-framework. The exchange rate has stabilized in the range of 1.3-1.4
million TL/USD. There are indications of fresh private capital inflows in the stock exchange,
which has rebounded strongly by some 50 percent in Lira terms since mid-September, and local
banks have been increasingly successful in rolling over their syndicated loans. Some Turkish
corporations that have succeeded in restructuring their operations have seen their access to
external capital restored. Spreads on USD denominated Turkish eurobonds have fallen by more
than 300 basis points since October. The Treasury successfully issued EURO 800 million and
US$750 million in new securities on international markets in October-December 2001,
exceeding expectations, followed by an additional US$1.45 billion in January-March 2002.
11.   The first IMF program review under the new Stand-by arrangement is expected to be
completed in April 2001. An IMF review mission visited Turkey in March and all of the
quantitative targets for the review are expected to have been met including performance criteria
for the fiscal and monetary programs. According to the mission, the prospects for meeting the 35
percent end-year inflation target have improved. The public sector debt is on track to reach or
fall below the program projection for end-2002 of 81 percent. Of some concern, is the rapid
appreciation of the real exchange rate which inay affect export performance in 2002. However,
the mission found that the external current account remains broadly on track with a better than
expected outturn for 2001 offsetting the impact of unanticipated real exchange rate appreciation



- 6 -
and higher oil prices. Recent improvements in Turkey's access to international markets could
lead to a modest increase in gross intemational reserves above the US$22 billion end-2002 target
(Table 1).
12.   The improvements in Turkey's macro-financial indicators in recent months remain
tentative, and represent in part the expected rebound from the overshooting seen in other crisis
countries. Sustained improvements in market conditions and economic recovery in the real
sector will depend on continued progress in implementing the program.  Determined
implementation of the financial and public sector reforms supported by the PFPSAL II and
subsequent programmatic operations will be critical to this effort.
C.    The Structural Reform Agenda
13.   The Government's program continues to emphasize the critical role of structural reforms
in overcoming the crisis and creating the foundations for renewed growth and financial stability.
Since the first PFPSAL was approved in July 2001, the Government has made significant
progress in implementing its agenda to restructure the foundations of the Turkish economy. The
first reform priority has been a major acceleration of financial sector reform. The financial
sector reform program encompasses continued improvements to the prudential and institutional
framework for bank supervision in line with Basel and EU standards. With regard to bank
restructuring, with the exception of two banks whose resolution has been halted by the courts, all
banks intervened by the SDIF before November 2001 were resolved by end-January 2002,
meeting a crucial program benchmark. In addition, the programn focuses on the restructuring and
privatization of the state banks.  The second core direction for structural reform is the
comprehensive reform of the public sector to address the underlying structural causes of
Turkey's macroeconomic instability, ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability, and increase the
transparency and efficiency of public expenditure management. The public sector reform
program includes structural fiscal reforms, institutional and policy reforms to improve public
expenditure management, and action to strengthen public sector governance and fight corruption.
In response to the sharp increase in public indebtedness in 2001, the Government has decided to
introduce more ambitious structural fiscal reforms starting in 2002. An initial set of measures
has been taken in the fiscal package for 2002 to streamline the public sector in line with medium-
term resource constraints and the long-term objective of promoting private sector development
and employment creation. The third direction is continuation of vital reforms in the agriculture,
energy and telecommunications sectors to improve the climate for private investment in an effort
to raise productivity, growth and incomes. Many of the latter reforms also have a structural
fiscal dimension in that they allow the state to downsize the public sector, modernize agriculture
support policies and reduce the government's contingent liabilities.
14.   Turkey needs comprehensive financial and public sector reforms to break definitively
with its troubled history of inadequate transparency, public deficits, inflation and financial
instability. A quick retrospective highlights the structural weaknesses in both the public and
financial sectors which contributed to macroeconomic instability and created the pre-conditions
for the February 2001 crisis. Chronic public sector deficits led to the buildup of debt which
financed rapid expansion of the banking sector which greatly outpaced the development of the
regulatory framework.  Macroeconomic distortions arising from fiscal imbalance created



- 7 -
incentives for the banks to take on excessive risk which was not counterbalanced by strong,
transparent regulation. The absence of comprehensive, accurate and timely fiscal information-
particularly the reliance on off-budget funds and quasi-fiscal obligations including the so-called
"duty losses" of the state banks--reinforced political and institutional obstacles to structural
change and sustainable fiscal adjustment. Unhealthy interactions between inadequate fiscal and
financial transparency compounded the risks to the economy and helped ensure the buildup of a
major systemic crisis following earlier cycles of crisis and aborted stabilization efforts
throughout the 1990s. The Government is now working to correct the underlying structural
weaknesses in the financial sector, while undertaking urgent financial restructuring to address the
impact of the crisis on the banks. In parallel, institutional and policy reforms are being initiated
to address systemic problems in the public sector, together with stronger structural measures to
underpin the fiscal adjustment. These reforms will complement on-going actions to improve the
climate for private investment and promote growth. Restoring investor confidence and economic
growth depends critically on the Government's ability to simultaneously address the structural
roots of the economic crisis and finance the costs of cleaning up the banking sector.
D.    Social and Poverty Impact of the Crisis and Reform Program
15.   Further assessment work since July 2001 tends to confirrn the heavy social impact of the
crisis and growing risk of poverty and vulnerability. Analysis, including the Corporate Sector
Assessment updated through the first three quarters of 2001, indicates that:
* Industrial production and private sector capacity utilization remain some 10 percentage
points below the levels of 2000.
*  Survey results by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry for the first half of 2001 based on a
sample of a total of 934 small, medium and large enterprises show that the rate of job
loss doubled compared to 2000, reaching 7.7 percent with small and medium-scale
enterprises reporting the highest rate of attrition.
*  Latest data from SIS show that the official unemployment rate was 10.6 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2001, compared to 6.3 percent one year ago; however, for educated
youth, the unemployment rate increased to 27.0 percent, compared to 22.7 percent in
2000(Q4).
16.   The Government is carrying out extensive survey work at the household level with
support from the Bank to identify more precisely the socio-economic characteristics of groups
most vulnerable to the economic crisis and social impact of the reform program. This data will
be used to prepare updated poverty lines for Turkey expected to be available by March/April
2002. On the basis of preliminary data, the following vulnerable groups can be tentatively
identified:
* families with children, particularly families with many children.
* single elderly females living alone.
1 Defined as the ratio of laid-off workers to continuing work force.



- 8 -
* widowed/divorced mothers with children (small group).
* families with children in disadvantaged regions: Southern and Eastern Anatolia reflect
high levels of poverty incidence and severity.
* families with children in gecekondu housing.
While not at elevated risk of poverty, educated youth, farmers, and small businessmen are very
much affected by the income declines associated with the crisis. However, falling from middle
class to lower class in Turkey does not mean falling into absolute poverty (living on less than
one US Dollar per person per day) or even chronic poverty. Survey data indicate that more than
half of all female heads of household (where there is no man 'present' in the household) are
married. In these cases, the spouse is presumably working abroad and sending back remittances.
Welfare levels in such households are well above average. The very few households headed by
divorced/widowed mothers or single elderly females are characterized by lower consumption.
17.    Although the PFPSAL program will have important social benefits in terms of restored
growth, job creation and reduced economic vulnerability, structural reforms do entail short-term
social costs which the Government is working to mitigate. Resolution of SDIF banks had
resulted in the loss of some 13,000 jobs as of November 2001. These workers are eligible for
severance payments under the law, but are not eligible for early retirement bonuses.
Restructuring of the state banks has led to a downsizing of staff by some 13,000 workers by the
end of 2001--representing about 20 percent of the workforce--through retirement, voluntary
separation or reassignment. Approximately another 16,000 are expected to leave, or be
transferred from, the state banks by the middle of 2002. These employees are mainly civil
servants and public sector workers who will benefit from relatively generous retirement and
severance payment provisions financed by the Government. Similar provisions apply to those
laid off or retired under programs to adjust staffing levels in the broader public sector (primarily
SEEs), including public sector workers affected by privatization. As part of the fiscal package
for 2002, the Government has lifted restrictions on retirement of public sector workers (although
not civil servants who are subject to specific labor legislation) over the age of 50. This measure
has encouraged roughly 15,000 public sector workers to retire in recent months, mainly in the
SEEs, and additional labor redeployment in the SEE sector is expected during the course of
2002. All of these workers are eligible for pensions and other social insurance benefits. In
addition to these standard benefits, workers laid off from SEEs in the portfolio of the
Privatization Administration benefit from special compensation under the privatization law. All
formal sector workers will benefit from the new unemployment insurance system launched in
mid-2000, once they meet the minimum contribution history requirement of 18 months.
2 According to law no 4603 regarding the state banks, enacted on 25 November 2000, retirement benefits are paid
with an additional 30 percent bonus to those personnel who were eligible for retirement on the date this law was
enacted if they applied for retirement within 6 months of the enactment date and to those personnel who will become
eligible for retirement by the end of 2002 if they apply for retirement within three months of the date they become
eligible. The personnel who are retired on these terms are not allowed to take employment in the state banks for 3
years after their retiremnent. Further legislation was enacted in January allowing the payment of a 20 percent bonus
for those state bank workers who apply for retirement within two months after its enactment. Civil servants and
contract personnel from the state banks also currently have the right to be transferred to another state agency.

18.       The Government has made progress in strengthening Turkey's social protection system
and has successfully maintained social spending under the PFPSAL program. Benchmarks for
public spending on health, education and social protection as shares of GNP were agreed with
the Bank under the first PFPSAL (Table 3). These benchmarks have been set at a level
somewhat above the averages for the 1998-2000 period, reflecting the Government's policy
decision to ensure adequate expenditure on social priorities. The estimated outcome for total
social spending as a share of GNP in 2001 is 15.5 percent, well above the PFPSAL benchmark of
14.5 percent. The individual components of social spending on health, education and social
protection are all also in line with their specific benchmarks as shown in Table 4. In real terms,
total social spending increased by some four percent in 2001, with health and social protection
registering increases of eight percent and seven percent respectively, while education
expenditure fell by three percent in real terms due in part to lower expenditure out of earmarked
revenues from consumption taxes as a result of the recession.
19.       The budget for 2002. approved by Parliament in December. ensures satisfactory
expenditure envelopes for health, education and social protecting, thereby meeting the program
trigger for PFPSAL II. The budget allows for an increase in total social spending to almost 16



- 10-
percent of GNP, an impressive achievement given the programmed fiscal tightening. The 2002
budget maintains public spending on health and social protection as a share of GNP above the
program benchmarks of 3.25 percent and 7.0 percent respectively. Public expenditure on social
protection is budgeted to increase slightly in GNP terms relative to 2001 resulting in part from
the expansion of the direct income support (DIS) program to cover all eligible farmers
nationwide. Per hectare payments under the DIS program for 2002 will be indexed to the 35
percent targeted inflation rate. Expenditure by the Social Solidarity Fund in 2002 will be
sustained at the increased level reached in 2001 (0.3 percent of GNP) with continued support
from the Bank's SRMP. At slightly under 4.0 percent of GNP, public spending on education is
budgeted to fall somewhat below the program benchmark of 4.25 percent of GNP. However, the
Government expects to reallocate additional resources from the budget contingencies to the
education budget to cover the cost of additional teachers to be hired over the course of 2002. As
a result, actual public spending on education is expected to exceed four percent of GNP in 2002.
20.   The preliminary outcome for spending on health, education and social protection under
the 2002 budget will be monitored during the supervision of PFPSAL II. Significant deviations
from the program benchmarks will be discussed with the Bank and appropriate corrective action
taken as needed prior to release of the second and third tranches of the loan. The Government is
committed to allocating satisfactory expenditure envelopes for social programs in the 2003
budget which will be a trigger for the programmatic public sector adjustment loan (PPSAL)
planned under the CAS.
E.    Bank Support for Economic Reform
21.   The proposed PFPSAL II is part of a broader package of Bank financing in support of the
Government's economic reform efforts. The Bank's overall lending program for the 2001-03
period is described in detail in the CAS Progress Report. The CAS includes a high case lending
program of US$5.0 billion plus US$1.2 billion on SSAL terms. The program provides for
adjustment lending of up to US$4.5 billion and up to US$1.7 billion in financing for investment
in support of economic reform and social priorities during the CAS period. The Government's
program meets all of the triRRers for the high case as presented in the CAS Progress Report. In
this context, the tobacco law was enacted on January 9, 2002 which eliminates support purchases
and sets the stage for privatization of TEKEL, the state tobacco company, as foreseen under the
ERL and ARIP programs. In the energy sector, on the basis of a recent Constitutional Court
decision, the Government has decided on a revised roadmap for resolving pending transfer of
operating rights (TOOR) and build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects in order to pave the way for
privatization and the introduction of a competitive electricity market.  The roadmap is
summarized in the attached Letter of Development Policy. These measures are in line with the
CAS high case triggers.
22.   The programmatic lending program continues to meet all of the criteria for both
programmatic and SSAL lending:



- 11 -
*  Progzrammatic Lending.3  The proposed PFPSAL II and follow-up programmatic loans
would continue to support the Government's medium-term reform program which
emphasizes structural, policy and institutional reforms in the financial and public sectors.
This program is designed to respond simultaneously to the current crisis through urgent
financial and fiscal measures, and to prevent a future crisis by tackling the deeper roots of the
chronic financial instability in Turkey. Building on the progress achieved under the first
PFPSAL, the program will help Turkey achieve sustainable poverty reduction through
macroeconomic stability and growth. The program is articulated in detail in the attached
LDP and policy matrix. The triggers and monitoring indicators for the program have been
updated in light of developments(see Part IV). The PFPSAL program remains grounded in
the revised CAS and is closely integrated with other elements of the CAS. The program is
supported by extensive economic sector work including key fiduciary aspects of public
expenditure management. The program's medium-term strategy for financial and public
sector reform helps restore confidence by demonstrating how Turkey will resolve the
underlying structural weaknesses which led to the February crisis.
* SSAL Lendin2i' The provision of US$1.2 billion on SSAL terms over and above the US$5
billion CAS high case is justified by the breadth and severity of the crisis, and its
fundamental structural dimension. The Bank's participation, in concert with the IMF, is
helping the Government articulate its program and is contributing to the restoration of market
confidence, financial health and growth. The Government's structural and macroeconomic
policy package is satisfactory. The 9th and 1 Oth Stand-by program reviews were completed in
August and November 2001, respectively and agreement was reached with the IMF in
December on a revised medium-term macroeconomic framework. The PFPSAL program is
part of a concerted international support package and a satisfactory external financing plan is
in place. The return of private capital inflows, originally projected to start in 2002, has now
been delayed until 2003. In response, the IMF has committed additional financing of US$10
billion in 2002 under the new Stand-by arrangement approved by its Board in February 2002
over and above the amounts committed under the previous Stand-by. The first program
review under the new Stand-by is expected to be completed in April. Under the high case
lending program, IBRD debt outstanding and disbursed would increase to about US$8.5
billion or some 6.6 percent of the total IBRD portfolio in 2003. IBRD exposure and IBRD
debt service as a share of exports of goods and non-factor services and as a share of total
public debt service are projected to remain within guidelines.
23.   The Bank's programmatic assistance in support of financial and public sector reform in
Turkey is a graduated response conditioned on concrete actions taken by the Government. The
programmatic approach recognizes that the complex second generation policy and institutional
reforms that Turkey is undertaking must be sequenced over the medium term. It also takes into
account the uncertainties inherent in the current crisis conditions that Turkey faces and allows for
a reasonable degree of adaptability of the prograrn to unfolding events on the ground. The

proposed PFPSAL II is the second operation in support of the Government's multi-year financial
and public sector reform program. It follows on the first PFPSAL of US$1. 1 billion approved in
July 2001. Looking ahead, two Programmatic Financial Sector Adjustment Loans of US$500
million each and a Programmatic Public Sector Adjustment Loan of US$375 million, all on
standard IBRD terms, are envisaged to support continued implementation of the program during
the remainder of the current CAS period. A second PPSAL is tentatively envisaged beyond the
CAS period. The actions taken prior to Board presentation of PFPSAL II and those expected to
be taken by April for release of the second tranche of the loan and by July for release of the third
tranche are specified in the attached policy matrix (Annex VI).
24.   Macro-economic outcomes under the new program will be monitored against key
indicators on a short-term basis in close coordination with the IMEF. The agreed indicators
include the level of domestic interest rates for government securities, inflation, the maturity of
new government borrowing, the cash outcome for the budget, and private capital inflows. The
projections for these indicators have been determined on the basis of the macro-framework
agreed with the IMF. Maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic framework. including a
track record of outcomes, will be a condition for release of the second and third tranches of
PFPSAL II.
25.   The PFPSAL programn is integrally linked with other support for the Government's
reform  program  under the revised CAS.  Further implementation of the energy and
telecommunications reforms, and the privatization program, is covered under the conditionality
for the second tranche of the ERL. Mitigation of the social costs of privatization is supported by
the PSSP approved by the Board in December 2000. The ARIP, approved by the Board in July
2001, is assisting the Govermnent in carrying out core aspects of the agriculture reforrn program
originally supported by the ERL including implementation of the DIS program as part of the
broader reform of agriculture support policies. The SRMP approved by the Board in September
is supporting the Government's efforts to strengthen social assistance programs including the
introduction of conditional cash transfers for families at risk. The PSSP and SRMP both include
support for household level survey work to identify more precisely vulnerable groups and track
the social impact of the economic crisis and reform program. In addition, these surveys will
provide information on the distributional impact of the economic recovery. Future Bank support
for basic and secondary education, and for health, will support realization of the objectives of the
broader public sector reform in key social sectors.
26.   The Bank's financial and public sector programnmatic lending operations are supported by
several targeted non-lending activities. A Corporate Sector Assessment to determine the impact
of the crises on the corporate sector and outline a strategy for restructuring will be finalized in
April. A Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) study planned for 2002 will support design of
the PFSAL I and II programs which will focus on NBFI issues in addition to finalization of the
banking system reform agenda. The content of the public sector reform program draws on
analysis and recommendations presented in the 2000 CEM and the Public Expenditure and
Institutional Review circulated to the Board in September 2001. It also benefits from the Bank's
fiduciary sector work including the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) finalized
in July 2001. A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was completed and sent
to the Government in August. The Bank has co-sponsored several international conferences and



- 13
workshops to assist the Government in articulating its public sector reform program and in
presenting this program to the public. A new CEM focused on economic recovery and medium-
term growth is planned for the second half of 2002. The Bank is also preparing a report on the
social impact of the crisis and economic reform program, drawing on on-going survey work,
which is expected to be circulated to the Board in 2002. A Local Governtnent Sector Review is
underway which will analyze the key issues faced by sub-national government in Turkey and
selected recommendations of the review may be incorporated into the program for the PPSAL
27.   The PFPSAL program is consistent with the Government's national program for EU
accession and the Bank is working closely with EU staff responsible for Turkey. The banking
sector reforms supported by PFPSAL are designed to ensure that Turkey's banking supervision
framework complies with both EU standards and Basle norms. The Bank has coordinated its
advice on the new public procurement law closely with the EU. The new public procurement
law is compatible with the UNCITRAL model and moves Turkey towards full compliance with
EU directives. The Bank's assistance on public debt management issues has been oriented
towards EU practices and the Maastricht criteria. The Bank is coordinating its dialogue on
financial management issues with the EU, and the new law on public financial management and
financial control is expected to be consistent with EU standards.

II.   TURKEY'S FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM
A.    Introduction
28.   The Government's financial sector reform program seeks to strengthen Turkey's financial
sector, to enhance its intermediation capacity in support of economic growth and to reduce its
vulnerability to internal and external shocks. To achieve this objective, the Government aims to
bring Turkey's legal and regulatory framework for financial sector activity, as well as its
financial institutions, up to Basel/EU and international best practice standards. Because of the
dominance of the banking systern, the initial focus areas of the reform effort, from 1999
onwards, have been: (i) overhaul of the prudential regime for banking; (ii) establishment and
institutional development of a new, independent Bank Regulation and Supervision Agency
(BRSA), (iii) problem bank/bank failure resolution, and (iv) state bank restructuring and
privatization. At a later stage, the reform effort will also encompass non-bank financial
institutions and capital markets activity. The Government's financial sector reform program was
designed with the Bank's assistance in the form of Banking Reviews undertaken in 1998, 1999
and 2001, and Financial Sector Loans in 1999, 2000 and 2001. The Bank's assistance is
described in more detail in Section IV of this report. The paragraphs below describe recent
banking sector developments, the banking sector reforms already undertaken, and the planned
reforms forming the basis for PFPSAL II.
B.    Financial Sector Profile/Recent Developments in the Banking Sector
29.   The Turkish financial sector consists (as of January 2002) of a dominant banking system
of 59 banks. Of these, 44 are deposit taking banks and 15 are non-deposit taking investment and
development banks. Of the 44 deposit taking banks, 3 are state-owned, 4 (formerly privately
owned) are under the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF-now quasi state-owned), 22 are
privately Turkish owned and 15 are foreign owned. The banks are complemented by 64
insurance companies, 128 securities trading companies, 216 mutual funds, 100 factoring
companies and 93 leasing companies (several deposit taking and investment and development
banks also hold leasing licenses). There are also several hitherto unregulated private pension
schemes, including schemes run by the banks and insurance companies for their own staff. Most
of the financial institutions are part of financial conglomerates, with the main group commercial
bank at the center of such conglomerates, and other bank and non-bank financial institutions
formed and managed as subsidiaries. Issues related to consolidated regulation and supervision,
financial reporting and comprehensive risk management are increasingly gaining more relevance
because of the prevalence of such group structures. However, even though the non-bank
financial institutions (NBFI) sector has begun to grow in Turkey in terms of size and economic
importance in recent years, and the regulatory oversight and development issues for the NBFI
segment of the financial system are increasing in importance, its size and economic impact
compared to the banking sector are still rather small (see Annex IIA).
30.   Banking Sector: 1990 - November 2000. In the banking sector, the emphasis of the
Government's reform efforts during the nineties was on the development of a basic legal and
regulatory infrastructure to facilitate ease of entry, and to increase competition and growth. This
triggered a rapid expansion of banking system assets in Turkey during the 1990s, and in spite of



- 15 -
the 1994-95 banking crisis, total system assets in absolute terms tripled from US$51.9 billion in
1994 to US$155.2 billion as of end 2000, and also increased substantially as a percentage of
GNP from 39.2 in 1994 to 77.1 in 2000 (Table 4) signaling a deepening of financial
internediation capacity. The rapid growth in the size of the banking sector, however, also had
some negative consequences. Prudential regulations and enforcement capacity lagged behind,
and there was a proliferation of connected lending and concentration of exposure and default
risks. Lenient loan loss provisioning rules and enforcement allowed banks to understate their
credit risks. Large FX open positions and asset/liability mismatches also created foreign currency
and interest rate/liquidity risks in addition to credit risks. Additionally, growing public sector
borrowing requirements during the years 1994-1999 encouraged banks to shift resources into
Government securities that were generating a relatively high risk free real return. As a result,
banks' lending activity declined in real terms.

31.     Banking sector: post November 2000. Starting in December 1999, the Government
with the help of the Bank initiated a financial sector reform program to address the above
identified weaknesses (see Section IV A of this report). Despite successful implementation of
these reforms, however, in late November 2000, Turkey experienced a banking system liquidity
crisis which was triggered by the need of a medium-sized private bank (Demir) to refinance an
excessive stock of Government securities. In early December, interest rates briefly spiked to
levels above 1,900 percent. In February 2001, there was another, much more serious crisis that

was ignited by the public airing of tensions between the President and Prime Minister. This set
off a new wave of turbulence in the financial sector as investors liquidated TL positions and fled
to US$ in expectation of a full fledged political crisis. Interest rates once again spiked, this time
as high as 6,200 percent, and with a rapid depletion of the Central Bank of Turkey's (CBT's)
foreign currency reserves apparent, the authorities were forced to float the TL leading to a sharp
deterioration in the value of the Lira. The combined effect of (i) interest rate losses; (ii) losses
arising from the TL devaluation; and (iii) loan book deterioration losses due to corporate sector
distress resulting from the crises eroded the banking system's capital. Total banking system
assets also have shrunk from US$155.2 billion at the end of December 2000 to US$111.8 billion
at the end of September 2001, a sharp reversal from the trend during 1994-2000. The banking
sector is experiencing financial distress, as is the rest of the economy.
32.    The Government's Response to the Banking Crisis. The Government in response to
the above crises has taken a series of urgent reform actions. These include: (i) significant reform
of prudential regulations for loan loss provisions, connected exposures and foreign exchange
exposures to bring them in line with Basle/EU standards; (ii) strengthening of the new and



- 17 -
independent bank supervision entity (Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency --BRSA);
(iii) restructuring the private banking sector by intervening in 19 insolvent private banks and
undertaking their resolution through sale/merger/or closure; and (iv) initiating the reform of the
state-owned banking sector by closing down the insolvent Emlak bank, and implementing long
overdue financial and governance restructuring of Ziraat and Halk banks. However, while the
above reforms have addressed a significant part of the urgent refonn actions necessary, they have
to be complemented by additional reform actions in all of the above area to sustain the long term
health of the banking sector in Turkey and return it to the growth path. The Government's reform
program has also been supported by the World Bank's Programmatic Financial and Public
Support loans. The first phase of the reforms were supported by PFPSAL in July 2001 and the
second phase is being supported by the proposed PFPSAL II described in this President's Report.
These second phase reforms are described in detail below, and the relationship between the
Government's second phase reform measures, and the program triggers for the proposed
PFPSAL II is outlined in Box 1 below.
C.    Strengthening the Regulatory Framework for Banking
33.   Until recently, Turkey's prudential regime for banking activity was seriously out of line
with Basel/EU standards and international best practice. The weaknesses in the prudential
regime, coupled with rapid banking system growth (Table 4 above), contributed to the
appearance of major vulnerabilities in the banking system to exchange rate, interest rate and
credit risk shocks. These vulnerabilities were already apparent even before the latest two crises,
as evidenced by the emergence of a sizeable pipeline of failed private banks under the SDIF
(Box 2) and the continued financial difficulties experienced by the state-owned banks. The
authorities initiated (from December 1999 onwards) an overhaul of the prudential regime as part
of the program supported by the FSAL and the PFPSAL. Under the proposed PFPSAL II, this
effort will substantially be completed by early 2002, while the following PFSALs I & II in late
2002 and early 2003 will focus on reform of the regulatory regime for non-bank financial
institution activity. Specifically, concerning the prudential regime for banks, the Government
already has undertaken and plans to undertake during late 2001/early 2002 the following
additional reforms.
34.   Loan Loss Provisioning. Reform of the loan loss classification and provisioning regime
for Turkish banks began in December 1999 with the adoption by the Council of Ministers5 of a
new loan loss provisioning rule based on a tiered loan classification system (pass-watch-
substandard-doubtful-loss) and borrower creditworthiness. The regime was further upgraded in
May 2001 through the introduction of full tax deductibility of specific loan loss provisions and
the lifting of the exemption from specific provisioning for Ziraat's agricultural support loans.
These steps were major improvements over the previous, much more lenient regime. However,
the current regime still suffers from the following weaknesses which have become increasingly
apparent since the February 2001 crisis: (i) the absence of fair value accounting rules for
collateral, which has resulted in significant value overstatement and a concomitant
5 The Council of Ministers was responsible for issuing banking regulations before the new BRSA was created in
September 2000.



- 18 -
understatement of provisioning requirements, (ii) overly restrictive provisions concerning the
allowable terms for loan reschedulings, and (iii) a provision in the banking law allowing a four
year phase-in period for classification and provisioning of loans made before June 1999. In
combination, these factors have discouraged Turkish private banks from restructuring problem
loans, while at the same time allowing them to significantly understate their non-performing
loans (NPLs). For the private banks, NPLs as a percent of total loans have remained at around 5
percent despite the major upheaval in the corporate sector caused by the crises. Such a low NPL
ratio, also as compared with the NPL experience of other major crisis countries in Asia where
NPL ratios reached 40 percent. has resulted in a significant overstatement of bank capital6. To
remedy these weaknesses and to set the stage for a more constructive and informed approach
towards problem loan workout and restoration of banks' capital adequacy ratios, the Government
has submitted, and Parliament has enacted, a banking law amendment eliminating the four year
phase-in period for pre-June 1999 loans. The law was published in the official gazette as of
January 31. 2002. Additionally. the BRSA as of January 31. 2002 issued a supplementary
memorandum to the loan loss provisioning rule to clarify fair value accounting rules for
collateral, and also amended the LLP rule itself to remove the restrictive debt rescheduling
provisions. At the same time, the BRSA will ensure that rescheduled loans are not upgraded to a
next higher classification level until the debtor concerned has firmly established a new,
satisfactory debt service track record and renewed creditworthiness.
35.   Large/Connected Exposures. The Turkish banking system during the past decade has
been characterized by a high degree of connected lending and equity exposures, as group-owned
banks financed group companies with both bank loans and equity investments. The authorities
have recognized the need to overhaul the prudential regime for such connected exposures, and
have already implemented the necessary reforms in this area. The December 1999 banking law
introduced a new, lower limit for connected exposures by banks and a six year phase-in period
for banks to reach the new limit in a step-wise fashion by the end of 2006. In April 2001, the
Parliament enacted a further amendment to the law separating connected lending & derivative
exposures from equity exposures (i.e., equity ownership in non-financial entities), and
introducing a new separate limit for such non-financial equity exposures. This new limit, which
is consistent with the applicable EU Directive, will be phased in over a period of 8 I/2 years, to be
in full compliance with EU non-financial equity exposure levels by 2009. Additionally, the latest
banking law amendment also mandates the application of the exposure limits (for connected
lending/derivatives and non-financial equity) on both a solo and consolidated basis (i.e., to banks
and their financial subsidiaries together). In June 2001 the BRSA also issued the new, EU
Directive based definition of connected exposures called for by the banking law, as well as the
interim targets and time-table for banks to come stepwise into compliance with the new non-
financial equity exposure limits.
36.   Although the new connected exposure regime allows a long phase-in period for banks to
reach compliance with the new lower limits (all expressed as a percent of bank capital), several
banks cannot meet the higher, interim limits for 2001/2002. This is in part due to the fact that the
6 The state-owned banks Ziraat and Halk, however, as well as the SDIF banks, under instructions from the
Government and the BRSA/SDIF, are maintaining much more realistic provisioning levels.



- 19 -
banks' capital base has shrunk as a result of the crises. In addition, some existing violations have
worsened because foreign lenders (or even domestic banks trying to reduce exposures to other
groups) have recalled loans to Turkish banks/enterprises, causing group banks to maintain or
even increase their group exposures to replace such creditors. To enforce compliance, the BRSA
has issued a regulation defining time-bound reduction targets for all non-compliant banks and
will actively monitor compliance with the reduction targets. The BRSA will develop and enter
into bank-specific corrective action plans for any bank not meeting the targets. For
undercapitalized banks, these plans will be an integral part of capital restoration efforts (see
paragraph 53-54 below). Also, where necessary, enforcement action will include restructuring of
financial industrial groups into separate financial and industrial holding companies (see
paragraph 40 below).
37.    Foreign Exchange (FX) Exposure. Weaknesses in the FX exposure rules for banks
were a major concern during the past few years, when banks were routinely carrying large short
open FX positions to arbitrage the Turkish Lira-US$ interest rate differential. To mitigate the
impact on bank capital of large unexpected exchange rate shocks, efforts to tighten the FX
exposure limits were initiated during 1998-99 when the maximum open FX position limit for
banks was reduced in a stepwise fashion from 50 percent of regulatory capital in June 1998 to 20
percent in October 1999 7. In spite of the tighter rules, however, loopholes remained and banks -
having taken advantage of such possible loopholes to carry excessive FX exposures - incurred
large losses due to the February 2000 TL devaluation. Even though most banks have since
sharply reduced their FX exposures, any such loopholes should nevertheless be closed to avoid
recurrence of abuse in future. A working group comprising BRSA and CBT staff has been set up
to: (i) catalogue the use by banks of structured finance products to incur FX exposures not
captured by existing regulations, and (ii) formulate remedial regulatory action to capture such
exposures.
38.    Repurchase Transactions. Turkey is unique in having a significant retail repurchase
and reverse repurchase agreement (repo) market. Repos are typically transacted on a wholesale
basis between banks, other financial institutions or large corporate treasuries for liquidity
management purposes. Prior to December 2000, in order to encourage secondary market
liquidity, the repo market enjoyed more favorable withholding tax treatment than deposit interest
and made repos attractive instruments for retail customers. Following an amendment of the
withholding tax rules in December 2000, banks primarily entered into repo contracts with their
retail clients to circumvent the CBT's reserve requirement on deposits. In February 2001, as repo
interest rates rose to as high as 6,200 percent per annum, a large numbers of customers cancelled
time deposits and moved into the highly lucrative repo market. The movement of funds from
7 In December 1999 the limit also was applied on both a solo and consolidated basis. A new BRSA regulation
imposing a Basel-compliant capital charge on banks for their open FX positions was issued in February 2001,
effective January 1, 2002 on a solo basis and July 1, 2002 on a consolidated basis. Also, in June 2001 the BRSA
amended the solo and consolidated capital adequacy and FX exposure rules increasing the reporting frequency from
quarterly to monthly. Furthermore, the BRSA has undertaken on-site examninations of the foreign subsidiaries of
Turkish banks abroad in coordination with foreign supervisors to verify Turkish banks' compliance with
consolidated FX open position limits (e.g., in Bahrain, Luxemburg, Cyprus and the Netherlands).



- 20 -
time deposits to the overnight repo market obliged some banks to borrow more heavily on the
inter-bank market, further destabilizing the banking system.
39.   As a first step to curb repo activity, the Government in July 2001 created a committee
comprising of representatives of the Treasury, the BRSA, the CBT, the Capital Markets Board
(CMB) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to recommend measures to reduce the risks caused
by excessive use of retail repos/short-term liabilities in the banking sector. This committee
completed its work in early August, and the Council of Ministers issued a decree8 on August 17,
2001 introducing a new withholding tax regime for deposits and repos with a view to encourage
a migration of funds from FX to TL, from off balance sheet repo transactions to on-balance sheet
deposits and from short term to longer term deposits. Also, the CBT introduced 40 percent
remuneration on hitherto unremunerated mandatory TL reserve requirements payable as of
September 1, 2001. There is preliminary evidence that these measures are already having some
effect, as evidenced by a decline in outstanding retail repos. Additionally. to further enhance the
transparency of the repo market, the BRSA issued a new regulation on December 13. 2001 with
applicability as of February 1. 2002 requiring banks to bring repos on balance sheet as
collateralized finance transactions.
40.    Taxation and Corporate Law    Reform   to Encourage Mergers/De-mergers and
Facilitate Separation of Financial Industrial Groups. To develop a healthy, strong and
modern Turkish banking sector, it is necessary to encourage mergers and consolidation among
the large number of small banks without the requisite size, capital, range of products and
services, and technical and managerial depth. At the same time, to facilitate efficient financial
flows among financial entities within a single business group, and to better manage and
supervise the inherent risks on a consolidated basis for group financial institutions, it is necessary
to separate the financial and industrial activities of the financial-industrial groups (FIGs) in
Turke . The Parliament has already enacted several amendments to tax legislation that facilitate
bank mergers. However, the Ministry of Finance still needs to issue an implementation decree to
operationalize the new tax provisions. Also, further amendments to tax laws as well as company
and financial sector legislation may still be necessary to allow full-scale corporate restructuring
(including de-mergers) of mixed conglomerates into separate financial and industrial holding
company structures: During 2002, as part of the action plans to reduced connected and large
exposures of banks to their/or other FIGs (see paragraph 35 above), the BRSA will recommend
restructuring of such intertwined financial/industrial conglomerates into separate financial and
industrial holding entities. In this context, BRSA will, in cooperation with the MOF and other
ministries and regulatory agencies, seek to remove any remaining legal/tax impediments.
8 The decree introduced the following withholding tax rates: (i) for FX deposits: for deposits up to one year 18
percent, for deposits longer than one year 16 percent; (ii) for TL deposits: for demand deposits 16 percent, time
deposit up to 3 months 16 percent, time deposit up to 6 months 14 percent, time deposit up to one year 10 percent,
time deposits longer than one year 6 percent; and (iii) for repos 20 percent. These withholding tax rates are effective
for deposit accounts opened or renewed, and repos entered into, after August 17, 2001.

D.    Strengthening the Institutional Capacity of the BRSA and the SDIF
41.   BRSA. Shortly after its operationalization on September 1, 2000 the BRSA identified
the following institutional development priorities: (i) integration of staff coming to the BRSA
from five different departments within the Treasury, the MOF and the CBT, and staff training;
(ii) development of a common database for all supervisory and enforcement departments (e.g.,
offsite monitoring, on-site supervision, enforcement, licensing) within the BRSA; (iii) upgrading
of existing procedures manuals; (iv) integration of offsite monitoring & on-site supervision and
enforcement activity to improve the effectiveness of the bank regulatory regime despite the fact
that the Sworn Bank Auditors have a special status under the banking law; (v) establishment of a
problem bank function within the enforcement department and development of manuals to deal
with problem banks; (vi) introduction of an early warning system to guide the efforts of onsite
examiners and provide input in determining the onsite examination cycle; and (vi) development
of the concept of risk-based supervision, to shift the onsite examiners from being mostly focused
on compliance testing to identifying banking risks and assessing the quality of the risk
management undertaken by bank managers.
42.   Institutional Development Plan Adopted and Implementation Underway. To address
these institutional development priorities, the BRSA Board adopted a time-bound institutional
development plan during its June 2001 meeting. The plan clearly assigned responsibilities for its
implementation. Implementation progress has been slower than planned, however, as most of
senior management's attention and scarce human resources have been devoted to resolving
problem banks and taking actions to stabilize the financial system in the aftermath of the crises.
The implementation status of the plan's major components is described below. Satisfactory
progress in all these areas is expected to be achieved in the first half of 2002.
43.   HR Policy-Staff Integration, Training and Staff Salaries. The BRSA has implemented
most of the actions needed to integrate staff from different sources. Coordination of work and
information flow between departments has improved. BRSA employees also have taken part in
various external training programs. However, the development of a human resource policy and
an internal training function has not yet been completed. Besides, a comprehensive review of the
salary and remuneration of BRSA staff to bring the salaries of BRSA Board members and staff
in line with the prevailing salary scales for similar professional staff in the banking sector (in any
event not less than comparable salaries at the CBT or CMB), is also still to be carried out. In July
2001, the Government issued instructions freezing BRSA staff salaries, causing them to drop
significantly below CBT salaries, and triggering the resignation of most of the CBT staff
seconded to the BRSA. Staff morale has gone down as a result. In order to rectify this situation,
BRSA HR staff remuneration policy consistent with the independent professional nature of
BRSA has to be developed.
44.   Common Database. With full access to the CBT's data base being provided to all
departments, the practice of using separate data bases by different departments has ended. The
BRSA is presently discussing with the CBT and the Banks' Association of Turkey how existing
regulatory reports can be streamlined to avoid duplications, while ensuring that its regulatory
requirements are met. Once this process is completed, a decision will be taken to determine
whether the present CBT data base best serves the BRSA's needs and therefore should be
retained, or whether it would be more beneficial to develop a new data base.



-22 -
45.   Problem Bank Function. The BRSA has created a problem bank unit within its
enforcement department, and is developing a manual for the new unit, which will define pre-
failure intervention triggers (effectively defining a 'problem bank') and pre-failure corrective
action procedures to be administered by the new unit. The BRSA has sent the draft manual to the
Bank and the manual will be finalized after receiving the Bank's comments. The upgrading of
procedures manuals for all other existing BRSA units is progressing well and should be
completed by year end 2002.
46.   Integration of offsite & onsite monitoring and enforcement. Although significant progress
has been made in information sharing between departments, the concept of relationship
supervision with offsite examiners, enforcement staff, and Swom Bank auditors working in
teams on individual banks is not yet in place, and is hindered by banking law provisions
specifying that only Sworn Bank Auditors can examine banks. Informal discussions do take
place between departments to discuss bank issues but there is a further need to integrate sworn
bank auditors with the rest of the supervision staff within BRSA to develop a "team supervision"
approach.
47.   SDIF. In September 2000 the SDIF (responsible for administering the deposit insurance
scheme and for intervening and resolving failed banks), was transferred from the CBT where it
was housed to the new BRSA. The SDIF was already dealing with a sizeable pipeline of failed
banks before this transfer, and the case load of the agency has only increased since then.
Additionally, immediately after the November 2000 crisis, the SDIF was also given the
responsibility by the Government to administer the blanket guarantee covering all bank
depositors and creditors (except subordinated debt holders). To ensure the SDIF can effectively
implement its multiple functions, it is in need of a targeted institutional development effort. Key
development priorities include:
*  Overhaul of the SDIF's organizational structure to more clearly assign responsibility for
(i) the provision of overall strategic guidance and coordination, (ii) interim management
and resolution of intervened banks and (iii) asset resolution;
* Development of an asset resolution strate , including: (i) drawing up an inventory of
assets received, (ii) grouping them into various categories based on the appropriate
resolution/asset management/recovery method for each category; and (iii) creating an
appropriate institutional capacity including procedures, manuals and staff training; and
* Relocation. Most of the SDIF's activities take place in Istanbul, while the organization is
divided between Ankara and Istanbul;
* Funding. The SDIF resources from premiums collected from banks (even though
inadequate in the short term to meet the blanket guarantee commitments), have to be
properly planned to meet future deposit insurance commitments.
48.   SDIF management has realized that it needs a comprehensive institutional development
plan to address the above identified institutional development priorities. The SDIF has agreed to
seek external technical assistance from reputed consulting firms for this purpose, and has
selected McKinsey to provide such advisory services. With the help of the McKinsey technical



- 23 -
assistance primarily on the organization of the asset management and resolution activities, the
SDIF management will prepare a full institutional development plan by April 2002.
49.   SDIF Financial Statements and Audit. In view of the large number of bank interventions
undertaken by the SDIF and the complexity of the financial transactions used to resolve
intervened banks, the SDIF Board has decided to prepare detailed year-end 2001 financial
statements and to hire an independent external audit firm to audit these statements. A proper
financial track record can be used by the SDIF in future to raise public funds from local and
international markets, thereby reducing its dependence on Government resources to fund any
large commitments. The audit report is expected to be available by end July 2002 at the latest.
50.   Deposit Insurance Reform. The institutional development of the SDIF cannot be
successfully completed until its long term mandate is clearly articulated. In this context, over
time, the Government plans to remove the blanket guarantee for all bank depositors and creditors
presently in force under crisis conditions, and replace it with a risk-based deposit insurance
regime consistent with the applicable EU Directive. At the same time, the effective functioning
of the SDIF's present legal, governance, financing and management structure as a subsidiary of
the BRSA will be reviewed, and the feasibility of the SDIF existing as a separate autonomous
and institution will be considered as necessary. These further reform measures for the SDIF are
envisaged under the planned PFSAL I and II during 2002/and 2003.
E.    Implementation of Efficient Problem Bank/Bank Failure Resolution
51.   In the aftermath of the November 2000 and February 2001 crises, the capital base of
nearly all of the private, domestically owned deposit taking banks (21 banks as of early
December 2001 excluding SDIF banks) has been weakened substantially. Stress testing has
confirmed that as a result of the combined impact of interest rate, exchange rate and credit risk
shocks, many of the banks concerned either already have suffered, or are likely to suffer, from
capital inadequacy in the near future. Banks' capital deficits range from temporary non-
compliance with the eight percent minimum capital adequacy ratio requirement to deep
insolvency and inability of some of the banks concerned to survive on their own. To remedy this
potentially systemic capital shortfall, during the period March-May, 2001 the BRSA undertook
the following actions:
* The BRSA instructed all undercapitalized private banks not to pay dividends and to retain
all year 2000 earnings;
* Through a combination of offsite analysis and on-site examinations, the BRSA identified
all capital deficient banks, and the likely size of the already apparent, or soon to be
apparent capital shortfall in each bank concerned;
* The BRSA held in-depth discussions with each bank concerned on time-bound capital
restoration plans, including in some instances the need for the merger of multiple weaker
banks that belong to the same financial-industrial group into one larger, stronger bank;
and
* By end July 2001, the BRSA entered into capital restoration plans with all capital
deficient banks with the aim to restore their capital adequacy ratio to eight percent as
soon as possible.



- 24 -
52.   Continued Financial and Corporate Distress Further Erodes Banks' Capital. Under
their capital restoration plans, a number of private bank owners did put significant new capital
(nearly US$1.3 billion) into their banks. However, these amounts have been inadequate in light
of a broad and deep loss of capital in the private banking sector over 2001. The deep recession in
the second half of 2001, coupled with high interest rates and exchange rate depreciation, has
caused widespread corporate and financial sector distress, causing a steep increase in the level of
non- performing loans (NPLs) in the banking sector. NPLs in private banks' formal financial
statements are significantly understated (around 5 percent), while they have been more
accurately recorded in SDIF banks (nearly 50 percent) and state-owned banks (nearly 20
percent). Keeping in mind the level of NPLs during the East Asia crises, and the current
estimated levels of NPLs in the banking systems of Indonesia, China and Japan, it appears likely
that the level of NPLs in Turkish private banks is much higher than what is officially stated. At
the same time, the market value of collateral securing these loans has also fallen considerably
due to lack of demand for assets. The BRSA will undertake the necessary regulatory and
enforcement actions, including instructing external auditors to launch the process of ensuring
that all non-performing loans are correctly and transparently stated through proper classification
and provisioning procedures in the private deposit taking banks' balance sheets in order to reflect
their true capital position. However, there is general consensus that a significant number of
banks continue to be undercapitalized, and that the capacity of private bank owners to further
capitalize their banks is now somewhat limited.
53.   Strategy for Undercapitalized Banks at the end of December 2001. Private banks'
capital shortfalls, coupled with an aversion to risk based financial intermediation to the corporate
sector under unstable and difficult economic circumstances, has led the BRSA and the
Government to discuss possible strategies for restructuring the private banking sector. These
include: (i) facilitating development of an informal and voluntary corporate debt restructuring
framework under the auspices of the Banks' Association of Turkey (called the "Istanbul
Approach" on the lines of the "London Approach") funded by the banking sector's own
resources; and (ii) exploring options for possible public solvency support by the Government
through the SDIF for severely affected banks in order to retain a reasonable level of financial
intermediation in the sector.
54.   A corporate debt restructuring framework is necessary (either an informal approach or a
formal approach under the bankruptcy law), with the following sequence: (i) full recognition of
NPLs and capital losses in banks as the first step; (ii) capital restructuring of banks and
ownership and management changes/adjustments as a result of new capital holdings as a second
step; and (iii) corporate debt restructuring to be undertaken by a healthy banks ownership and
management team as a third step. This process will help Turkey achieve the required goals of
proper re-engagement between banks and their clients in the real sector. A public solvency
support scheme to assist in the re-capitalization of private banks has been planned by the
government and a "private bank re-capitalization law" explaining the rules and criteria for such
assistance has been passed in the Parliament on January 11, 2002 and with President's approval
became effective on January 31, 2002. Subsequent to this law, detailed regulations have also
been issued by the BRSA regarding (i) the norms for the detailed portfolio audits to be carried
out in the private banks by the external auditors to determine the correct levels of non performing



- 25 -
loans, and therefore the correct level of capital in the private banks; and (ii) the procedures for
implementation of the re-capitalization program. The audits are expected to be launched by the
early February 2002, and the first round of audit results are expected to be completed by the end
of March 2002. These audit results will be verified by a second set of external auditors by
approximately end April 2002. Based on these findings, by end May, 2002, the BRSA will
determine the correct level of capital in the private banks and finalize the re-capitalization
assistance program. The re-capitalization program implementation is expected to be carried
during June 2002.
55.    SDIF Banks. The resolution of SDIF banks began in earnest after the creation of the
BRSA in September 2000 and the transfer of the SDIF to the BRSA. During 2001, in addition to
stepped-up efforts to sell banks as going concems, resulting in the sale of Ekspress, Sumer and
Demir, the SDIF initiated a consolidation strategy through merger of groups of banks under its
control. As a result, by early November 2001 only eight banks remained under SDIF control In
late November Toprak Bank was also intervened by SDIF. However, subsequently during
December 2001- January 2002, the licenses of Eti, Iktisat and Kent were revoked and the banks
were put under liquidation, Site was sold to the Nova bank of Greece, EGS was merged with
Bayinder, thereby reducing the number of banks with SDIF under resolution to two-Bayindir
and Toprak. Out of the previously intervened banks, Turk Ticaret and Taris shareholders have
filed lawsuits in the Administrative courts and their final resolution will depend on the resolution
of the court appeals (see Box 2 below).
56.   Residual Liabilities and Assets-Last SDIF Bank. However, in the above resolution
process, while banks were being sold/ merged/closed, there still remained the problem of
managing residual liabilities and assets. Because the buyers of Ekspress, Sumer and Demir were
interested in acquiring only a small part of the assets and liabilities, especially FX liabilities, by
early November 2001 the SDIF was still left with approximately US$10.6 billion equivalent in
liabilities. Under the SDIF resolution program agreed with the Bank and the IMF, all SDIF banks
intervened before November 2001 were to be sold/merged/closed by end 2001. To meet this
deadline, during December 2001 the SDIF sold US$2.9 billion (US$2.6 billion in FX and
US$0.3 billion in TL) of SDIF bank liabilities to other private banks through a series of auctions,
together with a corresponding amount of Government securities based on the auction yield.
Additional FX liabilities and assets worth US$2.4 billion were also transferred to Ziraat and Halk
in late November 2001. All remaining deposit liabilities and non deposit liabilities together with
corresponding amounts of assets were transferred to Toprak (intervened in late November 2001)
and Bayindir. Bayindir has been restricted from taking new deposits and its activities in future
will focus on completion of asset resolution.

Box 2: SDIF Banks
During the period 1997-early 1999 only 3 banks were intervened by the SDIF. In September 1999, recognizing that problems were
mounting in the banking sector, an intensive dialogue between the Govemment and the Bank was initiated, resulting in the enactment of a
new banking law in December 1999 with strong resolution powers for the SDIF. Immediately upon the passage of the new law, the SDIF
intervened in an additional 5 banks. This rapid phase of initial action was followed by a 9 month period of relative inaction, as the CBT
and the Treasury were waiting for the fornation of the new BRSA. Unresolved questions about how the SDIF was to finance the injection
of cash and Govemment securities required for resolution of the banks under its control also contributed to the inaction.

With the operationalization of the BRSA on September 1, 2000 the pace of intervention and resolution picked up. In October 2000, an
additional 2 banks were intervened. In November 2000, the SDIF re-capitalized the banks under its control and immediately afterwards
announced the sale of the banks. Though there was some initial interest from both domestic and intemational groups, no banks were sold.
The November 2000 banking crisis was triggered by the excessive liquidity demands of Demir, which needed funds to support a highly
speculative position in Govemment securities. Unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due, Demir was taken over by the SDIF. To
prevent a system-wide deposit run, the Govemment issued a blanket guarantee, to be administered by the SDIF and exercisable upon
SDIF intervention, covering all banking system liabilities (except subordinated debt). Immediately following the February 2001 banking
crisis, the SDIF intervened in an additional 2 banks. Six more banks have been intervened since (five in July and one in November). The
principal features of most of these bank failures have been acute shortages of liquidity and a high incidence of fraudulent/criminal activity
on the part of shareholders and management.
Unable to dispose of the banks as going concems, in late 1999 the SDIF revoked the licenses of 5 banks and merged them into a
transition bank (Sumer). After financial and operational restructuring, in August 2001 Sumer was sold to Oyak, the Turkish army's
pension fund. A second transition bank was fomied by merging Inter and Es into Eti and the licenses of the former two banks were
revoked. The merged entity was restructured and offered for sale, but no buyers were found and its license was revoked on December 28,
2001. Two other banks were sold (Ekspress in June to Tekfen Holdings, and Demir in October to HSBC). In all three sales transactions,
however, only a part of assets and liabilities was sold. To meet the end December 2001 deadline of resolving all banks intervened prior to
November 2001, the SDIF during late 2001 auctioned off US$2.9 billion of SDIF bank liabilities together with matching assets to private
banks, transferred US$2.4 billion of FX assets and liabilities to Ziraat and Halk, and moved the remaining assets and liabilities to Toprak
(intervened in late November 2001) and Bayindir. Bayinder has been restricted from taking new deposits and its activities will be
focused in future on completion of asset resolution.

F.     Legal Framework for Creditor Rights, Bankruptcy and Debt Workout
57.    As Turkey is currently facing one of its most severe financial crises with large amounts
of NPLs on the books of commercial banks, effective NPL resolution through efficient legal
mechanisms for debt recovery, insolvency and informal workouts is a critical necessity.
However, in Turkey, NPL resolution is constrained by inadequate and outdated legal procedures,
and institutional inefficiencies. Effective NPL resolution requires: (i) strengthening creditor
protection; (ii) accelerating bankruptcy resolution through the courts and (iii) creating debtor
rehabilitation/workout mechanisms both under the bankruptcy law, and through informal debt
resolution among debtors and multiple lenders ('Istanbul' approach, modeled on the London
approach, also used by Asian crisis countries). The Government already has prepared new
legislation for informal debt resolution that it intends to submit to Parliament shortly. Some
necessary amendments to the civil code and the bankruptcy law are also already planned by the
Ministry of Justice. Recognizing the need for greater efficiency in the court system, the
Government furthermore recently also already prepared new legislation to create an intermediate
court of appeals. But much more comprehensive legal and institutional reforms will be needed,
and to this end the Government has agreed to undertake an overall assessment of its legal and
institutional framework for creditor rights and insolvency, using the World Bank's Principles
and Guidelines for Effective Insolvency and Creditor Rights Systems (April 2001). This
assessment will identify specific reforms required in Turkey's legal and institutional framework
in core areas related to enforcement of creditor rights (including creation, registration and
enforcement of security), formal and informal corporate insolvency and restructuring systems,
credit risk management practices and institutional and regulatory frameworks. The Government
is committed to subsequently pursue implementation of the actions for legal reform and capacity
building recommended by the assessment. Specifically, the Ministry of Justice plans to establish
a feedback group to review and provide input to the assessment and develop a strategy for
corrective measures to strengthen relevant legislation. The Ministry of Justice also plans to
establish a commission to prepare amendments to relevant legislation for submission to
Parliament as soon as possible in an effort to maximize prospects for resolution of non-
performing loans and to kick start the credit markets.
G.     Implementation of Comprehensive Restructuring and Privatization of State-owned
Banks
58.    Background. Until July 2001, nearly a third of banking system assets and deposits were
accounted for by four large state-owned banks, Ziraat, Halk, Emlak and Vakif, with Ziraat
traditionally focused on agricultural finance9, Halk on lending to small businesses and artisans,
and Emlak on public housing construction. Vakif is a retail and general corporate sector focused
bank, and has an ownership structure dating from Ottoman times, with A and B shares (55 and
20 percent of capital respectively) historically belonging to so-called 'vakifs' (foundations) and
9 Ziraat actually combines three separate activities into one entity: (i) agricultural finance; (ii) general commnercial
banking; and (iii) payment and collection services for the Government. Because of the latter, and as the bank is the
only bank serving small rural communities, its restructuring and privatization will be more complex than that of the
other three state banks. In preparation for its eventual privatization, Ziraat prepared its first set of IAS financial
statements for the year ended December 1999.



- 28 -
now represented by the Ministry of State's General Directorate of Foundations, and the
remaining C shares (25 percent of total) belonging to the bank's pension fund and employees.
Longstanding Government governance and ownership steadily eroded the financial condition of
Ziraat, Halk and Emlak. For Ziraat and Halk, enormous losses (nearly US$23.0 billion as of
April 200110) were hidden under the umbrella of illiquid Government "duty losses" (paper
claims on the Government carried on the banks' books) as a by-product of subsidized, directed
lending for agriculture and small business development. The distortion in the money markets
caused by the large liquidity shortfalls experienced by these two banks as a result of the rapid
build-up of the duty loss claims was one of the principal propagators of the November 2000 and
February 2001 banking crises. Similarly, Emlak also accumulated significant losses through its
construction related activities and non-performing loans, and the bank was already insolvent
even before the November 2000 crisis.
59.   Financial and Governance Restructuring-First Phase Already Completed. To put
the financial structure of the state-owned banks on a sound footing, to ensure that these banks are
effectively and professionally managed on an arms length basis and transformed into profitable
commercial banks that can be rapidly privatized, the Government, in cooperation with the CBT
and the BRSA, has undertaken the following actions:
* recapitalization of Ziraat and Halk with Government securities at market terms in a mix
of maturities and currency denominations with floating coupon interest paid quarterly to
ensure that the banks have sufficient liquidity to operate and honor any deposit
withdrawals, allow the write-off of all duty loss claims as of mid May 2001 and the
absorption of losses associated with the merger of Emlak into Ziraat (see below);
*  appointment of a new independent professional Governing Board for the two banks with
the mandate to manage these banks in accordance with commercial principles and all
prudential guidelines under the banking law/issued by the BRSA; the Governing Board
has initiated the operational restructuring of the two banks, including the closure of
unprofitable branches and the reduction of redundant staff;
* appointment by the Governing Board of a Restructuring Adviser for Ziraat and a
Restructuring and Privatization Preparation Adviser for Halk;
* the transfer of construction related assets on the books of Emlak to the Mass Housing
Administration, the completion of the merger of all banking liabilities and all the
performing banking assets of Emlak with Ziraat; the provision of sufficient capital to
Ziraat in the form of marketable Government securities carrying quarterly floating rate
coupon interest to allow it to absorb all losses related to Emlak's merger; and
* the revocation of Emlak's banking license (July 2001).
60.   Financial and Operational Restructuring-Second Phase Underway. The creation of
a joint governing Board for Ziraat and Halk with a common chairman has significantly improved
governance of the two banks. Both banks are now managed by a single management board
responsible for all policy decisions on strategy, credit, asset/liability management, management
information system, human resource management and so on.
10 Further details are available in the PFPSAL Memorandum of the President dated June 2001.



- 29 -
61.   Financial Restructuring. The first priority of the management has been to put the two
banks on a sound financial footing. Towards this objective the two banks are now: (i) capitalized
significantly over the minimum capital adequacy ratios; (ii) FX risk has been eliminated by
matching short term FX assets with short term FX liabilities; (iii) the banks' liquidity position
has steadily improved through receipt of coupoIn interest on Government securities in cash, and
short term TL repos are gradually being eliminated-management has already eliminated short
term TL repos in Ziraat during December 2001, and will do so in Halk by end May 2002; (iv)
liability interest costs have been brought down through good liability management, and as a
result operating earning margins have turned significantly positive for Ziraat while they are still
borderline for Halk; and (v) better management of the credit portfolio and recognition of NPLs,
and stopping making loans to non-deserving entities. It is important to note that in spite of tighter
credit management, loans to small farmers and entrepreneurs continue to be made more or less as
before--it is the provision of larger loans to unsound borrowers for non-commercial reasons that
has now been stopped.
62.   Impact of Government Plans to Capitalize Interest and Principal Payments on
Government Securities held by Ziraat and Halk. Treasury is considering to capitalize some of the
coupon interest and principal payments due to Ziraat and Halk rather than to pay in cash. This
may cause: (i) a ballooning of Ziraat's and Halk's Government securities portfolios, with
concomitant enhanced liquidity and interest rate risks, and (ii) a reversal of the financial
restructuring process currently underway. To mitigate these risks, Treasury has assured
management that it will provide sufficient coupon interest and principal payments in cash
(approximately TL 8.3 quadrillion during 2002) to: (i) allow elimination of all short term
liabilities; and (ii) accommodate a certain risk level of term deposits not being rolled over by
depositors (a roll-over ratio of 75 percent is assumed). Treasury and management are in broad
agreement with this strategy, and so far the coordination between Treasury and the two banks has
worked well.
63.   Operational restructuring. The operational restructuring of the two banks in terms of
organizational structure, introduction of the concept of profit centers, reduction of the branch
networks and staffing etc. has begun, but has met with some resistance, especially on the issue of
branch closures. The details are:
64.   Branch network. Management has put in place a new branch structure for the two banks,
which consists of 37 hub branches at Ziraat, and 22 hub branches at Halk. The objective is to
enable the hubs to function as profit centers with responsibility for the resources and business in
their respective regions. In addition to the hubs, management estimates that Ziraat should have
around 1,000 sub-branches and Halk around 500 for profitable operation. Taking into account
the current number of branches of the two banks (including branches inherited from Emlak), this
implies that nearly 900 branches will need to be closed by mid 2002. To date (January 2002) 96
Ziraat and Halk branches have been closed, but these closures were in areas where there was
duplication. Further closures have been put on hold pending resolution of political objections to
the social upheavals such closures might cause.
65.   Staffing. Ziraat currently (January 2002) has around 33,000 staff, and Halk 15,000-
inclusive of about 9,000 former employees of Emlak. Management estimates that the number of



-30-
employees should be reduced to approximately 21,000 in Ziraat and 11,000 in Halk by mid 2002,
a substantial downsizing of nearly 16,000 employees within half a year. All employees, based on
new contracts containing job descriptions and associated remuneration will be given a limited
time period in which to either (i) accept the position, (ii) leave the bank (including possibly
through retirement), (iii) or choose to remain civil servants to be transferred to other Government
agencies (this will require issuance of Government instructions to facilitate such transfers). This
process has commenced with the top 6,000 staff already contracted under private law in the two
banks (January 2002) and will continue over the coming six months.
66.   To overcome hurdles to branch closures and staffing reductions, the Council of Ministers
issued a decree no. 2002/3555 dated January 12, 2002, approving management's proposed
course of action. Without such backing it would not have been possible to carry out the
operational restructuring within the timeframe envisaged. As some branch closures may result in
unavailability of banking service in certain rural areas of the country, the Post Office
Administration has entered into a Protocol with the Social Security Institutions, SSK and Emekli
Sandigi to make payments on behalf of them.
67.   Privatization of Halk and Ziraat-Third Phase. As noted above, the financial and
operational restructuring of the two banks should be largely completed by end 2002. Therefore,
preparation for the two banks' privatization should start now to allow the sale of the two banks
upon completion of their restructuring. For this purpose, the Government plans to appoint a
privatization advisor for the two banks by mid 2002. Completion of the necessary pre-
privatization actions for both banks are expected to be mostly completed by end 2002, and Halk
is expected to be privatized in the first half of 2003. Ziraat also plans to complete, by mid 2002, a
study on the future strategic direction of agricultural finance in Turkey and Ziraat's role in the
provision of such finance. A sale of shares in Ziraat to private sector entities resulting in majority
private ownership and control (more than 51 percent) is expected during 2003.
68.   Privatization of Vakif. In June 2001, Parliament enacted an amendment to the law on
the privatization of Vakif to allow the simultaneous sale of A and B shares. The Government and
Vakif management have now decided to proceed with a joint sale of the balance 75 percent (both
A and B) shares of Vakif still under state ownership. Vakif management has hired an investment
bank to act as Privatization Advisor for the sale. Following a short listing and bidding process
involving reputable international investment banks, Vakif has appointed Merrill Lynch for this
purpose. The process of seeking expressions of interest from prospective buyers and of
undertaking due diligence has started. Vakif, because of its strong client base and a diversified
loan book, is considered a good banking franchise and the share sale is expected to attract
significant market interest. The privatization process is expected to be completed by mid 2002.

III. TURKEY'S PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM
A.    Introduction
69.   The Govenmment's public sector reforn program aims to underpin sustained fiscal
adjustment and create the conditions for transparent and effective government. In combination
with the financial sector reform program described in Section II, the public sector reform
program addresses the underlying structural factors that led to the crisis, thereby trying to ensure
that these conditions do not recur in the future. In particular, the program aims to break the
vicious circle of inadequate public sector management leading to ever increasing public
indebtedness that fuels financial sector weakness through dependency on high return government
securities which in turn inflates the public debt burden.
70.   The program   focuses on three critical areas, each of which has a medium-term
dimension:
*  Implement structural fiscal policies to ensure permanent fiscal adjustment;
*  Launch a medium-term program of policy and institutional reforms to improve the
transparency and efficiency of public expenditure management (PEM) including action
to:
*  Improve budget preparation and execution, policy formulation, and the operational
performance of public agencies,
*  Upgrade public accounting, procurement and audit standards to ensure financial
accountability, and
* Ensure prudent public liability management; and
* Initiate broad based institutional reforns to improve the quality of public sector
governance.
71.   The underlying problems with the structure and management of the public sector have
been analyzed in detail in the CEM on Structural Reforms for Sustainable Growth and the Public
Expenditure and Institutional Review. Table 6 shows that Turkey's public sector is large relative
to OECD comparators such as Spain and Portugal, and that public spending has greatly exceeded
available resources." Countries like Germany and Italy, with comparably high levels of
expenditure sustain this with much greater revenue effort and therefore run much smaller
deficits. Central to this problem is extensive Govemment intervention throughout the economy
and an under performing system of public sector management. The first dimension of the
problem is being addressed though the on-going structural reforms to the social security system,
to modernize agriculture support policies, deregulate energy and telecommunications, and
implement privatization. The second dimension arises from the long neglect of the need to
modernize the procedures and institutions which govern decision-making and resource allocation
II Including a monetary correction for nominal interest payments would reduce the general government deficit for
Turkey in Table 6 to about 3 percent of GDP in 1999. However, this does not include duty losses of the state banks
(estimated at about 6 percent of GDP in 1999 after monetary correction) or the losses of the SEE sector. The
operational deficit for the public sector as a whole is estimated to have exceeded 12 percent of GDP in 1999.

in the public sector. The impact of many years of weak fiscal discipline and poor expenditure
management is also reflected in the composition of public expenditure. The share of public
spending on interest payments and wages and salaries in Turkey varies greatly from almost all of
its OECD counterparts. This difference is inconsistent with the objectives of sustained economic
growth and equity.
B.      Recent Developments in Public Sector Reform
72.     The Government has made substantial progress in defining and implementing its public
sector reform program since last July. Two of the four public sector reform triggers for PFPSAL
II as set out in the Memorandum      of the President for the first PFPSAL (Box 3) have been fully
met. These cover rationalization of the public investment program and enactment of the new
public procurement law. The public debt management law is expected to be adopted by
Parliament by end-March as a condition of Board presentation of PFPSAL 11 and enacted shortly
thereafter, thereby meeting the third trigger. The fourth trigger concerning satisfactory progress
in consolidating the budget to improve its scope and transparency will be met prior to the release
of the third tranche of the loan. These policy and institutional reforms are core components of
the Government's strategy for improving public expenditure management in Turkey. In the area

of structural fiscal policies, the Government has: (i) adopted a medium-term strategy for
improving the tax system and (ii) initiated a comprehensive employment policy for the public
sector. The latter program is a cornerstone of the Government's efforts to modernize the public
sector. In the area of public sector governance, the Government has adopted a national strategy
for improving governance and combating corruption which will be published by end-March.
73.     The implementation of the new legislation on public procurement and debt management,
together the other elements of the Government's public sector reform agenda-including the tax
strategy, public employment program and anti-corruption strategy, will be supported by the
second and third tranches of the PFPSAL II, as well as the proposed PPSAL and the expected
follow-up PPSAL II under the next CAS. To coordinate implementation of this complex agenda,
the Government intends to establish a new structure involving a small group of key ministers
acting as a Steering Group with clear coordination and program implementation responsibilities.
Under the new structure, the steering committee for public expenditure management reform will
operate under the authority of this Group. A committee will also be formed under the Steering
Group to support implementation of the national anti-corruption strategy. The ministerial



- 34 -
committee for civil service reform, which has already been established, will work in close
coordination with the new Steering Group. More detailed information on the status of the public
sector reform program and expected follow-up actions is presented in the paragraphs below.
(C.         ncrCudnrlR Fscal Policies
74.     The Government is implementing additional fiscal measures to meet the primary surplus
target of 6.5 percent of GNP for the consolidated public sector-of which 5.4 percent of GNP for
the central government--set in the budget for 2002 (Table 7). While the primary surplus is
targeted to increase by one percent of GNP in 2002, the authorities have identified fiscal
measures equivalent to two percent of GNP in order to compensate for certain revenue
weaknesses and expenditure pressures (Box 4). In particular, tax revenue on interest income is
projected to fall from 3.6 percent of GNP in 2001 to about 2.4 percent in 2002 as interest rates
ease. In response, the authorities are increasing excise taxes, notably those on petroleum
products, in some cases with significant negative externalities and distortions. A broader, more
comprehensive effort is needed to shift revenues to a more sustainable base as envisaged in the
medium-term tax strategy discussed below (para. 77).

Box 4: Fiscal Package for 2002
Revenue Increases (1.2 percent of GNP)
*   Petroleum consumption tax (PCT) was increased by 6 percent in November 2001 (diesel by 35 percent),
thereafter the PCT will continue to be increased at a rate at least equal to WPI inflation; a PCT on natural gas has
been introduced, effective May 2002, at a specific rate of TL 5,000 per cubic meter to be subsequently indexed
to the WPI.
*   Special transactions tax was increased by 50 percent and the motor vehicles tax by 75 percent, effective January
1, 2002.
*   The property tax rate was increased by 100 percent: and the share of tax revenues allocated to metropolitan
municipalities reduced from 5 percent to 4.1 percent (revenue neutral for the municipalities).
*   Administered prices were increased in November 2001 as follows: alcohol and tobacco products by 25 percent,
Turk Telekom tariffs by 12 percent, and sugar by 25 percent. Sugar prices were increased by another 15 percent
in December 2001. Electricity tariffs were restored by November 2001 to US 4.5 cents benchmark set under
ERL program, after falling in mid-2001 as a result of the devaluation. Discounted tariffs by SEEs were
eliminated in January 2002.
*   Legal and regulatory measures were implemented in December 2001 to improve collections of electricity bills
by TEDAS.
Personnel and Benefit Expenditures (0.5 percent of GNP)
*   Maintain civil service salaries constant in real terms according to the current indexation system and maintain the
ceiling on the total number of civil servants in the consolidated budget (excluding transferred state bank civil
servants); the replacement hiring ratio for the government budget agencies except education, health and security
will be reduced from 80 percent to 50 percent effective January 2002; rents for civil servants living in state
housing were increased by 50 percent in December 2001.
*   Limit on replacement hiring by SEEs in 2002 was tightened from 15 percent to 10 percent of attrition and to 0
percent for SEEs financed from the consolidated budget; mandatory retirement for public sector workers over 50
years of age was authorized in December 2001; measures have been taken to reduce the wage bill in SEEs by 10
percent relative to the total projected wage bill (postponement of two bonus payments until 2003 can be
authorized by the Council of Ministers).
*   Reduce regulated profit margins for medicine, tighten quality controls, limnit prescription to necessary amounts,
withhold a 10 percent co-payment for prescriptions for Emekli Sandigi and Bag-Kur pensioners; legislation
passed in January 2002 to increase health premia for Bag-Kur members by 5 percentage points (broader
legislation to reform Bag-Kur administration remains pending in Parliament).
Operating Expenditures (0.2 percent of GNP)
*   Eliminate regional level administration and other regional line agency offices (legislation pending); gradually
shift the workers, equipment and responsibilities of certain departments to the provincial level administrations
(legislation pending). Transfers to these departments will be reduced by TL :330 trillion; efficiency gains and
additional revenues associated with revaluing properties for tax purposes (expected in 2002) should enable local
government to cope with this burden.
*   Instruct SEEs to lower general administration expenses and reduce inventories; eliminate loss-making railroad
routes and unprofitable THY flights; and close idle airports.
Agriculture Subsidies (0.1 percent of GNP)
*   Reduce indirect agriculture subsidies and budgetary transfers to SEKER in line with the increase in sugar prices.
75.    While the fiscal package for 2002 continues to rely heavily on revenue measures, it does
include a number of significant expenditure measures as well. Most importantly, the package
incorporates an initial set of policies to promote retrenchment of public employment (primarily



- 36 -
in the SEE sector) discussed in more detail below (para. 81) as part of the longer-term process to
modernize the public sector. Also reflected in the fiscal package is the continued progress in
reforming agriculture support policies including the termination of the agriculture credit
subsidies temporarily reintroduced in 2001, the reduction of indirect subsidies for specific
products and cuts in budgetary transfers to SEKER, the state sugar company. 12 These measures
will increase the funding available for the DIS program.
76.    Most of the elements of the 2002 fiscal package have been introduced by the Government
as a condition for Board presentation of PFPSAL II and as a prior action for the new IMF Stand-
by Arrangement. Implementation of the 2002 fiscal package, including implementation of the
remaining measures, will be monitored during PFPSAL II supervision in close collaboration with
the IMF. The Government is committed to take additional action in the context of the 2002
fiscal package, if needed to meet the primary surplus target. While the 2002 fiscal package
incorporates a number of important structural measures, it continues a pattern of reliance on
revenue increases over expenditure cuts and on temporary measures. Moreover, a number of
provisions in the package are likely to prove difficult to enforce in practice, particularly steps to
reduce operational expenditures. Over the medium term, deeper and more permanent structural
fiscal measures will be needed in order to sustain the fiscal adjustment. These structural
measures will complete and build on the results achieved under the ERL program particularly in
the areas of social security reform, energy reform, and reform of agriculture support policies.
77.    The Government has adopted a medium-term strategy for improving the tax system in
Turkey based on a review carried out jointly with the World Bank. The overarching objective of
the strategy is to improve the stability, transparency and equity of the tax system through
measures to minimize tax distortions, broaden the tax base and improve the efficiency of tax
administration. This will allow an equivalent amount of revenue to be raised at lower marginal
tax rates thereby promoting economic growth. The strategy builds on the 1998 tax reform and
draws on earlier analysis of the tax system including work carried out under the Bank's Public
Financial Management Project (PFMP). It does not purport to be a full-fledged tax reform at this
stage.  Studies of the tax system  by the IMF and World Bank13 and of the investment
environment by FIAS14 have signaled concerns about the complexity and lack of transparency of
Turkey's tax system, which is exacerbated by tax policy instability coupled with high and
unstable inflation rates. Much of the complexity and instability arises from the proliferation of
special and additional taxes and surcharges as a result of urgent pressures to reduce the fiscal
12 The 2002 budget does include TL 50 trillion introduced by the Parliament to fund credit subsidies for smnall
business through Halk Bank. This will be funded by increased transfers to the budget from the operational surpluses
of the Istanbul Stock Exchange, Capital Markets Board and other regulatory agencies.

Box 5: Tax Strategy Priorities
Tax Policy
*   Simplify and consolidate the indirect tax structure with a VAT with a standard rate and two low rates (1
percent for agriculture and 8 percent for other basic consumption goods). Introduce a unified Special
Consumption Tax that will consolidate the current range of excise and specific taxes into a single tax charged
on a limited range of luxury goods. A threshold will be established for obligatory filing of VAT returns.
Earmarking of revenues will be abolished and all revenues from earmarked taxes will be brought into the
budget.
*   Simplify and consolidate the direct tax regime in line with OECD standards and international best practice.
Convert tax rebate for wage earners into a tax credit to simply administration and reduce tax burden on low
income wage earners. Minimize tax exemptions and exceptions.
*   Harmonize real effective tax rates across all types of financial instruments and maturities.
*   Phase in the full indexation of the corporate and business income taxes (real interest deduction to replace
nominal interest deduction). Reduce the scope of investment incentives, consolidate into a single investment
allowance rate across sectors and geographic regions, and gradually eliminate withholding tax on these
allowances. Make the incentive system more transparent and automatic.
*   Overhaul the tax regime for free trade zones. Terminate the corporate tax and payroll tax exemptions.
Provide reduced corporate tax rate only on condition that separate subsidiaries are established and inward
trading is below 15 percent of sales.
* Adjust taxation of financial leasing in line with internationally generally accepted accounting practices.
Tax Admninistration
*   Reorganize the GDR to introduce functional structure in line with OECD practice.
*   Revise payment scheme for managers and key technical staff and design a bonus and incentive system which
allows more competitive total remuneration for these positions.
*   Upgrade the tax policy department within the GDR.
*   Strengthen tax audit management capacity within the MOF by establishing an audit coordination unit and
upgrade the role of the audit department in the GDR. Prepare a coordinated annual auditing plan. Develop
databases for tax audit planning and the use of information from the tax identification number (TIN) system
for effective auditing. Design a more comprehensive large taxpayer audit strategy and improve knowledge
and database on large taxpayers and their business transactions.
*   Develop a strategy for taxpayer services and improvements in relations between taxpayers and the GDR.
*   Upgrade internal audit function for the tax administration reporting directly to the head of GDR.
*   Design and implement program to reduce tax arrears.
*   Upgrade the management information systems throughout the GDR.
deficit. Partial inflation indexation in combination with differential nominal tax rates and
investment incentives across financial instruments have left highly distorted real effective tax
rates across financial instruments and real business investments. Investors have identified
bureaucratic red tape, delays in processing applications for licenses or investment allowances
and VAT refund claims, and corruption as additional negative factors affecting investment and
business operations.
78.    The Government's tax strategy lays out a series of coordinated actions over the course of
the next three years to address certain serious tax policy and administration issues facing Turkey.
The priority objectives are summarized in Box 5. The details and sequencing of specific actions
are being discussed and agreed with the Bank and 1MF. In the area of tax policy, near-term
actions under the strategy are grouped into two phases to be implemented over the course of
2002. The first phase, to be enacted in a revenue-neutral manner by April 2002, focuses on



- 38 -
simplifying the system of indirect taxation. The second phase addresses improvements to the
system of direct taxation. The objectives are to: (i) harmonize taxes on investment income; (ii)
rationalize ad hoc inflation adjustments in the tax system and lessen distortions associated with
the taxation of nominal interest income; (iii) rationalize the system of investment incentives; and
(iv) overhaul the system of credits against income tax. Legislation for the direct tax changes will
be submitted to Parliament by October 2002 to take effect as of January 2003.
79.   The strategy also tackles tax administration issues encompassing institutional
improvements, automation, transparency, compliance, taxpayer services and tax audit. It is
designed to align Turkey progressively with best practice in other OECD countries. As a key
milestone, the MOF will publish a circular implementing the new functional structure within the
General Department of Revenues by June 2002. The functional reorganization will reorient the
GDR from a structure based on administration of individual taxes to one based on the core
functions of tax administration including taxpayer registration, taxpayer services, collections,
audit, legal, information technology, and human resources. The tax policy unit of GDR will be
upgraded. The MOF will also create an audit coordination committee at the ministerial level
which will be responsible for preparing annual audit plan. The audit capacity of GDR will also
be enhanced with additional resources. The legal framework for other priority actions in the area
of tax administration is expected to be in place before the end of 2002. Adoption of the tax
strategy was a condition of Board presentation for PFPSAL II. Satisfactorv implementation of
the strategv will be a condition for release of the second and third tranches of the loan. Further
progress in implementing the strategy to improve the tax system will be a benchmark for the
proposed PPSAL.
80.   Deeper structural measures are underway on the expenditure side as well, as part of a
longer-term strategy to modernize the public sector, ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability,
and free up resources for private investment and job creation in support of Turkey's growth
objectives. This strategy includes action to: (i) withdraw the state from direct involvement in
productive activities through the restructuring and privatization of SEEs and reform of
agriculture support policies, (ii) contain and then gradually eliminate the deficits of the social
security institutions, (iii) curtail the scope of the government's contingent liabilities through the
introduction of an energy market and transparent guidelines for financial and project guarantees
under the new public debt law, (iv) restructure central government agencies and decentralize
additional functions to provincial and local governments in coordination with efforts to improve
governance and financial accountability at the local level, and (v) implement a comprehensive
public employment program, including retrenchment of SEE employment. The retrenchment in
SEE employment supports the policy of a non-inflationary, sustained shift in the overall SEE
balance from deficit to surplus (see Table 7). While reducing SEE employment is always
difficult and entails social costs, the fiscal adjustment it supports will reduce crowding out and
promote the strategically important objective of private sector investment and job creation,
particularly for Turkey's youth. Under the public employment program, the Government
successfully met its objective of holding stable the number of civil servants under the
consolidated budget in 2001, while ensuring additional recruitment to meet needs in the social
sectors, notably education. The policy of replacing up to a maximum of 15 percent of retiring
personnel in the SEEs led to a modest reduction in their total workforce in 2001 (Table 8).

81.   Going forward, the Government is taking a more comprehensive approach to public
employmnent policy. For 2002, the focus of the program is on retrenchment of redundant labor in
the SEE sector and consolidation of aggregate limits on civil service employment in advance of
deeper civil service reform. The ceiling on civil service employment in the central govemment
agencies is being renewed for 2002 and expanded to cover civil servants employed in the local
administrations.15 The limit on replacement hiring in the SEEs has been tightened to 10 percent
of attrition and no replacement hiring will be authorized for SEEs requiring finance from the
budget. In addition, the hiring of security personnel has been included in the SEE replacement
hiring rule for 2002. In December 2001, long-standing restrictions were lifted on the ability of
managers to require public sector workers over 50 years of age to retire. Approximately 15,000
public sector workers were retired or notified of their retirement, laid off, or converted to private
contract status between December 2001 and end-January 2002. The large majority of these
public sector workers were employed in the SEEs. Civil service employment is regulated by
specific labor legislation and civil servants are not subject to this early retirement policy.
82.   The Government has identified (with Bank assistance under the PSSP project) redundant
public sector workers in Turk Telekom and in the PA portfolio of companies. The Government
is updating and expanding this earlier analysis to identify all redundant workers and positions in
SEEs. As of end-January, the Government had eliminated 90 percent of all unfilled SEE
positions. By end-April, the Government will translate the updated information into specific
positions in the companies, and determine how to meet the target of reducing the identified
redundancies by one third by end-June through voluntary retirement offers and layoffs only
when necessary.  Using company-specific information, the Government will by end-May
produce final estimates of redundant positions. These redundancies will be reduced by a
cumulative two thirds by end-October 2002, and, by end-June 2003, the remaining redundancies
will be phased out. For this well-targeted attrition, no replacement hiring will be allowed, and
the resulting unfilled positions will be immediately eliminated. Compliance with this program
by individual SEEs will be audited on a quarterly basis. The Government is also undertaking
coordinated efforts to ensure that adequate finding is in place for the lump-sum severance
payments due to retiring and laid-off workers.16 This is particularly important for loss-making
SEEs which cannot cover these payments from their own cash flow. 7 The net cost of this
initiative (severance payments minus wage savings) will not be counted towards the primary
surplus target for 2002 up to a limit of TL 1.25 quadrillion.
83.   To ensure close coordination among the relevant agencies and the necessary political will
for these tough measures, the Government has confided responsibility for the public employment
program to a newly established ministerial committee which will also be responsible for civil
service reform (see para. 105 below). Initiation of the comprehensive public employment
15 In practice, new civil service hiring in the local administrations will be limited to 2001 attrition.
16 With the introduction of the new unemployment insurance scheme, the Bank has recommended to the authorities
to consider a fundamental restructuring of the severance payment system over the medium term.
17 Experience to date under the PSSP project provides a rough upper bound for severance payment costs of some
US$15,000 per worker. Additional costs arising from reduced social security contributions have been factored into
the 2002 fiscal programL

program was a Board condition for PFPSAL II and its further implementation will be a condition
for release of the second and third tranches of the loan. Follow-up actions under the program
will be supported by the envisaged PPSAL.
D.         Public Expenditure Management
84.        The key elements of the Government's multi-year strategy for public expenditure
management (PEM) reform are laid out in its Strategic Framework for Public Expenditure
Management Reform. This strategic framework is the result of many years of internal discussion
in Turkey about the need to modernize public expenditure management, particularly at the higher
levels of the government bureaucracy. It draws on the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on
restructuring of public financial management and fiscal transparency which was subsequently
reflected in the eighth 5 year Development Plan. It also draws extensively on the PEIR and
incorporates recommendations from the Fiscal Transparency Review carried out by the IMF in
2000. The Government's strategic framework was annexed to the LDP for the first PFPSAL and



- 41 -
remains the basis for the PEM reforns under the PFPSAL program and subsequent
programmatic operations. The framework is structured in matrix fashion into three priority areas
in support of three core objectives. The objectives, commonly referred to in international
practice as levels 1-3, are: strengthening aggregate discipline (level 1), building capacity for
policy formulation (level 2), and improving the performance of public agencies (level 3). The
three priorities for PEM reform are to:
*  Reform the processes for budget preparation and execution. This involves steps to: (i)
improve the transparency and comprehensiveness of the budget in line with international
standards, (ii) strengthen the credibility of the budget preparation process, (iii) build capacity
for policy formulation at all levels of government, and (iv) realize concrete improvements in
the operational performance of line ministries and agencies through a progressive shift to
perfornance-oriented budgeting.
*  Upgrade public accounting, procurement and audit functions to ensure adeguate financial
accountability. This encompasses legal changes to introduce international fiduciary
standards, as well as institutional changes to build capacity to implement the new standards
and shift from formalistic ex ante control to effective ex post monitoring.
*  Ensure prudent public liability management. This involves legal measures to establish clear
lines of borrowing authority and transparent reporting of public liabilities, as well as
institutional measures to build up the capacity for modem fiscal risk management.
85.    Budget Reform. The Government continues to make significant progress in improving
the transparency and scope of the budget. In the 2002 budget, all budgetary and extra-budgetary
funds have been closed with the exception of the Support Price Stabilization Fund (DFIF), linked
to the restructuring of the agriculture sales cooperative unions (ASCUs) under the ARIP, and
five EBFs. The Government has renewed its commitment not to create new budgetary or extra-
budgetary funds. The DFIF will be closed at the end of the Agriculture Reform Implementation
Project with the World Bank. For the remaining EBFs (excluding the SDIF which is covered
under the financial sector reform program), the Government will undertake the following actions
with effect from the 2003 budget: (i) submit their budgets to Parliament for approval, (ii) audit
their accounts annually, and (iii) report their operations monthly on a consolidated basis with the
central government. The presentation of the 2002 budget to the Parliament was supplemented
with the submission in October of the accounts and financial outlook for the contingent liabilities
of the Treasury, the remaining extra budgetary funds, the social security institutions, autonomous
agencies, local authorities", and SEEs.'9 The number of revolving funds which are used by local
institutions to supplement budget allocations was reduced from over 2,600 to 1,981 by late 2001,
and a further reduction to about 1,400 is expected by end-March 2002. In implementing this
rationalization, the Government has to pay particular attention not to degrade the operational
perfornance of agencies which rely on revolving funds.
18 There are three levels of local authority in Turkey: (i) 80 Special Provincial Administrations are the central
government's agencies at regional level, (ii) about 3,300 municipalities have been established in settlements of more
than 2,000 inhabitants (and in provincial and district centres regardless of population size), and are home to about
70% of Turkey's population, and (iii) some 35,000 villages governed by elected head-men (Muhtar) and council-of-
elders. Local authorities have accounted for some 4.5 percent of GNP in public expenditure in recent years.
3 9This information was presented in the Public Finance Report prepared by SPO in September 2001.

86.   In June 2001, the Government completed a new budget classification for consolidated
budget agencies in line with new GFS standards. All preparations have been completed for
implementation of the new GFS classification on a pilot basis in the 2002 budget. Six pilot
agencies have been selected (Table 9) and training has been carried out for their staff. Three of
these agencies will participate in a joint pilot of the new budget classification and accounting
standards (para. 94). An article has been included in the 2002 annual budget law to give the
MOF authority to expand the new budget classification to cover all of general government as
defined by GFS.20 The above actions meet the conditions for Board presentation of the PFPSAL
II. As a condition for release of the second tranche of the loan, the MOF will issue a circular
expanding the definition of the GFS budget classification to all general government agencies by
March 2002. Satisfactory implementation of the pilot GFS program will be a condition for
release of the third tranche of the loan. Rollout of the new budget classification for the
consolidated budget agencies will begin with the 2003 budget cycle. The new GFS budget
classification is expected to be fully operational for the entire general govermment in the 2004
budget.

87.   Important steps have been taken to improve the credibility of the budget preparation
process and rationalize the public investment program (PIP) in the 2002 budget cycle. The
framework for these actions was established under the first PFPSAL by a High Planning Council
decision issued in June 2001 to accompany the Prime Minister's Budget Call. The HPC decision
provided a macro-fiscal framework for 2002 budget preparation including overall levels for the
recurrent and investment budget, (ii) established indicative ceilings for both the recurrent and
investment budgets for ministries and line agencies based on an indexation formula applied to
the actual budget allocations that each ministry and line agency received in 2001, and (iii) called
for a rationalization of the PIP in the 2002 budget with the objective of reducing expected
average time to completion of the overall PIP by 20 percent in 2002 along with limits on the
introduction of new multi-year investment projects except for emergency projects. While the
2002 budget preparation process remained far from perfect, the broad framework provided by the
HPC did serve to guide decision making particularly at the center. The full cooperation of the
20 Originally, this authority was planned to be established through an amendment to the public accounting law (No.
1050). However, the Govermnent now intends to replace the public accounting law in its entirety with a new Law
on Public Financial Management and Internal Control.

line agencies will take more time to materialize the 2003 budget preparation process will build
on this year's experience. For the 2003 budget preparation process, the Government intends to
set individual indicative ceilings for each ministry and line agency based on the experience with
the 2002 preparation process.
88.    In January 2002, the SPO     published the PIP for 2002 which is in line with the
rationalization criteria set by the High Planning Council (Table 10). As part of the PIP
rationalization, a Public Investment Review was carried out on an urgent basis by SPO in
October 2001 with support from the Bank. The PIR confirmed that the average completion time
is excessively long, reflecting a lack of prioritization among projects. In 2001, the average
completion time was 12.5 years21 (more than 30 years in the agriculture sector), a sharp increase
from 9.2 years in 2000 given the impact of the Lira devaluation and higher than expected
inflation. Scarce funds are distributed among an excessive number of projects which leads to
inefficiencies in project implementation. The PIP has traditionally included projects that will not
be implemented immediately (the so called "trace allocations"), which hampers the credibility of
the program. In response to the HPC's decision to rationalize the investment program, the 2002
PIP cuts the projected average completion time to 8.5 years, a 32 percent reduction which
significantly exceeds the 20 percent benchmark set by the HPC. The 2002 PIP: (i) phases large
projects with the view to focusing on priority subprojects; (ii) excludes from the investment
program numerous projects with "trace allocation"; (iii) terminates a large number of
uneconomic projects; and (iv) reduces by more than half the number of new multi-year projects
21 The 12.5 years average completion time is calculated by SPO based on updated average exchange rate and
inflation estimates for 2001 (TL 1.23 mnillion per US Dollar and a deflator of 60 percent). The average completion
time for 2001 was originally projected to be 9.4 years on the basis of the TL 0.714 mnillion per US Dollar average
exchange rate and 18 percent deflator in the May program.

included in the 2002 investment program. Most of the new multi-year projects are emergency
projects (e.g. flood prevention) or projects of a social nature.22 Overall, 353 individual projects
and 649 subprojects have been dropped from the PIP and the rationalization has reduced the total
cost of the PIP by TL 36.9 quadrillion. Publication of the rationalized 2002 PIP meets the
relevant condition for Board presentation of PFPSAL II. The Government intends to adopt by
March an action plan, as a condition for release of the second tranche of the loan, which will lead
to further improvements in the public investment program over the 2003-04 budget cycles. The
Bank has recommended that the action plan include a target for further reduction in the average
project completion time over the next two years and continued limits on the introduction of new
multi-year projects, as well as steps to strengthen the role of formal cost/benefit analysis in the
project approval process and establish a framework for project monitoring and evaluation.
Implementation of this action plan in the 2003-04 budget cycles would be supported by the
PPSAL and possible follow-up PPSAL II.
89.   Budget reforms are also underway to build capacity for policy formulation and improve
the performance of public agencies. The SPO has prepared draft guidelines for strategic
planning by key line ministries and departments including guidelines for costing policies. The
guidelines for strategic planning are under review and will be finalized prior to release of the
second tranche of PFPSAL II. The Government will also initiate policy reviews by selected line
ministries and agencies to derive clear statement of objectives and expenditure priorities in
preparation of 2003 budget. This will be complemented by action to revive the role of
ministerial departments responsible for policy reviews with support from SPO. These additional
actions are expected to be carried out prior to release of the third tranche of PFPSAL II.
90.   The Government is carrying out a pilot program in 2002 for a group of line ministries and
agencies willing to volunteer for reforms that will provide them with greater discretionary
control over inputs linked to adoption of effective intemal controls and commitment to improved
performance. Six agencies for the pilot programn in 2002 have been identified (Table 11). The
pilot program will start with a limited set of programs within these agencies and is expected to be
gradually expanded over time. The legal basis for providing block appropriations to these
agencies has been included in the 2002 budget law. Inplementation of the pilot program will be
monitored during supervision of PFPSAL II and the Bank will provide close support to the
Government to carry out the program effectively.
91.   The Government intends to undertake further budget reforms during the 2002-04 period.
Completion of the GFS pilot program and rollout of the GFS budget classification to all of the
consolidated budget agencies in the 2003 budget cycle would be supported by the PPSAL. The
PPSAL would support additional enhancements to the preparation process for the 2003 budget-
including introduction of a rolling two-year expenditure framework, along with further efforts to
build the capacity for policy formulation and implementation of the pilot program to improve
operational performance and its expansion beyond the initial set of agencies and programns. The
22 There are however two new large transport projects (airport safety and railway electrification) which account for
about half of the TL 2.25 quadrillion total cost of new multi-year projects. The railway project will be implemented
only if adequate external financing can be found.

core priorities of the budget reform-particularly the level 1 refornis in support of greater
transparency--would then be well established by late 2003, i.e., in time for Board presentation of
a possible PPSAL II. The PPSAL II which would shift the focus to level 2 and level 3 issues in
support of improved public service delivery. Together with the projected decline in inflation
under the program, the stage would be set for a progressive shift to a full medium-term
expenditure framework.

92.   Financial Accountability.  Modernization of Turkey's system of public financial
accountability in line with international standards is an urgent PEM priority. As detailed in the
August 2001 CFAA, some of the basic building blocks appear to be in place: an established legal
framework; reliable, albeit fragmented, accounting processes; regular reporting of financial
results; an apparently independent Supreme Audit Institution, the Turkish Court of Accounts
(TCA), which reports to Parliament; a relatively open system of accountability and plenty of
skilled personnel. However, deeper analysis reveals significant problems and lack of systemic
coherence. Complex institutional relationships, multiple sources of public funds, heavy emphasis
on ex ante controls and inadequate reporting to the legislature reduce transparency and weaken
financial management. The accounting law which governs public sector accounting dates from
1927, and procurement legislation has not kept up with evolving international standards. Similar
to the budget, the audit system is fragmented with many bodies besides the TCA carrying out
activities analogous to external inspection and audit.
93.   Accounting. Efforts to upgrade the public accounting system are gaining momentum
under the PFPSAL program after many years of limited progress. The MOF has essentially
completed the installation and commissioning of the say2000i automated accounting system in
the approximately 1,500 sites of the General Directorate of Public Accounting across Turkey.
Under this internet based system, the MOF's accounting data base will be held centrally and will
contain data on all individual transactions wherever they occur in the system. The say2000i
system went live on January 1, 2002 for the consolidated budget agencies thereby meeting a key
benchmark for PFPSAL II. By June 2002, the Goverunent intends to complete three key
interfaces for the say2000i system: (i) to the budget system of the General Directorate of Budget
and Financial Control of the MOF, (ii) to the VEDOP revenue system of the General Directorate
of Revenues, and (iii) to the accountancies of the Treasury. This will provide a fully integrated,



-46 -
automated system for tracking central government revenue and expenditure in Turkey. By the
end of 2002, all accountancies will have abandoned the old system and moved exclusively to
say2000i. However, it is too early to assess the extent of potential problems that may occur
during the implementation phase, and sometime after mid-2002 a full-scale assessment of
say2000i will be needed. The extent to which say2000i is providing accurate and timely
information to managers will be monitored during PFPSAL II supervision.
94.   The authority of the MOF to set government accounting standards for all general
government agencies in line with GFS has been provided by the same article in the 2002 budget
law as for the budget classification. Accounting standards on the modified accrual basis,
manual, and chart of accounts consistent with GFS have been drafted and were issued to the
three agencies participating in the joint pilot program on January 23, 2002.23 These actions
satisfy the conditions for Board presentation of PFPSAL II. By end-March 2002, MOF will
issue the new draft national public accounting standards on the modified accruals basis to all
general government agencies in line with GFS. By June 2002. the new accounting standards and
statutory chart of accounts for the general govermment will be published in the official gazette as
24
a condition for release of the third tranche of the loan.  In parallel, a new Law on Public
Financial Management and Financial Control (PFMFC) is being prepared to replace the existing
public accounting law (No. 1050). This legislation will make permanent the MOF's authority to
set budget coding and accounting standards for the general government. More broadly, it will
modernize the legal framework for public accounting and financial control in line with
international standards, and clear the way for the phased introduction of full accrual accounting
over the longer term. In this regard, the new law will go beyond the public accounting
benchmarks set for PFPSAL II. The Government intends to submit the PFMFC legislation to
Parliament by end-June 2002 as a condition for release of the third tranche of PFPSAL II.
95.   Deepening of the public accounting reform will be supported by the PPSAL and possible
PPSAL II in 2003-04. Enactment of the PFMFC Law, expected by late 2002, will be a trigger
for the PPSAL. In the 2003 budget cycle, the GFS framework will be rolled out to all
consolidated budget agencies and the pilot will shift to the remaining agencies of the general
government. This timetable will provide adequate time for the extensive training required,
particularly for local administrations. The new GFS framework for modified accrual accounting
is scheduled to be fully in place to support the rollout of the new budget classification to all of
general government in the 2004 budget cycle. The Ministry of Finance is also developing a
strategy for phased introduction of full accrual accounting across general govermment agencies.
However, the Bank and the Government have agreed that adoption of this strategy, originally a
benchmark for PFPSAL II, should be shifted to the 2004 budget cycle (i.e., to the possible
PPSAL II operation) given other pressing priority actions under the accounting reform.
23 The new chart of accounts is based on an economic classification. The coding for the functional, institutional and
financial classifications are being built into the accounting software running under say2000i.
24 This will be a framework chart of accounts which will be adapted by MOF to meet the specific requirements of
individual agencies while maintaining overall consistency with GFS standards.

96.   Procurement. Turkey has moved decisively over the past six months to upgrade its
public procurement legislation and practices in line with international standards. The new public
procurement law was enacted on January 22, 2002 thereby meeting a key condition for Board
presentation of PFPSAL II. The new law is based on the UNICTRAL model and moves Turkey
towards compliance with EU requirements. It was prepared in close collaboration with World
Bank and EU experts, and incorporates the key recommendations of the CPAR. The law covers
all goods, works, and services-with the exception of military contracts-and encompasses both
budgetary and non-budgetary procurement. It is applicable to central and local government
agencies, as well as SEEs. The new law stipulates the qualification requirements (including
technical and financial criteria) for contractors which will supercede the existing contractor
certificate system. The law establishes thresholds (in TL) above which foreign bidders cannot be
restricted and a domestic preference of 15 percent can be applied. However, the thresholds have
been set at high levels which could reduce competition and subject an excessive amount of
public procurement to shortened minimum time periods for bids.25 The Government intends to
enact amendments to the law by end-May 2002 to postpone indexation of the thresholds until
2004, which will have the effect of lowering their real value, and to increase the amount of
procurement subject to the full minimum bidding periods stipulated in the law. Consistent with
international best practice, the law creates an independent agency to oversee public procurement
in Turkey and ensure enforcement of the new procurement standards. The new public
procurement agency is expected to be established and its Board of Directors appointed by end-
March 2002. Enactment of the agreed amendments to the law and establishment of the public
procurement agency will be conditions for release of the third tranche of the loan. The agency
will be responsible for preparing the required regulations and model contracts by the end of
2002. The new procurement standards will come into force in January 2003. The EU may
provide the new agency with technical assistance to draft the required secondary legislation.
Technical assistance may also be forthcoming from the Bank. Implementation of the new
legislation and related efforts to strengthen institutional capacity would be supported by the
PPSAL operation, together with steps to prepare for the introduction of periodic procurement
audits by TCA and publication of the results.
97.   Auditing.  Effective financial accountability requires extensive modernization of
Turkey's public audit system.  The objectives are two fold: (i) clarify institutional
responsibilities, promote improvements in audit quality in line with international standards and
support the shift from ex ante controls to ex post monitoring in harmony with the efforts to
improve operational performance, and (ii) expand the scope of TCA audits to cover the entire
general government including local administrations, autonomous agencies, social security
institutions, remaining EBFs and revolving funds, with the overall objective of transforming
TCA into an effective supreme audit institution. The first objective will be achieved through
enactment of the new law on Public Financial Management and Financial Control. This law will
be the cornerstone for modernization of both public accounting and public audit functions in line
with international best practice and EU directives. On the audit side, the law will clarify the
25 At the current exchange rate, the thresholds are approximately equivalent to: US$535,000 for procurement of
goods and services by central government agencies, US$715,000 for procurement of goods and services by sub-
national entities, and US$12.5 million for procurement of works.



-48 -
roles and responsibilities of the line agencies, the MOF and the TCA. In tandem with parallel
changes in the TCA law, it will allow TCA to discontinue involvement in budget execution and
focus on ex-post audits, including performance audits. As was the case with the public
procurement law, the Bank is closely coordinating with the EU its advice on the draft PFMFC
legislation. In February, a discussion draft of the new PFMFC law was submitted by MOF to the
audit task force established in June 2001 under the PEM Steering Committee to coordinate the
work on audit reform. The draft is being reviewed by the task force, and then it will be
circulated to all line ministries and TCA. As mentioned above (para. 93), the PFMFC law will
be submitted to Parliament by end-June 2002 prior to release of the third tranche of PFPSAL II.
98.   The agenda for expanding the scope of TCA audits centers on the following three actions:
* Include all consolidated budget agencies under TCA's annual audit as required by the
Constitution, including the Presidency and Parliament.
* Subject TCA's own accounts to external audit with reports submitted to the Parliament.
* Adopt a plan of action to expand scope of TCA audits to cover the entire general government
in line with the objective of establishing an effective supreme audit institution.
99.   Action on this agenda has been delayed by the need for Parliament to appoint a new TCA
president, now expected by end-March 2002. As a condition of Board presentation for PFPSAL
II. draft legislation to include the Presidency and Parliament under TCA's annual audit and to
subject TCA's own accounts to external audit will be submitted to Parliament by end-March
2002. Enactment of this legislation and implementation of the proposal for external audit of
TCA are expected by April 2002 prior to release of the second tranche of the loan. Adoption of
the action plan to expand TCA audits to all of general government is expected prior to release of
the third tranche of the loan. Building consensus on the action plan among the institutions
concerned, particularly those whose own audit mandates will be affected, will be critical to its
success. The plan will be complemented by capacity building measures designed to transform
TCA in line with the requirements for a modern, systems based audit institution. Ensuring
uniform and transparent accountability of Turkey's independent regulatory boards is an
important priority for both the audit reform and the credibility of the overall reform program. In
this context, the Government intends that: (i) by June 2002, the current legislation will be
amended to include TCA in the audit committee for each regulatory board in Turkey, and (ii) the
action plan for expanding the scope of TCA audits to all of general govermnent will include
measures to establish a new medium-term audit structure for the regulatory boards in line with
international best practice and the overall objective of establishing TCA as the supreme audit
institution in Turkey. Implementation of the PFMFC law and the action plan to expand the
scope of TCA audits, as well as the shift to ex-post financial and performance audits, would be
supported by the PPSAL and possible follow up PPSAL II in 2003-04.
100. Public Liability Management. Efforts to improve public liability management under
the PEM reform strategy focus on strengthening debt management and containing the spread of
contingent liabilities. These actions complement the energy reforms supported by the ERL that
are tackling a key source of contingent liabilities in the form of government guaranteed BOT
contracts, as well as the banking reforms supported by the PFPSAL that address the buildup of
quasi-fiscal and contingent liabilities in the banking system which triggered the February crisis.
Measures to strengthen public liability management will address other important sources of



-49 -
contingent liabilities and quasi-fiscal losses, including those arising from take-or-pay contracts
for natural gas imports, non-energy BOT projects, and guarantees to municipal and local
governments. Table 12 presents information on the guarantee portfolio of the Treasury.

§nunrce: Treasury.
101. The new law on Public Finance and Debt Management, expected to be adopted by
Parliament by end-March, will create the foundation for a comprehensive risk management
framework in Turkey. The new law will confirm the Treasury as the single borrowing authority
for the central govemment.    It will create a more transparent framework for public debt
management and the issuance of government guarantees. The new law will also establish a risk
account in the budget, starting with the 2003 budget, to cover the expected fiscal cost of called
guarantees. Adoption of the public debt law is a condition for Board presentation of PFPSAL II.



- 50 -
In accordance with the new law, the Government intends to adopt new regulations for the
issuance of government guarantees and for borrowing by SEEs by end-March 2002 as a
condition for release of the second tranche of the loan. As part of its program to improve public
liability management, the Treasury intends to strengthen further its risk management capacity by
establishing a strong middle office for risk management by June 2002 prior to release of the third
tranche of the loan. A review of the government guarantee portfolio and preparation of a debt
sustainability analysis, originally expected to be completed by end-2001, will now be completed
by December 2002. This work was delayed in part by the need to establish clearer lines of
responsibility for debt management within the Government and to agree with the Bank on terms
of reference for technical assistance.
102. As elements of the risk management framework, the Government plans over the course of
2002 to: (i) implement mechanisms for monitoring government project guarantees and on-
lending operations, (ii) develop a centralized fiscal risk analysis capability in the new middle
office, and (iii) prepare and disclose a Government Fiscal Risk Statement. These actions would
be supported by the PPSAL. The full institutional structure for the new public liability
management system, including all necessary legal changes, should be in place by the end of
2003. The Government will then be in a position to issue its public liability management strategy
as an annex to the planned medium-term expenditure framework.
E.    Public Sector Governance
103.  Actions to improve public sector governance aim to reduce political influence over
economic management and upgrade the quality and effectiveness of Turkey's public sector.
This agenda includes the preparation and implementation of a national anti-corruption strategy as
well as the launch of a comprehensive civil service reform. These actions complement and are
integrated with the programn of structural fiscal reform and PEM reform discussed earlier. A
national strategy to enhance transparency and good governance in the public sector was adopted
by the Govermment in January. The strategy was prepared by a steering committee under the
leadership of the Prime Minister's Inspection Board and including representatives from the
Treasury, the Ministry of Finance's Financial Crimes Investigation Board (MASAK), the
Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Interior. The Government Decree adopting the strategy
and the Steering Committee's report under the slogan "A Transparent and Clean Turkey:
Together Hand in Hand" will be published by end-March. The objective of the strategy is to
provide a comprehensive framework for improving governance and reducing political influence
over the economy which establishes clear priorities and benchmarks, and empowers and
energizes public opinion to fight corruption.
104.  The strategy covers five core areas: public administration, the judicial system, the
political system, civil society and the competitive private sector. It complements on-going
regulatory reforms in the energy, telecommunications and financial sectors, as well as the
reforms to the public procurement system and the broader financial accountability agenda
discussed above. Priorities under the national anti-corruption strategy are summarized in Box 6
and the matrix of short to medium-term actions covering 2002-04 is presented in Annex VIII.
The Government is counting on the active involvement of national NGOs. One of the major
national NGOs, TESEV, has completed two diagnostic surveys on corruption covering



- 51 -
Box 6: Priorities under the National Strategy
to Enhance Transparency and Good Governance in Turkey's Public Sector
*   Accelerating the completion of ongoing work, within the framework of public administration reform, for
institutional improvement and financial management.
*   Implementing amendments to the Law on the Contents of a Declaration of Wealth, Bribery and Anti-
Corruption (No. 3628) in order to make these declarations public and to require mandatory audits and public
access to the declarations for all elected officials.
*   Enacting regulations to ensure that inspections of campaign financing, income and the expenses of political
parties and election candidates are made available to the public. Amending the existing Law on Political
Parties to require that political parties and candidates make a public declaration of contributions from
individuals and legal persons above a fixed amount. The High Elections Board will be responsible for
publishing and auditing this information.
*   Implementing amendments to the Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering Law (No. 4208) to expand the
list of criminal activities giving rise to illegitimate profits and to restructure MASAK in order to provide
investigative powers to MASAK experts in specific areas.
   Creation of an Inspection and Audit Services Class and passage of an Inspeetion Law-to put- into--effect
inspection standards, to allow for a complete restructuring of all inspection and auditing units, and to
implement changes to appointment procedures to allow for fixed-term appointment of presidents. Amending
the Civil Service Law (No. 657) to include a specific employment category for inspection and auditing
services.
*   Establishing specialised courts to facilitate quick resolution of corruption cases.
*   Founding specialised units within the security forces and under the supervision and inspection of the Chief
State Prosecutor to investigate corruption cases.
*   Implementing ethic agreements in Turkey.
households and the business community respectively, and is now initiating work on a third
survey covering civil servants. These surveys have been co-sponsored by the World Bank. The
International Conference on Good Governance and Combating Corruption co-sponsored by the
Government and the Bank in September 2001 provided input on international experience and
best practice to help shape the strategy. Adoption and subsequent publication of the national
strategv to enhance transparency and good governance will fulfill a Board condition for PFPSAL
II. Effective launch of implementation of the strategy will be a condition for release of the
second tranche of the loan. The Government intends to put in place by April appropriate
arrangements to coordinate implementation of the anti-corruption strategy. The medium-term
elements of the anti-corruption strategy would be supported by the envisaged PPSAL operations.
105.   The Government realizes that sustained improvements in public govemance will hinge in
large part on effective reform   of the civil service.   Indeed, civil service reform   features
prominently in the national anti-corruption strategy. Civil service reform is vital to raising the
quality of public services and ensuring the quality of the fiscal adjustment. The Government has
already initiated work on a norm cadre system to establish benchmarks for staffing in public
agencies which is now operational within the Ministry of Education. However, there is
widespread acknowledgement that a more complete, medium-term approach is needed in order
to adapt the structure and function of the civil service to the changing role of government in
Turkey and to internalize the on-going reforms to public expenditure management. In addition
to questions about the size and composition of the civil service in a changing Turkey, the reform
will need to address issues such as distorted salary incentives, career development requirements



- 52 -
and inadequate operational budgets in most agencies. In February, as a condition of Board
presentation, the Government established a ministerial committee to oversee the preparation of a
civil service reform strategy and carry out a full functional review of government in preparation
for further decisions about what functions to retain within government and what to devolve to the
private sector. Recognizing the linkages between civil service reform and more immediate
actions to adjust public sector staffing levels, the Government has also confided oversight for the
public employment program to the same ministerial committee. Under the committee's
leadership, preparations for a functional review of government are expected to be launched by
March. Preparation of the civil service reform strategv will be fully underway as a condition for
release of the third tranche of the loan. The Government expects to adopt its strategy for civil
service reform in late 2002 as part of the program for PPSAL. Continued implementation of the
civil service reform program would be supported by the potential PPSAL II in the next CAS
period.

IV. THE PROPOSED LOAN
A.    The Bank's Financial Sector Assistance Strategy
106.  Background. Turkey and the Bank have had a long relationship in the financial sector
since the early 1980s through a series of SALs (I-V) during the 1980-85 period and two FSALs
during the late 1980s. A number of policy and institutional reforms were undertaken during this
period. The focus of both the FSALs was on financial policies, financial institutions and
regulations, and money and capital markets. The FSAL programs were, however, only partially
completed, as Turkey's political and economic arena remained caught up in ad hoc short term
choices during most of the 1990s, making i1 difficult to engage in long term policy and
institutional development decisions. Thus, actions on better banking regulations and supervision
and on bank privatization still remained on the agenda in the late 1990s.
107.  Assistance strategy. After some years of lower intensity interaction during the early and
mid 1990s, the level, nature and quality of the dialogue on the financial sector policy and
institutional issues between the Bank and the Government has recently substantially increased,
and has been quite high during the past three years. Elements of the Bank's strategy of lending
and non-lending assistance in the financial sector as the context for the proposed PFPSAL II are
as follows (see Figure 1 below).
108. Banking Reviews I and II. and FSAL - 1998-2000. Since early 1998 the Bank has been in
a substantive dialogue with the Government of Turkey regarding the health of its banking sector.
Right after the Russia crisis in August 1998, the Bank undertook a first Banking Review in
Turkey in November 1998, assessing the overall risks and vulnerabilities in the Turkish banking
system, and offering a set of recommendations for strengthening the legal and regulatory regime
and in carrying out structural reform in the banking sector. The newly elected Government of
Turkey during 1999 followed up on these recommendations through passage of a new Banking
Law, and specifically requested Bank support and advice for developing a full scale reform
program in the banking sector. In response, the Bank carried out a second Banking Review in
November 1999 outlining a reform program with specific recommendations and technical
advice. The finding of this review formed the basis for the design of the first Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan (FSAL) for US$778 million approved by the Board in December 2000. The
FSAL focused on (i) overhaul of the banking sector legal and regulatory regime to bring it more
in line with international standards, (ii) creation and operationalization of a new and more
independent Bank Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) to take over bank regulation and
supervision responsibility from the Treasury and the Central Bank, (iii) strengthening the
Savings Deposit and Insurance Fund's (SDIF's) bank intervention and failure resolution
practices; and (iv) initiation of state bank restructuring and privatization. Both the banking
reviews, and the FSAL Board document clearly stated that there were serious vulnerabilities in
the banking system, and fairly high risks of a banking crisis. However, the FSAL got delayed
because the Government was unable to carry out the reforms agreed for nearly a year, and just
prior to the FSAL presentation to the Board, Turkey experienced its first banking crisis in
November/December 2000. This crisis confirmed the presence of the risks and vulnerabilities in
the banking system already pointed out earlier.

109.  Banking Review III, and PFPSAL I - 2001. Soon after this first crisis, and in the context
of rapidly deteriorating macro-economic conditions, when the second much more severe crisis
occurred in February 2001, the Bank undertook another Banking Review in early March 2001,
including comprehensive stress testing, to (i) identify the magnitude of already apparent and
possible future severe depletion of capital among Turkey's private banks; and (ii) outline the
urgent banking sector reform steps needed especially in the state banks and resolution of private
insolvent banks. To address the post crisis banking reform agenda highlighted in this review, and
the increasingly important macro-economic/public sector structural reform agenda, the Bank
prepared a single tranche Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan
(PFPSAL-US$1.1 billion during the May-July 2001 period that was approved by the Board in
July 2001). The PFPSAL was planned as the first in a series of four programmatic financial
sector adjustment loans over a three year period, to address both the most urgent reform actions
and to deepen and sustain the necessary restructuring of the banking sector (the first two
programmatic adjustment loans have been planned as joint financial and public sector reform
loans). Specifically, the PFPSAL's conditionality in the banking area focused on accelerating
banking sector prudential regulation refonn-especially concerning loan loss provisioning and
connected lending, strengthening of the newly created BRSA through a targeted institutional
development effort, stepping up SDIF interventions in additional insolvent private banks and
actions to rapidly resolve these banks, and accelerating the financial and operational
restructuring of the state banks, including resolution of the duty loss issue (large paper claims on
the Government held by Ziraat and Halk, see para. 61), and closure of the insolvent Emlak Bank.
110. Critical PFPSAL Reform Actions Taken by the Government Since the February 2001
crisis. As part of the overall set of reform actions under the PFPSAL I, during April-November
2001, the Government in coordination with the CBT, the BRSA and the SDIF: (i) eliminated the
overnight short term repo liabilities in the SDIF banks and sharply reduced the overnight short
term repo liabilities in the state-owned banks Ziraat and Halk; (ii) satisfactorily capitalized the
SDIF banks and the state-owned banks with a view to reduce and eventually reverse their
continuing accumulation of losses; (iii) put in place a professional governance structure for the
state-owned banks Ziraat and Halk; (iv) revoked the banking license of Emlak, merged its
banking assets and liabilities with Ziraat and put the remaining shell into liquidation; (v)
aggressively pursued the closure/merger/sale of SDIF banks to complete their resolution as soon
as possible; (vi) intervened in another five insolvent private banks; and (vii) entered into capital
restoration plans with an additional 17 private banks with the objective to restore their capital
adequacy before the end of December 2001.
111.  PFPSAL II - 2002. The proposed PFPSAL II will further deepen the above reform
measures to restore the health of the banking sector through: (i) finalizing the overhaul of the
banking system prudential regime, while introducing targeted enforcement goals; (ii) completing
the implementation of the institutional development plan for the BRSA, and initiating a
comprehensive institutional development effort at the SDIF; (iii) completing the resolution of
banks intervened by the SDEF, and continuing the restructuring of undercapitalized and
otherwise non-compliant private sector banks; and (iv) completing the operational restructuring
of Ziraat and Halk; and the full privatization of Vakif, the remaining third state-owned bank.
Details are presented in section II above.

112.  NBFI Study, and PFSALs I and II - 2002-2003. The follow-up reform efforts in the
banking area (especially the completion of the state bank privatization effort) as well as the
reform efforts in the NBFI segment of the financial sector will be supported by two additional
programmatic financial sector adjustment loans during 2002 and 2003.
B.    The Bank's Public Sector Assistance Strategy
113.  The Bank's public sector assistance strategy is based on a carefully sequenced series of
lending operations backed by extensive economic and sector work and other non-lending
services. The first phase of the reform was supported by the Economic Reform Loan. It
involved fiscal measures to underpin the initial fiscal adjustment in 1999 and early 2000, and a
first round of budget reform measures including closure of two groups of budgetary and extra-
budgetary funds in December 1999 and March 2001. The ERL program also encompassed
implementation of the structural reform agenda for social security, energy, agriculture and
telecommunications which helps underpin the fiscal adjustment and contain the growth of quasi-
fiscal and contingent liabilities. The analytical basis for the ERL program was provided in large
part by the CEM on Structural Reforms for Sustainable Growth (September 2000) which
confirmed the public sector deficit as the core source of macroeconomic instability in Turkey and
detailed reforms in support of fiscal adjustment and growth.
114.  The second phase of the public sector reform was initiated by work on the PEIR which
presents an in-depth diagnosis of the operational and institutional problems confronting public
sector management and outlines a strategic framework for reform. The PEIR was complemented
by due diligence economic sector work in the form of the CPAR and CFAA which reviewed the
current legal framework and procedures for financial accountability in Turkey and developed
recommendations for refonn. This work provided much of the analytical framework for the first
PFPSAL approved in July. The first PFPSAL focused on launching a broader program of public
sector reforms, including a comprehensive public expenditure management reform, more
extensive structural fiscal reforms on both the revenue and expenditure sides, and the preparation
of a national anti-corruption strategy. The proposed PFPSAL II aims to deepen this agenda and
shift from strategy design to active implementation of reforms ranging from tax strategy and
public employment retrenchment to overhaul of the public procurement system and a national
program for fighting corruption. In addition to economic sector work, the Bank has supported
this effort through a series of international conferences designed to increase public awareness
and expose Turkey to international experience and best practice. The assistance strategy going
forward comprises a Programmable Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PPSAL) in 2003 to support
continued implementation of the reform agenda. A second PPSAL is tentatively envisaged
beyond the current CAS period. Elements of the Bank's strategy of lending and non-lending
assistance in the public sector as context for the proposed PFPSAL II are presented in Figure 2.

115.  Drawing a lesson from past experience, the current assistance strategy exploits the
advantages of the programmatic approach to support a comprehensive medium-term program to
modernize the public sector for which political support has been obtained in advance from the
highest levels of government. The current assistance program for public sector reform draws on
earlier efforts. In particular, the PFMP project approved in 1995 has achieved considerable
results in modernizing Turkey's customs service and improving the debt and cash management
functions in the Treasury, as well as design and development of the say2000i automated
accounting system. However, the PFMP was less successful in catalyzing improvements in tax
administration and public expenditure management. Political support for these objectives was
not adequately secured and bureaucratic inertia eventually set in. The tax and PEM measures
supported by the project were seen by many in the government as technical fixes of limited
significance in the absence of a broader reform vision for the public sector. The current
assistance strategy has learned from this experience. The emphasis in the early stages of the
program has been on the preparation of medium-term strategies underpinned by economic sector
work in the critical reform areas (including PEM, taxation, public employment, and anti-
corruption). The articulation of these strategies and the involvement of high-level steering
committees in their formulation and implementation has helped build both internal consensus as
well as the political and bureaucratic muscle needed to ensure effective implementation.
C.    PFPSAL II Objectives and Description
116.  The main objective of the proposed PFPSAL II is to support the next phase of the
Government's financial and public sector reform priorities in response to the February 2001
financial crisis, while continuing to ensure that social programs are adequately funded. Key
priorities include, in the financial sector: (i) overhaul of the regulatory framework for banking
activity, (ii) institutional development of the new Bank Regulation and Supervision Agency
(BRSA), (iii) problem bank/bank failure resolution, and (iv) state bank restructuring and
privatization; and in the public sector: (a) a further deepening of structural fiscal policies in
support of sustainable fiscal adjustment, (b) a broadening of the Government's public
expenditure management reform program including the implementation of concrete
improvements to the framework for budget planning and execution, financial accountability, and
public liability management, and (c) implementation of the Government's strategy to strengthen
public sector governance including adoption and implementation of a national anti-corruption
strategy and initial steps towards civil service reform. The proposed Second Programmatic
Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL II) is the second Loan in support of the
Government's multi-year financial and public sector reform program. It follows on the first
Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan of US$1.1 billion approved in July
2001 (US$700 million on standard IBRD terms and US$400 million on SSAL terms). As with
the first PFPSAL, the proposed PFPSAL II will provide budgetary support to help the
Government finance the costs arising from the crisis while continuing to fund its critical social
programs. The subsequent programmatic operations in the financial and public sectors planned
under the CAS will support a sustained effort by the Government to carry out this complex
reform agenda.

D.    Lessons Learned from PFPSAL I
117. The PFPSAL II operation has benefited from important lessons learned in the
implementation of PFPSAL I approved by the Board in July 2001. The first lesson is that the
approach of combining financial and public reforms into a single operation is well suited to the
Turkish context at this stage in time. The combination provides important synergies, including
in terms of ensuring consistency between fiscal adjustment and the financing requirements of the
bank restructuring program. The second lesson is that the urgency and complexity of the
financial and public sector reforms-juxtaposed with real world constraints on the institutional
capacity of the Turkish administration-argues for selectivity in determining core conditions and
flexibility with regards to the timetable for the implementation of specific reform measures. The
number of core conditions for the second and third tranches of PFPSAL II has been streamlined
in order to focus on the most important priorities while maintaining overall program coherence
as represented by the Letter of Development Policy and policy matrix. The multiple tranche
structure of the operation allows the Bank to stay closely engaged at this crucial point in the
reform program and provides additional flexibility to link the Bank's financial support more
effectively to the actual implementation of specific reform measures.
E.    Benefits and Risks
118.  Benefits. The principal benefits of the Loan will be to: (i) support the Government's
macroeconomic policy framework which aims to overcome the affects of the February crisis and
create the conditions for renewed growth and disinflation, (ii) restore confidence in the banking
system; (iii) strengthen the foundation for an efficient and sound banking system which can be
competitive in quality and performance at the international level; (iv) reduce the vulnerability of
the banking system and enhance its capacity to withstand external shocks and thereby reduce
systemic failure risk; (v) position Turkey's banking sector for accession to the European Union
(EU) by starting the process of aligning the prudential regime for the banking system with
applicable EU banking sector directives; (vi) support structural fiscal measures to underpin the
sustainability and quality of the fiscal adjustment needed to achieve macroeconomic stability
while ensuring that social spending is protected; (vii) lay the foundation for durable
improvements to public expenditure management and fiscal transparency in line with
international standards; and (viii) raise the quality of public sector governance. The PFPSAL II
will provide essential budgetary support to help the Government finance the costs of recovering
from the crisis while continuing to fund its critical social programs.
119.  Risks and Mitigating Measures. Turkey's financial and public sector reform program
entails significant risks, but these continue to be outweighed by the benefits of the reforms and
the risks of not proceeding. The situation in Turkey will be subject to continued uncertainty as
events unfold on the ground. The three main risk factors are:
* the difficult macroeconomic conditions arising from the crisis,
* a potential loss of consensus for political or social reasons, and
* institutional challenges in implementing the program.



- 60 -
120.  The active support of the Bank is instrumental in helping the Government overcome
these risks and sustain implementation of its reform program. The Bank's assistance strategy for
financial and public sector reform incorporates significant mitigation measures. However, the
risks cannot be fully offset given the severity of the crisis and extent of the structural and
institutional reforms required. In response to the situation, the PFPSAL, originally envisaged as
a single tranche operation, has been restructured into three tranches which will disburse in
sequence with the concrete implementation of key measures under the program and the
progressive establishment of a track record of satisfactory macroeconomic outcomes over the
first half of 2002
121.  Macroeconomic risks.   The shocks generated by the February crisis continue to
reverberate in the Turkish economy and it has taken longer than initially expected to restore
stability to the financial markets. As mentioned earlier, the economy was hit by a new external
shock following the September 11 terrorist attack in the United States. With the recent
improvement in financial indicators, the balance of macroeconomic risk is shifting to possible
delays in economic recovery. Resumption of growth is critical to ensuring both technical
requirements such as debt sustainability as well as broader social support for the reform program.
Economic activity has slowed sharply since the crisis and the recession in 2001 has been much
deeper and more prolonged than expected. The actual pace of recovery will depend heavily on
the Government's ability to sustain an aggressive pace of reform.
122.  A key concern for growth continues to be that actual ex post real interest rates will
exceed program levels which would slow the recovery, negatively affect public debt
sustainability and create the conditions for renewed instability. Real interest rates have declined
sharply from post-
crisis levels (Graph         Graph 1: Ex-ante Real Interest Rate using Weighted Average of

requires        a

credible macroeconomic and structural policies, together with adequate financing for the now
much larger public debt to avoid crowding out of credit to the private sector which is needed for
the economic recovery. Credibility depends first and foremost on strong political leadership and
sustained progress in tackling the core structural weaknesses in the banking and public sectors.



- 61 -
The Government's market friendly reform strategy and the exceptional external financing from
the IFIs are designed to bolster credibility and rebuild confidence. Confidence will also be
helped by the fact that the Government is now implementing a detailed medium-term program
for addressing structural weaknesses which have built up over many years. Nevertheless, the
fragility of Turkey's banking sector and public finances will take time to correct, and the country
will remain vulnerable to internal and external shocks over the medium term.

123.    Public debt sustainability.       Sustainability of the public debt-which         is critical to
macroeconomic stability-will hinge on strong macroeconomic policies and accelerated
structural reform to build confidence. Under the program, the public debt to GNP ratio (net of
CBT net assets) is projected to fall from 91 percent in 2001 to 81.3 percent in 2002, a drop of
some 10 percentage points (Table 13). The debt burden is projected to decline further in 2003-
04 on the assumption that interest rates will continue to fall and the recovery will be sustained.
Realizing this outcome will depend on rapid economic recovery and falling interest rates, but it
also depends on other crucial factors such as the maturity of new borrowing and developments in
the non-central government components of the public sector. The program scenario assumes that
the maturity in 2002 of new borrowing by the Treasury in TL in the domestic auction market
stays at just under six months while improving to around 7.5 months in 2003, and that Treasury
will undertake a significant amount of new         domestic borrowing (about 15 percent of total
domestic borrowing) in FX-denominated/FX-linked instruments at maturities of one year or
more.26 With regard to the non-central govermnent components of the public sector, projected
26 The program baseline also assumes that the state banks will receive TL 8.3 quadrillion in interest due on
recapitalization bonds in 2002 based on a restructuring of these securities carried out in December 2001 and January
2002.

improvements in the financial position of the rest of the public sector, outside of the central
government and CBT, account for about four percentage points (i.e., about one-third) of the
improvement in the public debt to GNP ratio in 2002 under the program. This adjustment will
require an acceleration and deepening of structural reform and retrenchment in the broader
public sector, particularly the SEEs, beyond what Turkey has been able to achieve so far.
124.  A sensitivity analysis of the public debt dynamics demonstrates the central role of
credible policies to build confidence and deepen the fiscal adjustment. A downside scenario has
been prepared in which: (i) the decline in interest rates lags the program path by one quarter, (ii)
there is no improvement in the average maturity of new domestic borrowing and no new FX-
linked borrowing, and (iii) the public sector outside of the central government and CBT is unable
to improve its financial position. Under these assumptions growth is projected to reach only one
percent in 2002 and three percent in 2003. All other basic macroeconomic parameters remain
unchanged from the program baseline. Under the downside scenario, the public debt to GNP
ratio declines over the medium term, but at a much slower pace than in the program baseline and
domestic debt amortization remains high as a share of GNP. This is a clear indication that
domestic financial market conditions must continue to improve substantially-in parallel with
permanent fiscal adjustment in the broader public sector--in order for debt sustainability to be
ensured. This requires further gains in investor confidence which in turn will depend on the
credibility of the Government's program and the degree of support for the program from the
international community.
125.  External vulnerability. Turkey's external vulnerability is exemplified by the September
11 shock and the large capital outflows registered in 2001. A further indicator are the gross
financing requirements of some US$20 billion per year projected over 2002-04 (Table 14) which
now represent a greater proportion of GNP after the devaluation. Given the capital outflows, the
stock of external debt is now projected to stabilize in 2001 at the level of US$117 billion (with
the short-term debt stock falling sharply to US$18 billion). However, as a result of the
devaluation, this will equal 78 percent of GNP, a sharp increase compared to 59 percent in 2000.
Strong export performance kept the debt service ratio to under 45 percent in 2001. While
expected to improve under the program, the debt service ratio is projected to remain above 40
percent through 2003. The high level of capital outflows estimated for 2001 indicates that efforts
to encourage private sector involvement (PSI), i.e., "bail in" by private creditors, had limited
impact in 2001. Looking ahead, the extent to which Turkish banks and enterprises will be able
to rollover their external obligations will remain an important determinant for the program.
Slowing the capital outflow in 2002, and then reversing this trend in 2003-04, will be
instrumental in relieving pressure on the exchange rate and creating the conditions for a
sustained decline in domestic interest rates.
126.  Exceptional financing from the IFIs is providing Turkey with needed support at this
critical juncture, but a return of investor confidence will be essential to ultimate success of the
program. At the same time, the country is faced with an important opportunity. Most of the
capital outflow witnessed in 2001 and projected for 2002 is in the form of short-term debt and
portfolio investment. As private capital returns to Turkey over the medium term, the extent to
which a significant share of the "hot money" outflow can be replaced with longer maturity
inflows-especially FDI, the country's external vulnerability will be permanently reduced. In



- 63 -
this regard, decisive implementation of the action plan to promote FDI recently announced by
the Government will be extremely important.

127.  Political and social risks. The financial and public sector reforms pose major political
challenges to the Government and there are certain social risks as well. The resilience of the
coalition has been tested since February 2001. Political debates on the program among the
coalition parties, which surfaced strongly during the Summer, have now become less intense and
less frequent. The ability of the coalition to survive depends upon continued timely delivery of
the reform program and awareness of this is keeping the Government focused on the task at
hand. At the same time, sustained implementation of the reforms will test the coalition further in
2002. The commercialization and privatization of the state-owned banks is a major political
hurdle for the Government. The restructuring and privatization of Halk and Ziraat will have
social implications as their workforces are downsized, although this is mitigated to a significant
extent by the relatively extensive social protection programs for civil servants and public sector
workers. The reform agenda for the public sector is also politically sensitive. Institutional
change can face resistance from vested interest groups that would prefer to maintain the status
quo. To mitigate this risk, the program relies on strong consensus and up-front ownership of the
strategy by the Government and in particular key ministries. Sustained fiscal adjustment is
generating social costs and incomes policy and action to retrench staffing levels in the public
sector is particularly sensitive. The Government is trying to mitigate these risks by strengthening
its social protection programs and through dialogue with key social partners. The social risks of
the broader economic reform program are substantial and cannot be fully mitigated despite
efforts to protect social spending and improve targeted social assistance. The Government has
taken steps to strengthen its social protection programs under the SRMP project with the Bank,
including the introduction of conditional cash transfers targeted to families with many children.
The introduction of direct income support starting in late 2001 will ease the burden of the crisis
on farmers. To help build and sustain social consensus for the program during the tough
austerity phase, the Government has moved to strengthen its public information and outreach
efforts.
128. Implementation risks. The complex reforms which make up the program are challenging
the institutional capacity of the administration. In the financial sector, the BRSA has made
impressive strides as explained in Part II, but must continue to build up its implementation
capacity. The program includes support to the BRSA and SDIF, but their learning curves will
continue to be steep and tested by the crisis. To some extent, crisis management efforts at key
Government agencies such as the MOF, SPO and Treasury have deflected attention from slower
moving public sector reforms, and this explains in part the delays in meeting some of the
benchmarks for PFPSAL II. Looking ahead, institutional capacity constraints are likely to be a
serious obstacle to public sector reform implementation at all levels of government. The need
for extensive institution building and training to progress with public sector reform is one of the
major rationales for the programmatic approach being followed by the Bank. The Bank has
continued to provide intensive technical support for key public sector reform measures including
technical assistance during the second half of 2001 for the development of the tax strategy and
for the Public Investment Review. Further technical support will be provided in 2002 with an
increased focus on public liability management and implementation of the new public
procurement law. The Bank stands ready to consider financial support for selected institution-
building initiatives linked to the program.



- 65 -
129.  Regulatory forbearance. Satisfactory and timely failure resolution efforts by the SDIF
(for already intervened banks) and enforcement of capital restoration plans by the new Bank
Regulation and Supervision Agency for non-intervened banks are important. There is a risk that
such efforts will fall short of what is needed due to political pressure that may be put on these
agencies for a slow-down of regulatory enforcement action and general regulatory forbearance.
To mitigate these risks, the proposed program has specifically focused on strengthening both the
monitoring and enforcement functions of the BRSA. While the monitoring of capital adequacy
and foreign exchange exposure of banks has been significantly strengthened, efforts are being
made to focus on large/connected exposures, and close monitoring and corrective actions will be
planned and closely monitored to reduce risks due to such exposures. With regards to capital
adequacy levels of private banks, BRSA is insisting on full scale portfolio audits to correctly
reflect the correct capital levels. This will be followed by a public solvency support scheme
implemented by BRSA. With these actions, the total systemic risk due to low capital levels will
be considerably mitigated.

G.    Triggers for the PFPSAL II, and Follow-up PFSAL I & II and PPSAL I & II; and
Program Outcome Indicators
131.  In view of the fact that the planned financial and public sector reform program is being
supported by the Bank through a series of Programmatic Adjustment Loans, there is a certain
flexibility in the final conditionally for each loan based on actual developments in the relevant
sectors. However, while retaining this flexibility, there are some critical necessary conditions
(program triggers) to be implemented in any event to ensure that the reform program is
implemented in line with the agreed program. These necessary conditions or triggers for each of
the programmatic loans are presented in Table 15 below along with the reform outcome
indicators for the program as a whole. The triggers will be refined as the program moves
forward and the set of specific outcome indicators will be expanded in collaboration with the
Government. As explained above, the Government has met most of the triggers for PFPSAL II
as presented in the Memorandum of the President for the first PFPSAL in July 2001, and will
meet all the remaining triggers prior to release of the third tranche of the loan.
H.    Financial Management
132.  The Undersecretariat of Treasury has in place adequate accounting and financial
management reporting systems for the two Deposit Accounts (one each for the standard IBRD
and SSAL components under the loan). The Treasury will maintain records of all transactions
under the loan in accordance with sound accounting practices. The Government will submit to
the Bank a monthly receipts and payments account showing the transactions on the Deposit
Accounts, starting with the receipt of the first tranche of Bank funds and ending when the final
tranche of loan funds has been received and the balance on the Deposit Accounts has been
reduced to nil. The Borrower shall: (a) have the Deposit Accounts audited in accordance with
appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank; (b) furnish to the Bank as soon as available but in any case not later than four months after
the date of the Bank's request for such audit, a certified copy of the report of such audit by said
auditors of such scope and in such detail as the Bank shall have reasonable required; and (c)
furnish to the Bank such other information concerning the Deposit Accounts and the audit
thereof as the Bank shall have reasonably requested. The audit will be carried out at quarterly
intervals as agreed with the Bank, calculated from the date the first tranche of loan funds is paid
into the Deposit Accounts, with suitable adjustments of timing depending on the funds left in the
Deposit Accounts at any point in time. The terms of reference for the audit will be agreed
between the Bank and the Borrower. Audits would end once the final tranche of loan funds has
been received and all funds have been transferred from the Deposit Accounts. In addition to the
above, the Bank may request that its own staff (or a specialist contractor working on its behalf)
carry out special reviews of the Deposit Accounts. If, after deposit into the Deposit Accounts,
the proceeds of this loan are used for ineligible purposes, the Bank will require the Borrower to
either: (i) return that amount to the account for use for eligible purposes; or (ii) refund the
amount directly to the Bank.

I.    Project Implementation and Monitoring
133.  The PFPSAL II will be implemented in accordance with the procedures for adjustment
loans in Turkey established under the first PFPSAL and earlier adjustment operations. The
financial and public sector program is being implemented by the Undersecretariat of Treasury, in
cooperation with the Central Bank of Turkey, the BRSA, the SDIF, the Ministry of Finance, the
State Planning Organization, and the Turkish Court of Accounts. The Bank will conduct regular
supervision of the PFPSAL II in close collaboration with the IMF. To help ensure timely
implementation of the program, the Bank team has confirmed with the Government that each
condition for release of the second and third tranches of PFPSAL II as presented in the policy
matrix has been clearly assigned and is owned by a particular government agency. The high-
level Steering Committee for the PEM component of the public sector reform program is
responsible for ensuring effective cooperation among the numerous ministries and line agencies,
and arrangements will be put in place to ensure effective implementation of the national anti-
corruption strategy. Disbursement arrangements for PFPSAL II will be fully consistent with
Bank practice for adjustment loans. Upon notification by the Bank of loan effectiveness
(immediately following Board approval), the proceeds of the first tranche of the loan (excluding
the front-end fees) will be deposited by the Bank into the designated Deposit Accounts at the
request of the Borrower. In accordance with the Operational Directive on the Simplification of
Disbursement Rules under Structural Adjustment and Sector Adjustment Loans (February 8,
1996), disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases. The closing date for the Loan will
be December 31, 2002.
134.  Monitoring. The Bank will carry out regular supervision of the PFPSAL II program in
close coordination with the IMF. Progress in all areas of the program will be monitored against
agreed benchmarks and the conditions for release of the second and third tranches of the loan. A
daily monitoring system is in place with support from the IMF for key macroeconomic indicators
such as interest rates, the exchange rate, bank deposits and CBT net domestic assets and gross
international reserves. Monthly monitoring is in place for inflation, the fiscal balance and the
external accounts. Quarterly quantitative benchmarks for domestic interest rates, the maturity of
new domestic borrowing and private capital inflows have been established on the basis of the
IMF program. In the financial sector, an upgraded monitoring framework for the banks is being
established as described in the risks section above.  Quantitative benchmarks have been
established for the social expenditure envelopes under the 2002 budget. Benchmarks have also
been set for staffing levels in the civil service and SEEs, and these will be monitored on a
continuous basis, including the extent of staff reductions in the state and SDIF banks. Additional
quantitative benchmarks will be established, if needed, as events unfold on the ground. An
extensive monitoring of the broader social impact of the overall reform program is being carried
out through a combination of activities under the PSSP, ARIP and Social Risk Mitigation
Project.

Ref. B.02.1.HM.0.DEt.01.05.197/17484                      Ankara, March 19, 2002
Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President
The World Bank
Washington DC 20433
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn,
1.    Since adopting its strengthened economic program in May, the Government has made
significant progress stabilizing the economy and laying the foundation for sustainable growth
and employment creation in response to the economic crisis which hit Turkey in February 2001.
At the macroeconomic level, we have succeeded in overcoming the initial impact of the crisis on
Turkey's financial markets. Interest rates have fallen to below 70 percent, compared with crisis
peaks of well over 100 percent, and the fiscal program met the target for the primary surplus of
the consolidated public sector of 5.5 percent of GNP in 2001. The floating exchange rate regime
has been successfully introduced and a degree of exchange rate stability achieved following the
large devaluation after February. The exchange rate adjustment has helped shift the current
account to an estimated surplus of US$3.3 billion in 2001, compared to the US$9.8 billion deficit
registered in 2000. The initial spike in prices induced by the devaluation has been contained,
although it is clear that inflationary pressures remain significant. As a result of the crisis and the
need to absorb the costs of bank restructuring, the stock of net public debt to GNP has increased
to an estimated 91 percent of GNP by the end of 2001. In order to ensure debt sustainability and
economic recovery, and resume the disinflation process, we are putting into place further
strengthened policies for 2002 as described below under a new medium-term macroeconomic
framework. Our macroeconomic objectives for 2002 include an increase in the primary surplus
to 6.5 percent of GNP, a reduction in inflation to 35 percent and a fall in nominal interest rates to
the 55 percent range by December 2002, restored GNP growth of 3 percent, and a decline in the
public debt to GNP ratio to about 81 percent.
2.    With regard to our structural program, we have achieved some notable success in
implementing the reforms to the financial and public sectors supported by the programmatic
financial and public sector adjustment loan (PFPSAL) approved by the World Bank in July 2001.
In the banking sector, we have taken further steps to upgrade the regulatory regime, to enhance



the BRSA's institutional capacity, to strengthen the capital base of the private banks and resolve
SDIF banks, and to undertake financial and operational restructuring of the stae n  ba.
In. ceroain areas of the program, notably privatization of Valcif Bank and buldget consolidation,
we1have encbuntered some delays due to market sentiment and ile complexifies of the.reqjirbd
mstnrutional reforms. In other areas, such as banjk recapitalization and replacement of the public
accbuntinglawTh we have expa-nded the prograam.beyond the PFPSAL benchmarrcs and formulated
new measuros which were nol fofeseen in the original program.
3.    Tho Goverunent is also moving ahead with structural reforns to promote private seetor
developmnnt and improve the investment climate including an ac3ori plan to improve the foreign
direct investment (FDI) climate prepared in collaboration with FIAS. As part of this agenda, we
intend to complete the actions required for release of the second tranche of the Econoomic Refonn
Loan (ERL). Our program for paivate sector development includes the following actiond:
 In agricultfre, we have initiated the rollout of the direct income support (DIS) progrpn)at the
national Jevel with slipport from the Agriculture Refqrrm Trnpl4metaton Pro ect Lgslation
liberalizmn the tobacco sector and authorizing the privatizatiorr of TE(EL, which was
originally votoed by the President in July 2001, was enacted on January 9, 2002.
 Inh the energy sector, the new Energy Markets Regulatory Agency (EMRA) has been
-stablishc4d and is now preparing the secondary legislation required to establish energy
'mavets in Turkey. Average electricity sales tariffs for the Turkish Electricity Trade and
Cor#raLting Company, the successor to TEAS, are currently above US 4.5 cents per kwh in
line with the financial recovery plan. Future tariff policy will be datermined by EMRA as
Mnvisagedin the Electricity Markets Law (No. 4628).
 In telecornmunications, an international consulting firm was hired in December 2001 to assist
Turk Te]ekom with the prepration of a plan to complete the corporatization of the compwny.
The new tender comiittee for T3urk Telekaom has been established and wil prepare a new.
privatization plan for the company which is expected to be approved by the Government in
April 2002. Full licensing authority has been transferred to the Teleconirnuniafions
Regulatory Authoiity which is now preparing the required secondary legislation in line *ith
EBT standards.
*  The PA expects to complete the divestiture of 51 percent of BED hM2   (steel) by emd-March
2002 and of TUPRAS (refinery) by end-June 2002, at tbh latest PTivatization of rnedium
and s=all scale comnpanies in the PA's portfolio will also be relaunched in 2W2.
* The FDI action plan was adopted by the Govenment in )ecember 2001. The plan includes
the submission of a new drat FDI law to ?arliament in le with the fmdin&s of the FIAS
study by end-June 2002. The plan also calls for the developrinent of ab investu=t pro0tnoii
strategy which could lead to the establishment of an' investment prom6tiou agency.
Furtherrnore, we will establish an Investor Council consisting of prominent business'
representatives from Turkey and abroad.
4.    In order to move further towards our goal of a competitive electricity market, the
Government has decided on the following process for resolving the pending transfer of opeating
righis (TOOR-) and build-operate-transfer (:BOT) projects on the basis of the Constitutional Court
decision .aumulling parts of provisional artiples No. 4 and 8 of the Blectricity Markets Law. This
pr,qess wiU be adjusted, if needed, on the Vasis of the written Constitutional Court decision
2



expected to be published by end-March 2002, as well as the timing of the High Administration
Court (Danistay) clarification mentioned below and any subsequent Danistay opinions that are
required. License regulations for generation and distribution will be issued by the Energy
Market Regulatory Agency by end-May 2002.
* As soon as the Constitutional Court decision is published, the Government will seek further
clarification from Danistay in order to determine the list of TOOR projects, if any, which are
eligible for Treasury guarantees.
* The sponsors of TOOR generation and distribution projects eligible for Treasury guarantees
will be informed by June 2002 of the amendments required to bring the projects into
conformity with the license regulations issued by EMRA and the Electricity Markets Law.
* With the exception of assets linked to eligible TOOR projects, if any, where the required
amendments are made, by July 2002, the Government will transfer all state-owned thermal
generation and electricity distribution assets under the scope of privatization and launch pre-
qualification tenders for the distribution assets.
* For the remaining eligible TOOR projects, if any, by end-July 2002, the Government will
sign implementation agreements including Treasury-deterrnined guarantee principles where
appropriate and providing a non-renewable period of six months to raise the financing. At
the end of this period, the TOOR contracts which have not reached financial closure will
expire and these assets will be transferred under the scope of privatization by February 2003.
* The Government's policy is not to provide Treasury guarantees for BOT projects not
included in the list of 29 projects identified in 2000.
5.    We have made substantial progress in strengthening social protection for Turkey's
citizens under the PFPSAL program. The outcome for social spending as a share of GNP under
the supplementary budget for 2001 approved in June is in line with the program benchmarks
agreed with the Bank. These benchmarks have been set at a level above the averages for the
1998-2000 period, reflecting the Government's policy decision to fully fund its social priorities
even as overall public spending is reduced. The estimated outcome for total social spending as a
share of GNP in 2001 is 15.5 percent, well above the PFPSAL benchmark of 14.5 percent. The
individual components of social spending on health, education and social protection are all also
in line with their specific benchmarks. The budget for 2002, approved by Parliament in
December, increases total social spending to almost 16 percent of GNP. The 2002 budget
maintains public spending on health and social protection as a share of GNP above the PFPSAL
benchmarks of 3.25 percent and 7.0 percent respectively. Expenditure on social protection in
GNP terms is budgeted to increase relative to 2001 resulting in part from the expansion of the
DIS program to cover all eligible farmers nationwide. The Government has allocated TL 1.9
quadrillion for DIS payments in 2002. Per hectare payments under the DIS program for 2002
will be indexed to the 35 percent targeted inflation rate. Should actual spending requirements for
the DIS program exceed the TL 1.9 quadrillion allocation, the Government will take measures to
meet this additional expenditure while respecting the overall fiscal targets. Expenditure by the
Social Solidarity Fund in 2002 is budgeted to be TL 875 trillion (0.3 percent of GNP), i.e.,
equivalent in GNP terms to the expanded level reached in 2001, with continued support from the
Social Risk Mitigation Project. Public spending on education is budgeted at slightly under 4
percent of GNP in 2002, somewhat below the program benchmark of 4.25 percent of GNP.
However, the Government expects to reallocate additional resources from the budget
3



contingencies to the education budget to cover the cost of additioinal teaahers to be hired over the
course of 2002. As a result, aotual public spending on education is expected to exceed 4 percept
of GNP in 2002. The Government is prepared to take farther measures should actual social
.speading 'flI short the budgeted targets during the dourse of 2002.  The Govemrnent is
* comiitted to allo atng ad equate expenditure envelopes for social programs in the 2003 budget
6.    Unforwnaely, Turkey has been hit by another extemal shock. following the T'enjs of
Septembem 11 which affected our financial markets and export pxospects at a fxie wvhen -the
progr4m Was beginring to show results. To maintain the momenfum of refon;n and overCome ihe
ef;fts' of This additional shock, Turkey has requested additional support fro  the international
commnity. This support will underpin our external financing plan for 2002 and pro'ide niore
tipce Ibr'the program to restore confidence.  0i :Febrnary 4, 2002,-the I4 Board of Direct6rs
approved a new 3 year Stand-by Arrangement for Turkey for a total of SDR 12.8 billion
,quivalent tp USS16.2 billion). ITis includes US$12 billion in a4dltional financing and OSS42
billion w fund carried bver from the preVious Stand-by.  In parallel, the ,Goveirnm&  is
requesting that-the 3a3nc present to its Board of Directors the second Prograxnmaio Financial and
Publio Sectdr Adjustment Ltoan for US$1.35' biion. Progrcss l9as been achieved towards
meeiivg 'all ofa the benchmarks, for PFPSAL II set last July, and we are comniitted fo a iimetaNb,l
to rnmet the remaining benchlarks as revised and agreed with the Bani during the course of
2002. Therefore, mre request-that the PFPSAL 1 loan be struct red as'a three trancheooperation
with the sec,ond and tliird tanches to be disbursed in line with our timetable for cnpletig The
,remaWing agreed actions. The Government's program is consiit=nt with all of rthe triggers for
fhe hikh case as set out in the. CAS Progress Report of June 2001 and we are committed to taking
additioral measures, if needed, to meet these triggers in 2002. 'The status of eur financial and
public sector reform program--including progress sinwe the PFPSAL was approve4 in July 2001,.
the program for 2002 under PPPSAL I, and the strategy for the medium term-is presc6ed
below.
I.    Turkey's Financial Sector Morm Program
7.    After the February 2001 crisis, we have already put in place several vrgently needed
ban3dg system reformi measures, especially as they relate to regulatory reform, iitiation of
q2pacity 'building at the BRSA, stepped-up resolution of the growi'ng number of failed banks
undei.the SDIF, and financial and govemance restructuring of the state-owned banks. Di ordbr to
fuliy rostore and strengthen the banling system's safety and intermediation capacity on a
sustaiiable basis, and to develop the non-bank segments of our financial system in suppon of
.prnvawc sector growth, we are implementing a comprehensive set of financial sector reform
measires over several years, and are seeking the Bank's support for these reform measures in
two .pbases.' The flrSt phase-already partially completed-consists of: (i) implem;nt6tion, 'by
Jutn 200J, of the most argent legal, regulatory, and structural 'reforms necessaiy to gein ire
r#fzucturing of the banking setor under the PFPSAL; and (ii) implementation of the remahiing

Rlegulatorv Framework for Bankinr
1.0.  Loan Loss Provisioning (LLP). We adopted a new loan loss provisioning rule for..
T*Wksh.banks in December 1999 based on a tiered loan classification system (pass-watch-
substandard-doubtful-loss) and borrower creditworthiness to bring the LLP to intermatioTal
stapdds.. We fIurtber strengthened it in July 2000 through the introduction of full tax
dedi)cibi4ty of specific loan loss provisions and the lifting of the exemption from specific
provisioning for Ziraat's agricultural support loans,. However, addition4l imorovements are
necessary based on observations sjpce the February 2001 crisis. Those inaludq:.(i) dlazficatj6n
of Pair value accounting rules. for collateral wherever necessary to avoid gignficitan.
overstatbmenz, le4ding to a potential anderstatement of provisioning requiremn by ban1s;:(ii>
mQdification of restrctive provisions for loaw reschedulings; and (iii) nlinination of tae
provi ion in:thc banking law 43R9 allowing a four year phase-in period for clossification bd.
provisioning of loans made before June 1999. In combinatlon, these factors have discouraged
TurlVish-private banks from restructuring problerri loans, while at the same time alIdwing tiemi to
significantly understate their non-performing loans (NPLs). To rpmedy these  e sses,:y
have submitted, and Parliament has adopted, a banking Jaw ammdment e]  riahini   tb6 four year
phase-in perod for pre-June 1999 loans. With the President's simnature the amen'dnient beearne
effective on January 31, 2002. Add.itionaTlh. the B:RSA has issued on.Februarv 5. .2DWO a
Oaiifica#n to tie loan loss 2rovisioning rule conceniinz fair value accountina requirements for
all tpes& of collateral and has anended the LLP rule (January 31. 20024 to remove te restrictive

bv pernittitiiegtheir upWradine to a higher classification level only upon the dbtor cinmeed.

11. .. Large/Connected Exposures. In order to- educe a relatively, higb degree of connected
lepxdi~ig snd equity exposures and the resultant. risks in Turkish bbnks (As part of fivici4l.
ftduEia1 groiips), we have mernded thebanking law in Decemnber 1999 and'April 2001, In furne

called for by the banking law, as well as the interim targets and time-table for banks to comne
stepvwise into compliance with the new rion-finmncial. equiity exposure limits, The lending
rxposrirs limits will be rearhed in stages by the end of 2006, ald thle enew separate equity
pc>S=tO liTiltS will be in ul compliance with EU non-financial equity exposure levels yty the
end :6f 2009; Additionally, the latest banking laiv amendment aIso mandates the. applicatjbi of
t4e eXposu'rerits, (for conn,ected lendidg/deriva4tves and non-knaripial eqiuity) on bothi solo'
and consojidated basis (i.e., to banks and their financial subsidiaries togelher)., Rwever, even

Qo7mpliance withl: the rTeW lower limits (all expressdd as a perceni of bank capital),' several bankd
*cannaot meet tho higher, interim limits for 200O)Z002. This is in part due to the facl . tat, the
baris' ajpital base has shrank as a result of the rises. In additidca, some existing Viplatihns,ave
worsened7bcza,se foreign lenders (or even doniestic banks trying to rediuce exposures to other
groups) have recalled loans to .Turldsh bank/emtexprises, causing group bunks to mainud4 or
,'en increasc b.heir group expos.ures to replace silch c3reitors. The'BRSA bas issued a remxaation

12.   Foreign Exchange (FX) Exposure. Weakaesses in the FX expos-ure rales for banks were
a majoy concern during the past few years, when banks were routinelycarrying large gbort open
FXMpositi=DS to arbitrage the Tuikish Lira-USS interest rate differentiUl, To mitigate the inipact
on bk capal of large unexpected exchaange rate shocks, we initiated efforts to ti,ghten the F:X.
exposUre limits during 19$-99 when the maximum open FX positlon litnit for banks was
teduA5d ia 4 stepqkise faWhion fRom 50 percent of regiiktory cwital in lune 19989to 20 percent in,
October 1999 and was applied on both solo and consolidated basis ig December 1999. :  spile o
te' tighter n4es, hoWever, loopholes (especiilly 'itne,duredt flhatce products) remnained and
'baiks-J-aving taken advantage of such possible loplpholes to zany excessive FX exposites--
jicurred large lostes due to the Februaiy 2001 TLdevaluation. Even thotigh most bainkr, lhave
since. sharply reduced their FX exposures, we b1ieve. that any such loopholep should
neiirtheiess be closedl to avoid recurreice, of abuse in -future. For this pgrpose, w^/ have,creAted a,
*wclrking,group comprising B1SA and CBT staff to: (i) catalogue the use 'b banks of stnctured
,fin.ri prod4cts to incui FX exposures .not captured by existia$ rex laions, and (iB) formulate
rqaredial regulatory action as necessary to capture'such exposarbs.,

14.   Taxation aud Corporate Law     Reform  to Jneourage Mergers/Damtrgers and
h4iitate. Separatidon of Fnancial Thdustrial Groups. To 4evelop a healtby, strong and
*nddlrn Turkisfi badking sectr, we have adopted several measwes to mncourago mergers and
,:coWlidation among .smA1l banks witout the. requisite size, &apital, .ange of products and
rvics and,technical and niamagerial depth Ai the same time; to facilitate efficient fina.nclal
flow  aongio  fiaancial entities within a single buwinsss group, and to better muanage and
supervise thOinhCent risks on a consolidated basis for gronp fiancial istiutuons we beliove
that it ig xnec6ssary to separate the finandial and IndusiI activities of the fiiaaql-inditia1
g'dup5 (~FIGs) ini, Turkey. I:he Parliament has already enact4 several aax'iAeits to Wc
*lgl4i3tign 'tat facilitate bank mergers and t,  shtry of Finance will shorty issue ?n
imn,etnentation decree to operatkQnalize the new tax provisions. Further amendcments to tax laws
as well as coanpany and finan6ial sector legiglati6n 'may be necessary to allaw fUI_cae
corporate restructuring (including de-rherger5) of mixed conglom=ates into separate fiiianial
and indistiil holding company structres. During 2002, as part of the actin pans to redaped.
connected and large exposures of banks to their/or other FIGs, the BRSA will recoinnevd,,where
prudent and ndcessary, restructuring of such intert*Vined financitil/ industiial congle:erates into
separate financial and industrial holding entities. In this context, the BfSA wil1, in coop raXoxi
with the Ministry of Finance and other ministies and regulatory agencies, see4 to rewove aAy
remaining legal/tax impedinrents during 2002.
Strengtheuing the Institutional Capacxty of the BRSA and the SDIF
15.   Institutional Development of the BISA. Shortly 4ex its operafionalization on
Septe=bWr 1, 2000 thie BRSA identified the following institutional development priorities;. (i)
ii,eg8Ation of s2fcoming to the BRSA from five different deprtzments within the Triasuxy, the
Minisry of pFince and the CBsT, and staff training; (ii) develoiieMt of a coonmon database for
all supprvisory and enforcement departments (e.g, offsite monitoring, on-site SupeCMsi61n

30.   The program comprises three core pillars each of which has a medium-term dimension.
The first pillar inivolves structural fiscal policies to underpin the fiscal adjustment required for
overcoming the crisis and to ensure that this adjustment is sustainable over the medium term.
The Government has introduced a package of fiscal measures to underpin the increase in the
primary surplus to 6.5 percent of GNP in 2002. In order to sustain the fiscal adjustment, the
Government intends to implement further structural measures on both the revenue and
expenditure sides of the budget. The Government has adopted a medium-term strategy for
improving the tax system encompassing both tax policy reforms to simplify the system and
broaden the tax base and institutional changes to modernize tax administration in line with
international and OECD norms. The Government has initiated a comprehensive program to
adjust staffing levels in the central government and SEEs as envisaged in the PFPSAL
f1ramework. The public employment program complements other reforms to address the
structural roots of Turkey's problems with public expenditure including reforms to the public
pension system, agriculture support policies and the energy sector under the ERL program with
the Bank. The second pillar of our public sector reform program comprises institutional and
policy reforms to improve public expenditure management (PEM) based on the multi-year
Strategic Framework prepared in line with the recommendations of the Public Expenditure and
Institutional Review (PEIR) carried out jointly with the World Bank. As part of this strategy,
key legislation to modernize Turkey's public procurement system was enacted in January 2002.
The third pillar of the public sector reform program involves broad based institutional reforms to
improve the quality of public sector governance. This includes on-going regulatory reforms in
the banking, energy and telecommunications sectors, a systematic approach to combating
corruption, and civil service reform. The Government has adopted a national strategy for
enhancing transparency and good governance in the public sector which will be published by
end-March. To help deepen its public sector reform program and present core elements of the
program to the public, the Government hosted two international conferences in collaboration
with the Bank. The first conference in September 2001 focused on anti-corruption. The second
conferenice, held in December, focused on public expenditure management reform.
31.   The Government intends to establish before the end of April a new structure for
coordinating implementation of the public sector reform program. This new structure will
involve a small group of key ministers acting as a Steering Group with clear coordination and
program implementation responsibilities. Under the new structure, the steering committee for
public expenditure management reform will operate under the authority of this Group. A
committee will also be formed under the Steering Group to support implementation of the
national anti-corruption strategy. The ministerial committee for civil service reform, which has
already been established, will work in close coordination with the new Steering Group.
32.   We request continued support from the World Bank in carrying forward our public sector
reform program. The specifics of the Government's reform program are presented in the text
below under three major headings: (i) Structural Fiscal Policies, (ii) Public Expenditure
Management Reform, and (iii) Public Sector Governance. This text covers actions taken since
thie first PFPSAL was approved in July 2001 and prior to Board presentation of PFPSAL II, as
well as those actions to be taken for the second and third tranches of the loan. It also presents
additional implementation benchmarks expected to be completed by December 2002. These

Government plans over the course of 2002 to: (i) implement mechanisms for monitoring
government project guarantees and on-lending operations, (ii) develop a centralized fiscal risk
analysis capability in the new middle office; and (iii) prepare and disclose a Government Fiscal
Risk Statement. The full institutional structure for the new public liability management system,
including all necessary legal changes, should be in place by the end of 2003. The Government
will then be in a position to issue its public liability strategy as an annex to the planned medium-
term expenditure framework.
Public Sector Governance
54.   The Government's actions to improve public sector governance aim to rcduce political
influencc over economic management and upgrade the quality and effectiveness of Turkey's
public sector. This agenda includes the preparation and implementation of a national strategy to
enhance transparency and good governance as well as the launch of a comprehensive civil
service reform. These actions complement and are integrated with the program of structural
liscal reform and PEM reform discussed earlier.
55.   A national strategy to enhance transparency and good governance in the public sector
was adopted by the Government on January 12, 2002. The strategy was prepared by a Steering
Committee under the leadership of the Prime Minister's Inspection Board and including
reprcsentatives from the Treasury, the Ministry of Finance's Financial Crimes Investigation
Board (MASAK), the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Interior. The Government Decree
adopting the strategy and the Steering Committee's report under the slogan "A Transparent and
('leoan Tuirkey: Together Hand in Hand" will be published by end-March. The objective of the
strategy is to provide a comprehensive framework for improving governance and reducing
political influence over the economy which establishes clear priorities and benchmarks, and
emipowers and energizes public opinion to fight corruption. The strategy covers five core areas:
public administration, the judicial system, the political system, civil society and the competitive
private sector. It complements on-going regulatory reforms in the energy, telecommunications
and financial sectors, as well as the reforms to the public procurement system and the broader
financial accountability agenda discussed above. The Government is undertaking efforts to
improve public awareness about good governance and is counting on the active involvement of
national NGOs. The International Conference on Good Governance and Combating Corruption
co-sponsored by the Governnent and the Bank in September 2001 provided input on
international experience and best practice to help shape the strategy. The Government is
committed to active implementation of the full national strategy and has set out a series of
implementation benchmarks for 2002 and the medium term as set out in the matrix annexed to
this letter. To coordinate implementation of the strategy, the Government intends to establish
appropriate implementation arrangements by April 2002.
56.   Priorities under the national strategy to enhance transparency and good governance
include:
* Accelerating the completion of ongoing work, within the framework of public administration
reform, for institutional improvement and financial management.

I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS)
The main objective of the proposed PFPSAL II is to support the next phase of the
Government's financial and public sector reform priorities in response to the February
2001 financial crisis, while continuing to ensure that social programs are adequately
funded. Key priorities include, in the financial sector: (i) overhaul of the regulatory
framework for banking activity; (ii) institutional development of the new Bank
Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA); (iii) problem bank/bank failure resolution;
and (iv) state bank restructuring and privatization; and in the public sector: (i) a further
deepening of structural fiscal policies in support of sustainable fiscal adjustment; (ii) a
broadening of the Government's public expenditure management reform program
including concrete improvements to the framework for budget planning and execution,
financial accountability and public liability management; and (iii) implementation of the
governments strategy to strengthen public sector governance including adoption and
implementation of a national anti-corruption strategy and initial steps towards civil
service reform.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
The proposed Second Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan
(PFPSAL II) is the second loan in support of the Government's multi-year financial and
public sector reform program. It follows on the first Programmatic Financial and Public
Sector Adjustment Loan of US$1.1 billion approved in July 2001 (US$700 million on
standard IBRD terms and US$400 million on SSAL terms). It is envisaged that the
proposed PFPSAL II will be followed by (i) two Programmatic Financial Sector
Adjustment Loans (PFSAL I and II) of US$500 million each, and (ii) a Programmatic
Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PPSAL) of US$375 million. The latter two sets of
adjustment loans will all be on standard IBRD terms and are tentatively planned for
December 2002 (PFSAL I), January 2003 (PPSAL) and June 2003 (PFSAL II), to
support the implementation of the program.

Comments: Increases in fuel taxes under the program should act to promote energy
conservation and the shift away from indirect agricultural subsidies to direct income
support may reduce the use of environmentally harmfulfertilizers. Improvements in
Public Expenditure Management should permit line Ministries, including environment,
to be more focused in their use of resources.
