Kazakhstan Drylands Management Project
(GE-P071525-LEN-BBGEF)
Environmental Assessment and Environmental Management Plan
Environmental Assessment: The global environmental objectives of this project are to reverse land
degradation, to improve biodiversity, protect rare or endangered flora and fauna, increase the store of
carbon in biomass and the soils and to maintain if not improve the soil quality. The proposed project aims
to significantly expand the adoption of appropriate and environmentally friendly pastoral agriculture and
promote sustainable land use practices in the rangeland areas of central Asia.
The principal thrusts of the project are:
1. Promote reseeding of abandoned arable land and return it to prime grassland.
2. Improve the management of existing rangelands and make accessible remoter areas by rejuvenating watering
points for cattle.
3. Increase, bushes and shrubs in rangeland and grassland areas to improve the supply of fodder and enhance
water infiltration as well as encourage biodiversity.
4. Facilitate the marketing of farm and non-farm products.
5. Strengthen national policy and local extension and demonstration capacity.
6. Promote a broad public awareness campaign to disseminate the economic and environmental benefits of
project activities throughout the rangeland areas; and
7. Encourage regional collaboration and cooperation.
An environmental assessment was made of the various project activities. In summary, the initiatives should lead to
an increase in the quality and quantity of flora and fauna, an improvement to the soil and water quality and an
increased carbon sequestration in soil and biomass. In conclusion, this project will have substantial environmental
benefits. However, care must be taken to prevent (exotic) invasive and 'weed' species becoming dominant through a
careful choice of seed and seedlings and through improved management practices. Also farmers should not be
tempted to reverse long-term environmental gains by ploughing grassland. Meetings were held with the farmers and
they agreed to a binding conditionality, which prevents them from ploughing rehabilitated grazing land, unless there
are exceptional circumstances; these have to be agreed by the local farmers and the MNREP. In addition, the project
will provide initiatives to mcrease the availability of feed, especially winter feed and present more opportunities to
sell animals, milk, meat etc., thus reducing the need to obtain cash from cereal sales. Through better pasture
management, and an increased provision of winter feed, there will be more farm animals. These will be housed in
barns during the winter. Thus, manure disposal may cause a problem and so steps will be taken to educate farmers
on environmental friendly manure management techniques, especially its use in hay fields. Therefore, mitigation
measures are proposed to address the possible (negative) environmental impacts. These are shown in Tables 1.

B. Monitoring Plan.
The PMU will perform regular monitonng and evaluation of project activities. At the mnicro-level it will supervise the vanous
activities to ensure that they are being undertaken accordmg to the mitigation plan described in 'A' above. Where contractors
are involved, the contract should include clauses about conforming to standards workmanship and responsibilities etc.
This pilot project is of global significance. Thus, the collection of informnation at the macro-level is important. Data will be
collected on carbon sequestration, biodiversity and soils. A baseline sample survey of organic carbon m soils and plants will be
undertaken at representative sites throughout the project area. Simnlarly, a survey will be undertaken of flora and fauna and its
quality and quantity. Lastly the soils will be tested for rmneral content and organic matter as well as soil depth etc. Carbon will
be monitored closely and the soil and plants will be measured dunng the growing season for five years. This is described in
detail in Annex 2 and the equipment and personnel requirements are given in Section 3.1 of the Costing Tables (Annex 6).
Therefore, only a summary will be given here. Biodiversity re-surveys will be undertaken yearly as will the testmg of soils. The
PMU wIll be responsible for M & E. In-country specialists will receive additional training if and when required. In addition,
local people will be recruited to monitor flora and fauna. Environmental monitoring will be incorporated in the overall project
monitoring required by the World Bank as part of project performance. The results of such monitoring will be recorded and
maintained by the PMU throughout the project's lifetime.

Originally, the project was going to use pesticides to try and diminish mvasive and unpalatable species. But because farmers
have difficulty purchasing pesticides and are not familiar with usmg them, this component has been dropped. In its place
mechanical scraping will be tried coupled with phosphate application and reseeding with indigenous species, especially perenmual
legumes that can out perform the invasive and unpalatable species.
Another potential problem is that the water table at the proposed rehabilitated well sites may be insufficient to permanently
supply the cattle during the summer months. This is unlikely, because the wells were in use before collectivization and each
well has a potential recharge area of over 10 km2. However, the project and the local officials will monitor the ground water to
ensure that it is not being depleted.
C. Institutional Strengthening.
1.      Equipment Purchases.
The PMU will have maps of the 11 sub-districts and these will be used to denote where the sampling will take place or has been
carried out. The PMU should have two GPS devices and these will be used to pinpomt the sampling sites etc. Some equipment
will be provided by the people undertaking the various surveys or doing analysis in the laboratory; this has been mcluded m the
estimated cost. For example, the people undertaking the survey of flora and fauna should have simple equipment, key books and
equipment to store plants and animals for identification when necessary. When undertaking assessments of organmc carbon m
plants, weighing scales and moisture content meters are required as are specimen bags etc. This should be provided by the
people undertaking the survey, but the PMU should have extra equipment. This list is given in Table 4 below under 'biomass
measuring equipment.' The cost is estimated to be US$ 2,910.
While most of the soil testing will be for soil carbon, testing for other minerals (N & P) and organic matenal is important and
will be done at the same time as testing for orgamc carbon. Some additional equipment is required such as spades, soil sampler,
soil depth meter, plastic bags and other consumables. The cost this equipment is estimated at US$ 3,530, (Table 4).
A list of the major equipment for carbon stock assessment, including soil analysis is given below. Justification for the equipment
is included in the main report and in Annex 2. This new equipment costs US$ 77,650 and the laboratory will use equipment and
consumables valued at US$ 70,000. Their contract work is valued at US$ 70,000 and recurent costs come to US$ 46,700, giving
a total of US$ 264,350 for this assessment of carbon stock. These costs are elaborated m the Costing Table (Annex 6?).
Sirmlarly, the costs for biodiversity monitoring are summarized m Table 4 (US$ 189,100) and is detailed in the Costing Tables.
The project will also purchase through the tendering system 40 wind mulls for water pumping at a cost of about UDS$ 6,000
each, including maintenance and spares for five years. Thus, the total cost will be US$ 240,000. This will be a tnal to se if the
pumps are robust enough to withstand the variable wind speeds. Also, siting of the windmills is important to ensure that there is
sufficient wind to enable the pumps to function adequately.

2.      Training/Study Tours.
Environmental training will be undertaken at several levels. There will be formal courses for project staff, farmers and other
beneficianes. There will infornal discussions dunng meetmgs with village groups etc., there will be demonstrations of
environmentally friendly practices and there will be site visits to vanous areas within the project as well as other areas within
Kazakhstan. The training will cover land-use planmng, environmental management, monitoring and mitigation. Also, farmers
with windmill will receive training in their maintenance. As the project proceeds, environmental trainig will be tailored to the
lessons learnt from the project and the changing needs of the beneficiaries. Thus, the following table (Table 5) covers the
present proposals, but is subject to change.

1. This is required to survey local people to obtain mdigenous knowledge. Some beneficiaries can be used as trainers and
to locate areas of important and/or rare species.
3.      Consultant Services.
Consultants and/or staff from the MNREP should train project staff in environmentally fnendly farming practices when
undertaking specific components such as reeseeding, improvement of natural pastures, handling, storage and use of permitted
pesticides, integrated pest management etc. After this traimng, project staff will ensure that the vanous operations are
undertaken with minimum environmental damage. Some of the proposed measure are contour ploughing, minimum tillage,
using indigenous seeds and seedlmgs, appropnate time for undertaking ground preparation, avoiding areas of rare, endangered or
commercially important plants or breedmng grounds for birds etc. Demonstations will be laid out throughout the project area so
that the project staff can take farmers to them and also advise the farmers about appropriate methods, seeds and technology.
Consultancy contracts will be given to agencies within Kazakhstan through the Competitive Grant System. These will be for
Biodiversity Monitoring estimated to be about US$ 190,000 over the five year period and Carbon Sock Assessment (mcluding
soil analysis) valued at about US$ 263,000 over 5 years. The TOR have been drafted by the project management team and will
be circulated for comments. In addition there will be foreign and local techcmcal assistance valued at US$ 93,000 and US$
7,500 respectively. And as stated in Table 5 above, there will be trainung in carbon stock assessment and remote sensing valued
at US$ 28,000.
Technical assistance is requires for the shrub nursery establishment, to advize on the planting of belts of grasses and shrubs in
rangelands and to provide training and advice to farmers about shrub establishment and tendmg. A local specialist with
experiece in these fields will be required for six months each year for five years. The estimated cost for such a specialist is US$
1,640 includmg all allowances. Thus the total cost for 5 years is US$ 49,200.
The windmill contractor will supply traming in windmull maintenance to the farmers where the windmills are installed. This is
part of the contract cost.



4.     Special Studies: None needed.
D. SCHEDULE.
The mitigation and monitonng of routine activities are given m Table 5 above for the Tramers. In turn, the trainers will train
beneficianes to undertake the necessary mitigation activities. Monitoring of these activities will be carred out by the PMU or by
people designated by them. Biodiversity monitoring and carbon sequestration assessment will be undertaken by specialized
agencies such as research institutes. In addition, there will be monitoring of the ground water at the restored wells to ensure that
the groundwater is not being depleted. There is a nationwide locust control project. Through project activities, the breedmg
grounds for locusts should be reduced. The project will monitor this to see if the incidence of locusts decreases.
E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS.
The monutoring of bio-diversity and will be under the supervision of the MNREP. In-country specialists will receive additional
training if and when required. A baseline survey of plants and animals will be undertaken in year 1 at stratified random sites.
Re-surveys at the same sites will occur throughout the project's lifetime. In addition local people will be recruited to monitor
flora and fauna species especially birds and large ammals. Analysis of results will be undertaken at reputable institutes.
A baseline survey of carbon in biomass and the soil will be undertaken in Year 1 using stratified random samplmg techniques.
Re-surveying will be undertaken in at specific intervals durmg the project's lifetime. Soil carbon measurements will be taken
dunng each growing season and used to model sequestration potential. . Analysis of results will be undertaken at reputable
institutes and venfication will be done by independent organizations. This verification is necessary if Kazakhstan wishes to
trade sequestered carbon or use it for offset purposes. In addition measurements will be made of carbon in above and below
ground biomass.
Under the MNREP/MOA the PMU and especially the PIU would have the overall responsibility for carbon sequestration
determination, environmental monitoring, mitigation, and performance. The PMU has developed an implementation plan for
carbon sequestration measurement, blodiversity monitoring and soil and ground water momtoring at well sites and collecting and
analyzing of all the relevant data. Field technicians will analyze various data and together with laboratory technicians prepare
quarterly and annual reports and will send them to the PMU/international consultant for evaluations. Within Kazakhstan there is
a government Climate Change Council responsible for all matters dealing with the various related protocols. This council will
be fully informed about the purpose of carbon sequestration measurements and seek their advice on reportng methodologies.
Similarly, estimates of biodiversity and soil quality etc. will be in conformuty to agreed standards. At the end of each year in
which measurements took place, all data will be summarized in a usable form for the benefit of stakeholders including the WB,
GM, IFAD, MNREP and MOA. These latter bodies will have authonty to modify the EMP if necessary as a result of received
data/information.
F. CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL NGOs AND PROJECT-AFFECTED GROUPS.
The project started to be formulated in 1999. Since then, numerous meetings and discussions were held with government
mnumstries, research institutes and NGOs in Almaty, Astana, Karaganda and Shotandy. Included in the discussions were
environmental concerns and the overall positive benefit this pilot project should have on the environment. Three sites were
visited as potential areas for the project. After exhaustive consultations, the northern part of Shetsky Rayon was chosen.
Field trips were made to Shetsky Rayon and extensive talks and meetings were held with local officials, farmers' business
people, and women groups etc. For example, three Project Meetings held in Astana, between consultants, staff and mnmstry
officials etc. were highlighted on TV. Two press statements were submitted to the MNREP for release. Project information was
provided to the CCD for publication in UNDP documents. Infornation has been sent to various international agencies such as
CIDA, USAID and ICARDA.



Project and World Bank Staff have made several presentations to 'Environmental' groups. In parallel to these meeting a social
survey was undertaken, including attitudes to the environment. All these activities are documented and are on project's files.
Talks and discussions are continuing with full participation of the beneficiaries. As a result, an Environmental Assessment was
made with the inputs of local people and environmental experts. This assessment was then used to compile this Environmental
Management Plan. As this is a pilot project, it is probable that some of the environmental plans will be adjusted (and improved)
as lessons are learnt. However, by the end of the project, it is anticipated that farmers within the rayon and neighbouring farmers
will adopt many of the project initiatives, leading to sustainable management of the pastures, grasslands and rangelands of the
region. Not only that, the GEF project should have a catalytic effect on national and regional imtiatives for governments, donors
and International lending agencies, the including World Bank.
The project will have several other benefits including public awareness, capacity building from the beneficiaries and private
firms to government agencies. Trammg is an important component of the project. Besides givmg training in the immediate area,
the project will brmg people from areas of Kazakhstan and the region with simular climatic conditions. They will receive hands-
on trauing so that they will be able to use this experience to undertake similar initiatives in their own country or area. Thus
replication throughout the region and beyond is anticipated. Therefore considerable domestic and global benefits should result
from this pilot GEF initiative.
At present, a local consultant is developing PR activities to make the project widely available. Currently, this report is being
translated and an action plan will be drawn up to make it available to a wide audience especially the local people, but also
NGOs. Thus, the Environmental Management Plan will be made available m country for perusal and discussion, especially by
the affected people. Also, it will be made available on the World Bank's Web site and comments will be welcome.
