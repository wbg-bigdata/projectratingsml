SANTA ISABEL PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        With a previous Credit (61-BO) the International Development
Association (IDA) assisted in financing the Corani plant, the first hydro
development of the Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE), the autonomous
national electricity company of Bolivia. Commercial operation of the
Corani plant started in early 1967. A second hydroelectric project, the
Santa Isabel plant using the tailrace water of Corani, is now under con-
sideration, which would allow ENDE to meet the expected demand in the
central region of Bolivia. ENDE is also planning to extend its facilities
in other regions.
ii.       The Bolivian Government has applied for an IDA Credit of US$7.4
million equivalent to finance the foreign exchange cost of the Santa Isabel
Project. It would relend (a) U.S$7.34 million of the Credit to ENDE to meet
the foreign exchange cost of the Santa Isabel hydroelectric plant and associat-
ed transmission facilities and (b) the balance of US$60,000 to the Direccion
Nacional de Electricidad (DINE), the regulatory agency, to finance the foreign
exchange cost of consulting services. The Government has also applied for a
loan of US$5.6 million from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for
the expansion of ENDE's Southern Systems.
iii.      The total cost of the Santa Isabel hydroelectric plant and
associated transmission facilities, including engineering and contingencies,
and consulting services for DINE, would amount to US$10.5 million equivalent.
iv.       The Santa Isabel hydroelectric plant is needed to meet expected
load growth in ENDE's Central System. The plant has been soundly planned
by ENDE and its consultants. It is the least cost and the most suitable
plant for ENDE's system. Its internal rate of return would be between 15%
and 19.5%, valuing output at prevailing tariffs and making allowances for
possible variations in such factors as load.
v.        Procurement would be made after international bidding in accordance
with IDA Guidelines. Credit disbursements would be for the foreign exchange
cost of materials, equipment, engineering and consultant services and the
foreign exchange cost component of civil works construction contracts.
vi.       ENDE's present and forecast financial position is satisfactory.
vii.      The Project would be suitable for a credit equivalent to US$7.4
million, of which US$7.34 million would be relent by the Government to
ENDE at 6.5% interest for a term of 30 years, including a four-year grace
period, and US$60,000 to DINE.

SANTA ISABEL PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a project of Empresa Nacional
de Electricidad S.A. (ENDE), consisting of the Santa Isabel hydroelectric
plant with a capacity of 34 MW, the construction of associated transmission
facilities, and consultants' services to ENDE and Direccion Nacional de
Electricidad (DINE), the regulatory agency for the Bolivian power supply
industry.
1.02      The estimated cost of the Project is about $b 126.5 million
(US$10.5 million). The Government of Bolivia has asked the Association
for a credit to meet the foreign exchange costs of the Project which are
estimated to amount to $b 88.8 million (US$7.4 million).
1.03      The Borrower would be the Government of Bolivia which would relend
US$7.34 million of the Credit to ENDE at commercial rates and the balance of
US$60,000 to DINE.
1.04      In 1964, the International Development Association (IDA) made
two credits, totaling US$15 million, to the Republic of Bolivia to help
finance power projects. The first Credit of US$10 million, 61-BO, is
being made available by the Government as an equity contribution to ENDE
to help finance the 27 MW Corani hydro plant, transmission lines to
Cochabamba and the Oruro tin mining district, and distribution system
extensions in Cochabamba. Simultaneously, the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) made a US$3.5 million loan for the same purpose. The second
IDA Credit of US$5 million, 62-BO, was relent by the Government to the
Canadian owned Bolivian Power Company (BPC) for the construction of the
11 MW Chururaqui hydroelectric plant and system improvements in La Paz and
Oruro.
1.05      The project financed by Credit 61-BO has been substantially com-
pleted. The Corani plant has been operating satisfactorily since the be-
ginning of 1967. The cost of the plant was below the estimate and it was
agreed the savings could be used for additional transmission and distribution
work and for consulting services. To allow sufficient time for the addi-
tional work to be executed, the closing date was postponed by 1-1/2 years to
June 30, 1970. As of December 1968, US$0.9 million was undisbursed. The
Chururaqui plant has been operating satisfactorily since early 1966, and
credit 62-BO was fully disbursed before the closing date of December 31, 1967.
1.06      The conditions stipulated in the credit documents 61-BO and 62-BO
which were interlinked, have been fulfilled with the following exceptions:
the rate of return has not yet been reached and the Government has failed
in meeting its obligations to BPC. During negotiations for the proposed



- 2 -
credit, however, the Government and BPC agreed on a new debt settlement
which is satisfactory to IDA. Both these aspects will be discussed later
in this report;
1.07      During appraisal of the Corani project it was already apparent
that ENDE would need further generating facilities within a few years
after completion of the Corani plant. Consequently funds were made
available under Credit 61-BO for consultant services to study the market
and determine the most economic power developments. The J.G. White Engineer-
ing Corporation of New York prepared a study which showed that a plant using
the tailrace water of the Corani Plant, designated the Santa Isabel
Plant, would be the best development. The study left doubts, however, as
to the forecast of demand in the Bolivian power market. The Association
therefore requested a further study for which ENDE engaged Motor Columbus
of Switzerland. The consultants' report was submitted in February 1968 and
found acceptable. An appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. W.F. Kupper
and R. Knothe visited Bolivia in July/August 1968. This report has been
prepared by the mission and is based on information supplied by ENDE, its
consultants, and an IDB mission which appraised ENDE's projects in the
southern region of Bolivia in September 1968.
2. THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
Relation to the Economy
2.01      Bolivia is a landlocked country of about 1.1 million km2 bordered
by Chile, Peru, Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. The dominant geographical
features of the country are two ranges of the Andean mountain system which
embrace a high plateau, the "Altiplano", comprising about 40% of the total
area of the country. Population is concentrated in (a) La Paz, the capital
with about 600,000 inhabitants, (b) Oruro and Cochabamba, the area to be
supplied by the project, (c) Potosi and Sucre in south Bolivia and (d)
Santa Cruz in the tropical plains in thl east. The population is estimated
to be about 4.6 million, about 4 per km , and is increasing at an average
rate of about 2.4% per year. About two thirds of the people live in the
valleys of the mountains and on the altiplano.
2.02      The economy of Bolivia is based mainly on agriculture which con-
tributes about 23% to the GDP. The GDP, at current market prices, increased
from US$280 million equivalent in 1958 to an estimated US$790 million in 1968
or about 11% per annum. During the same period annual per capita income rose
from US$82 to an estimated US$180 or about 8% per annum. Although mining
(mainly: tin, lead, and zinc) accounts for only about 9% of the GDP, the
economy depends on it to a large degree, since mining generates about 70%
of the country's export earnings. The outlook for tin, which is Bolivia's
most important mining product, is uncertain due to low prices and as a
result the mining sector's demand for power is not expected to increase by
more than the 4% per year experienced in past years. A more significant
contribution to load growth is expected from the manufacturing and con-
struction industries and from residential consumers.



- 3 -
2.03      From 1960 to 1967 total gross generation of electric power in
Bolivia increased from about 447 GWh at a rate of about 4% per annum to
595 GWh. The installed generating capacity during the same period increased
by about 50% to 219 MW of which about 85 MW is owned by BPC, 35 MW by ENDE,
78 MW by private industries and 21 MW by isolated public supply systems.
Organization of the Sector
2.04      Prior to 1962, when the Government decided to enter into the
electric supply industry, BPC had supplied practically all public electric
power in the country. Due to the severe inflation in Bolivia and the lack
of authorization for tariff adjustments, BPC's financial position had
deteriorated to a point where the necessary expansion of facilities could
no longer be made. Furthermore the Corporacion Minera de Bolivia (COMIBOL),
the government-owned mining company, had accrued a large outstanding debt
of US$2.6 million for power purchased from BPC; the government also owed
BPC about US$170,000 for the Oruro telephone company it had taken over from
BPC in 1956 and about US$200,000 for power purchased.
2.05      These matters were considered by IDA in 1964 and it was agreed that
(a) ENDE was to be established as a government-owned autonomous power company
to construct, operate and manage power installations where needed except in
an area to be served by BPC (see paragraphs 5.02 and 5.03); (b) the Government
and COMIBOL would pay their debts to BPC; and (c) Direccion Nacional de
Electricidad (DINE) was to be established as an autonomous regulatory agency
to formulate policies and regulations governing the power sector and to
approve tariffs for all power entities in the country.
2.06      ENDE has been set up satisfactorily and started commercial opera-
tions in early 1967. COMIBOL has made all the payments due to BPC, but the
Government failed to pay for the Oruro telephone system and for the supply of
power. At the end of 1968 the amount owed by the Government had reached about
US$0.8 million. Following the credit negotiations, agreement was reached be-
tween the Government and BPC that the debt accrued would be repaid over about
7 years and that current electricity bills would be paid promptly. The
arrangement is satisfactory to the Association.
2.07      With the assistance of consultants, Motor Columbus of Switzerland,
DINE was finally established as a regulatory body by Supreme Decree No.
08283 in February 1968. An Electricity Code to regulate the Bolivian power
sector was prepared by DINE and promulgated by Supreme Decree No. 08438 in
July 1968. Tariffs aimed to allow a satisfactory return have been approved
by DINE for BPC, ENDE, and other power entities in the country.
2.08      Although DINE is now operating fairly satisfactorily, it still
suffers from an undue degree of supervision by the Ministry of Economy and
has difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified staff. The con-
sultants' contract expired in October 1968. It appears highly doubtful
that DINE, without assistance of qualified consultants, could overcome all
the difficulties a regulatory agency has to face. As a satisfactory func-
tioning of DINE is essential for the development of the Bolivian power indus-



-4-
try, an agreement has been reached during negotiations that consultants be
employed by DINE for at least another two years to assist it in the prepara-
tion of the various regulations pertaining to the Electricity Code and in the
administration of the Code. An amount of US$60,000 to meet the foreign
exchange part of the cost of the consulting services is included in the
proposed credit.
2.09      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government that
(a) the Electricity Code would be presented for enactment by Congress not
later than September 30, 1971, and (b) material amendments to the Code would
require prior agreement by the Association.
3. THE BENEFICIARY
Nature of Entity and Organization
3.01      ENDE was established by the Bolivian Government in February 1965
as a limited liability company to take over the assets and responsibilities
of the power division of Corporacion Boliviana de Fomento (CBF), the
government-owned development corporation. ENDE's Articles of Incorporation
fix its authorized capital at US$40 million, divided into 40,000 shares
with a nominal value of US$1,000 each. Of this authorized capital 15,000
shares were subscribed: one share each by Corporacion Minera de Bolivia
(COMIBOL) and Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) the
government-owned mining and oil company, and the remainder by CBF.
3.02      ENDE has a 6-man Board of Directors.  The Chairman of the Board
is selected by the President of the Republic from candidates proposed by
the shareholders. The other five members are elected by the shareholders.
All board members serve four years and are eligible for re-election. At
present the President of CBF is the Chairman and there are three Directors
appointed by CBF and one each appointed by COMIBOL and YPFB.
3.03      The General Manager, the chief executive of the company, is
appointed by the Board and can only be removed for cause. The present
General Manager is an experienced engineer and competent executive. He is
assisted by three department heads in charge of operation, administration
and finance, and engineering, respectively. For the last two years, ENDE
had contracted the services of two consultants from Harza Engineering (USA)
to head the operations department and to run the Corani Plant. After dis-
cussions with IDA, ENDE has recently signed a contract with Harza Engineering
to provide one consultant for another two years to head the operations depart-
ment and to train ENDE's staff. The General Manager and the operations
consultants have to be credited with the satisfactory development and
operation of ENDE. Its small staff still appears somewhat inexperienced and
the middle management especially requires strengthening. The IDB is consider-
ing the provision of funds for consultants to train ENDE's staff further.



-5-
3.04      Despite the weaknesses mentioned above, there is no question
about ENDE's ability to carry out the proposed project successfully while
at the same time continuing to serve its customers satisfactorily, as long
as a competent General Manager is in office. To assure this, an undertaking,
similar to the one given under Credit 61-BO, has been obtained that during
the life of the loan (to be made from the proceeds of the IDA credit by the
Government to ENDE) IDA will be consulted before appointments are made to
the position of General Manager.
Existing Facilities and Operations
3.05      In its Central System (which is connected to BPC's system in the
area) ENDE owns and operates the 27 MW Corani hydroelectric plant, 4 MW of
diesel plant and about 180 km of transmission lines, to supply power in bulk
to Empresa de Luz y Fuerza Electrica Cochabamba S.A. (ELFEC), the Cochabaiba
distribution company, and to the COMIBOL mines in the Catavi area. System
dispatching is straightforward, the pattern being to use the low cost hydro
energy first, the diesel plant which is relatively expensive to operate being
reserved for system peaks and standby purposes. The system annual load
factor is presently about 45%. This is low, but a gradual improvement is
expected (see paragraph 5.09). Maintenance of all plant is satisfactory.
3.06      Apart from the Central System, ENDE owns or controls facilities
in three other cities. In Santa Cruz, ENDE owns about 3 MW diesel-electric
capacity which is leased to Servicios Electricos de Santa Cruz, a former
division of CBF and for the time being administered by ENDE. In Sucre,
ENDE owns about 2 MW diesel-electric capacity of which 0.2 MW was leased
to a cement factory until the end of August 1968 and 1.8 MW is leased to
Cooperativa Electrica de Sucre S.A. In Tarija, ENDE supervises for CBF
the Servicio Electrico de Tarija which owns and operates the local dis-
tribution system and two generating plants: 0.9 MW diesel and 0.3 MW
hydro. In Potosi, ENDE acts as consultant on technical matters to the
Comite de Energia Electrica.
Accounts and Audit
3.07      ENDE keeps its accounts on a calendar year basis.  During 1967
ENDE modified its system of accounts to follow a somewhat simplified version
of t4e U.S. Federal Power Commission's Uniform System of Accounts but the
implementation has not been fully satisfactory.
3.08      During the appraisal it became apparent that ENDE's external
auditors, retained with approval of IDA (under Credit 61-BO) lack the account-
ing and public utility experience to give ENDE the guidance it needs and to
perform meaningful audits. It has been agreed during negotiations that ENDE
would appoint a different firm of independent auditors satisfactory to IDA.

Present Financial Position
3.09      Annex 1 shows summary balance sheets as of April 1, 1965 (opening
balance) and as of December 31, 1965 through 1968. The presentation of the
external auditors was rearranged to show more accurately ENDE's present
financial position but it proved impossible to restate properly ENDE's
1967 profit which appears to have been overstated by about 10 to 15% as
ENDE overestimated its 1967 income and underestimated its expenses. The
preliminary balance sheet as of December 31, 1968 can be summarized as
follows:

3.10      The assets are shown at cost and appear in general to be fairly
valued. Insurance coverage for the plant is adequate.
3.11      When ENDE was established it took over from CBF a participation
in Empresa de Luz y Fuerza Electrica Cochabamba S.A. (ELFEC), the Cocha-
bamba distributing company. This participation was increased and
supplemented by a loan when ENDE, under the IDA-IDB Corani 1964 agreements
provided the funds to ELFEC for distribution system extensions in Cochabamba.



- 7 -
As of December 31, 1968 ENDE held nearly 50% or $b 3.87 million of ELFEC's
share capital of $b 7.75 million and the loan outstanding was about $b 6
million. (For a short description of ELFEC and summary balance sheets and
income statements see Annex 2). ENDE does not intend to increase its share-
holdings in ELFEC but will lend the funds still required for distribution
system expansion. Investments of ENDE in associated companies totalled $b
16 million at the end of 1968. This included some investments in Tarija
and Sucre the form of which, equity or loans, has not yet been decided.
3.12      ENDE's current position was satisfactory at the end of 1968.  The
ample year-end cash and bank balance of $b 24 million was built up in pre-
paration for the large expenditures due under its investment program.
3.13      ENDE's capitalization as of the end of 1968 was $b 206 million
of which $b 164 million was equity and $b 42 million was debt, resulting
in a debt/equity ratio of 20/80.  Equity consists of direct capital
contributions by the Bolivian Government and CBF in the form of assets
and cash and includes the proceeds of the US$10 million IDA Credit 61-BO
(see paragraph 1.04). ENDE also receives, as equity contribution from the
Government, all debt service payments made by BPC to the Government under
Credit 62-BO.
3.14      The long-term debt (excluding 12 months' maturities) may be
summarized as follows:

Total Long-Term Debt                       41.85          3.49
3.15      Long-term debt comprised three loans, two of which had not been
fully drawn down:
(i) an IBD loan of US$3.4 million relent by the Government to
ENDE and made simultaneously with IDA Credit 61-BO, to help
finance the Corani Project;



-8-
(ii) a loan of US$6.3 million from the U.S. Agency for International
Development (U.S. AID) for the financing of generation and
distribution facilities in Santa Cruz (of this, about US$3.2
million will be relent by ENDE to the Santa Cruz distribution
company on the same terms and conditions as the U.S. AID loan);
and
(iii)  a loan of US$0.1 million from the Comite de Obras Publicas of
Santa Cruz, in lieu of payment for miscellaneous assets
transferred to ENDE.
3.16      During 1968 ENDE obtained a loan from IDB of about US$0.3 million
at 6% repayable over 7 years for the financing of a survey of water resources
for power plants in Bolivia. No withdrawals have yet been made.
3.17      The average weighted interest rate of the loans so far obtained
by ENDE is about 3%.
Past Earnings Records
3.18      A summary of ENDE's income statements for the years 1966-1968 is
given in Annex 3. Sales from the Corani plant which began on January 1,
1967, to ELFEC and on March 5, 1967, to COMIBOL reached 66 GWh in 1967 and
70 GWh in 1968. They were below the estimates given in the appraisal report
for Credit 61-BO because the output of the COMIBOL mines and hence their
demand for power was considerably below expectations; and, in the case of
Cochabamba, past unsatisfied demand, due to insufficient generating capacity,
was apparently not as big as estimated and development of small industries
not as rapid as expected. Operating revenues were therefore only about $b
13 million in 1967 and 14 million in 1968 compared to $b 34 million forecast
for each of these years. ENDE was nevertheless able to earn a return of
about 3.7% on net fixed assets in the two first years of full commercial
operations which in the circumstances can be considered acceptable.
Tariffs
3.19      Under Credit 61-BO the Government agreed that ENDE would obtain
tariffs which would enable it to earn a 9% return on the rate base. The
Electricity Code of July 1968 now incorporates the stipulation that all
power companies shall earn for each of their systems taken separately a
return of 9% calculated as an average for a period of three to five years.
The rate base is defined as average net fixed assets in operation plus
working capital (1/8 of the annual operating revenue) and materials (up
to 3% of tangible assets).  The adequacy of tariffs is reviewed annually
for each system by DINE and if the return expected for the forecast period
drops below 8.5% or exceeds 9.5% the tariffs are adjusted.
3.20      ENDE's tariffs for the existing Central System, which are based
on a demand charge and an energy charge, were authorized bv DINE in early
1967. They were calculated on the basis of forecasts for which no
historical data were available and were expected to give ENDE a 9% return



over the period 1967-1970 assuming that the Corani plant would be nearly
fully loaded in 1968. It is now apparent, however, that with the present
tariffs ENDE will be able to reach the average of 9% for the Central System
only over the 5 years through 1972. There are several reasons for this:
-    load growth was slower than expected (see paragraph 3.18);
-    1968 was an extremely wet year which allowed COMIBOL, ELFEC and
BPC to operate all their own hydro plants at capacity which
affected ENDE's sales to ELFEC and COMIBOL;
-    the final tariff, replacing an inadequate provisional one, for
ENDE's power supply to COMIBOL was negotiated only in September
1968 and subsequently authorized by DINE (see interconnection
agreement paragraph 3.21).
Interconnection Agreement
3.21      One of the conditions of Credits 61 and 62-BO was that ENDE and
BPC would sign an Interconnection Agreement to ensure efficient operations
of the facilities in the Central System and to cover tariffs to be charged
to COMIBOL. After unsuccessful negotiations DINE ruled in September 1968
on all matters in dispute and ENDE and BPC agreed to the rulings. This
arrangement is satisfactory to the Association.
4. THE PROJECT
Expansion Program
4.01      ENDE's four year expansion program 1969-1972 requires about US$31
million for additional generating and transmission facilities in its various
systems and for studies to prepare for the next stage of expansion. Annex
4 shows details of ENDE's investment program.
4.02      The program for ENDE's Central System includes the remaining
investments under Credit 61-BO, the construction of the Santa Isabel hydro-
electric scheme (the proposed IDA Project), and feasibility studies for
associated future extensions. ENDE intends to study also the possibility
of constructing a 20-30 MW hydro plant to supply power to a zinc smelting
plant under consideration by Empresa Nacional de Fundiciones.
4.03      In ENDE's other systems, the generating facilities in Santa Cruz
will be extended by a 13.3 MW dual fuel (diesel oil/gas) diesel plant in
1969, financed by U.S. AID. A further unit of 6.6 MW would be added in 1971.
In the Southern System, comprising Sucre and Potosi, it is intended to install
a 10 MW gas turbine plant in Sucre to be in operation by 1971, and to link
Potosi and Sucre by a 115 kV transmission line. IDB is expected to finance
the expansion of the Southern System.



- 10 -
4.04      ENDE intends to carry out studies of the most promising hydro
resources in the country. It appears that several power plants could be
constructed on -the Rio Grande with an aggregate capacity of at least 200 MW.
This scheme, appropriately staged, could supply power to ENDE's Central
System as well as the Santa Cruz and Southern Systems.
Description of the Project
4.05      The proposed Project consists of (a) the 34 MW Santa Isabel hydro-
electric plant, (b) a step-up substation and a 6.5 km long 115 kV transmission
line to connect the plant to the existing substation at Corani, (c) engineer-
ing services for supervision of the Project, (d) studies of future extensions
of the Corani and Santa Isabel plants and, (e) consultant services for DINE
(see paragraph 2.08). It would amount to some 34% of ENDE's 1969-1972 pro-
gram. A more detailed description of the Project is given in Annex 5. The
maps attached to this report show the location of the proposed hydroelectric
plant.
4.06      The physical features of the Project have been adequately inves-
tigated and construction should proceed without undue difficulties.
4.07      The Santa Isabel plant, using tailrace water of the Corani
plant, diverts water from the Corani river to the Santa Isabel river. A
small reservoir would be provided for the Santa Isabel plant.
Engineering
4.08      With IDA's agreement, ENDE engaged Motor Columbus of Switzerland
in September 1967 for the preparation of the final feasibility study, the
design, preparation of bidding documents and bid evaluation, and related
studies for the Project which are all financed under Credit 61-BO.
4.09      During negotiations an understanding has been reached that ENDE
will continue to employ consultants satisfactory to IDA for the supervision
of the construction of the proposed Project. ENDE's present plan is to
continue to employ Motor Columbus for this purpose. This would be satis-
factory and the foreign exchange cost would be financed from the proposed
credit.
4.10      The schedule for completion is tight.  Tunneling would be
critical as would be the supply and erection of turbines and generators
in view of transportation difficulties from a Pacific port to the site.
The invitations to bid for the Santa Isabel civil works and for the
electrical and mechanical plant have been issued recently. Contracts
are expected to be signed by mid 1969. Commercial operation of Santa
Isabel is scheduled for the beginning of 1972.

Estimated Cost of the Project
4.11      The project is expected to cost the equivalent of US$10.5 million.
A cost summary is shown below and in more detail in Annex 6.
Local    Foreign    Total   Local    Foreign    Total

4.12      The estimated cost for the civil works has been based on actual
prices for similar work on the Corani Project, which was completed in early
1967, taking into account the increase of prices and labor costs in
Bolivia since then. Nevertheless, in view of the nature of the work,
contingencies of 20% have been included for tunneling and of about 10% for
other civil works. Prices for electromechanical equipment have been based
on recent world market quotations with a contingency allowance of about
8% which is considered satisfactory. Contingencies of 5% for the penstock
and tunnel lining, have been included and should be adequate.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.13      The proposed credit would finance the foreign exchange cost of
the Project. Disbursement would be against the actual cost of goods and
services. Contracts financed by the proposed credit, other than consultants'
services, would be awarded in accordance with the Bank/IDA Guidelines for
international competitive bidding. No expenditures are expected to be made
prior to the date of the credit. Should the foreign exchange cost to complete
the Project be less than the estimate, any undisbursed amount of the proposed
credit would be cancelled unless there were good grounds for applying savings
to additional works.
5. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Power Market
5.01      As stated in paragraph 2.05, the Bolivian power market has been
divided since 1963 into two sections: (a) that served by BPC and (b) that
to be served by ENDE. The latter section also includes isolated under-
takings in which ENDE has an interest.



- 12 -
The Bolivian Power Company Market
5.02      The principal market served by BPC is the La Paz area where it
has an installed capacity of 64 MW. Since the inauguration of the
Chururaqui hydro plant (Credit 62-BO), power rationing has been eliminated
in La Paz. A 27 MW plant is now under construction downstream from the
Chururaqui plant to meet future demand.
5.03      In the Oruro area (Central System) BPC owns 21 MW of hydroelectric
capacity and serves the town of Oruro and COMIBOL mines. As BPC has agreed
with the Government not to expand its facilities in the Oruro area, any
future load growth will have to be met by ENDE.
The Empresa Nacional de Electricidad Market
5.04      ENDE has the responsibility for power generation and transmission
in all areas not served by BPC. ENDE's principal market is the Cochabamba-
Oruro area (Central System) where it supplies ELFEC in bulk, the Central
Group of COMIBOL mines, and several direct clients located along its trans-
mission facilities. As mentioned in paragraph 3.06 ENDE has also several
generating plants which it leases to the distribution companies in the
cities of Santa Cruz and Sucre which are not connected to ENDE's Central
System.
5.05      The characteristics of ENDE's Central System Market for 1968 are
shown below:
Sales
Customer                    (GWh)                     %
ELFEC Cochabamba            28.2                    40.0
COMIBOL                     42.0                    59.6
Others                       0.2                     0.4
Total                  70.4                   100.0
5.06      Information for forecasting the growth of demand for electric
power in the Central System, which would be supplied by the Santa Isabel
plant, is available from three market forecasts. The first forecast was
prepared in 1966 for ENDE by J.G. White Corporation of New York. This
forecast was later revised by ENDE showing more conservative estimates.
The latest forecast has been made by ENDE's Swiss consultants, Motor
Columbus, who prepared two estimates. One, the low forecast, is based
on the assumption that COMIBOL postpones indefinitely a major expansion
program of its industrial installations. The other, the high forecast,
takes into account an accelerated expansion program of COMIBOL in the
years 1969 and 1970.



- 13 -
5.07      The forecast adopted for this report follows the basic approach
used by Motor Columbus in its low forecast, modified to reflect the actual
situation at the beginning of 1969. It was established in discussions
with COMIBOL that it does not presently intend to embark on a major
expansion program in its central mining area. If, at a later stage,
COMIBOL should decide upon its expansion program, there would be sufficient
time for ENDE to install a gas turbine to cover the demand adequately since
the implementation of COMIBOL's program would require at least 18 months.
5.08      Forecasts of sales, gross generation and peak demand, and
required capacity, for the Central System, are shown in Annex 7. The
forecasts take into account sales and gross generation of BPC, which
company will not extend its facilities (see paragraph 5.03). The
average annual increase in sales for the Central System in the period
1968-1974 is expected to be about 11.8%.  In evaluating this forecast,
it should be noted that ELFEC's very old hydro facilities, capable of
supplying up to about 18 GWh per annum, are expected to be taken out of
operation after the commissioning of Santa Isabel while several large
consumers, such as a tire factory, cement plant, tin smelter and the YPFB
refinery, are expected to be connected in the next few years, aggregating
about 45 GWh in sales by 1972.
5.09      Since ENDE is to supply the total increase in demand for the
Central System, its gross generation is expected to increase by about 28%
in 1969 and 1970. The annual rate of increase then drops to about 11% by
1973. BPC's annual load factor would be about 60% and ENDE's load factor
is expected to rise gradually from 44% in 1967 to about 50% in 1973.
5.10      The forecast in Annex 7 shows the required capacity to meet
system demand as well as the present generation sources and the expected
capacity additions. Demand is expected to exceed firm capacity in 1969
and to exceed installed capacity by a small margin in 1971. ENDE has,
however, decided not to provide for these forecast deficits for the follow-
ing main reasons: (a) to install the necessary reserve capacity would be
beyond the financial capacity of ENDE, (b) the rate of load growth for
COMIBOL and some other direct consumers of ENDE is uncertain in view of the
low prices on the tin market. Plans are being made, however, to allow for
the installation of a 15 MW gas turbine on short notice, should the load
build up beyond expectations.
5.11      The sales forecasts for the outlying systems are also shown in
Annex 7. They are based for the Sucre-Potosi area on the forecasts prepared
by Harza Engineering, and for Santa Cruz by Kuljian of Philadelphia. How-
ever, forecasts for Santa Cruz have been reduced after discussion with ENDE
and those for the Sucre-Potosi system after discussion with the IDB appraisal
mission.



- 14 -
Least Cost Technical Choice
5.12      The available topographical information and stream gauging
records are not yet sufficient to consider other hydro plant as an alter-
native for Santa Isabel, although ENDE has started making a systematic
study of a number of resources. For this reason only a thermal plant has
been considered as an alternative. Although natural gas is produced in
Bolivia it is unlikely to be available in the Cochabamba area for some
years after 1972 when Santa Isabel is scheduled to be in operation. It
has therefore been assumed that a thermal alternative would use oil as
fuel.
5.13      It is estimated that the cost of fuel oil is about US$16 per
ton at the Pacific Coast. ENDE however has to pay some US$28 per ton to
the Yacemientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) for fuel oil and
it appears unlikely that YPFB will sell for less than this.
5.14      A comparison was made, using the discounted cash flow method,
between Santa Isabel and the thermal alternative taking into account the
alternative investments and operational costs. With a fuel price of US$
20 per ton, Santa Isabel is the least cost solution for discount rates
of up to 15%. With a fuel price of US$25/ton, the equalizing discount
rate would be about 17%.
Rate of Return of the Project
5.15      An attempt has been made to calculate the rate of return of the
proposed Project (for details see Annex 8). It was not possible to evalu-
ate all of the possible benefits and therefore the calculation was limited
to quantifying the incremental revenues, taking output at current tariffs,
which could be attributed to the proposed investment. A probability analy-
sis was included, assuming various degrees of uncertainty for all estimates.
The calculations show that the revenues from the new investment would yield
an expected minimum rate of return of about 15% and a maximum of about 19.5%,
which appears satisfactory.
6. FINANCING PLAN AND FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION
Proposed Financing Plan
6.01      Forecast Sources and Applications of Funds 1969-1972 are shown in
Annex 9. The forecast covers a period of high capital expenditures for ENDE
which during the four years to 1972 would increase its net fixed assets by
about 2.6 times over the end 1968 level. Expenditures for major new
construction following the proposed and other projects under consideration
(see Annex 4) have been provided in the financing plan which can be summariz-
ed as follows:

1/   Exclusive of $b 720,000 (US$60,000) for DINE
6.02      ENDE's internal cash generation is estimated on the basis of the
forecast income statements (see paragraph 6.05). The forecast long-term
debt includes the proposed IDA credit of US$7.34 million to be obtained in
1969 at an assumed annual interest rate of 6.5% for a term of 30 years
including a grace period of about four years; an IDB Loan of US$5.6 million
for the projects in ENDE's Southern System to be obtained also in 1969 at
an annual interest rate of about 6% for a term of 23 years including a
grace period of about three years; and the drawing of the existing IDA,
IDB and AID loans mentioned in paragraphs 3.15 and 3.16.



- 16 -
6.03      The equity contributions would come from the debt service payments
made by BPC under Credit 62-BO (paragraph 3.13) and would include also the
receipts from the funds still undisbursed under Credit 61-BO. The decrease
in working capital does not endanger ENDE's current position as about US$
2 million in cash had been accumulated to the end of 1968 in preparation
for the expansion program.
6.04      Total financial requirements including payments for studies
and surveys would be financed about 20% from internal cash generation
(after debt service) during the years 1969 through 1972. Internal
cash generation (after debt service) plus equity contributions and cash
resources would finance about 31% of financial requirements in the 1969-
1972 period. Although ENDE's contribution from internal cash generation
is on the low side due to the fact that ENDE is still a very young
company with a sizeable expansion program, the financing plan is accept-
able as internal cash generation is supplemented by equity contributions.
Future Earnings
6.05      Forecast income statements for the period 1969 through 1972 are
shown in Annex 10. For purposes of this forecast it is assumed that ENDE
would only be able to achieve the projected lower growth rate in sales
mentioned in paragraph 5.07. Tariffs (see Annex 11) have been taken as
existing or for future connections on a basis which would allow ENDE to
earn an average 9% return as provided by the Electricity Code. Rates in
ENDE's Central System are expected to remain on about the present level.
In the Santa Cruz and Sucre-Potosi systems tariff reductions were assumted
to take place in 1972 when capacity is more fully used. The operating
expenses were forecast in detail by consultants for ElNDE's different
systems and modified by IDA's staff. As reliable historical cost data do
not exist for either ENDE's Central System or the other systems, the
operating cost forecast may contain some margin of error. Costs were
conservatively calculated. The depreciation rates applied average 3.8%
which is adequate for ENDE's assets which in the next few years will
include heavy investments in dual fuel and gas engines for which a 15-year
life has been estimated.
6.06      Net income from operation would increase from $b 9.2 million in
1969, when operations in the Santa Cruz system are expected to begin, to
$b 30.1 million in 1972, the first year of operations of the Santa Isabel
plant. The aggregate return on ENDE's average rate base would increase from
5.5% in 1969 to 8.3% in 1972; and it is expected to rise to close to 9%
thereafter.
6.07      ENDE's investments in associated companies (see paragraph 3.11)
have not been taken into account in calculating either the rate base or
the rate of return. The return on ENDE's investments is low since the
associated companies are allowed to plow back part of their profits and
as they borrow from ENDE at the interest rates ENDE has to pay itself.



- 17 -
6.08      ENDE's income before interest charges would cover interest pay-
ments between 4.2 times in 1969 and 2.1 times in 1971, which is satisfactory.
The internal cash generation, increasing from $b 15.7 million in 1969 to
$b 45.0 million in 1972, covers total debt service on existing and assumed
future debts (for debt service requirements see Annex 12) between 4.6 and
2.5 times in the years 1969 through 1971. The debt service coverage then
drops to 2.1 times in 1972, reflecting the first repayments under the AID
and the proposed IDB loan; but this coverage is still satisfactory.
Future Financial Position
6.09      Forecast balance sheets for the period 1969 to 1972 are shown
in Annex 13. Total net fixed assets during these four years would in-
crease from $b 163 million as of the end of 1968 to $b 453 million at the
end of 1972, or by about 175%. ENDE's equity would nearly double during
this period reaching $b 260 million and outstanding long-term debt would
increase more than 6.5 times to $b 272 million causing a change in the
debt/equity ratio from 20/80 to 51/49 which is still satisfactory.
6.10      During negotiations for Credit 61-BO a debt limitation covenant
was agreed upon in the form of an earnings test which allows ENDE to incur
debt on appropriate terms as long as its earnings for a past 12 month
period would cover maximum future debt service 1.5 times. On the basis
of this ratio ENDE would presently not be able to incur the debt assumed
in the financing plan. Account must be taken, however, of the fact that
ENDE has just started operations and therefore has a rather low income but
a substantial expansion program. This debt limitation was waived for the
proposed IDA Credit and IDB Loan under consideration. It was agreed that
the earnings test as described above would be repeated in the proposed
Credit Agreement and be applied to any future borrowing by ENDE. Also an
undertaking was obtained similar to that under Credit 61-BO that, except
as IDA shall otherwise agree, ENDE shall not undertake or execute, for its
own account or for the account of any other party or parties, any major
power projects or developments other than the Project and the IDB project
for the southern zone.
6.11      ENDE's working capital position is expected to be satisfactory.
Accounts receivable have been assumed at a level of about two months
average sales which should be conservative.
6.12      ENDE's present financial position offers an adequate basis for
the proposed project. In order to assure that satisfactory earnings are
maintained, IDA has obtained a commitment from ENDE that it will take all
steps necessary to obtain tariffs which would allow an average return of
9% as provided for in the Electricity Code. The Government has undertaken
to allow ENDE to obtain the return provided in the Electricity Code.

7. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The p-roposed Santa Isabel project is needed to meet reasonable
load growth projections in ENDE's Central System; it is well planned and
consultants acceptable to the Association have been engaged to assist in
its execution. The project is the least cost solution to meet demand and
its internal rate of return would be between about 15% and 19.5%.
7.02      ENDE should experience no problems in carrying out the project
as long as a competent General Manager is in office and experienced con-
sultants are retained.
7.03      ENDE's present and forecast financial position is satisfactory.
Debt service coverage would range between 4.6 and 2.1 times on existing
and assumed future debt and the aggregate return on the rate base would
range between 5.5 and 8.3% in the 1969-1972 period and an improvement is
expected thereafter.
7.04      During negotiations the following undertakings were obtained:
i) Consultants would be employed by DINE for at least
another two years (paragraph 2.08);
ii) The Electricity Code would not be materially amended without
prior approval of IDA and would be presented for enactment
by Congress not later than September 30, 1971 (paragraph 2.09);
iii) ENDE would consult IDA prior to appointments to the position
of General Manager (paragraph 3.04);
iv) ENDE would continue to employ experienced consultants
satisfactory to IDA to supervise construction of the Project
(paragraph 4.09):
v) ENDE would only incur long term debt without the approval of
IDA, if its maximum future annual debt service is covered at
least 1.5 times by past net revenues (paragraph 6.10);
vi) ENDE would not undertake or execute any major power projects
without approval of IDA (paragraph 6.10); and
vii)  The Government would cause ENDE to be granted tariffs which
would enable it to earn an average rate of return of 9% as
provided for in the Electricity Code; ENDE would take all
steps to obtain tariffs which would allow this return
(paragraph 6.12).
7.05      Following negotiations an agreement was reached between the
Government and the Bolivian Power Company Ltd. regarding the debt settlement.
This agreement is satisfactory to the Association.



- 19 -
7.06      The project would provide a suitable basis for a Credit of US$7.4
million equivalent of which the Government would relend (a) US$ 7.34 million
to ENDE at 6.5X. interest and for a tenm of 30 years including a grace period
of about 4 years, and (b) the balance of up to US$ 60,000 to DINE on terms to
be agreed upon between the Government and DINE.

General Infortnation
1.          ELFEC serves the city of Cochabamba, its suburbs and some
nearby villages. It owns and operates three small hydroelectric plants
with a total capacity of 5.8 MW, about 70 km of 30 kV transmission lines
and a 10 kV/220 V distribution network.
2.          ELFECts share capital is owned by ENDE (49.99%), the
municipality of Cochabamba (33.50%), and private investors (16.51%).
3.          ELFEC went through many years of financial difficulties.
No dividends were paid from 1954 to 1966 when ELFEC resumed the pay-
ments with a 7.3% dividend followed by a 52 dividend in 1967.
4.          After a revaluation of assets, ELFEC's balance sheet as of
the end of 1967 shows a satisfactory situation: The debt/equity ratio
was 32/68 and the current ratio 3.3:1.
5.          Since the beginning of 1967, EMDE's Corani plant is
providing pcwer to ELFEC, bringing to an end the power rationing in
Cochabamba. In June 1967 DINE aDproved ELFECts new tariffs which should
yield ELFEC about a 9% returr on the rate base.

SANTA ISABEL PROJECT
DESCRIPTIOiN OF THE PROJECT
1. The Project
The project would comprise a 34 HUd hydroulectric plant
including substation and a short transmission line to connect the Plant
to the existing Corani Substation.
2. General Description
The Santa Isabel hydroelectric plant wfill be located about 70 km
north-east of Cochabamba. It would utilize the tailrace water of the
Corani plant which has an 82 million cubic meter regulating reservoir.
At a later stage of development it will also utilize the waters of the
tributaries of the Santa Isabel river.
3. Yiain Data and Outline Description
(i) Gross/average net head         863/839 m
'iated Discharge               5 m3/s
Installed capacity        =    2 x 17 NW
Energy capability         =    139 GIJh/per annum
(ii) Compensating reservoir - Between the Corani tailrace and Santa
Isabel intake a compensating reser-voir will be constructed wTith
a storage volume of 72,000 i3.
(iii) Pressure tunnel - Between intake and surge tank, the tunnel
will be about 3,500 m long, with a 3 36o grade and a diameter of
2.20 m.
(iv) Pressure shaft - the inclined part of the steel lined pressure
shaft (at an 80% grade or about 40 degrees to the horizontal)
will be about 510 m long, the horizontal part about 300 m long;
the diameter will be l.0 m.
(v) Penstock - the length of the penstock will be about 2,600 m
(at a 20% grade or about 11 degrees to the horizontal), with
an inner diameter diminishing from 1.25 m to 1.15 m.



ANNX 5

(vi) Turbines - two horizontal shaft, single wheel, two jets Pelton,
at average net head of 855 m, 750 revs per minute.
(vii) Generators - Each 21 IMVA at 10 kV and 50 cps with distribution
transformer grounded neutral; each unit connected to a 21 MVA
10/115 kV air cooled transformer which will be executed with
a tertiary winding for station supply.
(viii) House supply - 220/380 V, 50 cps and auxiliary batteries.
(ix) Control - the Santa Isabel Plant will mainly be controlled
from Corani by means of a tele-metering, tel-prottactidn and tele.
control system.
(x) Transmission line - double circuit lattice type steel towers
on which initially one circuit will be mounted. The line,
with a length of 6.5 km will have a nominal rating of 138 kV
but be operated at 115 kV.
(xi) Connection to the existing system - the Santa Isabel substation
will be of consorvative design writh 2 transformer feeders, outgoing
feeder to Corani, incoming feeder form future plants and 2
spare bays.  At the Corani side, to connect the incoming Santa
Isabel line, a circuit breaker only will be needed with
associated electrical and metering equipment.

Santa Isabel Project
Internal Rate of Return
1.         The following variables are taken into account to  forecast
the probability distribution of the internal rate of return.
- capital expenditures
- operating expenses
- energy sales in GWh
- sales price per Zilh
2.         The table on page 2 presents the average annual values of
the four variables, for the assumed life of the project.
3.         Making allowance for unbalanced disbursements and the
Dossibility that total construction cost could be t10% on either side
of the estimate, discrete probabilities wiere assumed for four schedules
of disbursements and for three uncorrelated schedules of cost between
the +10% and -10% limits of construction cost.
4.         Operating expenses are assumed to increase annually by 3%,
with a possible error of +0.3% and -0.3%, with a discrete probability
of 20% for both the highest and the lowest estimate and 60% for the
avera ,e.
5.         Since ENDE started operation recently (February 1967),
historical data are lacking to forecast correlation between calculated
proceeds from tariffs and actual proceeds. For this reason, and
because this is a difficult relation to establish, energy sales in
GWh (attributable to the project) and the sales price per KW!h were
assumed to be uncorrelated. For both a range of four discrete
probabilities were assumed on the basis of the missions findings and
discussions with ENDE.
6.         The table on page 3 shows the distribution of the combined
probability P(R) and the expected internal rate of return R(%) of the
project. The mean rate of return is expected to be 17.2% and the
standard deviation about 1.10%. This would give a range of about 15%
to 19.5% in the internal rate of return.

to Santa Isabel may rise by 3 t0.3% annually.
3/  Based on the expteted operating regime under various conditions of demand,
it is assumed that these average annual sales, attributable to Santa
Isabel, may vary in the fifth year (first year of op.,ration) by about
+25% and -25% decreasing to +1% and -1% in the 10th year and onward.
4/ It is assumed that the average annual sales prices may vary between +5%
and -5%.
