REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE M RECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE GUAYAQUIL PORT AUTHORITY
WITH THE GUARANTEE (F THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR
FOR A SECOND PORT OF WUAYAQUIL PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Guayaquil Port Authority with the guarantee of the Republic
of Ecuador for the equivalent of US$33.5 million to help finance a second
Port of Guayaquil project. The loan would have a term of 24 years, inclu-
ding 4 years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Ecuador: Economic Memorandum" (No.1033-EC)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on February 26, 1976. Annex I
summarizes the main economic and social indicators.
3.        With the first shipments of crude oil from the Oriente Region in
1972, Ecuador became a net exporter of oil.  This provided the country with
additional resources which at least temporarily removed the savings and
foreign exchange constraints that had severely impeded Ecuador's growth in
the past. Oil income rose from $38 million in 1972 to over $420 million
in 1974. However, during the last year it has become clear that the coun-
try's oil wealth is smaller than previously estimated. One year ago, it
was estimated that the country had total -- proven and probable -- oil
reserves equivalent to 5.7 billion barrels. Current estimates are of only
2.5 billion barrels, owing to a substantial decline in the calculation of
probable exploitable reserves. Moreover, it is now expected that the
production levels projected last year for 1976 will not be achieved until
the early 1980s. These revised estimates, together with a better knowledge
of the difficulties to be encountered in the exploitation of Ecuador's
untapped oil fields, and with the transitory problems faced by the country's
oil exports in 1974-75, indicate that Ecuador is not likely to accumulate
substantial amounts of foreign exchange reserves in the foreseeable future.
4.        There has been a sharp decline in petroleum output since mid-
1974 because of marketing difficulties for Ecuadorian crude in export
markets and a protracted disagreement between the Government and the
foreign concessionaires over the taxation of oil exports. The total off-
take of oil dropped from an average 232,000 b/d during January-June 1974
to 123,000 b/d during the second half of 1974, and became irregular in
1975, owing to two breaks in the trans-Andean pipeline. For 1975, the
average production is estimated at about 165,000 b/d. There has also
been a virtual standstill in exploration during the past two years and
the level of proven recoverable reserves, estimated at 1.5 billion barrels,
has remained unchanged.

5.       The disappointing performance of the petroleum sector had not
been expected by the Government. Counting on rising petroleum income,
the Goverment had adopted policies designed to stimulate further growth.
It increased public expenditures -- including subsidies of essential
consumption goods --, offered more generous credit programs for agricul-
tural and industrial investment, and lifted most quantitative import
restrictions. In 1974., import duties were cut by an average of 34 percent.
Moreover, imports of agricultural inputs and of essential foodstuffs were
fully exempted from duties.
6.       The response of the economy to these policies, and to the pre-
vailing very optimistic economic climate was, in general, strong. Gross
investment grew by 22 percent in real terms in 1973 and growth of GDP at
market prices reached a rate of about 15 percent, far above historical
levels. Continuing rapid growth in industry, construction, trade and
Government services, made it possible to achieve an overall GDP growth
rate of approximately 8 percent in 1974. This was obtained in spite of
the significant decline in the oil sector product, and of the virtual
stagnation of agricultural production -- which was hampered, until early
that year, by the insufficiency of credit availabilities and by the inade-
quate price policies followed up to then by the Government.
7.       The rapid economic expansion was accompanied by inflationary
pressures. The cost of living index for low and medium-income families in
Quito, which had risen by about 8 percent per anumm during 1971 and 1972,
increased by 13 percent during 1973 and by over 23 percent during 1974.
While the inflationary pressure was largely generated by the rapid rise of
public expenditure, the strong expansion of credit to the private sector
also contributed to the increasing money supply. Domestic supply could
not respond in full to the growth in demand, which led to higher imports
of wheat, oils and fats, and other products. In construction materials,
domestic production did not keep pace with increases in demand. In
manufacturing, the process of import substitution of finished goods
accelerated, leading to rapidly rising imports of equipment, raw materials
and semi-finished products. As a result, total imports of goods and non-
factor services rose from about $440 million in 1972 to $515 million in
1973 and over $1.0 billion in 1974. This import growth in part also
reflects a rise in import prices of 17 percent in 1973 and 28 percent in
1974. Exports -- also including non-factor services -- e-xpanded from
$365 million in 1972 to about $1.1 billion in 1974. Of the increase,
about 75 percent was accounted for by petroleum.
8.       Despite the growth of imports, Ecuador's balance of payments
showed, until mid-1974, a marked improvement. In 1973, Ecuador achieved
the first surplus in its resource balance since the early 1950s, and net
foreign exchange reserves rose from $128 million at the end of 1972 to
$371 million by the end of June 1974. However, these favorable trends
could not be maintained after mid-1974. As oil exports declined and total
imports continued to rise substantially, Ecuador's reserve position began
to deteriorate rapidly. By August 15, 1975, the country's net foreign
exchange reserves had fallen to $181 million, equivalent to less than two
months' imports.



- 3 -
9.        Until 1974L, increasing oil revenues brought about a substantial
improvement of the Government's financial position. For the Central
Government /1 -- which received about 54 percent and 57 percent of total
oil revenues in 1973 and 1974 respectively -- these revenues led to a
strong increase in current savings and to an expansion of capital expendi-
ture substantially above the growth of current expenditure. With current
savings rising to about $68 million in 1973 and $298 million in 1974, the
overall cash position of the Central Government turned from a small deficit
in 1973 to a $62 million surplus in 1974, despite a more than threefold
increase in capital expenditure in 1974. FONADE, established in late 1973
in an effort to earmark part of the additional oil revenues for the finan-
cing of public investment projects over and above budgetary allocations,
disbursed about $93 million in 1974. Most of these disbursements helped
finance the construction of the Esmeraldas refinery, and the credit pro-
grams of the National Development Bank and other financial institutions.
As a result of the decline of oil revenues, current savings decreased by
an estimated 20 percent in 1975 despite an-improved performance of non-
oil taxes. These developments led to a temporary financing gap in the
Central Government operations and to the decision to contain the growth
of Government expenditure in 1976.
10.       A number of recent measures have contained the deterioration of
the balance of payments, and foreign exchange reserves are estimated to
have totalled about $245 million by the end of 1975. The measures included
a reduction of the tax-paid cost of petroleum exports by the equivalent of
about US$0.43 per barrel; the concession of higher allowances to oil com-
panies for their production cost; and the introduction of import restric-
tions in August and September 1975. Oil production has recovered, mainly
as a result of the cut-back in the income tax rate on oil exports, and is
estimated to have reached over 210,000 b/d towards the end of 1975.
11.       On October 2, 1975, the Govenument announced new financial objec-
tives for 1976: to achieve additional increases in foreign exchange reserves
and a more balanced budgetary position, which would make it unnecessary for
the Government to borrow further substantial amounts from the domestic
banking system during 1976. The Government hopes to reduce the annual rate
of inflation from some 15 percent in 1975 to about 10 percent in 1976.
Further negotiations with the oil companies are expected to open the way
to increased exploration and development efforts.
12.       Ecuador's oil production is now expected to increase gradually
and to reach about 270,000 b/d by 1979-80. An expansion beyond this level
appears feasible, provided that a vigorous exploration and development
program can be brought underway in the near future. Increasing export
earnings from petroleum, coffee, sugar and manufactured goods, combined
with a net inflow of foreign capital in the order of $265 million a year
/1 Including the National Development Fund (FONADE) and the National
Participation Fund.



- 4 -
during 1976-80 -- needed largely to finance new gas and oil-related
ventures -- should make a substantial improvement of the overall balance
of payments situation possible after 1976, and permit a moderate increase
in foreign exchange reserves. The extent to which Ecuador's balance of
payments situation will actually improve depends largely on the success
of immediate stabilization policies, the development of oil production,
the behavior of oil prices, and the mobilization of foreign capital.
13.       Although the oil sector will continue to be the major source of
foreign exchange in the medium term, there are considerable uncertainties
with respect to the possible production profile of this sector in the
longer run. Most of the oil likely to be produced until the early 1980s
has already been found. Unless exploration efforts are substantially
stepped up and new oil fields are discovered, production could decline
soon afterwards. To make the most efficient use of oil revenues the
Government therefore intends to begin to diversify the production base
of the economy by developing agricultural and industrial activities in
which the country has a potential comparative advantage. Exports other
than oil need to be developed -- for example, natural gas, and agricul-
tural and forest resources. An appropriate use of the financial resources
provided by oil will also make it possible to alleviate the country's most
pressing social needs. However, Ecuador continues to be one of the poorest
countries in Latin America, with an estimated per capita income of $450 in
1974, and a large proportion of the ponulation living at subsistence levels.
Oil has only shifted Ecuador from the upper strata of the poorest countries
to the lower brackets of the middle income developing countries.
14.       Several years ago the Government designed an ambitious develop-
ment strategy. It is reflected in the 1973-77 Plan Integral de Trans-
formacion y Desarrollo and focuses on (a) promoting the diversification
of the economy by fostering agricultural and industrial development;
(b) alleviating poverty in the countryside through rural development pro-
grams; (c) upgrading social services; (d) expanding infrastructure; and
(e) improving the absorptive capacity by overcoming major bottlenecks to
development, notably the shortage of qualified manpower and the adminis-
trative weakness of the public sector.
15.       To pursue these broad objectives, efforts have been made to
improve the investment capacity of the public sector. In 1973, a preinvest-
ment fund (FONAPRE) was set up to finance prefeasibility and feasibility
studies. Inventories of projects and project ideas were compiled in the
public sector. Also the Government has been able to increase public invest-
ment rapidly. However, progress has been slow in sectoral planning --
particularly in setting investment priorities in some major sectors -- and
in the coordination of investments by region.
16.       Ecuador's development needs, as well as persistent structural and
institutional weaknesses, call for continued external assistance. Although
the country's creditworthiness has improved greatly, it would not be sound



- 5 -
policy for Ecuador to rely on the capital market as the sole source of
external finance. Neither the amounts nor the terms available to Ecuador
in the market would make this advisable. Rather, a mixture of commercial
and official financing will best suit Ecuador's needs during the next few
years.
17.       Ecuador is creditworthy for further lending on Bank terms. The
external public debt outstanding on December 31, 1974 was estimated at
US$530 million, of which US$297 million was disbursed. Service on out-
standing public debt is relatively moderate -- about $85 million in 1975,
equivalent to about 8 percent of the exports of goods and non-factor
services. The debt service ratio is projected to fall to approximately
4 percent in 1979-80. The Bank/IDA share in outstanding and disbursed
public debt as of December 31, 1974 was about 19.7 percent; it is expected
to rise to about 25 percent by 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ECUADOR
18.       Starting with the first loan in 1954, the Bank and IDA have made
sixteen loans and six credits to Ecuador totalling US$171.5 million, net
of cancellations. At March 31, 1976, the Bank and IDA held about US$11 3.2
million including about US$44.6 million not yet disbursed.  The most
recent loans, to finance projects for technical assistance, seed produc-
tion and highways were approved by the Executive Directors on March 30,
1976 and have not yet been signed; therefore their aggregate amount --
US$17.5 million -- is not included in the total amount held by the Bank
and IDA. IFC has made five loans and investment commitments in Ecuador,
two in a large textile company and three in a development finance company,
amounting to Us$4.3 million of which, as of March 31, 1976, US$2.7
million has been repaid, sold, terminated or cancelled. In addition, IFC
is considering a loan to help finance the expansion of sugar production
in the Guayas Province area and a loan and an equity investment for a
plYwood mill near Esmeralda-s. Execution of Bank Grup financed projects
has, on the whole, been satisfactory, even though it has not been free of
difficulties often caused by the insufficiency of the country's managerial
and technical resources -- a constraint that still is a major obstacle for
Ecuador's economic and social development. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and ZFC investments as of March 31,
1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
19.       Bank and IDA lending were originally concentrated in transpor-
tation and power, where there were substantial deficiencies to be overcome.
These two sectors still account, respectively, for about 36 percent and 10
percent of total past lending. Most of the lending for transportation was
to improve the road network of the country, although one loan was made to
help finance a new port in Guayaquil (FY59). Lending for power has been
concentrated in improving generation and distribution facilities in Quito.
The first livestock development loan (FY67) marked the beginning of a



- 6 -
diversification of lending; since then, the Bank and IDA have made six
more loans and credits for agriculture and fisheries, two loans to
support industrial development through two development finance companies,
two loans for education and one loan for water supply. Bank/IDA assis-
tance for the production and social sectors account now for about 54
percent of total lending.
20.       External development financing has also been provided by IDB
and USAID and, to a lesser extent, by other bilateral sources. External
financing by sector and by source through 1974 is summarized below:

IDB is the largest single lender, having extended most of its loans to
Ecuador from the Fund for Special Operations, which has normally carried
a 2 percent interest rate, a ten-year grace period, and repayment terms
of up to forty years. It is likely that IDB will remain the major develop-
ment lender in the immediate future, although the terms will be less con-
cessionary than in the past. USAID loans generally have had amortization
and grace periods similar to those of IDB, with interest at 2-3 percent.
Education, health and other socially oriented activities, as well as agri-
cultural development, have been receiving increasing attention from the
external lending agencies in recent years. IDB, USAID and the Bank Group
have coordinated their efforts in these fields to assure the most effective
use of all available resources.
21.       Bank lending is aimed at supporting the Government priorities
outlined in Part I above. This objective will be met by emphasizing
projects that will help strengthen the institutional framework for develop-
ment policy -- particularly concerning project planning, preparation and
implementation -- in agriculture and rural development, transportation and
other high priority activities. The second Port of Guayaquil project will
substantially complete an important stage of the Bank's involvement in
Ecuador's transport sector. This project -- as well as the recently



- 7 -
approved fourth highway project -- is designed to help the Government to
establish the administrative mechanisms and technical procedures required
for designing and implementing appropriate policies and investment projects
in the sector during future years, while assisting also in the overcoming
of some major transportation bottlenecks.
22.       Beyond those two transportation projects, the current Bank pro-
gram is primarily concentrated on agricultural and rural development. The
Bank can undertake a major institution-building effort in these fields,
which should yield tangible benefits for Ecuador. Agriculture is, at the
same time, the most important and the most neglected sector of the Ecua-
dorian economy. Its potential is far from being adequately realized and
its low productivity is a main cause of the extreme poverty in which most
of the Ecuadorian population still lives. The current Bank program includes
a substantial support for integrated rural development projects and impor-
tant assistance for the development of the country's agricultural potential.
All projects programmed for this sector include sizable technical assistance
components, as a major part of the overall institution-building effort
referred to above. This is reflected particularly in the projects for
certified seed production and for technical assistance in the field of
rural development which the Executive Directors approved on March 30, 1976.
Other projects in this sector planned for the next two years include one
agricultural credit, one irrigation and two rural development projects.
Moreover, most of the other projects currently under consideration - for
instance, rural roads, rural electrification and agro-industries -- are
also related to the major objectives referred to above for agriculture
and rural development.
PART III - THE PORTS SUB-SECTOR IN ECUADOR
23.       Ecuador's four main seaports -- Guayaquil, Puerto Bolivar, Manta
and Esmeraldas - handle 98 percent of the country' s external trade.
Traffic at those ports (excluding petroleum products) has increased from
2.15 million tons in 1969 to 2.94 million tons in 1974. There are also
two important oil terminals: one at Balao, near Esmeraldas, which is the
export point for crude from the Oriente fields and where a refinery is
being built; the other one is at La Libertad, which receives crude oil for
two near-by refineries dating back to the oil import days. There are also
minor ports at San Lorenzo and Bahia de Caraquez, and fishing port facili-
ties at Manta and Posorja.
24.       Since the days of the Spanish conquest, Guayaquil has been the
most important port of Ecuador. The original port was located on the
Guayas River estuary, some 80 km. from the sea. New facilities -- partly
financed with a $13 million loan from the Bank (No.212-EC, FY59) were built
during 1958-63 on a tidal inlet, some 4 km. south of the original location,
to accommodate ships of a larger size and draft.   The Guayaquil Port



- 8 -
Authority (GPA) was created in 1958 to operate the new facilities. As an
autonomous agency, it was given broad powers to conduct its operations,
including the power to establish its own tariffs and salary levels which
attracted qualified staff. Its overall management was entrusted to a
board of directors composed of a chairman, appointed by the President of
the Republic, three Government representatives and three representatives
of business and local interests; day-to-day operations were the responsi-
bility of the general manager. The Bank's association with that project
and with the creation of GPA afforded it an opportunity to familiarize
itself with the problems and institutional aspects of Ecuador's ports
sub-sector and the plans for the expansion of ports infrastructure and
to maintain over the years a continuing dialogue with the Ecuadorian
authorities concerning these matters.
25.       The organization described above operated the new port success-
fally for a number of years. However, a 60 percent increase in expenses
(mainly personnel costs) during 1968-69 brought about serious financial
problems for GPA; it sought and obtained financial assistance from the
Government which, in turn, decided to reorganize port administration on
a nation-wide basis. This resulted in the creation of (a) the National
Council of Merchant Marine and Ports, as a policy making body with broad
representation of concerned government departments, (b) the Merchant
Marine Directorate (DIMERC), as a regulatory and supervisory agency
reporting to the Navy's General Commander, and (c) the National Ports
Department, a division of IEMERC in charge of port matters. This whole
institutional set-up was placed under the aegis of the Ministry of
Defense and given responsibility for the formulation and implementation
of port policy in the country. Under this arrangement, GPA's autonomy
was markedly reduced.
26.       Lately, however, the Government's policy has gradually shifted
towards restoring a degree of autonomy to the Port Authorities which
would be compatible with their operational efficiency and with the
necessary safeguards and controls for the Government. Recently enacted
legislation has resulted in a streamlined institutional organization for
the ports sub-sector which leaves its regulation in the hands of the
Council and DIMERC alone. The Port Authorities have been given power to
organize their day-to-day operations according to their own specific
local problems and to conduct studies for the improvement, of their opera-
tions. In general terms, the new legislation provides a balance of powers
between the Government agencies and the operating Port Authorities which
would afford the latter a more flexible operational environment without
detriment to reasonable Central Government controls.
27.       Original forecasts of pcrt traffic growth indicated the need for
an expansion of port facilities at Guayaquil in the early 1980s. This
need, however, has been accelerated since 1973 by the increase of imports
resulting from increased oil revenues. This sudden change in operating
conditions caught GPA unprepared. The Port suffered heavy congestion
which led three shipping conferences to impose surcharges of up to US$6 per
ton of cargo handled at Guayaquil. In addition to earlier than antici-
pated increases in traffic volumes, the main causes of this congestion



were low storage charges, long periods of free storage available to
importers and cumbersome cargo clearance procedures. Recently, however,
the free storage period was reduced, the storage charges were increased
almost five-fold and GPA and the Government adopted several measures to
expedite the clearance of goods. As a result, cargo clearance time was
reduced from 45 days at the time of appraisal to an estimated 18 days in
November 1975. Two of the shipping conferences have already removed their
surcharges and the third is expected to do likewise in the near future.
There is, however, room for additional improvement in the handling of cargo
at Guayaquil and both GPA and the Government have agreed on a series of
specific measures,to be adopted during the execution of the project, con-
cerning the operation of the proposed bulk cargo terminal and further
adjustments in storage tariffs designed to encourage prompt removal of
goods from the port area. (See Sections 3.04 and 4.05 of the draft Loan
Agreement and Section 3.03 of the draft Guarantee Agreement.) In addition,
GPA has agreed to retain the services of port operation experts to be
engaged by the end of 1976 to advise its management on day-to-day opera-
tions (see Section 3.05 of the draft Loan Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       The proposed project would be the Bank Group's second operation
in Ecuador's ports sub-sector. This project has been prepared on the
basis of a feasibility study made by Messrs. Palmer and Baker (U.S.A.),
engineering consultants to GPA, as modified during the oourse of appraisal.
The appraisal was conducted in May-June 1975. Negotiations were held in
Washington from January 26 to 30, 1976, at which time GPA was represented
by its Acting General Manager, Capt. Tomas Leroux and the Government was
represented by Mr. Manuel Calisto. An appraisal report on the project
(947a-EC) is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A
summary statement on the proposed project and loan is contained in Annex
III to this Report.
General Description
29.       The proposed project would include:
(a) The construction of (i) three alongside deep-water berths for
container and general cargo traffic, four transit sheds, open
storage areas and associated facilities; and (ii) a bulk cargo
terminal comprising one alongside deep-water berth and mechanized
storage and loading facilities for sugar, wheat, molasses and
edible oils;
(b) The relocation of the existing small boat moorings;
(c)  The acquisition of cargo handling and workshop equipment; and



- 10 -
(d) The provision of technical assistance to (i) improve port
operations; (ii) carry out a training program for shore labor,
stevedores and equipment operators; and (iii) manage the pro-
posed bulk terminal for two years and train GPA staff to
operate and maintain it thereafter.
The proposed project constitutes the least-cost solution to the present
need for additional berthing and cargo handling capacity at Guayaquil.
With the proposed expansion, the port of Guayaquil could handle forecast
traffic through the mid-1980s, depending on the trend of containerization.
However, given the relative uncertainty of traffic forecasts and the
economies of scale attainable in construction, the Bank has agreed with
GPA on the inclusion in the bidding documents of an option to construct a
fourth general cargo berth. GPA would not begin such construction before
parts (a) and (b) of the above project are completed, unless its economic
justification has been demonstrated to the Bank and arrangements satis-
factory to the Bank have been made for its financing (see Section 3.08 of
the draft Loan Agreement).
30.       In line with the Bank strategy outlined in paragraph 21, the
purpose of the proposed project is two-fold. First, to improve the insti-
tutional and operating conditions at the Port of Guayaquil. The measures
agreed with GPA and the Government (see paragraph 27), and the recently
enacted legislation (see paragraph 26), are likely to contribute substan-
tially toward improving port operations at Guayaquil. It is hoped that
these measures eventually would be extended to other ports. Moreover, the
project includes technical assistance designed to expedite cargo handling
further, to train GPA staff to operate the new balk terminal, and to train
port labor. Second, to provide additional berths and facilities to relieve
the existing congestion caused by earlier than anticipated traffic growth,
and to handle forecast increases in cargo traffic.
Execution
31.       Project execution is expected to start around August 1976 and it
is expected to require about three years to be completed. Responsibility
for the execution of the project would rest with GPA, with the assistance
of consultants to be retained on conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Provision has been made for engineering consulting services which would
include about 192 man-months of expatriate staff and 348 man-months of
local staff at an average cost of US$5,700 and US$2,100 per man-month
respectively. Technical assistance to operate the proposed bulk cargo
terminal initially and to train GPA's staff to take over this task is
estimated to require 120 man-months of specialists' services at an
average cost of U $4,000 per man-month.
Project Cost and Financing
32.       The total cost of the project, including taxes and import duties,
has been estimated at US$83.6 million equivalent. This estimate is based
on bids received by mid-March 1976 and includes US$3.0 and US$13.4 million,



- 11 -
respectively, for physical and price contingencies. The estimated foreign
exchange component represents 68 percent of total costs and would amount to
US$56.7 million equivalent.
33.       GPA is expected to be able to finance all local costs (estimated
at about US$26.9 million equivalent) and about US$3.2 million of the esti-
mated foreign exchange costs, out of its internal cash generation. The
balance of the foreign exchange component would be financed in part by the
proposed US$33.5 million Bank loan (59 percent). In addition it has been
agreed that GPA would be provided with US$20.0 million as follows: (a) a
US$10.0 million Government loan -- which is expected to be disbursed during
1979 -- on terms not less favorable than those of the proposed Bank loan;
and (b) as a condition of effectiveness, another US$10.0 million Government
loan -- which is expected to be disbursed over the project construction
period, starting in 1976 -- on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank (see Sections 7.01(a) and 7.02(a) of the draft Loan Agreement and
Section 2.02(a) of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
34.       The Government and GPA are currently negotiating with a private
foreign bank a US$10.0 million medium-term loan, within a co-financing
framework which would enable GPA to obtain better terms than those it
could have obtained by itself in the international financial markets.
The loan would be guaranteed by the Republic of Ecuador. If these nego-
tiations were satisfactorily concluded within a reasonable time after
approval of the proposed Bank loan by the Executive Directors, the second
US$10.0 million Government loan (paragraph 33(b) above) would not be
required. In that event, the Loan and Guarantee Agreements between the
Bank and, respectively, GPA and the Republic of Ecuador, would require
amendments to reflect the co-financing arrangements with the private bank.
Such amendments would be brought to the attention of the Executive
Directors.
35.       In summary, the cost and overall financial plan for the project
would be as follows:

Procurement and Disbursements
36.       Civil works and equipment installation will be contracted with
the successful bidder in the recently opened bids, which have been obtained
by GPA on the basis of international competitive bidding. Some Ecuadorian
firms are expected to participate as sub-contractors. There are no local
manufacturers of the types of equipment required for the project. Retro-
active financing not exceeding US$180,000 is proposed for consultant
services incurred after January 1, 1976.
37.       The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against 60 percent
of the foreign exchange component of civil works, equipment, consultants'
services for supervision of construction and procurement of equipment and
technical assistance to manage, operate and maintain the bulk cargo terminal
and train GPA staff therefor. The bulk of the disbursements would be com-
pleted towards the end of 1979; however, the technical assistance to operate
the bulk terminal would require final disbursements until the end of 1981.
Annex III contains the estimated disbursements schedule for the proposed
Bank loan.
GPA Finances
38.       GPA has a successful financial record:  in the 16 years since it
was created, it only had operational losses in 1968 and 1969. The rapid
increase in traffic has meant higher expenses for GPA but also a consis-
tently high level of revenues. These have covered operational expenses
and debt service, and permitted the build-up of liquid assets -- which
amounted to US$7.2 million equivalent at the end of 1974 -- which would be
used to finance part of the cost of the forthcoming expansion. In addition,
the Government of Ecuador and the Province of Guayas owe GPA about US$2.0
million equivalent, most of which is overdue. The Government has given
assurances that these debts will be paid by the end of 1976 and 1978,
respectively (see Section 3.02 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).



- 13 -
39.       Based on its financial statements, GPA's financial rates of
return on average net fixed assets for the years 1972, 1973 and 1974 were
respectively 8.8 percent, 13.3 percent and 21.7 percent. However, these
rates of return are overstated since GPA's fixed assets have not been
revalued since 1963 and the depreciation provisions are low. As part of
the overall improvement in its operations, GPA has agreed to establish
a new system of cost accounting by the end of 1976; in conjunction with
this, GPA's fixed assets will be revalued by the end of 1976 and realistic
depreciation allowances will be established (see Sections 5.03 and 5.06
of the draft Loan Agreement). Once cost accounting is established and
assets are revalued, it would be possible to review the structure of
GPA's tariffs which, although desirable, would not be feasible at this
point.
40.       In November of 1975, the National Council of Merchant Marine
and Ports approved a tariff increase of about 20 percent which became
effective in January 1976. GPA this will be able to generate revenues
which, in addition to its present resources, will enable GPA to finance
the local cost of the project and about 5.4 percent of its foreign
exchange component. No further tariff increases are contemplated until
the project is completed and the new facilities become operational during
the second half of 1979. GPA and the Government have undertaken to
maintain a tariff policy, starting in 1980, which would enable GPA to
cover operational expenses, provide adequate maintenance and depreciation
and achieve a rate of return of at least 8 percent on revalued average
net fixed assets (see Section 5.05 of the draft Loan Agreement and
Section 3.04 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
41.       At the end of 1974, GPA's total debt amounted to only 19 percent
of capitalization. Based on current traffic forecasts, GPA's financial
position should be good during the period 1976-80 and should be safficient
to service the loans required to finance the project. However, the repay-
ment of that debt would absorb a large proportion of GPA's cash flow.
Therefore, GPA has agreed not to incur any further debt unless its debt
service requirements are covered by net revenues at least 1.5 times
(see Section 5.07 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Economic Benefits and Justification
42.       In 1974 the Port of Guayaquil handled about 80 percent of general
imports and exports, excluding bananas. Although Guayaquil's share of
total traffic is expected to decline somewhat as other seaports are expanded,
Guayaquil is expected to remain the leading port in Ecuador. Import traffic
at Guayaquil is expected to grow at 7.5 percent per annum while exports would
increase at 2.5 percent per annum during the period 1975-85. Consequently,
overall traffic tonnage is expected to grow from 1.8 million tons in 1974 to
3.27 million tons in 1985. Therefore, if the Port of Guayaquil were not
expanded now, it would become a serious bottleneck for the flow of imports
and exports in Ecuador. This accounts for the high priority assigned by GPA
and the Government to this project whose principal benefits consist of
savings in ship turn-around time, cargo handling and traffic diversion.



- 14 -
43.        The economic analysis has shown that the project would have an
overall economic rate of return of 14 percent. A separate analysis has
been conducted for the three general cargo berths, which showed an economic
return of 16 percent and for the bulk terminal which showed an economic
return of 12 percent. In addition, sensitivity analyses revealed that
even under adverse assumptions of higher costs and lower benefits, the
rate of return would still be acceptable. This economic rate of return
is based exclusively on the estimated direct and quantifiable benefits
accruing to the ports and shipping sub-sectors of the Ecuadorian economy.
In the case of the general cargo berths, these benefits consisted of time
savings in Ecuadorian ship turn-around time and in the avoidance of lighterage
and of diversion of traffic to other ports. In the case of the buIlk terminal,
the benefits consisted of savings in freight costs arising from the use of
larger ships that could be berthed at the proposed bulk berth and from savings
in cargo handling costs (especially elimination of lighterage for sugar and
molasses).
44.       The above calculation of benefits is a conservative one.  In
the first place, benefits accruing to other sectors of the Ecuadorian
economy, which could not be easily quantified, have not been included.
In the second place, these estimates include only the likely benefits to
Ecuadorian users -- i.e., ships owned or chartered by Ecuadorian nationals
-- who account for about 55 percent of total traffic at Guayaquil. The
benefits accruing to foreign users -- 45 percent of the total -- could,
and probably would, be partly recovered through higher tariffs that GPA
will be able to charge to those foreign users once the improved facilities
are operational. If those benefits were fully recovered in this fashion,
the economic rate of return would increase to 21 percent. Therefore, the
actual return to the Ecuadorian economy, measured in terms of direct,
quantifiable, benefits to the ports and shipping sub-sectors, will depend
on the degree to which benefits to foreign users are recovered through new
tariffs charged by GPA but it is likely to lie somewhere between 14 percent
and 21 percent.
Risks
45.       The expansion of the port facilities would be conducted in the
same area where the original facilities were built. The consultants who
designed the expanded facilities and are expected to supervise their con-
struction also designed and supervised the construction of the original
facilities. In the light of their experience, and bearing in mind that
the present design and construction plans include precautions against the
recurrence of the slides which affected the construction of the existing
wharves in 1960-63, no major engineering problems are expected. The
project design also takes account of the possibility of earthquakes
in the area. The new facilities would handle general cargo similar to
that handled at present and the bulk terminal would handle only non-
polluting cargo. No adverse effects on the environment are therefore
expected.



PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Guayaquil Port
Authority, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Ecuador
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of the draft
resolution approving the proposed loan, are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. Features of the draft Loan and Guarantee
Agreements which are of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 27,
29, 33, 38, 39, 40 and 41 of this Report.
47.       A special condition for the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement
would be the signing of a US$10.0 million loan agreement between the
Government and GPA and the falfillment of the conditions of disbursement
(_If any) thereunder (see Section 7.01(a) of the draft Loan Agreement).
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
