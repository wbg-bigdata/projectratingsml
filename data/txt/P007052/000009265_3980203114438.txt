SECOND PORT PROJECT
LOAN 1255-EC
Preface
1.        The following is the Project Completion Report (PCR) oni the
Second Port Project in Ecuador for which Loan 1255-EC (US$33.5 million)
was made in May 1976. Board presentation had been delayed about 4 months
in order to have a new port legislation approved by the Government. The
loan account was closed in December 1981 but disbursements under the loan
continued until March 1982 when the last disbursement was processed and
funds were exhausted. This PCR was prepared 1982 by the Latin America and
Caribbean Regional Office with the assistance of the Borrower and is based
on information furnished by the Borrower, as well as that collected during
normal supervision of the project.
2.        The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) has reviewed the PCR,
but the project was not audited.  Salient aspects of the project's experience
are summarized in the Highlights.
3.        The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments and none was
received.

ECUADOR
SECOND PORT PROJECT
CLoan 1255-EC)
HiLlIlghts
1.        The project was intended to eliminate existing port congestion
and permit coping with forecast traffic. This was to be achieved by
strengthening GPA's manageriaL capabilities, increasing operational efficiency
and expanding port facilities. To this effect GPA was to: (a) retain consultants
to assist in the implementation of cost accounting and management information
systems; (b) develop training programs for port workers; and (c) carry out the
construction of three new general cargo berths, two of which would eventually
become part of the first container terminal in Ecuador; construct a specialized
liquid and dry bulk cargo berth; and dredge a new port basin. By means of
this port expansion project, port capacity was considerably increased, port
zoning was clearly defined with the establishment of three terminals: one
for bulk cargo, one for container traffic and another one for general cargo
and bananas; and port operations were reorganized increasing the operational
efficiency of the port.
2.        The project, prior to Board presentation prompted institutional
changes that were satisfactoriyimplemented; they consisted of a new port
legislation that was approved by the Government and later enacted and the
simplification of custom procedures to alleviate existing port congestion
(para 2.08).
3.        The project was completed before the date estimated during appraisal;
actual project cost was about 12% greater than appraisal estimates due mainly
to design changes (para 3.08 and 3.09).
4.        Physical project components were satisfactorily concluded except for
some technical problems of the sugar-handling facilities that have not yet
been solved (para 3.01(d)). Some of the technical assistance components of
the project were not executed as stipulated in the loan agreement; for
example, the cost accounting system was considered by GPA synonimous with
computerization, and in the absence of computers, it was not introduced
(para 5.22); some limited training of port workers sponsored by others and
not financed by the Bank took place in 1977; during project implementation,
a National Training Center for port worlFers was built and courses are expected
to start shortly (para 2.07); training for the operation of the bulk and
container terminals is being financed diractly by GPA (para 3.06).
5.        By 1981, general cargo traffic handled at GPA's facilities was about
95% of appraisal forecast; total Guayaquil bulk traffic, also by 1981, was
about 83% of forecast, however, practically all of it was handled at private
facilities leaving GPA's bulk terminal unused (para 4.06 and 4.09). Container
traffic has developed in line with appraisal forecast (para 4.07).



v 
6.         GPA's financial results were considerably better than anticipated.
1981 net income was about 42X higher than in 1980; operating and wvrrking
ratios, rates of return and debt service coverage in general exceeded
forecasts (para 5,01). Assets were revalued in 1978 (para 5.24); GPA's
accounts and financial statements were audited but audit repors have been
delayed (para 5.21).
7.         The revaluated EER for the three general cargo berths is estimated
at 12% compared with the appraisal estimate of 16%; a lower traffic growth
rate was used thar. that estimated at appraisal.  Even for the most optimistic
scenario, the grain terminal has an unsatisfactory ERR of 3%, the sugar
molasses and edible oil fac&lities have marginally acceptable ERRs. The
project as a whole has an estimated ERR of 9% as compared with the appraisal
estimate of 14% (pares 6.03, 6.07 and 6.08). In retrospect, it appears
that the bulk handling facility should not have been included in the project.
(Para 8.01). Otherwise, the project generally achieved its objectives.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Ecuador tias four deepwater commercial ports, two oil
terminals and two fishing ports. Other minor ports and a large number
of private wharves and river moorings complete the country's port
system. Guayaquil Is Ecuador's main commercial port as it handles
over 80% of all seabound traffic excluding oil and bananas. Existing
facilities at Guayaquil prior to the second port project referred to
in this report, consisted of five deepwater berths built between 1958
and 1963 with Bank participation (para 2.01).
*          1.02       Traffic growth at the port of Guayaquil increased after 1972
as a consequence of the accelerated economic growth of the country.
Traffic increased from 1.2 million ton in 1972 to about 2.2 million in
1977 and about 2.8 million in 1981 (Table 3).
1.03      The combination of traffic growth, inefficient port
operations and inadequate cargo-clearance procedures, coupled with
weak management at Guayaquil port during the early 1970s, led
eventually to port congestion which, by 1975, prompted the three main
shipping conferences to impose port surcharges. The general objective
of the second port project was to provide additional port capacity to
cope with forecast traffic up to 1985 (para 2.07), through improvement
of operating procedures and additional specialized facilities.
1.04      This project Completion Report (PCR), has been prepared with
the assistance of the Borrower, who prepared a preliminary completion
report for Bank review and provided necessary operational, financial
and technical data, and is based also on information obtained from LAC
Informatiou Center, and project appraisal and supervision reports.
This PCR corresponds to the Second Guayaluil Port project financed by
Loan 1255-EC for US$33.5 million to the Guayaquil Port Authority
(GPA).
1I. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Background
2.01      The Bank'3 participation in the port subsector began in 1958
with the Loan 212-EC for the first port project which helped to
finance the construction of existing facilities at Guayaquil prior to
the expansion project referred to in this report. CPA was established
in 1958 in connection with the construction of that project.
Origin and Project Preparation
2.02      GPA first approached the Bank in 1972 to seek financing for
new port equiipment and additional port facilities. The Bank
immediately expressed interest in the proposed project.  After
consultations with the Government and GPA, the Bank expressed its view
that, in order to assess overall existing and future port



-2-
requirements, the Government and GPA should (a) undertake the
improvement of cargo-clearance procedures and introduce institutional
changes for the operational efficiency of the existing port facilities
at Guayaquil, and (b) await the completion of an ongoing general study
of Ecuadoran ports being prepared by foreign consultants retained by
the Government.
2.03      While the general port study was being completed, GPA
retained consultants for the preparation of a feasibility study for
the proposed Guayaquil port expansion project, incorporating the most
relevant findings of the general study.
Appraisal of the Project
2.04      In October 1974, the Bank reviewed the completed feasibility
study and found it unsatisfactory, particularly with regard to traffic
forecasts, transport economics and engineering work. After extensive
Bank consultations with the GPA and the Government, an agreement was
reached on the scope of the project. The project was appraised by the
Bank in May 1975.
2.05      Two important issues remained outstanding after appraisal
which the Bank decided had to be resolved prior to Board presentation:
(a) GPA should adopt institutional framework adequate to improve the
operational efficiency of the port and (b) in view of the steadily
increasing local and foreign cost estimates, the estimates needed to
be reviewed to establish the proposed loan amount.
2.06      These issues were satisfactorily dealt with as follows:  (a)
new port legislation was approved by the Government and later enacted
in April 1976 (para 2.08); (b) increased cargo storage charges and
some simplification of customs procedures were Introduced to alleviate
existing port congestion; and (c) the review of project cost estimates
resulted in a total project cost of US$83.6 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$56.7 million (Table 1).
Project Objectives and Description
2.07      The objectives of the project were to increase the capacity
and operational efficiency of the port of Guayaquil to enable it to
eliminate congestion and cope with forecast traffic. To achieve these
objectives, the project included the construction of: (a) one
specialized berth equipped to handle dry- and liquid-bulk cargo, (b)
three deepwater berths, one of which was designed to support container
cranes; (c) a shallow water berth for small floating craft; (d) open
and covered storage areas; (e) port workshops and ancillary buildings;
and (f) dredging to widen an access channel and a new turning basin
and for removing upper layers of soil unsuitable for the construction
of these facilities. An option to build a fourth deepwater berth
originally contemplated by GPA, but not included in the project, was
eventually abandoned. To improve port efficiency, the project also
included technical assistance for training of port workers and GPA
personnel.



-3-
Institutional Changes
2.08      The establishment of a new port legislation, promoted by and
satisfactory to the Bank (para 2.06) was enacted one month after the
loan became effective. The Government also undertook the review of
salaries of GPA's qualified staff, the simplification of customs
procedures and auctioning of abandoned cargoes.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      Project implementation was delayed by a series of
difficulties. These included:
(a) design of the dredging slope that apparently was not
suitable to the adverse soil conditions prompted disputes
between the consultants, GPA and the lowest evaluated
bidder, and ultimately led to arbitration and design
changes. This resulted in increased construction costs of
about US$13.4 million and delays of about eight months;
(b) a legal dispute between the dredging subcontractors and
Ecudoran custom authorities concerning minor irregularities
in compliance with import regulations resulted in further
delays;
(c) other technical problems, also related to adverse soil
conditions, arose during the construction period:' shed
design had to be modified; some utility ducts had to be
replaced, shed walls and floors suffered settlement and
cracks. Most of these problems were solved during the
construction period; others are still being solved;
(d) unsatisfactory performance of sugar-handling facilities
included in the project which has not yet been solved. This
problem, and some of those mentioned in paragraph 3.01(c),
prompted GPA to withhold the retention guarantee established
in the construction contract.  This led to long and
acrimonious disputes between the GPA, the contractor and the
consultants, and settlement is still pending. The Bank has
been closely following the events, trying, with some
success, to convince all parties to enter into an amicable
and satisfactory settlement; and
(e) the lack of continuity in port management hindered the
project's orderly implementation. Between 1975-1981, GPA
had ten presidents, ten general managers, two administrative
directors, four finance directors, two operation directors
and three chief engineers. The large turnover of executives
meant often conflicting policies, instructions and, from
time to time, different understanding of intricate details
of the project.



Procurement
3.02      Procurement was satisfactorily carried out on the basis of
international competitive bidding (ICB) for one single package
comprising all works and equipment. In hindsight, it appears that the
procurement of mechanized bulk-cargo equipment should (i) have been
made on the basis of performance specifications instead of on the
basis of detailed design, and (ii) been procured separately from the
civil works contract. In this way, the equipment contract would have
been addressed at specialized manufacturers/suppliers instead of at a
civil works contractor. The supplier would then have proposed already
tested equipment to meet the performance specifications rather than
modify the equipment to meet detailed designs. This might have
avoided the technical problems that have prevented the use of the
sugar-handling facility. In addition, GPA and the Bank could have
encouraged the development of the local industry through a bid
packaging waich separated works for which local firms could have
successfully bid; this would have probably allowed a more direct
participation of local contractors.
Project Supervision
3.03      Taking into consideration the difficulties with the
consultants' proposed design, and the fact that the same consultants
had been involved in a similar problem during the first port project,
the Bank advised GPA against retaining them again for the supervision
work. However, GPA considered that the replacement of these
consultants at such a critical time would cause further delays and
awarded the supervision contract to them. GPA, on the other hand,
accepted the Bank's recommendations to retain the consulting firm that
prepared the revised dredging slope design to act as GPA's technical
advisor through periodic visits and technical consultations during the
execution of the project.
Administration Unit
3.04      At the Bank's request, GPA established a Project
Administration Unit (PAU) to monitor and coordinate all
project-related activities. The responsibilities of this Unit were
gradually increased until it became practically the only communication
channel between consultants and contractors with GPA's management.
Although this imposed a heavy workload on the PAU, its performance was
very good. The PAU's heavy involvement in all technical matters,
however, prevented a more active participation of GPA's Technical
Department that would probably have been helpful in threshing out
numerous technical problems.
Project Changes
3.05      Certain changes were made to the project during the
execution period. Based on the significant increase of container
traffic, GPA decided, with Bank agreement, to eliminate two of the
three transit sheds included in the project and replace them with an
additional container shed. For same reasons, the dimension of the



-5-
container yard was also extended. These changes did not appear to
have occasLoned significant additional cosLs. In the light of the
continuing rapid trend towards greater containerization, GPA decided
to purchase from its resources specialized container-handling
equipment which became operational in August 1982.
Technical Assistance
3.06      GPA reorganized its Operations Department by creating and
staffing three divisions to be responsible for the bulk cargo
terminal, the container terminal and the general cargo zone.
Technical assistance included in the project for training of GPA's
staff in the operation and maintenance of the bulk terminal was not
used because such training was provided by the equipment suppliers
manufacturers through the main contractor. GPA also decided that the
additional technical assistance required to manage and operate the
specialized terminals should be carried out under a port management
study financed directly by GPA which contract was awarded in April
1982 to a foreign consulting firm.
3.07      During project implementation, a National Training Center
for port workers was built in Guayaquil with funds provided by the
existing four port authorities of the country. This training center
is now completed and courses are expected to start shortly.
Project Costs
3.08      The actual final project cost in current prices was S/2,339
million (about US$93.5 million) against the appraisal estimate of
S/ 2,091 million or US$83.6 million (including contingencies). The
cost overrun, about 12% above appraisal cost estimate in US dollar and
in sucres terms, was caused mainly by design changes (para 3.01).
Additional costs arising out of current disputes (para 3.01(d)) may
yet alter total project cost, although it is expected that these will
not be significant. A comparison of detailed cost estimates and
actual project cost is given in Table 1.
Construction Schedule
3.09      Despite delays in loan effectiveness (project data sheet)
and design and legal problems (para 3.01), the project was completed
in March 1981 before the estimated appraisal completion date. The
completion date stipulated in the construction contract, however, was
August 31, 1980; responsibility for this contract delay is still being
defined by CPA.
Disbursements
3.10      Actual disbursement of loan funds differed considerably from
that envisaged in the Loan Agreement. The comparison of appraisal
schedule and actual disbursements is given in Table 2; it reflects
delays in work commencement and the fact that GPA withdrew funds from
the cofinancier, BNS International (Panama), before drawing on Bank
loan funds. At appraisal, it bad been expected that the loan would be



-6-
disbursed pari passu with that of the cofinancier; Schedule 1 of the
loan agreement stipulating the withdrawal of loan proceeds would have
allowed GPA to simultaneously use the Bank and the co-lender funds,
but GPA decided to fully disburse the co-lender's funds before using
the Bank loan.
3.11      The loan amount of US$33.5 million was fully disbursed.  At
GPA's request, the Bank increased the disbursement percentage from 60%
to 90% of foreign expenditures in mid-1979 to adjust for the fact that
GPA had not utilized the loan proceeds during the initial phases of
construction. In 1981, the undisbursed balance of the loan was
sufficient to cover only about 27% of foreign expenditures. The
disbursement percentage for the total loan averaged 57% of foreign
expenditures.

Agreement, with actual use of fu'ads, is given below. This final allocation of the
loan proceeds reflects the reallocation of funds under Category III (b), which were to

Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.13      Problems described in paragraph 3.01, explain the
consultants' performance, particularly with respect to the design
features of the project. Although the Bank recommended to CPA against
retaining the same consultants for the supervision of the project
(',ara 3.04), these were hired by GPA and their performance was
acceptable during most of the construction period, despite the fact
that for sometime the firm was on the verge of bankruptcy. Their
performance however was poor during the last stages of construction
due to the firm's internal problems that caused continuous changes in
project managers.
3.14      The contractors' performance from the point of view of
quantity, quality and compliance with design specifications was very
good. This is supported by the fact that despite the serious problems
encountered (design changes, etc.), the works were practically
completed only three or four months after the contract's completion
date. The responsibility for delays is still to be determined.
Reporting
3.15      Progress reports were regularly sent to the Bank by GPA;
their contents were acceptable at the onset, and their quality
improved through project implementation.

IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
A.   General
4.01      Traffic through Guayaquil is handled at a number of private installations
along the river Guayas and the Estero, as vell as at the GPA wharves. General cargo,
sugar, molasses, and bananas are handled at CPA wharves; petroleum products at a
specialized terminal, and grain and edible oil are handled at both private and GPA
facilities. At appraisal, global trafiic projections for all public and private
installations were made by commodity, and traffic allocations between private and GPA
facilities estimated, taking into account the new facilities to be provided at the GPA
wharves under the project.
B.   Total Traffic:  GPA and Private 'acilities
4.02      Table 3 gives details of appraisal forecasts for total traffic and relates
these figures to actual data. A summary is given below:

Total (Exclusive of Petroleum Products)  1'725         2,655    2,428        6.4      5.0
4.03      Export traffic grew at an average rate of 0.9% p.a. between 1974-1981, as
compared to projected growth of 2.4% p.a. The shortfall is mainly explained by
consistently lower than expected volumes of sugar and molasses exports. By 1981, it
had been expected that sugar exports would increase to 90,000 tons as compared with
average annual exports of 72,000 tons between 1970-1975. This forecast was based on
assumption of relatively slow increases in world consumption but expanded domestic
production. The export of the molasses was expected to grow even faster, from 45,000
tons in 1974 to 120,000 tons by 1981. In the years following the appraisal, however,
world sugar prices 1/ fell dramatically from the highs of 1974-1975, and as a
consequence domestic production and exports have suffered. Overall, in 1981, sugar
and molasses exports were only 40% of forecast levels. In 1982, the combination of
drought and poor world sugar prices have resulted in virtually no exports of these
commodities. In contrast to sugar and molasses traffic, fish and fish meal products
Increased faster than expected at appraisal; actual traffic in 1981 was about three



- 10 -
times greater than anticipated. Banana traffic was lower than expected until 1981,
when it exceeded appraisal estimates by 11%.
4.04       Import traffic (exclusive of petroleum products) was about 9% below forecast
levels, mainly due to shortfalls in the import of metals, fertilizers, vehicles and
machinery. The shortfall is mainly explained by somewhat lower than expected economic
growth since 1975, mainly due to the sluggish agricultural and industrial sectors.
Real GDP was expected to grow by 7% p.a. over the period, as compared with actual
growth of 6% p.a.
4.05       Petroleum products were imported at a much higher rate than anticipated.
This is due to the fact that the refinery at Esmeraldas was not constructed as
anticipated, and because domestic fuel consumption grew at unprecedentedly high rates
in the 1970s due in part to large domestic energy price subsidies during that period.
C.   Traffic Allocations
4.06            Table 4 gives actual and forecasts traffic through GPA facilities
between 1975 and 1981, and Table 5 gives the expected and actual allocation of traffic
by commodity between the completed GPA facilities and private installations for 1981,
the first year the project financed facilities became operational. This table is
summarized below, and a comparison between the appraisal assumptions, and actual
traffic allocations for the main commodity groups (general cargo, containers, sugar,
molasses, cereals, edible oils and fats) is given in paragraphs 4.07-4.10.

- 11 -
4.07      By 1981, traffic at the GPA general cargo wharves was about 5% below
appraisal estimates. Containerization of cargo has developed in line with that
projected at appraisal. In 1981, 160,000 tons were handled in containers. It iB
expected that over the next five years, containerized traffic will develop somewhat
more rapidly than anticipated at appraisal (largely due to the installation of
container crane and availability of handling equipment not envisaged at appraisal),
with about 25% of all general cargo containerized by 1985 as compared with 18%
previously forecast.
4.08      Although somewhat below appraisal estintates, traffic at GPA's general cargo
wharves was relatively strong between 1975-1981, with an average annual growth rate of
5%. In contrast, traffic at GPA's bulk facilities constructed under the project to
handle sugar, molasses, grains, oils and fats, has not materialized. At appraisal, it
had been expected that part of this traffic would shift from private facilities to GPA
bulk wharf when the new facilities came on stream. The lack of bulk sugar and
molasses traffic is explained by the fact that the new installations are not yet
operational (pare 3.01(d)). When problems with the sugar and molasses handling
facilities are corrected, this traffic should be diverted to the bulk facilities as
expected at appraisal, though volumes will be lower than forecast due to the state of
the world sugar industry (para 4.03).
4.09      At appraisal, it was expected that most grain and cereal imports would
divert from private facilities along the river, which have draft limitations of 7 m,
to the GPA bulk terminal, as importers took advantage of lower transport costs
obtained through the use of larger ships that can be handled at the GPA bulk
terminal. It was expected that one large importer would continue to use its own
facilities which had a capacity of 124,000 tons/year. This diversion of grain imports
has not occurred for a number of reasons. There are now two major importers with
private grain handling and storage facilities which have the capacity to handle
between 250,000 - 300,000 tons/year. Together, these importers make up 85% of total
imports through the Guayaquil river. It has been suggested that given the fact that
the capital costs for the private terminal have already been made, the grain importers
have had little incentive to minimize variable transport costs because of the
structure of Government subsidies on grain products which in effect subsidized
inefficiencies along the distribution chain. In October 1982, subsidies on wheat were
eliminated, however, and this could result in these importers becoming more sensitive
to costs. If this is the case, the GPA's bulk facilities could attract some of this
traffic. An additional 50,000 tons of grains and cereals are imported by small
companies who use both private and GPA facilities. In October 1982, a Government
decree was passed specifying that all of this additional traffic pass through the GPA
bulk wharves.
4.10      At appraisal it was expected that all edible oils and fats would pass
through CPA's wharves when the bulk facilities were completed; about half of these
were expected to be handled at the bulk facilities with the remainder handled as
general cargo. In fact, virtually all of this traffic is now handled at private
facilities which apparently did not exist when the project was appraised. It is not
known the extent to which private facilities were built in response to delays in
project execution.
D.   Operations
4.11      Following operational changes undertaken by GPA at the Bank's request in
1976, congestion of the port areas was gradually reduced, enabling the port to handle



- 12 -
about 1.5 million tons in 1979 or 15% more traffic than in 1975 through the existing
facilities. By 1980, three of the new berths built under the project became
operational and port congestion disappeared completely, prompting shipping lines to
eliminate surcharges.
4.12      Container traffic grew from about 3,500 in 1974 to about 17,000 TEU in 1979,
before the new facilities were completed; productivity at the time was very low
(7 TEU/hour). Containerization started to grow at a faster pace in 1980 when ample
container stacking areas provided by the project became available and productivity
increased to about 10 TEU/hour. In 1982, this traffic is expected to be over 32,000
TEU, almost identical to appraisal estimates. Containerization will most likely
continue to grow at an even faster rate now that the container terminal is fully
operational and productivity is expected to be 17 TEUthour.
4.13      Operational changes mentioned in paragraph 4.11, together with availability
of new berths, have allowed GPA to eliminate lighterage of banana exports.
4.14      Actual operational data for dry bulk cargo is not available because there
have been no sugar exports, and grain imports continue to be handled through private
facilities (paras 4.08-4.10). However, it is expected that future sugar exports and
grain imports should be han4led at the 200 ton/hour rated capacity of the
bulk-handling system.

V.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
A. Financial Position of the CPA
5.01      During the project's implementation GPA's actual financial
results were considerably better than anticipated.   Each year between
1976 to 1980, the actual net income exceeded considerably the
forecasted income and in 1981, for which year no forecast was made
during appraisal, the net income was about 42% higher than in 1980
(Table 6). Operating ratios, working ratios, rates of return and debt
service coverage also consistently exceeded forecasts with the
exception of 1980 when both the working and the operating ratios were
worse than expected (see para 5.05). Rates of return on net assets
employed were not representative prior to 1979 due to the
unrealistically low values of the fixed assets. In 1978, the fixed
assets were revalued and, after that, the rate of return fell to a
plausible level.
GPA's Revenues
5.02      The better than expected financial results stem from the
higher than forecast operating (and non-operating) revenues. Between
1976 and 1980, the actual operating revenues exceeded the forecast
each year.   In addition, GPA has had considerable non-operating (net)
income in each of the years observed; at appraisal only small
non-operating income was forecast until 1977 and losses thereafter.
5.03      GPA revised its tariff schedules in 1976, 1978 and 1980.
During project appraisal, tariff increases were envisaged to provide
20% to 25% revenue increase in 1976 and about 25% in 1980. The actual
tariff increases, while achieving the desired higher revenues, were
obtained from sources other than expected. Storage and shipping dues
far exceeded their expected importance, while cargo related revenues
in fact were almost the same as forecast.
5.04      The aggregate operating revenues between 1976-1980 exceeded
the forecast by some 33%. The higher than anticipated revenues
resulted from ship dues and storage fees which were about 58% more
than forecast. Storage revenues exceeded expectations by some 98%,
basically due to (three) tariff increases which were not forecast
during project appraisal and the revenues from shipping fees exceeded
the forecast by about 36%, mainly due to different composition of
shipping traffic than expected. Cargo related revenues were only
about 1% higher than the forecast. The importance of the storage fee
as a source of operating revenue has also grown; it represented 29%
share of the total operating revenue during the last five years
compared to the expected 19%.
5.05      While operating revenues considerably exceeded expectations,
total working costs remained close to projected levels until 1979,
with the maximum difference from the projections being 11% in that
year. However, from 1979 to 1980, due to higher personnel expenses,
costs increased by 43% and were about 40% above the forecast. As a
result of this, for the first time during the project's life, the



- 14 -
working and operating ratios deteriorated beyond the forecast
values.
5.06   Until 1979, actual personnel costs increased somewhat faster
than envisaged.   In 1980 the increase became particularly pronounced;
actual personnel costs grew by 48% compared to the previous year and
exceeded the forecast by 42%.   Both the higher than expected
compensations and the higher manning levels were responsible for the
increase. Between 1976-1981, compensation per person rose at an
average rate of 22% per annum compared to the 15% forecast; employment
increased at an annual average rate of 7% in contrast to the less than
1% forecast. In fact during appraisal, no increase in employment was
envisaged until 1980 for which year a nominal increase was forecast
for operating the bulk cargo facilities. The GPA's port traffic,
which grew by about 11% p.a. over this period, probably would not
justify a manpower increase (about 30% over the last four years) or
the increase in compensation (estimated at 7% p.a. in real terms).
5.07      In spite of the better than expected financial results,
earnings did not improve in relation to the cargo handled. While irL
1977 the revenue per ton of cargo handled was about 2.5 times higher
than the cost per ton of cargo handled, in 1981 it was only 1.5 times
higher. Should this declining trend continue, the port could expect
increasingly serious financial difficulties in future years. With the
timely implementation of a cost accounting system, tariffs could be
designed to maintain an explicit link between revenues and costs and
to improve the port's earning potential (see paras 5.23 and 5.24).
5.08      GPA's total assets increased until 1977 as forecast, but
with a different composition; the value of the current assets exceeded
the forecasts, while the values of net fixed assets fell below.   In
1978, 1979 and 1980 values of both the fixed and current assets
exceeded their forecast by about 71% for the following reasons:
(a) During 1978 GPA revalued its fixed assets increasing the
values by about 75%. During project appraisal allowance of
20%-30% increase in asset values was made for a revaluation
to be completed in 1976 and an additional 20% for a second
revaluation in 1979.  The magnitude of the revaluation was
underestimated during appraisal; and
(b)  During 1979 and 1980, the actual values of "construction in
progress" were higher than forecast.  These reflected some
delays in civil works implementation, higher than
anticipated project costs due to cost overruns and
additional project items.
5.09      GPA's liabilities also reflect the better than expected
financial results (Table 7).   The lower than projected level of
borrowing for project financing, as well as the delay in finalizing
the BNS International Loan (see paras 5.11 and 5.12), resulted in
lower than expected total debt between 1976 to 1979. Debts began to
grow rapidly only from 1980. The lower than anticipated levels of
total debt and the stronger equity position are also reflected by the



- 15 -
better than forecast debt-equity ratios. CPA has had no difficulty in
complying with Covenant 5.07 of the Loan Agreement pertaining to debt
service as a proportion of the preceeding year's net revenue.
B. Project Financing
5.10      Table 8 compares the forecast and actual project financing
according to various sources. It is noted that the actual local
currency expenditure was about 30% and the foreign currency
expenditure was about 5% above the respective appraisal estimates.
GPA financed both these cost overruns, and, in addition, contributed
to the project $10 million more than originally was expected; this
amount was to have been a Government contribution. GPA's overall
involvement in the project was about SI 871 million, or US$16.1
million. The port was able to provide these finances due to its
stronger than anticipated financing position.
5.-       The Bank financed 57% or US$33.5 million of the foreign
exch. ige costs. US$10 million was provided through a loan to the GPA
by BN., International (Panama) S.A. under co-financing arrangements
with the Bank.
5.12      The finalizing of the US$10 million loan from the Government
of Ecuador or from other sources was a condition of the Bank loan
effectiveness. At the time the Loan and Guarantee Agreements were
signed, the deadline for effectiveness was August 24, 1976. However,
the Government was reluctant to finalize the financing arrangements
until an accord was reached between the GPA and the contractors on the
civil works construction. Consequently, the deadline for
effectiveness was twice postponed at the request of the Ministry of
Finance, and as the financing arrangements were signed on December 21,
1976, the loan finally came into effect on March 11, 1977.
C. Review of Covetants
5.13      The covenants included in the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
covered financing, institutional, management areas, and also reflected
institution-building components of the project. The principal
covenants are discussed below and the related performance records of
both the Borrower and the Guarantor are reviewed. Standard covenants
which were complied with in a satisfactory manner are not discussed.

Guarantee agreement
Section 3.02: Repayment of Government Debts to GPA
5.14      At the time of appraisal, the Government's debt to GPA
amounted to S/ 35.5 million, and repayment was required by December
31, 1976. The Government has repaid this debt, but during the last
five years new obligations were incurred. The GPA now reports that
the outstanding debt is S/ 51.2 million.
Loan Agreement
Section 3.03: Technical Assistance for Manpower Training to Improve
Skills of Shore Labor, Stevedores and Equipment
Operators
5.15      A series of courses for port workers, the costs of which
were not financed by the Bank, was begun in 1977 under the sponsorship
of the American Association of Port Authorities. Other training
programs undertaken or to be undertaken by GPA are discussed in
paragraphs 3.06-3.07.
Section 3.04: Hiring of Management and Engineering Experts to Assist
in Operation of Bulk Cargo Terminal.
5.16      Provision was made in the contract with the main contractor
for the necessary training to be carried out during the erection and
trial of the equipment as well as during the guarantee period.
Section 3.05: Hiring of Port Operations Expert by December 31, 1976
for Training and Operational Assistance
5.17      Experts were hired in 1977 to prepare a study of port
operations. However, the GPA and the Bank found the work to be
unsatisfactory and consequently new consultants were retained. The
work of the latter was later suspended due to ruling by a government
regulatory body which alleged irregularities in the hiring procedure.
By December 1981, the difficulties had still not been resolved. A
stevedoring operations program was implemented in 1977 with the aid of
a Swedish expert. However, training for the operation of the bulk and
container terminals has been included in a separate contract recently
awarded to a foreign consulting firm (para 3.06); this contract is
being financed directly by GPA.
Section 4.01: Appropriate Insurance Coverage
5.18      During 1978, the CPA arranged a self-insurance policy which
the Bank deemed to be inadequate. In early 1980, an acceptable
insurance scheme was introduced.
Section 4.03: Establishment of System of Salaries and Benefits for
Management Consistent with Need to Employ Qualified and
Experienced Personnel
5.19      The rules governing the port authority's discretionary
powers regarding personnel compensation were altered in 1976. By



- 17 -
virtue of this change, compensation levels for GPA management were
raised and in 1977 it appeared to be competitive with those offered by
other public and private employers in the Guayaquil area. The
management every three years renegotiates employment contracts both
with laborers and administrative staff, trying to maintain the
competitiveness of the employment conditions offered. The latest
negotiations have been completed recently. Subsequent to these
negotiations, the compensation of management personnel iB adjusted.
Section 4.04: Study on Impact of Conditions of Employment of GPA
Employees Upon Efficiency of Operations of Port
5.20      The study, to be completed by June 30, 1977, had not yet
been undertaken as of December 1982.
Section 5.02: Annual Audit of Accounts and Financial Statements by
Extprnal Auditors
5.21      Compliance with this covenant was consistently achieved up
to the end of fiscal year 1977. But, it was not until late 1981 or
early 1982 that the audited accounts for 1978, 1979 and 1980 were
completed. The considerable delays stemmed from the requirement that
each year the Government approve the contract between the appointed
auditors and the GPA. This approval was usually delayed.
Section 5.03: Establishment and Maintenance of Statistical and
Cost Accounting Systems
5.22      The original compliance date was December 31, 1976, however,
basically due to the delayed loan effectiveness. This date was
changed to September 8, 1979. Part of the requirement, the design and
application of a statistical system was largely in place by mid-1977.
In 1978, the GPA hired Price Waterhouse to design a cost accounting
and inventory control system amenable to computerization.   By April
1980 the design was completed and submitted to the GPA Board of
Directors together with a recommendation to upgrade the port's data
processing facilities. Although the Port sought the Government's
approval for procuring the appropriate facilities almost immediately,
as of now approval has not been received. Since the new system was
considered synonymous with computerization, in the absence of the
computers, it was not introduced. Current indications are that GPA
will be able to obtain the computer in early 1983.
5.23      The Bank has closely monitored GPA's performance under this
covenant as it is considered that the introduction of a cost
accounting system is an essential prerequisite for efficient
management of a port. The non-compliance to date has seriously
impeded the GPA's ability to ensure the rational costing of its
services and appropriate framing of tariffs. The long delay in
setting up a cost accounting system must be viewed with gravity
because of the negative implications for efficient port management.

Section 5.06: Revaluation of Assets and Preparation of Depreciation
Schedule
5.24      This was originally to be carried out by December 31, 1976
but an extension was later granted until September 1979. The
revaluation was completed in June 1978.

VI. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
A.   General
6.01       At appraisal, the economic analysis of the Second Guayaquil Port Project
was divided into three parts: (a) three additional general cargo wharves; (b) bulk
terminal pier; and (c) total project. The general cargo wharves had an estimated
economic rate of return (ERR) of 16%, the bulk terminal 12% and the overall project
14%. The ex-post economic reevaluation follows the methodology used at appraisal
except where noted in the following paragraphs.
B.   General Cargo
6.02       For the general cargo wharves, benefits quantified at appraisal consisted
principally of savings in ship turnaround time, savings from avoiding lighterage of
bananas and from avoidance of diversion of traffic to other ports. Some savings
from the cost of handling containers was also included.  In this economic
reevaluation, these savings were requantified using actual investment costs and
updated productivity figures and traffic forecasts. In addition, the cost of the
container crane acquired by GPA in 1982 but not included in the original project
has been included as an investment cost. Benefits from reduced container handling
costs with the crane and faster ship turnaround have also been included.
6.03      The reevaluated economic rate of return for the three additional general
cargo wharves is estimated at 12% as compared with the appraisal estimate of 16%.
The lower reevaluated economic rate of return is explained by a 14% real increase
in project costs (exclusive of the container crane), longer than expected
implementation period which delayed project benefits, and reductions in forecast
traffic. While 1981 traffic at the general cargo wharves is only 5% below the
appraisal estimate, the reevaluation assumes a somewhat lower growth rate over the
life of the project. At appraisal, traffic at the GPA general cargo wharves was
expected to increase by 5% p.a. through the 1980s. The reevaluated economic
analysis assumes a 3% p.a. traffic growth rate at the GPA general cargo wharves,
which is in line with the most recent Bank macroeconomic projections of imports and
exports.
Bulk Facilities
6.04      The bulk facilities, were reevaluated as a whole, as done at appraisal,
using three traffic scenarios. A separate excercise was made to allocate
investment costs between the various bulk facilities. This analisis was not made
at the time of appraisal. Paragraph 6.05 gives details of the reestimated traffic
forecasts and paragraph 6.06 discusses the benefits considered and 6.07-6.08 the
reevaluated economic rates of return.
6.05       In the first scenario, it was assumed that the sugar and molasses
facilities would be operational by 1983. Traffic in that year is assumed at 1980
levels; thereafter sugar traffic is expected to grow at 5% p.a. and molasses at 6%
p.a. This is in line with the most recent Bank economic projections for these
exports. By 1985 it is therefore expected that sugar traffic will reach 52,000
tons and molasses to 65,000 tons as compared to appraisal estimates of 101,000 tons
and 175,000 tons, respectively. For grains it was assumed that the GPA would
capture 100,000 tons of traffic currently handled by the two larger importers and
all traffic handled by smaller importers; this represents about 50X of all grain



- 20 -
traffic. Imports are projected to grow by 1.5% p.a. thereafter. By 1985, 160,000
tons would be handled by the GPA facility as compared with the appraisal estimate
of 290,000 tons. Finally, it was assumed that the GPA facility would capture 50%
of the edible oil and fat traffic from private facilities and that this would grow
by 6% p.a. Under Scenario II, sugar and molasses traffic remains the same as in
Scenario I. It is assumed that the GPA will only be able to attract that grain
traffic being imported by small companies without their own facilities, or about
56,C)0 tons in 1985. For edible oils and fats, it is assumed that private
facilities will continue to handle the present levels of traffic (about 53,000
tons) and that any additional traffic would be handled through the GPA bulk
facility (6,000 tons in 1985). Under Scenario III, the extreme case of all grain
traffic being diverted from private facilities to the GPA facility was assumed.
Sugar, molasses and edible oils and fats remain as in Scenario I.
6.06      Benefits accruing to the bulk facilities include (a) savings in freight
costs from the utilization of larger ships and faster port turnaround, and (b)
savings in port cargo handling costs. Because the facilities have not yet been
used we have no actual productivity figures or information on changes in ship sizes
due to the project. For the purposes of the reevaluation, the ship sizes assumed,
with and without the project, at appraisal were accepted, and ship costs at port
and at sea updated. Savings in cargo handling costs were reestimated to the 1980
base year by correcting for inflation.
6.07      As shown in the table below, under Scenario I, the bulk handling facility
as a whole has a reestimated ERR of 4% as compared with the appraisal estimate of
12%. The sugar, molasses and edible oils have marginally acceptable ERR's while
the grain facility has a negative ERR. Under Scenario II, the facility as a whole
has a reestimated ERR of 3%. Under the extreme Scenario III, where all grain
traffic diverts from private facilities, to the GPA terminal, the grain terminal
investment still has an unacceptable ERR of 3%.
6.08      The project as a whole (based on Scenario I and II) has a reestimated ERR
of 9% as compared with the appraisal estimate of 14%.

6.09      The poor performance of sugar and molasses exports is mainly caused by
the steep drop and subsequent stagnation of world sugar prices. If sugar and
molasses exports recover at a faster rate than anticipated here, this investment
could have a higher return than that calculated in this excercise.



- 21 -
6.10      In retrospect, however, the grain handling facility should not have been
included in the project. At appraisal, more careful analysis of the prospects for
the development of private bulk handling facilities should have been carried out.
Further, the components of the bulk handling facility should have been analyzed
separately to determine the extent to which each was viable on its own. This
analisis suggests that relatively high returns for the sugar and molasses terminals
anticipated at appraisal masked marginal returns for other facilities. If the
grain facility analyzed separately had emerged as a viable sub-project, then the
CPA should have entered into agreements with the grain importers for the use of the
bulk terminal before loan negotiations.
6.11      An interesting issue which arises out of the analyses made here relates
to the allocation of joint investment costs for the bulk terminal to determine the
extent to which each facility at the terminal would be viable on its own. For
example, if the grain terminal had not been included in the project, it is not
clear that there would have been a meaningful decrease in infrastructure costs.
Because the data on infrastructure requirements which could be developed in the
framework of this PCR was limited, Joint costs were allocated in a fairly
simplistic manner in this analysis. Costs were allocated proportional to the share
of total bulk tonnage expected at each bulk facility at appraisal. An alternative
methodology, which might be investigated for future appraisals of projects with
joint costs, would be to determine, for the facility with the largest expected
present value of benefits, the minimum infrastructure costs required and the
associated economic rate of return. A marginal benefit/cost analysis could then be
made for each additional component to be considered for inclusion in the project.

VII. THE ROLE 01' THE BANK AND THE BORROWER
7.01      During 1972-1975, the port of Guayaquil started to suffer
from considerable port congesti",n. The GPA considered at that time
that additional facilities we,e required to relieve such congestion.
When the Bank started its participation, the attention was focussed on
the operational efficiency of the port and on the institutional
aspects of the GPA. After reviewing GPA's proposals, and while the
scope of a satisfactory project was being defined, the Bank
recommended to GPA some operational changes aimed at improving port
productivity.
7.02      With regard to the scope of the project and its contents,
the Bank was a key factor is scaling the project down to a reasonable
size.  However, it appears that GPA and the Bank should have more
carefully analyzed the bulk facility, with GPA clearly defining the
use of the grain terminal after its completion by entering into
agreements with grain importers.
7.03      The fact that GPA had had some previous experience with the
Bank may have contributed to facilitate project implementation.
However, the lack of continuity on the managerial level played a
negative role in dealing with problems during construction (para
3.01(e)).
7.04      Based on design and construction problems that occured
during the execution of the first port project, the GPA and the bank
should have paid special attention to the adverse soil conditions; the
final design prepared by consultants should have been very closely
monitored during its preparation stage and more carefully reviewed
after its completion (para 3.01).
7.05      Serioub disagreements between the GPA, the consultants and
the lowest bidder came to light on the adequacy of dredging
slopes-design. Bank participation was relatively important during
this process, and disputes were finally settled through arbitration,
design changes and additional construction costs.
7.06      Bank supervision was somewhat less than adequate,
particularly in connection with some of the technical assistance
project components, and compliance with some loan covenants (paras
5.17 to 5.25). Work relationships with the GPA were excellent despite
continuous changes within the GPA's top level staff.
7.07      The Bank participation in disputes that arose from defective
completion of the works, has been restricted to the observation of
events and to attempting to convince the parties involved to solve
first the technical problems, and deal later with the corresponding
aspects (paras 3.01(c) and (d)).

VIII. Conclusions
Achievement of Project Objectives
8.01      The project has generally achieved the objectives set up at
appraisal: the increased port capacity eliminated port congestion and
is expected to be adequate to cope with traffic forecasts until at
least 1987. Operational efficiency was also improved (paras 4.11 to
4.14) and with the additional investment of GPA to fully equip the
container terminal, port capacity has been further increased and
operational efficiency improved. The investment in the bulk terminal,
however, has not contributed to achievement of those main objectives.
Furthermore, it appears that, in retrospect, the grain handling
facilities should not have been included in the project (para 6.10).
Economic Results
8.02      Economic benefits of the project have not yet fully come
into stream. This is due to: (a) the decline of international sugar
prices that have caused the reduction in sugar and molasses exports;
and (b) vested interests and Government subsidies to grain imports
that have counteracted the incentives to importers to use the GPA's
grain-handling facilities.  The project's overall EER is 9% as
compared to 14% at appraisal. At appraisal, more careful analysis of
the prospects for the development of the grain handling facility
should have been carried out. Further, the components of the bulk
handling facility should have been analyzed separately to determine
the extent to which each was viable on its own. GPA should compete
for grain traffic as strongly as it can; to do so it should explore
the possibility of reducing tariffs, covering as little as short-term
marginal costs. If traffic does not materialize after a reasonable
time, the facility might be converted to an alternative use, such as a
general cargo berth.
Financial Results
8.03      GPA's financial situation is good; net income, operating and
working ratios exceed appraisal forecasts. Tariffs were Increased
more than anticipated but the ratio of average revenue to cost per ton
seriously declined due to higher operating cost increases (mainly
salaries). A cost accounting system has not yet been implemented, and
until it is, tariffs cannot be linked to costs. GPA's fixed assets
were revaluated in 1978, bringing rates of return to adequate levels.
Project Preparation and Implementation
8.04      Based on technical problems that occurred during the first
port project, the Bank should have followed more closely preparation
of final design taking into consideration the adverse soil
conditions. With regard to specialized grain bulk-hane'.ing facilities
included in the project, the Bank should have requested 3PA to take
the necessary measures to ensure that, upon completion of the project,
grain importers would start using GPA's bulk terminal, and that in the
meantime, the private facilities would not be expanded.



- 24 -
8.05      Project implementation schedule proved to be very realistic
because despite delays in loan effectiveness and in work commencement
(para 3.01), coupled with design changes and arbitration, the project
was completed before the appraisal estimated completion date. There
were no ma4or procurement problems (para 3.11). Disagreements on
adequacy of dredging slopes' design led to disputes and arbitration
that, with Bank participation, resulted in decision changes,
additional construction costs and delays (paras 3.01 and 7.04). Other
disputes arose after the project had been practically completed,
concerning construction defects; some of these disputes have not yet
been settled. The Bank has been closely following the events,
advising the concerned parties, from time to time, to solve first the
technical problems and sort out the legal aspects that may be involved
later (paras 3.01 and 7.07).
Procurement
8.06      Procurement under ICB procedures was satisfactorily carried
out. In retrospect, it appears that a better bid packaging could have
produced better results technically and have promoted the development
of the local construction industry (para 3.02).
Borrower 's Participation
8.07      The Bank should have encouraged a wider participation of
GPA's technical and operational departments with a double objective:
first, to facilitate transfer of technology and experience, and,
second, to make a better use of the knowledge of local conditions and
allow the designers to take into consideration the existing and
planned operational procedures.
Project Supervision
8.08      The Bank should have been more deeply involved in monitoring
GPA's training program. Compliance with the auditing covenant and the
implementation of cost accounting systems could also have been more
consistently pursued.
