MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO BANCO NACIONAL DE OBRAS Y SERVICTOS PUBLICOS, S.N.C.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR AN URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to Banco Nacional de Obras
y Servicios Publicos, S.N.C. (BANOBRAS) for US$125 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be repaid over 15 years,
including 3 years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate and would
help finance an Urban Transport Project.
2.        Background.  Approximately 68% of Mexico's 75 million people live
in urban centers of more than 2,500 inhabitants, while about 26% of the
population live in three metropolitan areas: Mexico City, Guadalajara and
Monterrey. As a result of natural population increase and immigration, these
areas have experienced population growth rates as high as 10% p.a. The
burden on urban transport infrastructure has been aggravated even more by
rapid motorization. This has led to congestion, excess fuel consumption,
deterioration of the infrastructure system, high levels of pollution, and
increased demand for federal subsidies. Responsibility for providing urban
transport services is shared among the federal, state and municipal levels of
government and the private sector with inadequate coordination. Planning and
execution of investments have emphasized capital intensive construction with
little attention to traffic system management concepts or evaluation of
low-cost alternatives for meeting transport demand. State owned public
transport companies, such as the Comision del Transporte del Estado de Mexico
(COTREM), have required large subsidies to cover operating and investment
costs for systems characterized by inefficient route structures, poor
maintenance practices, ineffective management, and antiquated equipment.
3.        Project Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a) improve the accessibility, quality of service, operational efficiency,
and costs of public transport; (b) rationalize tariff policies, improve the
financial and economic viability and sustainability of transport investments,
and encourage private sector participation; (c) preserve transport
infrastructure investments and reduce vehicle operating costs through
implementation of adequate cost-effective maintenance programs; and (d)
strengthen institutional capability, at the local as well as national level,
to provide effective policy development, planning, resource allocation,
traffic system implementation and operation, and project replicability.
4.        Project Description.  The proposed project would finance civil
works, materials and equipment, technical assistance and studies to initiate
and support a transport systems management approach to urban transport in the
Monterrey Metropdlitan Region (State of Nuevo Leon) and the urbanized area in
the State of Mexico. The project would include four integrated components:
(a) corridor improvements to improve traffic flow and reduce accidents and
pollution in major corridors, such as road widening, addition of turn lanes,



- 2 -
inter-section improvements, curbs, gutters and sidewalks, paving, and
construction of missing links, pedestrian overpasses, medians, and exclusive
bus ways; (b) public transport to increase the quality and efficiency
thereof, including: (i) bus system management. route rationalization and
tariff studies; (ii) construction of bus maintenance facilities, including
purchase of maintenance equipment; (iii) development of a program to optimize
bus maintenance procedures; (iv) development of integrated medium- and
long-range public transport plans; and (v) provision of credit for financing
bus purchases by private operators; (c) road maintenance to develop an
integrated road maintenance management program and implement the program's
recommendations; and (d) traffic system management to develop a program of
low-cost physical and administrative measures such as signing, marking,
signaling, minor geometric improvements, parking and turning regulations,
training in accident investigation, one way systems, and location of bus
stops to improve traffic flow and safety.  The project would also provide
technical assistance to the Transport Technical Directorate in BANOBRAS to
assist with project coordination and supervision and to analyze transport
problems in medium-sized cities in Mexico. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$294.9 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$110.5 million (37%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
Operations in Mexico are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps are
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6487-ME dated April 29, 1987
is being distributed separately.
$.        The proposed project would demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of an
integrated transport management approach, emphasizing increased efficiency in
the utilization of existing infrastructure as well as minor infrastructure
investments, in two major urban areas of Mexico. At the same time, the
project would strengthen the institutional framework at the federal, as well
as local, level to prepare and coordinate a similar approach to transport
problems in other urban areas in Mexico. Emphasis on increasing operational
efficiency of existing infrastructure as opposed to initiating new capital
intensive works, and raising fares to cover the costs of operating and
maintaining services thereby reducing subsidies are fully consistent with our
overall country assistance strategy. The project would address transport
problems in two major industrialized areas of Mexico, thereby complementing
Bank assistance to non-oil export development by helping to eliminate
transport bottlenecks which affect the efficient production of goods and
services in these areas.
6.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, BANOBRAS agreed: (a) to
submit to the Bank for review the annual urban transport investment program
in the States of Mexico and Nuevo Leon, including proposed allocations to
road rehabilitation and maintenance; (b) that any urban transport investment
exceeding the equivalent of US$10.0 million which would adversely affect the
project or the economic or financial viability of the states' urban transport
investment programs would constitute grounds for suspension of loan
disbursements; (c) that the State of Mexico would agree, under the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement, to cause COTREM to make substantial prograss towards
improving the financial condition of its bus operations within two years of
the effective date of the Loan Agreement by decreasing the ratio of total



-3-
working expenses to total operating revenues so as to achieve a ratio of not
higher than 100 percent, and to carry out management, operations, maint-
enance, tariff and financial studies, and implement appropriate action plans
to achieve this objective; (d) that the project studies would be initiated
and completed according to agreed implementation schedules within the first
18 months of the project, and relevant recommendations would be incorporated
in corresponding physical works programs; (e) to present, as a condition of
effectiveness, a formalized onlending agreement with either the State of
Mexico or Nuevo Leon and, as a condition of disbursement, the formalized
onlending agreement with the remaining state, and that non-compliance with
the onlending agreements would constitute grounds for suspension of loan
disbursements; (f) to onlend funds to the States of Mexico and Nuevo Leon at
a rate of 80% of ACF and to private bus operators for the purchase of buses
at a rate of ACF through June 30, 1989 and ACF+2 thereafter and to submit
evidence that the July 1, 1989 interest rate adjustment shall have been made
as a condition of disbursement against bus purchase subloans made after that
date; (g) as a condition of disbursement for the privately operated pilot
maintenance facility in Nuevo Leon, that both feasibility studies and the
execution of agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, which would ensure that
all costs of operation and debt service are borne by private bus operators,
are completed; (h) as a condition of disbursement for the Nuevo Leon
subproject, that maintenance operations facilities have been established and
agreements between the State of Nuevo Leon and the municipalities of the
Monterrey Metropolitan Region have been executed; and (i) as a condition of
disbursement for the purchase of buses under either subproject, to: (1)
complete and implement route reorganization studies; (2) complete tariff
studies and implement recommendations; and (3) complete financial analysis,
acceptable to the Bank, of each subborrower which would include
substantiation of full cost recovery of the bus operation.
7.        Justification.  Economic benefits would result from reduced vehicle
operating costs and reduction in the use of fuel, improved efficiency in bus
operations which would impact user costs and provide incentives for private
investment in system operation, and reduced depreciation of transport
infrastructure. The economic rates of return (ERR) for the appraised
components were calculated using projected user cost savings in total vehicle
operating costs, excluding passenger time savings. The overall ERR for the
project weighted by investment costs is 39%. About 428,000 urban poor
households (about 2.5 million people) would receive direct benefits under the
project, equivalent to an estimated 5.6% increase in household incomes.
Approximately 15,700 man-years of direct employment and approximately 2,250
man-years of indirect employment would be generated by the project. Finally,
the proposed project would have a positive impact on air quality by reducing
vehicle emissions through improved traffic flows.
8.        Risks.  The major risk is institutional as previous projects have
been adversely affected by institutional weaknesses within BANOBRAS.
However, BANOBRAS has recently been reorganized and strengthened, and the
project would provide technical assistance to the project coordinating unit
in BANOBRAS' Transport Technical Directorate. An interministerial committee
which would provide regular monitoring of the project, combined with
intensified supervision during early implementation, are expected to mitigate
the risks of delays in project execution, approvals, and disbursement which
could result from institutional weaknesses in BANOBRAS.

9.        Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
