Countrv Brief
THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA
I. THE ECONOMY
1.        A Country Economic Memorandum on Zambia (Report No. 5000-ZA) was
distritbuted to the Executive Directors nn April 24, 1984. A new CEM and a
Public Expenditure Review will be issued shortly. The analysis presented
here.is based on these reports' findings and on subsequent informatinn
received from the Zambian authorities. Country data sheets are attached as
Annex I.
2.        Zambia's economy Is heavily dependent on-external trade and on
government activity.  Iuports and exports each range between 30 and 40
percent nf GDP. Government expenditures amount to about 35 percent of GDP,
and the Government owns a majority share of mining and most manufacturing
enterprises. Mining, mainly copper, provides about 90 percent of foreign
exchange earnings and 10 percent of gross value added. Much economic
activity is dependent on expatriate technical, managerial, and
administrative skills.
Current Economic Situation
3.        For the past decade, the Zambian economy has been in a state of
contraction and the country is presently in the midst of an acute economic
and financial crisis. Relying on a single primary commodity for the bulk
of its expnrt earnings and with an industrial sector highly dependent on
imported inputs, the economy was vulnerable to the combination of
deteriorating export prices, increasing costs for imported goods and raw
materials, and regional unrest which occured over the past decade. Since
1975, when the economy's problems began with a sharp drop in the copper
price, Zambia's terms of trade have deteriorated steadily and by 1985 were
more than 70 percent below the average for the early 1970s. Although the
Government initially managed to slow the decline in economic activtty by
extensive foreign borrowing, contributing to the serious debt-servitting
problem that constrains the country's current options, real GDP has been on
a general downward trend since 1975, falling on average by about 1.5
percent per year.  With population growing by 3.1 percent per annum during
this period, real GDP per capita is now about 25 percent below the 1974
level. Following the World Bank Atlas methodology, GNP per capita was
estimated at US$470 in 1984, but It is much lower now as a result of che
substantial depreciation of the Kwacha in the past two years.
4.        The balance of payments has been In chronic disequilibrium since
1975, with current account deficits climbing to an average of 19 percent nf
GDP in 1980-82, before dropping to an average of about 10 percent of GDP in
the past three years. Nevertheless, the volume of imports declined



-2-
steadily and is now about 60 percent of the ievel in 1980 and 45 percent of
the level in L974. This has resulted in an economy-wide problem of severe
underutilization of capacity and, especially in the mining sector, a large
backlog of maintenance and rehabilitation expenditure that has contributed
directly to a declining trend in copper production and exports. In 1985,
copper exports fell to their lowest level (475,000 tonnes) since Zambia's
independence. The current level of imports, supported by external aid, is
now only barely adequate to sustain copper production and to provide a
critical minimum of inputs for the rest of the economy. The large current
account deficits have also led directly to Zambia's high level of external
indebtedness. At the end of 1985, Zambia's total external liabilities
stood at US$5.4 billion, including drawings from the IMF (US$640 million)
and 6verdue commercial payments of about US$600 million.  By comparison,
merchandise exports amounted to only about US$715 million in 1985.
5.        The decline in copper prices also severely affected Zambia's
fiscal and monetary positions. Prior to 1976, mineral taxes provided a
large share of government revenue, but because of the losses incurred by
the mining company in that and subsequent years, they became an
insignificant source of funding for the government. A new mineral export
tax was introduced in 1983, however, which now contributes about IJ percent
of Government's revenue. Deficit financing absorbed a large share of net
domestic credit and contributed to a sharp rise in consumer prices,
averaging 20 percent per annum during 1976-78 and 12 percent per annum in
1979-82. Price increases have accelerated in 1983 and 1984 to about 20
percent per annum, reflecting the decontrol of prices in December 1982 and
the devaluations of the Kwacha during the past two years. Currently,
inflation is running at an annual rate of about 30-40 percent due largely
to the sharp depreciation of the Kwacha from 2.2 per US$1 in October 1985,
just prior to the introduction of the foreign exchange auction, to over 10
per US$1 at present.
6.        There is no doubt that external factors have been an important
cause of Zambia's present economic difficulties. Apart from low copper
prices, severe droughts over 1982-84 have necessitated substantial food
imports. Nevertheless, inappropriate policies and shortcomings in economic
management have exacerbated the economic difficulties.  The main
deficiencies in economic policies were that: (i) pricing and subsidy
policies favored the urban consumer at the expense of the agricultural
producer; also, controlled industrial prices led to low profitability in
the manufacturing sector; (ii) tax incentives and low interest rates led to
a pattern of capital intensive investment; (iii) exchange rate and tariff
policies encouraged the use of artificially cheap imported raw materials
and other inputs.
Strategy for Economic Restructuring
7.        Zambia's economically exploitable ore reserves are only
sufficient to maintain present levels of copper production for another 15
years or so, after which production can be expected to decline sharply. In
the absence of new sources of income, employment and foreign exchange,
Zambia may expect a drastic fall in living standards and social well-being



3
by the turn of the century. However, Zambia hap the potential to develop
alternative sources of Income, employment, and exports. The greatest'
potential is in agriculture, where there are opportunities for. import
substitution (cotton, oilseeds, livestock, grains, forestry prnducts, and
fish) and for exports (beef, cotton, coffee, tobaccn, groundnuts, and
sugar). Once a good start Is made with agricultural development,
possihilities should be created for agro-based industries.
8.        The Government's development strategy, then, is to restore copper
production to the 530,000 tnune level,. the economically sustainable level
given the technical and other constraints on the industry in Zambia, while
at the same time accelerating development of the agricultural and
industrial sectors, with a heavy emphasis on production for export. This
strategy Is designed to maximize foreign exchange earnings from mining over
the medium term, while efforts are made to diversify production and exports
through growth in the other sectors of the economy. This will require a
susbstantial restructuring of production and employment, which can only be
accompllshed in the long run. The Government initiated this effort in 1983
with the introduction of a far-reaching program of economic reforms that
has received the full support of the international donor community. The
authorities also introduced, with support from the IMF, a comprehensive
stabilitzation program deslgned to restore the country's financial
viability.
9.        The main content of the economic restructuring package may be
summarized as follows:
-- Providing a system of incentives to producers and exporters of
agricultural and industrial products in which production is
responsive to market forces;
-- Ensuring the competitiveness of exports through an active
exchange rate policy;
- Using tariffs and interest rate policies to reverse past
trends of Import dependence and capital intensity;    t.
-- Liberalizing administrative restrictions an foreign trade and
the licensing of production, in order to improve the
allocation of resources and to encourage investment in
produrtive activities;
- Reducing the Government's deficit and recourse to domestic
bank borrowing by reducing expenditure on personnel costs,
subsidies and other non-development relpced activities;
- Improving planning and budgetary procedures to shift resources
to productive uses and economic investments;
-- Allowing greater competition in the procurement and selling of
food crops. The National Agricultural Marketing Board
(NAWBOARD), the Government's agricultural marketing agencv,



-4-
will move towards the role of buyer and seller of last resort,
using a system of floor and ceiling prices for agricultural
produce and inputs, respectively;
-- Strengthenlng the techntcal and managerial capacity of Zambia
Industrial and Mining Corporation (ZIMCO), which Is the
holding company of most state-controlled enterprises;
Restructuring the energy sector to bring about lesser
dependence on imported oil.
10.       In. the past two years, the Government has made significant
progress in translating the above policies into tangible action. Stand-by
arrangements were agreed with the IMF in 1983, and again in 1984.  Unider
these programs, the Kwacha was first linked to a basket of currencies and
was depreciated in a gradual manner through October 1985 when a foreign
exchange auction was introduced, resulting in a furtber substanttal
reduction in the value of the Kwacha. Because the Government has been
successful in holding wage increases to considerably less than rises in the
cost of living, it has maintained the benefits of devaluation in real
terms, which has improved the competitiveness of exports. Debt
reschedullnz with members of the Paris Club, commercial banks and non-OECD
governments covering obligations due in 1983 and 1984 was also obtained.
In early 1986, following approval of a two year IMF standby arrangement,
the Paris Club agreed to reschedule Zambia's 1985 arrears to the Club
members, plus all obligations falling due in 1986.
11.       In terms of improving conditions for longer-term growth, the most
significant of the above financial measures was no doubt the exchange rate
adiustments. But other measures with significant long-term impact have
been introduced as well. Since December 1982, the Government has abolished
the control of all wholesale and retail prices except for maize flour used
In the production of roller mea), the basic staple consumed by the lower
income segments of society. Over the last three years, producer prices for
most agricultural crops have been increased considerably in real terms, and
they now approximate border prices. The Government has also improved the
incentives affecting foreign trade by introducing a foreign exchangd;          -
retention scheme and concessional tax rates for non-traditional exports,
and by imposing a minimum tariff on many non-dutiable imports which should
reduce the high rates of effective protection afforded to import-intensive
industries.
12.       The Government's efforts over the past two years represent a
major reformulation of economic policies and incentives. This progress Is
currently in danger of being set back, however, due to insufficient foreign
exchange to maintain production (and exports) and to honor external debt
obligations. On one hand, the Government- wishes to improve the supply of
essential consumer goods by providing inputs to the productive sectors and
thus show some benefits from the considerable sacrifices its policies have
required of the population. In particular, a rapid increase in the
consumer price of maize (resulting from higher producer prices, drought
induced imports and lower subsidies) has heightened the political



sensitivity of further reforms that may result in higher prices for other
goods and services. On the other hand, the Government must allocate
considerable foreign exchange to debt service that cannot be rescheduled,
13.       Along with the new exchange rate system, the Government
introduced last October a wide range of supporting measures, including
decontrol of interest rates, conversion of the import licensing system to
one of import registration, and further measures to reduce government
expenditure and borrowing from the banking system. There remains, however,
a major requirement for the success of the economic reform program. Xbe
Government's capacity for policy analysis and formulation, for
administering development programs and for mobilizing and monitoring the
flow of domestic and external resources needs to strengthened
considerably. The Government will need to focus on this crucial issue in
the context of a long-term program of training and institutional
development, while also giving top priority to improving immediately the
policy formulation and implementation capacities of such key agencies as
the Ministry of Finance and Planning and Bank of Zambia which are essential
to the success of the whole reform program.
Growth Prospects
14.       Zambia's external payments situation deteriorated further in 1986
and the worsened prospects for mineral exports in the near term have worked
to delay the recovery process. On the other hand, however, more rapid
growth'than was anticipated has occured in industry and agriculture in
response to favorable weather conditions and the reform measures, and the
response of non-treaditional exports to the improved incentives and
exchange rate has been quite promising. It seems reasonable to expect,
therefore, modestly positive growth in 1987 and 1988, followed by somewhat
more rapid growth in ensuing years. The main obstacle to more rapid growth
continues to be the excessive amount of debt service falling due in the
medium term, which prevents imports from reaching the levels required for
faster growth. Resolution of this problem will require a high and
sustained level of commitments and disbursements from the donor community,
on concessional terms and in quick-disbursing form, preferably in support
of the auction. It will also require continued access to IMF resources.
But most significantly, it will require an extraordinary restructuring of
Zambia's external debt to bring about a large reduction in the debt service
ratio. The amount of restructuring provided by the annual rescheduling
exercises of past years although helpful will simply not suffice, since
imports will not be able to reach the necessary levels.
15.       For the five year period, 1986-90, the Zambian economy should be
able to achieve GDP growth (at market prices) of about 3.6 percent per
annum on average, which would only maintain per capita income at current
levels. Because of the difficulties facing-the economy in the next couple
of years, especially in the mining sector, the rate of growth is not likely
to exceed 2.5 percent per annum on average, but as productive efficiency
rises and the confidence of the private sector is restored by the reform
program, there should be an upturn in economic activity in the later years
of this period. To achieve this level of GDP growth, gross investment



-6-
would have to increase by about 10 percent per annum in real terms,
reaching 16 percent of GDP by 1990 from 12 percent in 1985.. At this level,
the investment ratio is still low. However, it is the most that is
achievable given the external constraints on the economy. On' the other
hand, a good part of the gains in GDP over the next few years are expected
to come from increased productivity of investment due to improved resource
allocation and greaLer selectivity in capital projects by the public
sector. While a major effort is required to generate domestically the
savings needed to support this level of investment, a substantial part of
the investment will have to be financed from abroad.
16.       There is no question but that the social cost of adjustment in
Zambia will be heavy, particularly for the next five years and perhaps for
the next decade. Coming on top of the large drop in living etandards that
has already occurred, this will be an especially difficult period for the
Zambian people. However, it is equally certain that without these
adjustments living standards would decline even further and there would be
little or no prospects for improvement in the future. With the adjustment
program per capita income will be stabilized in the medium term and rise in
the longer run, which would not be the case without the program. Steps are
being taken to soften the impact of these measures on the lowest income
segments of society, e.g., the maize subsidy is being retained for this
group, assistance is being provided for resettlement to rural areas,
incentives are being given for investment in lower income areas, etc. Most
importantly, the adjustment program itself will ensure increasing supplies
of basic consumer goods at reasonable prices, which would not be the case
otherwise.
Creditworthiness
17.       Scheduled service on public and publicly guaranteed (PPG)
external debt will remain over US$400 million per annum for the next three
years, or about 40 percent of export earnings at today's copper prices. Of
this amount, about US$65 million per annum is due to the World Bank Group,
including the IPC. (The Bank currently holds US$467 million, or 15 percent
of Zambia's US$3.2 billion PPG debt disbursed and outstanding). In y
addition, about US$200 million per annum in payments is due to the IMF and
another US$50-70 million per annum on Zambia's pipeline of commercial
payment arrears and short-term borrowings. In total, scheduled debt
service will amount to over US$700 million per annum for the next three
years, and it will thus be necessary for the Government to continue its
financial stabilization policies in cooperation with the IMP and to seek
debt relief through further rescheduling. Even with maximum debt relief
under rescheduling arrangement similar to those of the past, however,
Zambia will continue to owe over US$400 million per annum in debt service
that cannot be rescheduled. The Government.should, therefore, avoid as
much as possible borrowing on commercial terms, and additional borrowing
should carry sufficiently long grace periods and maturities.
18.       In the longer term, the restoration of Zambia's creditworthiness
depends on the vigor with which the Government continues to pursue its
economic restructuring policies. The Government is well underway in



-7-
adjusting Its economic policies and Is fully committed tn take further
steps towards economic reform and the restructurlng of Zambia's productive
industries. Assuming successful economic policies, careful financial
management and adequate external assistance, Zambia will be able to achieve
a sufficient measure of export growth and diversification within the next
decade to allow the country to resume normal debt servicing.
II. BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ZAMBIA
19.       Since 1956, the Bank Group has made 28 loans and 14 credits to
Zambia, totalling about U$780 million (net of cancellations). Two
additional Bank loans were made to Zambia and Zimbabwe jointly to finance
shared power facilities on the Zambezi River. Fourteen loans and six
credlts have financed energy, transportation, communications and rural
water supply projects. Four loans and one credit for education have helped
expand Zambia's secondary and higher education systems, teacher training,
and commercial, agricultural and technical education systems. Two program
loans have helped Zambia maintain its development program in periods of
severe economic dislocation. In agriculture, forestry and fisheries, six
loans and six credits have been for industrial forest plantations,
livestock, commercial crops, integrated family farning, coffee production,
smallholder dairy development and fisheries development. Agricultural
projects in the Easterr. arnd Southern Provinces are assisting smallholder
farmers, and an Agricultural Rehabilitation Project is providing inputs to
the sector in support of policy reforms. Other loans have assisted
Zambia's urban development program, copper mining and, through the
Development of Bank of Zambia, its manufacturing, agricultural and
industrial sectors. A technical assistance credit is helping the
Government improve its planning and project preparation. An engineering
credit is supporting a project to assess the rehabilitation requirements of
the TAZAMA oil pipeline.
20.       The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has invested about
USS87 million in 11 projects in Zambia since 1972. Two investments each
were in shoe manufacturing, in a packagtng materials plant and in tettiles -
and fiber production, and one each in the Development Bank of Zambia,
tourism development, food production and processing, cobalt production, and
copper prodtuctlon.
21.       The implementation of Bank-assisted projects in Zambia has
deteriorated significantly in recent years, and serious delays have
been experienced in the execution of a number of these projects. There are
several reasons for this, the main one heing the lack of budgetary
resources with which to finance local counterpart expenditures and to
prefinance local expenditures which are subsequently to be reimbursed by
the Bank loan. Most seriously affected have been the Bank's agricultural
projects for which funds, although budgeted, have not been released to the
executing agencies for several months. Other reasons for the lagging
iuiplementatiov of projects are ineffective project management and
inadequate inter-agency coordination. The Bank-assisted agricultural



prolects, whtch require careful management and effective coordination have
suffered from these problems, am has the Third Highway Project.
22.       The deterioration of project implementation has, as expected,
substantially reduced the rate of disbursements nn Bank Group loans and
credits. As of September 30, 1985 a total of US$87 million of loans and
US$128 million of credits remained undisbursed. To alleviate the problem,
provision Is heing made for technical assistance in projects to *trengthen
implementing agencies and increased use Is being made of the Resident
Mission in monitortng project execution. Revolving funds arm belng
established under new and nngoing projoets which should sase the
Government's financial burden and accelerate disbursaments. In addition,
estimates of counterpart funds required and when the funds should be made
avatlable are beina prepared by Bank/IDA staff well in advance of their
need to allow implementing agencies as much lead time as possible to plan
for these expenditures. As of December 1984, IBRD loans disbursed and
outstanding were about 12 percent of Zambia's total medlum and long-term
debt disbursed and outstanding.
23.       The Bank Group's strate*y in Zambia Is to support the country's
efforts to diversify and increase economic efficiency. Raising the
efficiency of the mining Industry through the Export Rehabtlitation and
Diversification loan so that the industry may contribute resources to
diversification programs was the first step in carrying out this strategy.
Subsequent operations, such as the Agrtcultural Rehabilitation Project and
the Industrial Reorientation Project are focusing on improving sector
policies in agriculture and industry, which are the sectors with the best
potenttal for production and export growth and for employment creation.
The Group's strategy also gives priority to programs to increase the use of
indigenous energy resources and to ralse the efficiency of transportation
services. Emphasis will be given to rehabilitation and maintenance, rather
than expansion, of infrastructure and Bank Group assistance is expected to
include a stgnificant proportion of quick-disbursing resources. Support
for addressing the longer term development constraints, e.g., Improving
economic management, education, population, health, etc., is also part of
the strategy.  Policy and institutional reform programs in each of the
sectors, as well as on the macroeconomic level, are heing agreed with the
Government. Through organizing and chairing the regular meetings of the
Consultative Group for Zambia, the Bank is assisting the Government in
coordinating the country's economic rehabilitation program and investment
needs with the International donor community. At its last meeting, which
was convened on an emergency basis in December 1985, the Consultative Group
endorsed the Government's recent economic measures, in particular the
foreign exchange auction system, and announced substantial multi- and
bilateral financial support for the Government's program.

FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO TEE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA
FOR A SECOND COFFEE PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to Zambia
for SDR 16.9 million (US$20.4 million equivalent) is submitted for
approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and help
finance the development of the coffee industry in the country.
2.        Background.  Zambia is heavily dependent on external trade.
Copper provides more than 90% of the country's foreign exchange earnings.
Agriculture in Zambia, while providing a living to about 60% of the total
population of 6.4 million and employing 67% of the labour force, only
contributes 17% of GDP, indicating a low level of rural productivity and
income. Agricultural output grew at about 2.8% per annum during 1965-85,
which was less than the population growth rate of 3.4%. Consequently,
self-sufficiency in major food crops declined and agricultural exports
remainedl at less than 2t of the total export earnings.  This development is
of particular concern because agriculture is the sector with the best
potential for growth and income generation in the short and medium term.
It is also the most promising sector for diversifying the economy and the
country's foreign exchange earnaings away from mining. Recognizing this the
Government has recently taken a number of actions which should help :Improve
agriculture's performance. The most important ones are: (a) introduction
of a foreign exchange auction system; (b) progressive decontrol of crop
prices and interest rates; (c) encouragement of private sector investments
in agricultural production and agro-processing; and (d) increased emphasis
on agricultural research, extension and training.
3.        Zambia's coffee production was small until 1976.  Since that
time, due mainly to the implementation of an IDA assisted coffee project
and an IFC supported coffee estate development project, coffee output has
been rising and is expected to rise to levels that would satisfy local
consumption and leave a small surplus for export. The IDA assisted project
concentrated on the establishment of 450 ha of coffee and construction of a
coffee factory by a parastatal organization, Zambia Coffee Company, Ltd.
CZCCL). Most of the project's physical targets have been achieved, but
project implementation has been slow, the irrigation system requires major
improvements, and management performance and agricultural operations are
not yet satisfactory.  The major reasons for the disappointing performance
*can be traced to unrealistic appraisal estimates, shortage of funds, lack
of Zambian experience in coffee production, processing and marketing, and a
worsening economic situation in the country-resulting in shortages of
materials and suppl±es. Recently, because of the Government's incentive
programs to stimulate export crops, interest in coffee production has been
growing rapidly among private coffee farmers large and small. Efforts to
expand production have, however, been constrained by lack of experience in
coffee growing and processing, inadequate and unfocussed extension support,
insufficient credit availability and uncertainty with respect to a
long-term government coffee policy.
This document has a restricted disnibution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contenu may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



-2-
4.        Prolect Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to overcome
the above nentioned constratnts with the objective to generate additional
foreign exchange earnings and increase farmers' incomes. It would assist
the Government in creating a suttable institutional framework for the
establishment of a coffee industry in Zambia and in building up national
expertise In management, productinn, processing and marketing of coffee for
the export market. At full development, the project would increase the
annual coffee production by about 4,700 tons of high quality arahica coffee
primarily for export. The proiect would also provide support to address
prohlems being experienced under the first Coffee Project.
5.        Proiect Description.  Unlike the first project which was oriented
towards parastatal estate development, the proposed project would concen-
trate on coffee development by smallholders, emergent farmers, and
commercial farmers.  It would be implemented over a seven-year period and
comprise: (a) the provision of credit to eligible farmers through the
commercial banking system for establishment of irrigated coffee and
installation of processing facilities; (b) the strengthening of the Lint
Company of Zambia (LINTCO) and the training of its staff in order to
improve coffee extension nlipport; (c) assistance and training to the coffee
research establishment in support of the proposed national Agricultural
Research and Extension Proiect; (d) technical assistance and training to
further improve coffee markecing; and (e) assistance to ZCCL to improve its
viability and management capabilities. The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$34.9 million with a foreign exchange component of US$21.8
million (62%). Additional funding requirements for ZCCL (USS3.0 million)
are expected to come from private sector equity partners and ZCCL's own
resources. Details of this arrangement, which must be acceptable to IDA,
would follow the recommendations of a corporate plan, currently being
drafted under a PPF and scheduled for completion in November 1986. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursement and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Zambia are given in
Scheduiles C and D respectively. A general map of Zambia is also attached.
The Staff Appraisal Repnrt, No. 6236-ZA, dated July 1986 is being
distributed separately. To ensure timely start of project implementation
and set-up of suitable arrangements for smooth prnject implementation,
including the establishment of appropriate long-term lending procedures by
participating banks, two Project start-up Facilitators have been engaged
under a Proiect Preparation Facility. Under the same facility technical
assistance has been recruited by ZCCL to help the Company resolve its
manazement and operational problems.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  In line with the country's
lony-term development ohjectives and the Bank Group's lending strategy in
favor of agricultural diversification, the proposed project would help to
expand Zambia's agricultural base and to diversify its sources of foreign
exchange earnings.  Zambia being a land-locked country would benefit from
producing high value per unit weight products such as coffee. The project



-3-
builds upon the experience gained under the first coffee production project
and would benefit from IDA's institutional knowledge of the world coffee
market and the coffee industry in other producer countries. This
experience and knowledge have been helpful in the design of a suitable
coffee policy and of institutional arrangements which have the ingredients
necessary for a successful coffee industry. These include concentration On
the private sector for coffee production and processing, and on areas which
are agroclimatically most suitable for coffee growing. The policy also
provides for private sector control over coffee marketing by a coffee
growers association. IDA's continued association with the sub-sector would
assist in the adoption of suitable technology especially with regard to
irrigation and coffee processing systems for different farmers and farmer
groups. The project would complement IDA's support for the agricultural
sector and for agricultural research and extension.
7.        Agreed Actions.  All major issues have been resolved and agreed
with Government. They concern: (i) adoption of the agreed coffee policy
and establishment of a Coffee Board to assist in formulating rules and
regulations governing the coffee industry (the coffee policy became
effective in September 1986 and will form the basis of a coffee act
currently under preparation); (Ci) establishment of a Project Management
and Coordinating CommIttee to ensure coordination among all institutions
responsible for project implementation; and (iii) the currency denomination
of sub-loans and on-lending rates. Farmers may choose between loans
denominated in foreign or local currency. Interest rates on foreign
currency sub-loans to farmers would be in accordance with the Bank's policy
on lending to commercial entities. Interest on local currency loans would
be considerably higher than on foreign loans, reflecting the exchange
risks. They would be in line with rates charged for similar loans for
other purposes and would be expected to remain positive in real terms.
Currently lending rates are decontrolled and are positive on an annualized
basis. Actions acceptable to IDA have also been taken to resolve ZCCL's
principal operational and management problems. These include: (a) the
preparation by ZCCL of a short-terr action plan - which has been reviewed
and found acceptable by IDA; (b) the engagement of a consultant firm to
provide management assistance starting in June 1986 (financed under the
above mentioned PPF); and (c) the selection of consultants for the
preparation of a long-term corporate plan, including a five-year
investment/expenditure program, for consideration of private sector equity
involvement in ZCCL financed by the Commonwealth Secretariate. ZCCL at
present is the sole marketing agent of Zambian coffee and is doing a good
job.  During the initial stages of project implementation this position
would not change. Subsequently, the newly formed Zambia Coffee Growers
Association would take over this responsibility and ZCCL would become a
coffee producer and processor.  The Zambia Growers Association was Iutuded
in August 1986 and is an association mainly consisting of private sector
coffee farmers.

8.        Justification.  Irrigated coffee in Zambia is both economically
and financially viable. Assuming that the International Coffee Agreement
(ICA) remains, the economic rate of return for the entire project is
calculated at 24%. As a small coffee producer, Zambia receives special
arrangements to market its coffee under the ICA and no significant problems
are seen in marketing the project output. Depending upon size of
operation, the financial rate of return calculated for participating
farmers is between 26% and 32% with a projected average price for 1995
between US$2,500 and US$3,000 per torn.  The project would furthermore
provide the country with an additional source of foreign exchange to offset
some of the lost income from mining, raise rural incomes and provide
employment opportunities.
9.        Risks.  The project risks are mainly revolving around the
Government's commitment to economic reforms and timely implementation of
the coffee policy. An outbreak of coffee berry disease could reduce
yields, but this risk could be overcome by increased crop spraying.
Without an ICA, it is estimated that export prices would drop to about 10%
below the projected market price, but even under this scenario the project
would remain viable. Remaining problems of the first coffee project have
been fully addressed, and lessons learned from the first project have been
incorporated in project design.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
