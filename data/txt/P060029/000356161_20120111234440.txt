1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The origins of the Sustainable Forestry Development Project go back to the disastrous
floods in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers in 1998, an
event which resulted in the Government‟s Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP).
The NFPP was a far-reaching and ambitious initiative, which, inter alia, banned
commercial logging in natural forests in Southwest and Northeast China; expanded the
protection and rehabilitation of natural forests and the retirement of economically
marginal farmland to protect key watersheds in upland areas; and promoted afforestation
to meet increasing industrial timber demand. It also included a restructuring program of
state forest enterprises in key forestry regions, and the transfer of forest workers to
alternative employment and livelihoods. While the NFPP helped promote environmental
rehabilitation and reduce forest degradation, the exhaustion of timber resources from
natural forests and the logging ban resulted in temporary wood shortages, higher wood
prices, and surging timber imports. In response to this, the Government put specific
emphasis on increasing wood supplies through afforestation.

The CAS embraced the NFPP by including protecting the environment and preserving
productive natural forest and biodiversity of global importance, and by promoting
sustainable natural resources management. The Project, which was launched in January
2003, was designed as a contribution to the implementation of the NFPP. The Bank, with
its long involvement in the forestry sector, was well placed to help the Borrower
implement a comprehensive forest sector intervention to advance reforms and help
redress some of the economic hardships to communities brought about by logging
restrictions and enterprise restructuring. In addition to providing IBRD-financing for the
Project‟s Plantation Establishment (PE) component, the Bank was also well placed to
attract other donors and funding sources. Specifically, the Bank mobilized grant funding
from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for the Project‟s Protected Area
Management (PAM) Component, and facilitated the involvement and contribution of the
European Union (EU) to the Project‟s Natural Forest Management (NFM) Component.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

The Project Development Objective was to ensure that viable, participatory, and locally
managed systems for conservation, management, and sustainable use of forest resources
and associated biodiversity were developed and adopted in project sites to promote
sustainable development and management of forest resources and protect the natural
environment.1 The practices developed under the Project and applied for the protection

 The ICR follows the PDO statement of the Project Appraisal Document. The PDO statement in the Loan
Agreement is worded slightly differently but this does not constitute any material difference.



                                                18
and sustainable management of natural forest resources in pilot areas in China would
provide models for wider replication under the NFPP. The PDO was to be achieved
through three components: (1) Natural Forest Management (EUR16.9 million, EU-
financed); (2) Protected Area Management (US$16 million, GEF-financed); and (c)
Plantation Establishment (US$93.9 million, IBRD-financed).

The Project‟s Key Performance Indicators were: (a) 6 natural forest management areas
under effective management; (b) 13 nature reserves management improved by 1.5 points
by end of Project; (c) Project generates 13.3 million m3 of timber and 2.73 million metric
tons of bamboo by December 31, 2025, and CNY 1.1 billion net income from tree crop
production by December 31, 2022; and (d) 6,900 villages benefiting from participation in
Project activities by end of February 28, 2009. Key Performance Indicators by
component are listed in Table 1.

1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives and Key Indicators

The Global Environment Objective (GEO) was to foster improved conservation and
sustainable management of biodiversity in remaining natural forest areas by ensuring
effective in situ protection of threatened and globally important forest habitats and rare
and endemic species. Indicators included: (a) over 1 million hectares of important
biodiversity areas brought under improved management; (b) substantial involvement and
participation of local communities in nature reserve management planning and
implementation; (c) reduction of community reliance on forest resources inside
biodiversity important zones; and (d) increase in local government‟s capacity to supervise,
monitor, and implement conservation and sustainable resource use activities.

1.4 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

The PDO and indicators as approved remained unchanged.

1.5 Revised GEO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

The GEO and indicators as approved remained unchanged.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries,

At appraisal, the total number of beneficiaries was estimated to include 687,500
households or approximately 2.75 million individuals. The beneficiary groups included a
large share of women and ethnic minorities. Of the 55 recognized ethnic minority groups
a total of 18 resided in Project counties and sites. Project activities and benefits were to
accrue to collective forest farms and local communities with social and economic
dependency on natural resource extraction.

Approximately 29,000 beneficiaries were to benefit from the NFM component of which
most were dependent on forest resources and belonged to ethnic minorities. Under the
PAM component, support was to be provided to 13 nature reserves of international
biodiversity significance located in Sichuan (5 sites), Hunan (2 sites) and Hainan (1 site).
Under the PE component, primary beneficiaries were estimated to comprise 666,900
small farmers and displaced forestry workers in either single households, groups of small
households with shareholding arrangements, and those in collective farms. These were to
benefit from on-farm employment and loans to create new plantations, economic tree
crops and small primary processing facilities. Training was also to be provided to
improve the quality and sustainable productivity of planted areas through best practice,
and to upgrade both post-harvesting facilities and marketing arrangements. Secondary
beneficiaries were staff of the provincial, county and township forestry departments,
which were to benefit from training and exposure to best forestry practice/innovation.

1.7 Original Components

The Sustainable Forestry Development Project was designed along three complementary
components.

The NFM component would support the development and dissemination of new
sustainable management techniques in natural forest areas protected under the NFPP and
community development and livelihood enhancement activities targeting selected rural
communities. The component would be implemented in Hainan, Hunan, and Sichuan
Province, covering six pilot counties with approximately 203,000 hectares of natural
forest representing major ecological forests types in the respective provinces.

It originally included sub-components on: (a) natural forest management, including the
development of forest management plans through resource assessment, zoning, and forest
classification; yield regulation and control; policy studies relating to opportunities for
forest ecological benefit compensation systems, marketing, and market intelligence
systems; implementation of forest management plan through demonstrations, non-timber
forest products domestication, establishment of yield plots to model growth and yield and
assessment of biodiversity change; and monitoring and evaluation; (b) community
development, including small household loans, household training, implementation of
small village infrastructure based on village development plans developed by the Project
communities and associated technical studies (e.g., rural energy, animal grazing, and so
on); (c) training and dissemination directed at forest administration staff and the broader
public; and (d) forest management training to employees and vocational training to laid-
off workers of State Forest Enterprises in the Project areas to upgrade their skills and
assist efforts to find alternative employment.

The PAM component would support conservation and improved management of
biodiversity of global importance in selected, high priority nature reserves. The
component was to be implemented in Gansu, Sichuan, Hubei, Yunnan, Guizhou and
Hainan, covering 13 national and provincial nature reserves with globally important
biodiversity.

Sub-components would include: (a) participatory nature reserve planning and
management (GEF US$5.4 million), including management plan development and
implementation, ecological baseline mapping, strengthening of field-level management,
targeted applied research, and biodiversity surveys of Western Sichuan; (b) community-
based nature conservation (GEF US$5.1 million) including co-management activities
that link biodiversity conservation with sustainable income generation, energy
conservation demonstration, wildlife management to reduce damage to local community
livelihoods, community conservation education and awareness, and delivery of
sustainable alternatives and enhancement of community skills; (c) training and capacity
building (GEF US$2.1 million) to strengthen institutions responsible for biodiversity
conservation and management at the provincial and nature reserve levels; and (d) project
management, monitoring and evaluation (GEF US$3.4 million), including training in
support of Project implementation, policy studies, and monitoring and evaluation.



                                            21
The PE component, the largest investment component, would support the production of
wood to meet the growing gap between domestic supply and demand, generate new
employment and income for forestry farms and rural households and improve
environmental management. The component covered 107 counties in 10 provinces, these
being key NFPP provinces were the potential for plantation forestry and economic tree
crops was greatest, and where institutional capacity was adequate because of previous
experience in Bank-financed forestry projects. Participating provinces included Sichuan,
Hunan, Henan, Shanxi, Hebei, Hubei, Anhui, Shandong, Liaoning, and Gansu. Hainan
province withdrew from the plantation program during preparation.

The PE component included the following sub-components:

(a) Establishment of timber plantations (US$48.71 million) to reduce pressure on natural
forests by increasing wood supplies from sustainable plantations. Specifically, the sub-
component would finance the establishment of 115,100 ha of new plantations; create new
standards for sustainable plantation forestry; provide models of best practice; raise
plantation productivity by adopting optimal management regimes; promote the use of
genetically superior planting stock, raise rural incomes; and improve prospects for
sustainability through best environmental practice.

(b) Establishment of economic tree crops (US$63.95 million) to provide alternative
incomes for retrenched workers and farmers and to diversify the rural economy by
establishing 57,900 ha of horticultural crops, including apple, apricot, pear, plum,
pomegranate, prickly ash, Chinese date, grape, chestnut, walnut, and tea based on farmer
preference, proven performance, market demand, and site suitability. Large areas of
monocultures were discouraged to favor biodiversity, reduce pest outbreak, and avoid
supply gluts.

(c) Pre-commercial thinning (US$13.33 million) to improve quality and health of 61,300
ha of existing 8-10 year old plantations which had not been thinned because of low
returns and a lack of farmer know-how. This included both farmer and state forest
enterprise plantations with the purpose to demonstrate best practice, and provide
information on optimum thinning intensity. Main species included were Chinese Fir
(Cunninghamia lanceolata), Bamboo, Masson Pine (Pinus massoniana), Poplar (Populus
spec.), Slash pine (P. elliottii), Loblolly Pine (P. contorta), and Larch (Larix spec).

(d) Technical Support Services (US$60.80 million) to enhance sustainability, raise
productivity, and improve environmental protection by strengthening technical support
programs for afforestation and horticulture. Activities to be financed under this sub-
component included:

        (i) Planting Stock Development to raise nursery and plantation productivity
through the use of genetically superior planting stock and the adoption of advanced
nursery practice. Support was provided to existing and new nurseries belonging to both
collective and state forest farm nurseries. Sixty four nurseries were provided for, and 265
million genetically superior seedlings were to be produced. Nurseries were also to be



                                            22
used to train government staff and farmers in best silvicultural and environmental
practice. The Project funded nursery infrastructure, seedling production, and training.
        (ii) Training and Extension, using existing forestry and agriculture extension
networks to disseminate project experience, promote best silvicultural practice, and
strengthen environmental safeguards.
        (iii) Rural Infrastructure for both township and village levels including: the
construction of forest trails, sheds, wells, and access paths; and the provision of small sub
loans for post-harvest treatment, transport and, in the last two years of the project,
marketing of horticulture crops.
        (iv) Monitoring and Evaluation to be carried out by the PMC and provincial and
county PMOs. Monitoring and reporting procedures were put in place to track physical
progress, assess quality and confirm compliance with environmental and social
safeguards, such as pest incidence, pesticide use, site selection and participation.

1.8 Revised Components

The NFM component was implemented by the EU under a separate implementation
arrangement through the SFA‟s Natural Forest Protection Center and was not under the
supervision responsibility of the World Bank. The specific rationale for these separate
supervision arrangements are not documented in World Bank Aide Memoires. The NFM
component was extended by two years in 2008 to account for long start-up delays of
implementation. For a further discussion see Annexes 2 and 8.

At the request of Government, the PAM component was extended by one year from its
original closing date of August 31, 2009 to August 31, 2010. The purpose of this
extension was to accommodate for unexpected implementation delays caused by the May
2008 earthquake that affected all Project-supported nature reserves in Sichuan and Gansu
provinces. A reallocation of GEF grant proceeds between disbursement categories took
place with the purpose to reallocate some savings and provide some additional support to
those earthquake-affected reserves that had lost building infrastructure and equipment.

Some minor changes under the PE component included the following: an even more
positive attitude of farmers towards timber plantations resulted from the introduction of
longer term (70 years) tenure for forest land; a sharp rise in wood prices; and the higher
risks which farmers associated with economic tree crops. To cater to this change in
preference, the MTR decreased targets for economic tree crops from 57,938 ha to 42,000
ha, and increased targets for timber plantations from 115,100 ha to 135,100 ha, and pre-
commercial thinning from 61,300 ha to 82,850 ha along with reallocations of funds from
sub-component 2 to sub-component 1. Sub-component 1 also benefited from funds being
switched from the purchase of goods and vehicles, marketing infrastructure, nursery
development, study tours and technical assistance.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Preparation took three years, but this is not considered excessive given the size,
complexity and coverage of the Project. Preparation also took place when the Bank was
updating its policy for forestry (approved in 2002), and when Bank forestry projects were
coming under intense scrutiny both inside and outside the Bank. An Environmental
Category A rating also meant that a full Environmental and Social Impact Assessment
(ESIA) was needed, and an initially differing opinion between the World Bank and the
Government over the appropriate environmental rating of the Project took time to resolve
and temporarily delayed negotiations. The Project background analysis, however, was
sound, the sector issues were clearly identified, institutional absorptive capacity was
correctly assessed, lessons learned from previous Bank project were taken into account,
and the ESIA was detailed and thorough.

Design of the Project was sound in that it supported the implementation of the NFPP
through a comprehensive sector approach by: (a) creating viable and sustainable supplies
of wood products to relieve pressure on native forests; (b) providing alternative incomes
through diversification into timber plantations and economic tree crops; (c) developing
and piloting models for the commercial sustainable forest management of natural forest
resources; and (d) improving management capacity and in-situ conservation in key forest
biodiversity areas through best practice. The Project was also careful to focus in areas
where the need was greatest, where markets existed and where conditions were favorable
for timber plantations and economic tree crops. The subcomponents chosen under each
component to achieve the PDO were effective in that they provided the appropriate blend
of interventions and safeguards.

Government commitment and the capacity of implementing agencies were correctly
assessed, and a strong sense of ownership was fostered by adopting a community based
approach. Ownership was further strengthened by having a Project Leading Group at the
county level, and by having the County Forestry Bureaus, Townships and farmers
responsible for implementation. Project launch workshops and staff training in
procurement also facilitated implementation.

The Project was designed as an integrated project to promote natural forest management,
biodiversity conservation, and timber resource development. It had a single overarching
PDO and M&E framework described in the PAD. The Project involved three financiers,
IBRD, GEF, and the EU, each of which financed one component of the Project. As
envisaged at appraisal, the EU financed Component 1-Natural Forest Management in its
entirety with a total grant contribution of EUR16.9 million, which was provided in form
of parallel financing.

One weakness in the Project‟s design was that due to this parallel financing arrangement,
the NFM component was conceived and implemented as a free-standing project, titled
„EU-China Natural Forest Management Project (NFMP)‟, separate from the main



                                           24
Project. This arrangement and the implementation of the NFM component through the
SFA‟s Natural Forest Protection Center resulted in different supervision arrangements
and modalities between the Bank-supervised and EU-financed components and precluded
the effective coordination and exchange between components during implementation and
completion. A second weakness detected in the design was the choice of some of the
impact indicators. Indicators, which cannot be measured before the years 2022 and 2025,
are of limited usefulness, as is the use of monetary values so far in the future.

The risk analysis was thorough. Only two risks identified during preparation proved to
be real, that is, a possible shortage of counterpart funds, and an over-supply of economic
tree products (fruits etc). Both events occurred, but flexibility in design was able to cater
for this, and neither had a deleterious effect on the project.

The QAG did not carry out a Quality at Entry, but the Project was subject to a rigorous
review which helped ensure quality at entry. The absence of any significant structural
changes in the Project and its overall good performance is evidence of this.

2.2 Implementation

Very few problems were encountered during implementation of the PAM and PE
components, with supervision missions having rated the Project as Satisfactory
throughout. Only two minor problems emerged, one being that Bank procurement
procedures (bidding) delayed fertilizer purchases which caused some start-up delays, and,
in 2006, some poorer counties (mainly in Sichuan Province) had difficulties mobilizing
counterpart funds. The logging ban imposed by the NFPP deprived many poor counties
of revenue, and this may explain why some (especially those in Sichuan) had difficulties
in meeting their counterpart commitments in 2006. However, these problems were
addressed promptly and had no lasting effect on progress and performance of the
implementation.

The global economic boom from the late 1990s to 2008, and high rates of economic
growth in China favored implementation of the project, specifically the PE component.
Wages and purchasing power increased, the demand for wood increased and this
stimulated farmer interest in tree planting, and helped ensure that sufficient counterpart
funds were, in most cases, available on time. The impact of urban migration is difficult
to assess, on the one hand it exerted an upward pressure on wages in some areas, but it
has also been said (anecdotal) that farmers turned to tree planting as a way of securing
possession of their land in their absence.

The Forest Tenure Reform Program whereby farmers could obtain a 70 year lease over
their land had a positive influence. It provided security of tenure and encouraged longer-
term investments such as tree planting. The abolition of the Agricultural Tax served as
an incentive to invest in plantations and tree crops. The policy framework (NFPP) was
favorable in that it restricted wood supplies from native forests and this stimulated
demand for plantation produce.




                                             25
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

Under the PE component, the PMC, the PMOs and County Forestry Bureaus were
responsible for M&E. Under the PAM component similar M&E arrangements were in
place with the PMC taking overall responsibility and local PMOs and nature reserves
being in charge of day-to-day M&E. M&E arrangements under the NFM component
were not subject to Bank supervision.

The PAD identified clear parameters to be measured for both components. The main
tasks undertaken were: (a) tracking the progress and quality of implementation, (b)
checking the quality of newly planted and thinned areas, (c) monitoring environmental
(control of pests and diseases) and social impacts and benefits (number of participating
households, impact on income and assessment of benefits), (d) financial controls, and (e)
case studies and research. The key monitoring indicators in the PAD were used to help in
this regard.

The M&E system worked effectively, with the PMC preparing detailed, high quality and
timely accounts of progress for supervision missions and the ICR mission. In some cases,
the PMOs identified sub-standard field operations under the PE component which did not
qualify for reimbursement, and instructed county staff and farmers to take the necessary
remedial action. The environmental aspects of pest and disease management received
special attention under the Pest Management Plan to ensure that Integrated Pest
Management was being used in place of chemicals. Financial control was satisfactory,
PMC and provincial PMOs were able to explain or rectify any discrepancies highlighted
during supervision.

The M&E system also included a score card to monitor effectiveness of project areas
management effectiveness that was used at different stages of implementation. A
detailed biodiversity monitoring system of key species in nature reserves was developed
and put in place and provided M&E information on key species. However, such a system
to measure biodiversity trends will only develop to its full usefulness over longer periods
of time, as trends in biodiversity are medium to long-term in nature.

An area which might have been strengthened is farmer and community feedback on
project interventions. While there is much anecdotal evidence on farmer and community
attitudes, a more statistically valid and better structured approach to recording attitudes
would have been desirable under both the PE and PAM components. Similarly, no
systematic approach was put in place to monitor annual price fluctuations for economic
tree crop products, so it is difficult to say what impact this sub-component had on prices.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The Project complied with the Bank‟s safeguards and fiduciary requirements, and Bank
staff worked closely with the PMC during supervision to ensure that there were no
deviations. The main safeguard and fiduciary issues were as follows:




                                            26
   (a) Environmental Assessment (OP4.01). A full ESIA, including a Social Assessment,
       was carried out by international and national consultants during preparation. The
       main risk identified was possible disturbance to local habitats during site clearing
       and tree planting. Environmental Protection Guidelines were followed and
       supplementary site screening measures were included.
   (b) Natural Habitats (OP4.04). No conversion of natural habitats took place and the
       project was in full compliance.
   (c) Forestry (OP 4.36) was fully complied with. There were no interventions of the
       plantation program in native forests, the intention being to relieve pressure on
       these. Rigorous site selection for plantation establishment as laid out in the
       Environmental Management Plan ensured that plantations did not impair either
       ecology or biodiversity or triggered the conversion of natural forests.
   (d) Pest Management (OP4.09). Risks from pests existed and control measures were
       envisaged. A Pest Management Plan was prepared which stipulated the use of
       Integrated Pest Management and biological control as the preferred method of
       control, with chemicals being used a last resort. Training of farmers and staff on
       low intensity chemical application was also provided for. These measures helped
       reduce chemical control to only 50% of outbreaks.
   (e) Cultural Property (OP11.03). No risks were foreseen, and no incidents occurred,
       but site screening measures were in place to cater for this.
   (f) Indigenous Peoples (OD4.20). No indigenous people participated in the PE
       component but an Ethnic Minorities Development Plan, applicable to the PE and
       PAM components was prepared as a safeguard.
   (g) Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12). This did not occur, but a Policy Framework
       for Resettlement and Land Acquisition, and a Process Framework for Mitigating
       Potential Adverse Livelihood Impacts were prepared.
   (h) Fiduciary Safeguards. Financial management was satisfactory throughout
       implementation, with Project staff having gained the necessary experience
       through previously financed Bank forestry projects. A procurement assessment
       carried out during preparation concluded that the organization, structure, skills
       and control systems at central and provincial levels were adequate. At county
       level, staff were provided with the necessary training to fill any skills gaps. No
       significant fiduciary issues arose during implementation.

2.5 Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

Under the PAM component, major capacity building investments were undertaken with
GEF and Government funds during the initial years of implementation. Sufficient
recurrent and investment government budgetary sources are available to cover the
continuation and even expansion of management planning and implementation in
national and provincial-level nature reserves.

For the PE component, full cost recovery in form of on-lending to beneficiaries and
repayment responsibility was prescribed to ensure sustainability of the investments and
implementation supervision responsibility was devolved to local institutions. Over-
dependence on Bank financing was avoided by having the counterpart contribution set at
50 percent. Provinces, counties, nature reserve administrations, and farmers were to


                                           27
assume responsibility for Project activities after closure, and Project design ensured that
maintenance obligations would be small and diminishing at that time. Only 37,800 ha of
timber plantations were to be established under the PE component in the last two years of
implementation, so that only these would require tending in the 3 years following Project
closure. Thereafter, tree crops would be beyond the tending stage. The budgetary impact
of maintenance was therefore to be low and within the capacity of counties (mainly
extension) and farmers to manage. Similarly, most economic tree crops were to be
productive and self sustaining by the time of Project closure.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The PDO was highly relevant to the sector‟s needs at both appraisal and Project closure.
It was strongly supportive of the government‟s policies, including the NFPP, collective
forest tenure reform, and abolition of agricultural taxes to promote rural development. It
was also consistent with the CAS and with the then (1989) Bank‟s policy on forestry, and
the updated policy of 2003. In addition, it was supportive of the global and national
objectives of management of high-value biodiversity resources inside and outside of
protected areas, and of poverty alleviation initiatives by generating alternative
employment and income opportunities in rural areas.

The design of the PAM component built on the GEF-financed Nature Reserves
Management Project (1995-2002) and proved to be effective in improving management
capacity of key nature reserves and community involvement in reserve management as
well as in strengthening overall institutional capacity in reserve management.

The NFM component was a highly innovative component in the area of sustainable
natural forest management previously not part of GEF or Bank-financed projects.

The design of the PE component built on the Bank‟s substantial previous involvement in
plantation forestry. It was responsive to farmers‟ preferences and proved effective in
increasing areas under timber plantations and tree crops in priority areas with high
potential. It was also effective in providing alternative incomes to displaced forestry
workers in rural areas, and in raising productivity and profitability of plantations and tree
crops through the adoption of advanced technology, training, and the promotion of best
practice. It enhanced sustainability of plantation management through adherence to the
Environmental Protection Guidelines, improved site selection criteria, better land
preparation and the application of the Pest Management Plan. The design also served
effectively to strengthen local level institutions, foster local ownership, encourage
participation and strengthen farmer and community involvement in sustainable forestry,
horticulture and biodiversity conservation.

Implementation arrangements proved robust and stable, with chains of command being
clear and effective, and lines of communication good. National and provincial level
institutions proved effective at financial management and monitoring, and having



                                             28
counties, townships, and local forestry institutions and farmers responsible for
implementation created a strong sense of involvement and local ownership, and improved
prospects for sustainability.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives

The PDO and GEO were achieved. The SFDP developed viable and participatory models
for forest resource management that were adopted in project sites. Overall rating of PDO
and GEO achievement is satisfactory.

For 13 nature reserves, covering more than 1,000,000 hectares, the project introduced
systematic nature reserve management planning and prioritization of investments in
protected areas, which resulted in measurable improvements in reserve management
capacity (based on scorecards using the World Commission on Protected Areas
Framework). Reserve management plans were developed, approved, and implemented
for all nature reserves. The project involved communities through participatory
community resources management plans (all 26 community reserve management plans
were developed and adopted) that helped to demonstrate alternative income sources for
resource dependent communities. It built stronger capacity of local governments‟ to
implement biodiversity conservation as demonstrated by the continuation and expansion
of management planning across nature reserves originally not included in the project.
Finally, more than 24,800 person time training were implemented at nature reserve,
community and local government levels.

While direct human pressure on nature reserves may have been reduced during
implementation, it is not possible to assess long-term reduction of such pressure and, if
occurring, this may be more driven by demographic changes and out-migration rather
than direct Project interventions. Systems for in-situ monitoring of key biodiversity
resources have been put in place and M&E results on key threatened species is being
made available.

The project was also highly successful in forest resources development and management
under the PE component. Tree planting targets were exceeded by 75%, whereas areas
tended and thinned surpassed targets by 40%. The production of improved seedlings
(97% classified as Grade 1) exceeded targets by 47%, household participation exceeded
targets by 5%, and the number of farmer training courses delivered exceeded targets by
21%.

Newly planted areas, which have incorporated improved technology, will produce around
29 million m3 of additional wood and 3.9 million tons of bamboo. The project generated
around 65 million person-days of new employment and improved income opportunities
(RMB 6.6 Billion) in forestry farms and rural households. The rigorous application of
Environmental Protection Guidelines, site screening, IPM, and PMPs greatly improved
environmental management. Prospects for sustainability look promising for the following
reasons: (a) component activities have been main-streamed into county level operations;
(b) institutional capacity has been strengthened at all levels; (c) a Post-Project
Management Plan has been prepared; (d) the component shows a highly positive ERR


                                           29
and IRR (with all crops established and thinned showing positive IRRs); and (e) the
demand outlook for products being produced under the component look favorable.
Detailed outputs are discussed in Annex 2.

In the field of natural forest management (NFM component), four strategic management
plans were prepared; 57 Village Development Plans were prepared and implemented;
over 3,200 households benefited from micro-loans; and a substantial amount of training
in forest management, community development and micro-finance was implemented.
Detailed outputs are discussed in Annex 2.

3.3 Efficiency

China‟s low wage rates (RMB15-30 per day at the time of appraisal) made it very
competitive in plantation forestry and tree crops. Growth rates of bamboo and poplar are
also high, whereas those for slash pine and masson pine are good-to-moderate.
Establishment costs in most developing countries vary between U$1,000 and U$1,500/ha,
whereas in China they average U$600/ha.

Economic benefits were quantified for the PE component. Total component cost was
US$196 million. If one were to charge this entire amount to sub-component 1, Timber
Plantations, the cost would be U$$975/ha of plantation established, well below
international norms. If one includes economic tree crops, then the cost falls to U$806/ha.
Given that wood products are very sensitive to transport costs and that fruits are highly
susceptible to post-harvest degradation, locally produced goods should prove very
competitive in domestic markets.

Thirty nine crop models were used to determine an ERR and IRR, the evaluation results
by Subcomponent (weighted by main species) planted, and individually for the main
species planted are shown below. The ERR and IRR for the PE component as a whole
are slightly above those forecast at appraisal. The ERR and IRR for Timber plantations
and Pre Commercial Thinning compare favorably with appraisal, but for economic tree
crops they are substantially higher, possibly due to the impact of soaring food prices after
2006.

It should be noted that the labor rate used in these calculations is 15 RMB per day, which
is representative for remote rural areas. However, in other areas substantially higher rates
apply, and rates of return in such areas would be lower.

In addition to economic and financial benefits, benefits would accrue to reduced pressure
on natural forest, poverty alleviation, and strengthened institutions.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

The overall outcome and Global Environment Outcome are considered satisfactory. This
rating is based on the fact that the project achieved its PDO and GEO, exceeded most of
its planned outputs within budget, showed better-than-predicted returns for the economic
components, fully disbursed loan and grant funds, and appears to be sustainable in its
interventions. The rating is further justified by the fact that the objectives of the project
remain as relevant today as they were at time of preparation, prospects for sustainability
look promising, and the project generated social and environmental benefits additional to
those anticipated at time of appraisal.

The rating of this project is not considered highly satisfactory despite the numerous
significant achievements of the project because of some implementation shortcomings in
the NFM component. Particularly, the formal introduction of forest management plans as
well as community co-management contracts for natural forest areas, which both were
new and unknown approaches at the time of design of the project, did not materialize to
the extent originally envisaged and formal approval of such new approaches by the
Chinese authorities was too ambitious and could not be achieved as stated in the project
indicators.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

Increased Plantation Wood Output and Reduced Pressure on Native Forests. Having
established an additional 201,700 ha of plantations capable of producing 29 million m3 of


                                             31
timber and 3.9 million tons of bamboo, pressure on native forests (which would require
around 1 million ha to produce the same quantity), and its associated biodiversity will be
much reduced. Soil erosion risks will also be reduced, as will flooding.

Alternative Incomes for Displaced Workers. Most plantation tree crops show high FRRs,
with the principal species planted, poplar (66% of total), Bamboo (18%) and Slash Pine
(5%) showing IRRs of around 23%, 24% and 15%, respectively. The main Economic
Tree Crops also show attractive rates of return with Jujube (16% of total), Peach (15%),
and Pear (14%) showing IRRs of 39%, 39% and 47% respectively. Such returns should
greatly improve alternative income generation potential in rural areas where under-
employment is high and wages rates low. In some poorer rural areas in Gansu Province,
case studies show that the project was able to more than double per capita income from
RMB 1,003 (c. US$150) per year to RMB 2,159. Some 263,800 people were also
provided with employment through the component and some RMB989 million (U$145
million) was spent on labor.

Environmental Management and Sustainability. Environmental management was
improved through adherence to Environmental Protection Guidelines for plantations. It
was further strengthened by the implementation of the IPM which reduced chemical use
(during implementation chemical usage was confined to about 50 percent of pest
outbreaks). Site screening prior to planting helped to safeguard habitats and biodiversity.
Low impact site preparation, road construction, and harvesting reduced soil disturbance.
A case study in Majiadong, Hubei Province demonstrated that the application of
improved management practice in bamboo plantations was able to reduce sediment loads
in streams by 35%. If this gain were to be realized over the entire area planted, some
730,000 tons of soil loss could be prevented.

Increasing Plantation Productivity and Promoting Best Practice. The use of improved
seed and the promotion of best practice at nursery and field levels raised the productivity
of tree plantations and economic tree crops. It also helped improve land productivity
which is an important consideration in China where pressure on land is intense.
Experience in other countries has shown that these measures can result in a 20% gain in
productivity.

Improved Wood Quality. Thinning 86,228 hectares of existing plantations and training
farmers and staff in best practice improved the quality and value of existing plantations
by removing poor quality trees and by concentrating growth on the better quality, final
crop trees. This should greatly increase the quality and value of the latter.

Institutional Change/ Strengthening. Substantial investment in the training of farmers
and staff of implementing agencies resulted in efficiency gains, while the involvement of
county and local level institutions in implementation has improved prospects for
sustainability.

Impacts on Biodiversity Conservation and Reserves Management. With combined
project investments in both conservation-related and community development activities,



                                            32
the relationship between protected area administrations and neighboring communities
improved significantly, and local partnerships for biodiversity conservation and
management developed in the form of community patrols and biodiversity monitoring
and reporting. Detailed ecological surveys and baseline mapping have been implemented
and this data is now managed in the form of Geographical Information Systems for
administration and government decision making. These systems are expected to support
more focused and effective conservation activities and protection of species and habitats
through identification of hotspots and priority sites.

Demonstration impact of GEF-funded activities. The reserves supported by the project
are playing an important demonstration role for improving nature reserves management
across China. Reserve management and participatory community resources management
planning procedures have been standardized, and state-of-the-art training materials for
reserve management, law enforcement and applied research, and a participation and
community management are now available and are being applied by SFA across the
country.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Social and environmental benefits. Through the plantation development, the project
provided employment opportunity for about 263,800 people in the project areas. The
average income of labor has increased by RMB3,800. The project also generated
environmental benefits, which increased vegetation coverage in the project areas has
increased by 1.4% on average. In 2013, carbon sequestration of plantation would reach
to its maximum value when 9.201 million tons of CO2 is fixed, which would contribute
actively to improving ecological environment of project areas and coping with global
climate change.

Other benefits include the human resource strengthening and knowledge and skill
improvement. The project provided a very large training program for the project
management staff and the farmers in the project areas. In total, about 1.5 million people
attended the training courses (total about 10,000) in various topics (e.g., plantation
management and improvement, thinning technique, pest management) and technical
assistance through the forest extension system. This is the foundation for plantation
sustainable development for the farmers, who have learned the new techniques for
managing tree plantation and would apply them in the production practice, especially
after the project completion.

Climate Change. While not included in the DO, the PE component will sequester a
significant amount of carbon dioxide. Using a mean annual increment of 15m/ha/year for
the 201,700 ha planted, and a figure of 1.83 tons of carbon sequestered per m3 of wood
produced, around 5.5 million tons of carbon will be sequestered each year over tree crop
rotations of between 8 and 30 years. With a market value of U$5.00 per ton, this could
generate additional financial benefits of around U$25 million per year.

Poverty Alleviation. Forty of the 109 counties included in the component were regarded
as impoverished, with poverty being most severe in remote rural areas. By providing


                                           33
employment and income generating opportunities, the component was able to help
address this issue. The component created the equivalent of 263,800 jobs, and through
credit, assisted rural people to produce wood and economic tree crop products such as
fruits which could double their income. The multiplier effect of this could be
considerable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment
Outcome

Rating: Low

The only risks foreseen were: (a) additional output from economic tree crops could create
oversupply situations and this could cause price collapses; (b) pest and disease attacks
could increase in large areas of monocultures, such as poplar and fruit trees; (c) fire could
damage plantations; (d) counties might not be able to fund plantation maintenance; and
(e) farmers may not be able to repay loans.

On the first, a mixture of economic tree crops has been planted by farmers to reduce the
risk of supply gluts, and market surveys preceded the planting of new economic crops of
over 1000 ha at provincial level. This, together with increased purchasing power in rural
areas, should reduce risks somewhat, but the risk of periodic supply gluts still exists. On
the second, at least three clones of poplar, and mixed stands of tree crops have been used
to mitigate the risk of disease. Routine pest monitoring by County Forestry Bureaus and
the State Forestry Administration under their Post Project Management Plan should also
help mitigate this risk. So far losses from pests and diseases have been low, at around
5%. Fire is an ever present risk, but adequate fire protection, detection and suppression
measures are in place to combat this risk, and these will be strengthened under the Post
Project Management Plan. Losses have been very low during project implementation.
To mitigate against a possible shortage of county funds for crop tending after project
closure, areas planted in the last two years of the project were kept low, so tending
requirements will be limited, and disappear altogether three years after closure. Finally,
previous experience shows that the risk of farmers defaulting on loan repayments is low,
and it is only in cases of genuine hardship, like bad weather, that they have difficulty in
repaying; in such cases the loan repayment period can be extended.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

Preparation took 3 years, which is reasonable for such a large, complex and potentially
controversial forestry project with a Category A Rating for environmental issues.
Despite its complexity, the proposal was well prepared and rigorously reviewed. The
PDO and design of the component were appropriate, safeguard policies were


                                             34
meticulously formulated and applied; lessons learned from previous projects were
incorporated, cost estimates were accurate, institutional arrangements proved robust;
environmental, social and sustainability issues were well covered, and no major
weaknesses emerged. Minor shortcomings include the use of impact indicators which
can only be verified over the long term.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The Project was regularly supervised, and when issues emerged, such as the late arrival
of counterpart funds, slow reimbursements, and the need to reassign funds from
infrastructure to tree planting, prompt remedial action was taken by Bank staff. Good
long-term working relations between Bank staff and the Borrower and continuity of task
team members during the supervision period also helped ensure that implementation went
smoothly. A more frequent and close interaction between the Bank and the EU during
supervision may have helped to strengthen the link between the three project components
but such coordination was partly outside of the control of the Bank because the EU-
funded component was implemented by a different department in SFA, which with the
Bank had no formal interaction.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The SFDP was relevant to country needs, supportive of Bank and Country policies and
strategies, and contained all the necessary safeguards. PDO, component objectives and
outputs were realistic and preparation was sufficiently detailed. Supervision was timely,
with the necessary corrective measures being identified and followed upon.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The PMC of the SFA at the national level showed diligence and commitment to the
Project throughout. The PMC was proactive in management, kept implementation on-
track, attended to issues promptly, and contributed greatly to the component's success. It
carefully and comprehensively monitored progress, compliance with safeguards and
quality, and submitted the necessary reports on time. To ensure sustainability, it initiated
the preparation of a Post Project Management Plan.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory




                                            35
The PMOs at provincial, county, and nature reserve level worked tirelessly to ensure that
the Project succeeded. Even though a few counties were late in providing counterpart
funds in 2006, most component targets were met/exceeded on time, the quality of work
was good and reporting was satisfactory. Supervision missions rated implementation of
the PE and PAM components as satisfactory throughout.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

Borrower performance is rated as Highly Satisfactory because: the PDO and component
Dos were achieved; most of the measurable targets were exceeded; the quality of work
was good; implementation was timely; sufficient counterpart funds (50%) were made
available; safeguard measures and best practice were applied; fiduciary compliance was
good; and a sustainability plan was put in place.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

The main lessons learned are:

   (a) security of forest land tenure is an important pre requisite for investments in tree
       planting;
   (b) large and complex Bank supported forestry projects can be successful when
       implemented by sound and disciplined institutions which have developed strong
       partnerships between national and local levels, and between local levels and
       beneficiaries;
   (c) embedding projects in local level institutions fosters ownership (and success);
   (d) a supportive policy framework facilitates successful implementation;
   (e) despite the longer term pay-back from tree planting and the challenges that this
       poses for resource poor farmers, they will plant trees in preference to shorter term
       crops if markets for wood exist;
   (f) prospects for success in forestry projects are enhanced when the Bank has had a
       long term involvement in the sector;
   (g) appropriate training greatly assists smooth implementation;
   (h) if local level institutions (counties) are expected to provide counterpart funds,
       their capacity to do so needs careful assessment;
   (i) Bank procurement procedures (in this case for fertilizer) need to be looked at
       carefully to ensure that they do not cause implementation delays; and
   (j) when farmers take credit, the possibility of providing debt relief to those stricken
       by severe weather or natural disasters needs to be considered.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1. Natural Forest Management Component

The EU financed the NFM component in parallel and implemented the component in
form of a separate project. This is reflected in its title „EU-China Natural Forest
Management Project (NFMP)‟. The overall thrust of the NFM component/project
remained as originally designed by the Bank and only relatively minor revisions and
specifications to the scope of sub-components and activities were made. The NFMP was
implemented during 2003-2010, including a two-year extension by the Natural Forest
Protection Center of SFA with direct implementation support through an external
technical assistance team. Implementation arrangements were thus separate from those
of the Bank/GEF-financed components, which were under implementation responsibility
of the Project Management Center of SFA.

The NFMP aimed at developing improved sustainable management techniques in natural
forest areas which were protected under the NFPP and with the intent to decrease rural
communities‟ dependency on forests in the areas most affected by the NFPP restrictions.
This partnership project was funded by a EUR16.9 million grant and a GoC contribution
of EUR 6 million. The project was supplemented by an IBRD US$93.9 million loan for
establishment of plantations and a US$16 million grant from the Global Environment
Facility (GEF) for the management of protected areas.

NFMP was implemented over a period of seven years (2003-2010) by the NFPPC with
the support of an EU technical assistance team (led by GTZ IS). It worked through three
main components: (i) a natural forest management component for the testing of improved
sustainable forest management techniques; (ii) a community development component for
supporting rural communities in diversifying their livelihood base and replace traditional
activities not longer possible because of the logging ban; and (iii) an information training
and dissemination component for capacity building and dissemination activities in
support of the other two components.

Fields activities were undertaken in Sichuan (Baoxing, Pingwu and Songpan counties),
Hunan (Yanling and Yongshun counties), and Hainan (Changjiang county) covering 58
Administrative Villages (comprised of almost 300 Natural Villages), and six state forest
enterprises or forest farms.

This summary report (provided by the EU) provides an insight of major achievements
attaint in these three components.

Sub-component 1: Natural Forest Management (NFM)

The natural forest management activities were all directed towards increasing local
capacity in forest management in the areas where the logging ban was active and towards
piloting new techniques to improve the quality of forest management planning,
implementation and monitoring. The activities were implemented in natural forest areas



                                            39
outside nature reserves and outside the main areas of plantation forest. In this component
the project piloted and demonstrated actions in the following areas:

Forest Management Planning. The project piloted actions to improve technical aspects
of resource inventory and planning methodologies. The approach attempted to vertically
integrate planning activities from broader "land-use" and "strategic" level plans to field
level operational plans (township/village). Attempts were also made to introduce
"ecosystem modeling? into this sequence–though this, in most respects, involved
upgrading local capacities and technical inputs beyond a level that the project could
effectively support. Using participatory methodologies, NFMP tested:

Forest Maps. As a first step for forest planning NFMP prepared forest maps for all 11
townships. The maps were based on interpretation of satellite images and their projection
of existing topographic maps. The classification system used was very similar to the
classification of the national forest inventory.

Multi-forest resource inventories (MRFI). MRFI were conducted for areas where the
project intended to support the formulation of a plan. These inventories also included the
identification and assessment of resources generally not tallied during traditional forest
inventories, typically Non-Timber Forest Resources (such as medicinal plants, fodder,
etc.). MRFI were produced with the participation of local stakeholders, like local
government agencies and the villagers and showed therefore potential for transparency
and conflict resolution in determining borders between state and collective forests. They
also raised local awareness on the extent and type of the forest resources. NFMP
completed and demonstrated the MRFI in 7 townships, developed an EDP program for
data processing (FRIDAP) and a manual to guide the assessment process.

Demonstrations on eco-system modeling. Demonstrations on ecosystem modeling were
completed in 11 townships to determine structures and dynamics of a given ecosystem
for further planning procedures. A guide for ecosystem modeling was prepared and used
to produce ecosystem modeling reports for each township. This experience represents a
valuable input for the current Chinese forest management planning system where
ecosystem modeling is not included and is lacking any guidelines for its implementation.

Land Use Plans (LUP). LUP aimed at zoning different types of ecological and
commercial forests and represent a further step in the forest planning process. Land use
strategy maps were prepared for 12 townships (available in a GIS data base). NFMP-
LUPs represent a valuable test in the current forestry system. They were produced in a
participatory manner and thus have the potential to be more accepted by local
stakeholders than the LUPs carried out by the land management bureaus. A manual to
guide this planning exercise was also prepared by the project.

Strategic Forest Management Plans (SFMP). SFMP represented the main planning
document providing information of the forest resource base‟s potential and indicating the
strategy for different forest types and the silvicultural objectives. It was realized through
participatory methodologies. It reflects a new approach in the Chinese forest



                                             40
management planning procedure mostly for this reason and also because considers the
multiple services provided by the forest (timber, recreation, non timber forest products).
The SFMP is based on information provided by MRFI, LUP and Eco-system Modeling. 4
SFMP were completed at the township level together with a planning manual.

Operational Participatory Village Management Plans (OVFMPs). The OVFMPs
proposed by the NFMP intended to cover the area of an administrative village. OVFMP
is an integrated plan defining silviculture treatments and harvestable amounts for forest
management types on a per ha basis, which is then applied for individual forest user right
owners lots. It is an integrated plan because incorporates not only the direct use of timber
and firewood, but also NTFPs, the use of forest land as recreation area, touristic uses and
grazing for domestic animals. The basis for the OVFMP is the SFMP, where the strategy
for the different forest zones already was defined and the silvicultural objectives
formulated for forest management types. OVFMPs gain particular importance in the
framework of the ongoing collective forest reform, where the forest farmers are granted
long term user rights of forest resources. In fact these plans have the potential to
guarantee better protection of forest resources and at the same time generate income due
to modern silviculture techniques. NFMP has developed 4 OVFMPs.

The plans produced by NFMP could not unfortunately received final official approval
and could not be implemented as they not constitute legally recognized planning
documents under the existing Chinese forest management planning framework. These
key project outputs coupled with the project Manuals covering ecosystem modelling, land
use planning, and strategic forest planning, form however a cohesive knowledge package
to guide local and central forest planning officials in the application of advanced forest
and forest resource planning approaches and techniques.

Silviculture Demonstrations (STDs). The project implemented several studies to
provide and initiate management of selected forest types applying close to nature
silviculture model approaches and techniques. It piloted 25 STDs with the intent of
introducing techniques to obtain desired stand characteristics at the time of harvest and be
then used in OVFMPs. STDs consisted primarily of release thinnings, stand improvement
thinnings, fuel-wood thinning, and sanitation thinnings. Selective harvest cutting and
enrichment planting were also supported by the project. 15 demonstrations of other
natural forest management technologies were also implemented under STDs, like
demonstration on bamboo management, grafting of walnut or chestnut, showing negative
effects on grazing in forest vegetation or applications of border line survey with GPS.
NFMP accomplished a manual and quite a number of comprehensive technical reports in
the field of silviculture.

Evaluations of the Project's STDs unfortunately revealed weaknesses in implementation
particularly in proper "base-line" measurement of stand characteristics prior to treatment
prescription and implementation and "post-project" systematic periodic "re-sampling" of
a treated stand.




                                            41
Forest co-management. Aside from using participatory approaches in most aspects of
the implementation of its various "planning" activities, the Project also introduced
specific "co-management" approaches in an attempt to institutionalize or embed such
approaches into not only forest management planning activities, but also forest
management "implementation" and "monitoring" activities. The project facilitated several
activities to demonstrate and pilot Forest Co-Management (FCM) approaches in Songpan
County, established two township start up teams and co-management committees in all
the 11 villages of the pilot area. The Project's efforts to demonstrate and pilot FCM
approaches were difficult to implement. This seems to have been primarily because these
efforts were generally resisted by participants (especially by forestry officials when
planning involved the management of state forests and by villagers where the planning
involved collective forests). But it is also apparent that the NFMP's intentions for Forest
Co-Management may have been over-ambitious and that the efforts required to prepare
and support forestry officials and village participants in these activities was
underestimated. A key output of this activity has been a manual to guide FCM.

Sub-component 2: Community development (CD)

The CD component aimed at supporting the diversification of rural communities‟
livelihood base in the areas most affected by the NFPP restrictions and at introducing
more sustainable land use practices. The component allowed for various types of
community development activities that were based on participatory exercises, training
and other capacity building activities targeted to villagers, forest staff and local
government.

It has to be noted that by the time NFMP has started delivering CD activities, most rural
households already initiated alternative activities to support income, mostly through
migration labour or other support from the local government. CD activities therefore
contributed to further diversify these strategies and improve livelihood opportunities.

Village Development Plans (VDP). VDPs represented the planning instruments to assess
needs and implement community development actions. They were prepared using
Participatory Resource Appraisal methodologies that allowed better understanding of the
linkages between livelihoods, policy, institutions and the environment. 57 VDP were
completed.

Community Entry Point activities (EPA) and Micro-infrastructure Projects (MIP).
These included village roads or trails, canals for field irrigation, household water supply
or sanitation systems and other community infrastructure. 58 EPAs and 271 MIPs were
completed. These interventions not only had very positive impacts on the villages‟
livelihood base, but were also very effective in generating people‟s interest in NFMP
activities and improving the ability of communities to plan, implement and manage their
own resources. The largest benefits were achieved with the construction of new roads or
bridges particularly in remote areas. These have opened up new areas for access and
potentially created additional income earning opportunities for community members.




                                            42
Alternative Livelihood Demonstrations (ALD). ALD included support to household
based practices such as beekeeping, bamboo management/processing, orchard
management/processing of products for consumption or traditional medicine, livestock
and poultry rising. New techniques were introduced or local ones improved. 76 ALD
were implemented. Overall ALD created an interest among beneficiaries in expanding
production possibilities and introducing innovative schemes to improve income. A series
of weaknesses have however been identified on the way these activities were
implemented particularly with respect to household targeting and or household financial
capacity to replicate these activities.

Thematic Demonstration Projects (TDP). Thematic Demonstration Projects were often
similar to ALD but were implemented by community organizations or groups of
proponents. They included: bamboo management & production, community-based
ecotourism, livestock and fodder management, non-timber forest products processing
(particularly improved drying techniques for medicinal plants), bio-gas, solar cookers,
solar water heaters, fuel-saving stoves, sustainable rural building design, traditional
beekeeping. 9 TDP were implemented in 11 villages. TDP were highly appreciated by the
beneficiaries and some of the actions (particularly community based eco-tourism) show
very good sustainability prospects and represent valuable experiences to be replicated.
TDP has also shown a great potential to contribute to gender equality and sustainable
natural forest management.

Micro-credit Fund (MCF). The MCF was intended to provide small loans for income
generating activities to village households and State Forest Enterprises (SFEs) workers
who had insufficient access to formal bank loans due to insufficient collateral or that
lived in rural areas not reached by financial institutions. The MCF was implemented in
29 Administrative villages and 4 State Forest Enterprises (SFEs) or Forest Farms in the
project area and was managed and operated by 24 Micro-credit Units (MCUs) set-up by
the project. The MCUs operated according to three management models and included, 1
MCU managed by China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation (CFPA) in Changjiang
County, Hainan (NGO model); 19 MCUs managed by respective Community Natural
Forest Management Associations (Community Fund Model); and 4 MCUs managed by
respective State Forest Enterprises (SFE model). The MCF granted over 7000 loans to
over 3200 village households or SFE employees. These loans have been invested by the
borrowing villagers in income generating activities, typically animal husbandry, cropping
activities and small trade/service businesses. The MCUs have proven capable of
disbursing and recovering loans in a cost effective manner and with very few exemptions,
the loan conditions and procedures have been adhered to. This has been a valid
achievement and a vital input to rural development in the targeted areas. The MCF has
been handed over to the NFPCC of the SFA at the closure of the project. The ownership
of the fund now stands with the various MCUs and the NFPCC of the SFA insures their
coordination, monitoring and supervision.

Despite the project could not ensure a clear integration of CD and NFM activities, several
CD activities were almost entirely forestry related (i.e. reading livestock or crops under
forest canopies, bamboo management, bio-gas, etc.) and many of them have heightened



                                           43
villager's awareness on the impact of livelihood practices on forest resources. The CD
activities that had a direct positive impact on livelihood may have also had an indirect
positive impact on natural forests. It has to be noted also that forestry staff in all 6
counties and 11 townships have become active in community development.

The analysis of impacts of NFMP on gender showed that the project had a positive
impact on gender equality through its gender sensitive approach in recruiting villager link
workers and implementing micro-credit, micro infrastructure construction and livelihood
improvement activities.

Sub-component 3: Information Training and Dissemination (ITD).

A total of 366 ITD events and activities have been carried out by the project to support
the implementation of the activities under the CD and NFM components, which
collectively have included: 55 village level training courses / study tours; training of
1,657 villagers in SFM practices; training 278 SFE workers; 16 awareness raising events;
monitoring 27% of ITD training courses; 2 dissemination study tours; 1 film produced
and televised with NFMP support (done, though focused chiefly on NFPPC); 1 project
closing conference.

The project also produced a number of awareness raising and visibility items and set up a
„training M&E system‟ to monitor and evaluate training.

NFMP capacity building events have increased the awareness of NFPP staff, village link
workers and villagers in subjects related to participatory approaches and sustainable
forest management, and to a certain extent also have increased the related knowledge and
skills.

Sub-component 1: Participatory Planning and Management of Nature Reserves

Developing Management Plans. This activity supported the preparation and
implementation of comprehensive management plans for 13 protected areas supported
under the project. Working groups and leading groups for management planning,
ecological surveys, community-co-management, and training were set up at provincial
and protected area levels which were supported by international and national consultants.
By 2005, all management plans had been completed and approved by local authorities
and SFA. The plans specified 477 investment and capacity building activities to be
implemented under the project. Despite some delays caused by the 2008 earthquake in
Sichuan, all of these activities were completed before project closure. In 2010,
management plans were reviewed, revised and updated for the next 5-year period for all
13 protected areas. Participatory nature reserve planning and management has now
become an integral part of biodiversity conservation efforts at the grassroots level as a
result of the project.



                                                    45
Developing and updating Bio-system Baseline Maps. By 2006, all 13 protected areas had
completed ecological baseline surveys, data collection and entry, printing, and
distribution of various thematic ecological baseline maps. About 190 persons
participated in technical trainings on ecological mapping. Significant capacity in GIS
applications has been developed in all reserves. Overall management capacity of reserve
staff has improved with the development and application of such baseline maps.
Regularly updated baseline data feeds into decision making at reserve and local
government levels.

Improving Nature Reserve Management System. To enhance overall effectiveness of
reserve management, boundary surveys and demarcation, and identification of
conservation core zones were finished in 2004. About 3,000 kilometers of boundaries
were surveyed and settled. Large amounts of equipment were purchased to facilitate
implementation of conservation activities in the field, including 34 vehicles, 71
motorcycles, 2,778 sets of computer systems, office equipment, telecommunication
equipment, outdoor equipment, and fire control tools. In addition, 59 patrol stations, 28
inspection stations and 26 management stations were built and in operation by 2010.

Western Sichuan Biodiversity Survey. A series biodiversity surveys was completed in
Sichuan in 2008. These surveys generated important new biodiversity knowledge,
including the discovery of some new plant species and new information on critical
habitats, which had previously not been known and could now be identified for protection
activities. A comprehensive report on this survey, including an overview of the overall
socio-economic conditions and biodiversity threats in Western Sichuan, were prepared
for Government consultations on conservation and sustainable resources planning and
zoning.

Sub-component 2 - Community-based Nature Conservation

Conducting PRA Survey and Selection of Demonstration Village. PRA surveys were
conducted and results documented for 187 villages out of which 26 villages were selected
for reserve co-management demonstration activities, 36 villages for energy saving
demonstrations, 10 villages for wild animal damage control demonstration activities.
More than 150 villages were part of a follow-up PRA survey.

Developing Community Resources Management Plan. 26 community resources
management plans were developed and implemented.

County Co-Management Leading Group Activities. More than 150 meetings of county-
level co-management leading groups were held covering all reserves of the project. The
purpose of these meetings was to share information and experiences in co-management
and provide direction for improvement. In addition, village-level co-management
committees were put in place. Altogether, 236 meetings (5,394 person times, of which
20 % were women) were organized to discuss natural resource management initiatives at
the community-level.




                                           46
Establishing and Managing Community Conservation Fund. The control of the
Community Conservation Fund rested with the demonstration villages. In total, RMB 4.1
million were invested under the fund, of which RMB3.1 million were allocated to
conservation activities and RMB 1.1 million were channeled as small credits to improve
livelihoods of the poor. GEF contributed about 60 percent of such funds while 40 percent
were provided through government counterpart funds. In total, 129 different activities
were funded and about 4,500 people benefited from the fund.

Community Conservation Education and Publicity. Activities included village forums,
community bulletins, household visits, field visits, knowledge contest, summer camps,
skill development and religious service events. Activities covered nearly 250,000
person/times across the 13 protected areas.

Energy Saving Demonstration. 5,273 wood-saving stoves were introduced in 4,390
households in 109 demonstration villages. On average, the fuel wood saving rate is 50
percent of previous (pre-project) consumption.

Wild Animal Management System. Various measures to reduce negative impacts and
damages from wildlife were tested and introduced benefitting 1,431 households.
Measures included loud speakers, biological and wire fences, protection wall, change in
cropping, installation of alarm devices, and others.

Scaling up Improved Sustainable Techniques and Upgrading Community Skills.
Project training workshops on livelihood improvement covered about 12,900
person/times.

Sub-component 3 - Training and Capacity Building.

Local training and capacity building. Training modules for nature reserves management,
biodiversity conservation, monitoring of nature reserve, community-based observation
method, outdoor research techniques and patrol methods for nature reserves, and law
enforcement practice were developed. Seven provincial training coordinators and 45
trainers were selected and trained. Extensive training materials were compiled, which
included publications on Management of Nature Reserves, Biodiversity Conservation and
Monitoring for Nature Reserves, Participatory Community Management for Nature
Reserve, Outdoor Research and Patrol Techniques for Nature Reserve, Regulation of
Nature Reserve, and Law Enforcement Practice for Nature Reserves. Farmer manuals
were drafted, such as crop growing and animal raising handbooks.

Regular Staff Training. Training on financial management, procurement and equipment
maintenance were held and involved 477 persons in 14 workshops. About 8,500
person/time training for mid-level management, researchers, technicians, community
workers, village committee members, patrol and monitoring staff, and project
management officers were conducted. More than 3,012 person/time of training for
partrol and monitoring staff were implemented and more than 12,000 person/time




                                          47
training on productive skill development were conducted. About 169 staff finished their
degree education, 84 staff got higher professional titles and 29 staffs were promoted.

Overseas Study Tour and Training. International study tours to Canada, France, South
Africa and Germany took place and 62 management-level staff and technicians
participated in these study tours.

Handbook for Nature Reserve Management in China. A Management Handbook
Series for Nature Reserves in China was prepared under the project. This series includes
handbooks for Nature Reserve Management, Patrolling and Law Enforcement, Applied
Research, and Participatory Community Management in Natural Reserves. 1,500 copies
of these handbooks were distributed to 31 forestry bureaus across China and 207 national
forest nature reserve authorities.

Institutional Strengthening. As a result of the project, staffing levels were increased in
all nature reserve management offices. For example, 35 additional staff were recruited
for the Nature Conservation Unit of the Yunnan Provincial Forestry Bureau. Additional
20 patrol staff were hired for Jianfengling Nature Reserve in Hainan. A GEF project
office was established in all seven provincial forestry bureaus working with the project.

Establishment of Tree Plantations. The subcomponent aimed to plant 115,085 but
surpassed this by 75% and planted 201,700 ha. The main species planted were Poplar
(66%), Bamboo (18%), Slash Pine (5%), Chinese Fir (4%) and Larch (2%).

To enhance environmental conservation and prospects for sustainability, the project
developed Environmental Protection Guidelines (EPG) and a Pest Management Plan
(PMP). The EPG included screening procedures (cultural, edaphic, ecological, biological
and social) to guide appropriate site selection, as well as species selection, site
preparation, tending the appropriate use of fertilizers and herbicides, and selective cutting.
Training on EPG implementation was provided through 813 training courses (160,205
person days) for provincial staff, county staff and farmers. Compliance with the EPG
requirements was monitored by the PMOs. Similarly, the PMP provided the legal and
regulatory framework for pest monitoring, pest control and biodiversity protection. It
also included rules and methodologies for species selection, pest monitoring and
forecasting, the control of the most common pests ion economic crops, and the use of low
toxic pesticides.

The main pests encountered were poplar canker, blight and die back and these were
treated with a combination of integrated and chemical control. In total, pest damage
occurred in only 5% of tree plantations, and chemical control was used in only 51% of
cases.

To underpin PMP implementation combined courses for tree plantations and economic
tree crops were used. In all, 1,615 training courses, or 213,738 person days of training
were provided to farmers (93% of total person days), provincial and county staff, the rest
being dealt with by physical or biological methods.

The use of superior seed stock and clonal material was monitored by the National Seed
Bureau, the use of which resulted in 76% of areas established meeting the criteria
(growth rates and form) for Class 1 status.


                                                  49
Establishment of Economic Tree Crops. The sub component aimed to plant 57, 938 ha
of economic tree crops, including chestnut, walnut ginkgo, apricot, apple, pear, plum,
Chinese date, prickly ash, pomegranate, tea and others, but in fact only 42,246 ha were
established. The shortfall was due farmer preference for timber trees where prices were
rising sharply and uncertainties over demand for horticultural products (fruits nuts, dates
etc). The main species planted were Jujube (16%), Peach (15%), Pear (14%), Apricot
(13%), and Chestnut (8%).

As with tree plantations, EPGs and PMPs (see above) were rigorously applied so that the
environmental of impact of planting was reduced to a minimum. Some pest damage was
recorded such as peach leaf curl, pear scab, apple leaf spot and rust, apple and pear
canker, walnut canker and blight but the judicious use of pesticides as per the PMPs
limited damage to five percent of the area planted. Training for PMP implementation for
economic tree cops was combined with that for tree plantations. For the two, 1,615
courses were provided, and 213, 738 person days of training received, 93% of which was
received by farmers.

Pre Commercial Thinning. The target of 61,333 ha to be thinned was exceeded by 40%,
with a total of 86,227 ha being thinned. Thinning was concentrated on 8-12 year old
stands and the main species thinned were Chinese Fir (60%), Larch (16%), Mason Pine
(13%) and Slash Pine (11%). Individual tree selection was used to remove suppressed or
badly formed trees to improve the health and quality of the stand, and to concentrate
increment on the final crop trees. Not only did this serve to improve stand quality, but it
also served to identify the optimum regimes for thinning, and to train farmers and
workers in best practice. Even though most logs extracted were of small diameter and
low quality, they found an outlet as pit props, fuelwood and, in some areas, as veneer logs.

Technical Support Services. This was a key activity in that it aimed to promote best
practice and disseminate project information beyond the project area through the Planting
Stock Development Program and the Training and Extension Program. It also provided
additional support through the Rural Infrastructure Program and the Monitoring and
Evaluation Program.

Planting Stock Development Program: The target of producing 265 million improved
seedlings to raise plantation productivity was exceeded, with 392 million having been
produced. This was achieved despite reducing the original number of nurseries from 64 to
50. All 50 nurseries are now producing genetically superior seedlings, and have become
self financing through seedling sales, which are being sold at a small profit. Given
experience in other countries, this could improve plantation yields by 20%. The nurseries
are also being used to promote best nursery practice outside the project area.

Technical Extension and Training (TET): The TET program played a key role in
achieving the goal of promoting best practice and in disseminating information on the
project. Sixteen central training courses were organized, with the target of 2,075 person
days of technical and managerial training being exceeded by 5%. In addition, the target of



                                            50
18,966 person days of technical and managerial training at county level was exceeded by
25%, and the target of 1.37 million person days of training for technical staff and farmers
at county level was exceed by 16% (1.59 million person days), 1.49 million of whom
comprised farmers. Five thousand copies of Technical Notes on five priority technical
themes were distributed to staff and farmers, and project activities were highlighted in a
newsletter and the project website. In addition, project information was distributed to
provincial and county level staff and beneficiaries through the distribution of over
865,000 CDs. To help provide field training for staff and beneficiaries, 5,821 ha of
demonstration plantations were established in 10 provinces, covering the 6 most
important tree species, and the 17 most important economic tree species. Technical and
managerial staff also went on overseas study tours to seven countries to study such
subjects as project management, information management, plantation establishment and
management, environmental protection, and timber processing. The services of an
international specialist were also obtained to provide recommendations on poplar
management, and local consultancies were contracted from time-to-time to provide
guidance on project related issues.

Rural Infrastructure Program: Support under this program comprised mainly the
construction of forest trails, simple sheds, new or expanded nurseries, nursery equipment
the provision of bore holes, and sub loans for marketing of mainly economic tree
products (fruits, nuts etc). All the required trails and sheds were constructed. Of the 64
nurseries planned for during preparation, 51 were considered adequate, with the savings
being allocated to tree planting. Similarly, of the 670 bore holes planned, 523 were
considered sufficient. Assistance for the marketing of economic tree crop products turned
out to be unnecessary as most products were familiar to Chinese consumers, and existing
arrangements for marketing were thought to be adequate. The activity was therefore
canceled and the money allocated to tree planting.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The SFDP‟s PDO was to ensure that viable, participatory, and locally-managed system
for conservation, management, and sustainable use of forest resources and associated
biodiversity are developed and adopted in project sites to promote sustainable
development and management of forest resources and protect the natural environment.
These practices developed and applied for the protection and sustainable management of
natural forest resources in pilot areas in China would provide models for wider
replication under the government NFPP. The SFDP had three components: (1) Natural
Forest Management; (2) Protected Area Management; and (3) Plantation Establishment.

During preparation, a comprehensive financial and economic analysis was carried out for
the PE Component. The estimation of the technical coefficients, such as yield, in puts
and output prices, tree growth cycle, etc., was based on the existing plantations and
models of timber and economic trees. At completion, the economic and financial
analysis was repeated following the same format and based on the same tree/ plantation
models and cash flows used at appraisal. Economic benefits of the PE component were
quantified at completion using actual data (at completion) of costs and yields and
economic (ERR) and financial rate (FRR) of returns were estimated.

Economic Benefits

The PE component aimed to increase wood production to meet the growing gap between
domestic supply and demand, to generate new employment and income for forest farms
and rural households affected by the logging ban and other restrictions on forest land use,
and to improve environmental management. At completion, the PE component reached
far beyond of its original plantation establishment targets.

Project output. A total area of 163,800 ha of timber plantations (as compared to 115,090
ha at appraisal, or 142% of the original target) was established. It is estimated that 29.85
million m3 of timbers will be produced (as compared to 13.31 million m3, or 224% of the
original target). A total area of 37,900 ha of bamboo plantations were established
producing an estimated 3.9 million kg of bamboo. A total area of 42,200 ha of economic
tree was established (as compared to 57,940 ha, or 72.8% of the original). About 2.8
million tons of fruits and other products are estimated to be harvested (as compared to
452,682 tons, or 618% of the original target). In addition, 53,200 m3 of Eucommia
timber is expected to be produced. Pre-commercial thinning was carried out in an area of
86,200 ha of existing plantations (as compared to 61,330, or 141% of the original target).
Incremental revenue of pre-commercial thinning was calculated (based on „with/without
project scenario‟) to amount to 3.12 million m3, while incremental timber growth on
remaining stocking volume would amount to 1.96 million m3.

Economic revenue. Economic revenue would be generated from (1) timber and resin
production from plantations and pre-commercial thinning activities; (2) bamboo timber
and bamboo shoots production; and (iii) economic (fruit) tree crops.




                                            53
Total project revenues is estimated to be CNY20.698 billion (or US$3.03 billion
equivalent, using an exchange rate of US$1=CNY6.8282(2010)), including CNY9.83
billion from timber/ resin production, CNY2.637 billion from bamboo products, and
CNY6.64 billion from fruit production. Revenue of timber and resin generated from pre-
commercial thinning is estimated to be CNY1.61 billion (US$235.6 million equivalent).

Project costs. Project costs included investment costs and plantation management costs.
Final investment costs at completion were calculated at CNY1.530.2 billion (US$187.7
million equivalent) or 96% of originally planned costs. Plantation management costs
were at CNY5.032 billion of which CNY989 million were spent on labor (CNY15/day),
and CNY541 million were spent on material, representing 64.65% and 35.35% of the
total, respectively. Post-completion costs include maintenance costs of plantations, and
the harvest costs for the final cutting timber, and collecting fruits of economic tree crops.
Recurrent costs of plantation management include direct plantation maintenance costs:
labor, materials (fertilizer, pesticides), irrigation charges (for fruit trees) and harvesting
costs. Indirect costs, such as extension, training, site survey except environmental
monitoring cost, which occurs every year, are only included in the first year of
investment, but were not included in the recurrent costs of the following years. Because
of the continuous depreciation of the US Dollar against the CNY, the actual amount of
the IBRD loan decreased by an estimated CNY51.83 million (of 6.7% of the original
amount), which required the provision of additional counterpart funds of about
CNY30.97 million (or 4.01%) .

Methodology and Data Sources Applied in the Analysis

Cash flow crop models were used for estimating the net present value (NPV) and internal
rate of returns (IRR). The methodology applied at completion was identical to that at
appraisal, except for the fact that estimation at appraisal was based on existing model
parameters and price at appraisal while this post-analysis is based on the actual data
collected from the field after project completion. Price data for inputs and outputs was
collected from the project provinces. A weighted average of 2005 market prices was
used, which may not reflect 2010 prices. Especially, the labor cost of CNY15/day used
in the post-analysis may underestimate the current opportunity cost of labor. The Bank
team discussed this issue in detail with the Borrower which maintained that labor cost in
the remote areas of the project were still very low because of the absence of alternative
employment opportunities for forest farmer and therefore insisted on applying the same
labor cost estimate used at appraisal.

Main Assumptions for the Models

A one-hectare model is applied for financial and economic analysis for each of the 39
species. Three species have been omitted because these models were not applied or areas
planted were negligible. IRR and NPV were estimated through cash flow calculation.
Incremental cost and revenue analysis (focusing on with and without-project scenarios)
was used to assess investment in plantation rehabilitation, and full cost-benefit analysis
was used to assess new plantation development. The model does not include the revenue



                                             54
derived from inter-cropping revenue and any such benefits directly increase the income
of beneficiary farmers. The hectare model for calculating the rate of return include: (1)
the investment costs of materials and equipment, such as seeds and seedlings, fertilizers
and pesticides, manure, equipment hire and tools; (2) labor costs for site clearing,
preparation, planting, tending, road maintenance, guard house construction, and
harvesting; (c) indirect costs such as site surveying and design work, management and
quality monitoring, training and extension; (d) accompanying irrigation costs for tree
species were applied; and (e) all relevant provincial and national taxes and fees. A
discount rate of 12% was used for estimation. The assumptions are identical to those
made at appraisal.

The cost-benefit analysis for all timber species (17) is based on: (1) a single rotation,
which implies that none of the costs and benefits of replanting a site has been considered;
(2) a 20-year time period, which captured the full rotation of all timber species financed
under the Project; (3) complete production and harvesting costs; and (4) thinning and
tending assumptions for all relevant species and the revenue generated from the sale of
thinned wood. The cost-benefit analysis for all economic tree crops is based on: (1) a
single planting cycle which assumes natural attrition; (2) a 16-year time period which
directly corresponds to the loan period and includes the 7-year grace period; (3) complete
production and harvesting costs; (4) complete investment costs; and (5) pruning
assumptions for all relevant species. The cost-benefit analysis for five species of pre-
commercial thinning is based on: (1) existing timber plantation; (2) investment costs in
the first project year include indirect costs (survey and design, training and extension, and
management and monitoring) and direct costs (tending and thinning, and road
maintenance); (3) recurrent costs include management and monitoring, and final cutting;
and (4) incremental revenue includes twice cutting of small dimension (less than 12 cm)
timber, fuelwood, and final timber.

Input and Output Prices

Actual financial prices of inputs and outputs are used in the models for the
implementation years (2003-2009) and projected prices for the rest of years. Financial
prices are the prevailing market prices for purchasing inputs and marketing outputs.
Standard economic conversion factors are used in the economic analysis to convert the
financial costs of specific investments to economic costs, and to convert financial prices
of key inputs to economic prices. The economic output prices are based on actual border
prices for comparable imported timber, fruits and nuts, and adjusted for transport and
processing costs. The economic input prices of seedlings, pesticides, manure, fertilizers,
equipment rental and tools were assumed the same as the financial prices. The farm gate
output prices for thinned wood (in term of the timber crops) and fruit and nuts (in terms
of economic tree crops) were calculated on the basis of the actual prices the famers
received plus transportation and handling costs. In addition, a shadow wage of CNY12
per day is used in the economic analysis to reflect the invisible surplus of agricultural
workers with little alternative employment opportunities in the project areas, leading to a
marginal product of labor below the prevailing market wage.




                                             55
Economic Analysis

The economic analysis was carried out to evaluate the viability of each tree species in the
plantations developed. There were some adjustments, which some original proposed
species to be planted were not planted, while some new species were added to the project
plantations. A few timber tree species were dropped (Loblolly Pine, White Poplar, Pinus
simonii, Abrus, and Phyllostachys), and some additional species were included
(Casuarine equisetifolia, Red Bamboo) were planted. Within the economic trees, four
species (Prickly Ash, Rubber, Chinese Yew, and Hackberry) were not planted, while
Chinese Red Pepper was added. Pre-commercial thinning also had some adjustments that
the plantation of Loblolly Pine was not selected, while two species (Chinese Fir and
Slash Pine) were selected to be included into pre-commercial thinning.

In the cash flow for estimated economic IRR and NPV, the total investment costs include
plantation construction (field works), institutional strengthening, training, and technical
extension. The plantation maintenance costs include all physical inputs and labor costs.
All the prices as mentioned above are the 2005 constant boarder prices. Taxes, fees and
interest payment are excluded, which are, however, reflected in the financial analysis.

Timber species planted have different growth cycles, which result in the generation of
revenue at different periods of time. Under the Project, the maturity period varies from 6
to 25 years. For timber species with longer growth periods, the first and second thinning
would generate minor income from small-diameter timber and fuel wood. For economic
trees, revenue generation would start in different years, which affects the rate of return.
Most of the fruit trees would generate revenue from year 3 to 5 and reach full production
in year 7 to 8 (fruits) and year 14 (nuts). In practice, during the initial growth period of
year 1-4, the income could be derived from intercrops, but the analysis excluded such
income generation.

Overall, the project yielded an ERR of 29% (compared to 25% estimated at appraisal)
and a NPV of US$356 million (compared to US$216 million at appraisal) at a 12%
discount rate over 20 years. At subcomponent level, investment in timber species yielded
an ERR of 28% (compared to 30% at appraisal) and NPV of US$172 million. Economic
tree crops yielded an ERR of 33 percent (as compared to 22 percent at appraisal) and
NPV of US$142 million. The ERR for pre-harvest thinning was estimated based at 26 (as
compared to 22% at appraisal).

The results of the ERR calculation for timber trees and economic trees show that each
model was economically viable. The ERRs for timber species range from 14-32%.
Overall, ERRs at completion are somewhat higher than estimated at appraisal. ERRs
above 30% are bamboo plantation because of multiple products and short maturity of
such plantations. For economic trees, the ERRs range from 13-49%. Detailed results of
the analysis for each species as shown in the Tables 3-1 and 3-2.




                                            56
Financial Analysis

One-hectare models were used to evaluate the financial viability of the project‟s 17
timber trees species, 17 economic tree crop species, and 5 pre-thinning models using the
same assumptions applied above. Benefits are derived from the products (timber, resin,
fruits) and by-products (e.g., fuelwood). Incremental costs and benefits are used for
rehabilitation and pre-commercial thinning and full costs and benefits are used for newly
established plantations. The model employs prevailing market prices, farm gate price for
output and actual occurred costs for inputs. Farm labor is valued at CNY15/person day
as discussed above. The investment period for timber was three years and four years for
economic tree crops. Maintenance costs (recurrent costs) included thinning, irrigation
water charges, fertilizer for some species, and harvesting. The Government exempted
economic tree crops (fresh fruits and nuts) from taxes, but taxes on timber species
remained in place.

The analysis shows that all timber species models were financially viable with FRR
ranging from 15-27%. FRRs of all timber species, except for Paulownia, are higher than
appraisal estimates. The highest FRRs are calculated for bamboo. For economic tree
crops, FRRs range from 11-47% which is different from the estimation during the
appraisal. The FRRs of most of economic trees are much higher than appraisal estimates.
Citrus and chestnuts did not prove to be financially viable due to long time to reach
maturity and high maintenance costs.

The FRR of the project is estimated at 26% versus the appraisal estimate of 22%. The
FRR for timber plantation is estimated at 26% before tax and 24% after tax. The NPV is
calculated at US$174 million before tax and US$137 after tax. The FRR for economic
tree crops is estimated at 32% and the NPV at US$157 million. The FRR for pre-
commercial thinning is estimated at 23% before tax and 21% after tax, and the NPV of
US$37 million before tax and US$28 million after tax.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Protected Areas Management

Beneficiaries: Executive Agency is the State Forestry Administration of the People‟s
Republic of China. Project management offices were affiliated with the World Bank
Loan Projects Management Center of the State Forestry Administration (PMC) , the 7
provincial forestry bureaus of Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hainan and
Gansu, the 9 national nature reserves of Houhe, Badagongshan, Hupingshan, Xuebaoding,
Tanjiahe, Baishuijiang, Jianfengling, Fanjingshan and Bamaxueshan, and the 4 provincial
nature reserves of Piankou, Xiaozhaizigou, Baiyang and Nujiang.

Total Cost: The planned project cost is US$22.85 million, of which domestic counterpart
fund amounts to US$6.85 million (equivalent to 56.86 million RMB), and GEF grant
contributes US$16 million. Due to the appreciation of the RMB, by August 31, 2010, the
actual cost was US$20.17 million of which GEF disbursements accounted for US$16
million and domestic counterpart fund accounted for US$4.17 million (equivalent to
RMB 29.2 million.)

Implementation Period: It was planned to be implemented for 6 years (January 2003 to
August 2009), as it was extended for one year, the project was completed by August 2010.

Project Objectives: By managing nature reserves of global significance and adopting
innovative approaches for developing protected areas management plans, upgrading skills
and improving staff quality, and by involving local communities into management of
protected areas, the project improved the protected areas management level, strengthened
biodiversity conservation and played a demonstration role for China‟s protected areas.

Project Activities: Participatory planning and management of nature reserves;
Community-base nature conservation; Training and capacity building; and Management,
Monitoring and Evaluation.

Effectiveness: The project achieved multiple goals, which are summarized as follows:
Through the participation of all the stakeholders in developing management plans and
community resources management plan, the 13 project protected areas accomplished
scientific and participatory decision making and standardized and systematic
management in nature conservation and biodiversity management, which has promoted
biodiversity conservation of the protected areas. With support provided by the project, the
13 protected areas developed 7 sets of GIS-based ecological baseline maps for the first
time, established and improved outdoor patrol and monitoring system, which has reduced
threats to the areas‟ biodiversity. Community co-management mechanism were
developed, which promoted co-development of nature conservation and communities,
raised public awareness of conservation and gradually altered the traditional use of
natural resources and the environmentally unsustainable production practices. 484
training workshops and study tours with 24,269 person/times participating and equipment
investments allowed the 7 provinces and the 13 protected areas to strengthen their



                                            62
institutional capacity. This can be exemplified by a large number of staff with modern
management and knowledge for protected areas and upgraded management level of
protected areas.

Plantation Establishment Component

Project name: The World Bank financed “Sustainable Forestry Development Project?
(Plantation Establishment Component)

Implementation period: From January 29, 2003 to August 31, 2009, 6.5 years in total.

Project objectives: The project of this component are to support increasing wood
production to meet the increasing gap between domestic wood supply and demand;
generate new employment and incomes for forestry farms and rural households; and
improve environmental management.

The borrowers: The project borrowers are of 4 levels. The first level is the Ministry of
Finance, P. R. China (on behalf of the Chinese government). The second level is the
Peoples‟ Governments of 11 project provinces (regions) of Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning,
Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Hainan and Sichuan. The third level is the
Peoples‟ Governments of the 109 counties (cites) of the above-mentioned 11 provinces
(regions). The fourth level is the 770,903 farmers, household groups, shareholding
forestry farms, collective forestry farms or state-owned forestry farms of the above 109
project counties (cites).

Total investment: The planned total project investment is RMB1.55102 billion
(equivalent to USD187.73 million (in 2003)), including the loan offered by IBRD of
USD93.90 million, (equivalent to RMB 779.37 million) and counterpart fund of RMB
771.65 million (equivalent to 92.96 million USD). As of August 31, 2009, the total
project investment of USD196.03 million (equivalent to RMB 1.53016 billion) has been
disbursed, including the World Bank loan of USD93.21 million and the actual
counterpart fund of RMB 802.62 million.

Loan terms: (1) The loan period is 16 years including 7 years of grace period; (2) When
the World Bank loan become effective, a fee in an amount equal to 1% of the loan
amount shall be paid to the World Bank. The World Bank shall withdraw from the Loan
Account of the project and pay to itself the amount of said fee; (3) A commitment charge
shall be paid at the rate of 0.75% per annum on the principal amount of the Loan not
withdrawn from time to time; (4) Interest shall be paid on the principal amount of the
Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time, at a rate for each Interest Period
equal to LIBOR Base Rate, which shall be determined reasonably by the World Bank
semiannually.

Main achievements: (1) 163,800 ha of high-standard timber plantation has been
established, also served as the demonstration base for development of fast-growing and
high-yield plantation in China‟s pivot areas, which has increased forest resource in the


                                          63
project areas; (2) 42,200 ha of economic tree crops and 37,900 ha of bamboo plantation
have been planted under the project, which has contributed to farmers‟ efforts to become
rich in forest and mountain areas, and to construction of new socialist countryside. (3)
The World Bank Loan has been used for the first time to demonstrate improved forest
management approach where pre-commercial thinning of 86,200 ha of existing
plantations has been accomplished and useful experiences accumulated; (4) The design
approach of participatory community forestry appraisal has been implemented and
promoted, which has created 65.95 million persons-day of employment opportunities to
local farmers. With 770,000 farmers taking part in the project, farmers‟ recent incomes
and overall knowledge attainments have been improved; (5) Forest coverage rate of
project counties has grown by 1.41% on the average. In 2013, carbon sequestration of
plantation in the project will reach to its maximum value when 9.201 million tons of
nitrogen is fixed, which will contribute actively to improving ecological environment of
project areas and coping with global climate change.

Main benefits: It has been calculated that 163,800 ha of project timber plantation will
produce a total stand volume of 29.8478 million cubic meters, including 19.5788 million
cubic meters of standard timber, 924,500 cubic meters of non-standard timber, 2.4285
million tons of firewood and 37.7882 million kg of resin. Meanwhile, 37,900 ha of
newly-established bamboo plantation will produce 3.943 billion kg of bamboo timber and
bamboo shoots, and 42,200 ha of project economic tree crops will be able to produce
2.798 billion of fruits, leaves and bark. Furthermore, 86,200 ha of pre-commercial
thinning of existing plantations have been implemented, bringing about an increase of
3.1966 million cubic meters to the total stand volume, an increase of 1.9622 million cubic
meters of timber and 14.3544 million kg of resin. The After-tax NPV of the whole project
is 1.840 billion Yuan and the after-tax financial internal rate of return is 24.6%.

Important experiences: (1) On a basis of learning implementation experiences from
former World Bank loan forest projects, forestry sector of China has been keeping up
with the times, and established strong organizations and the technology guarantee system;
(2) Economical rules and natural rules have been complied with, and willingness of
beneficiaries groups been respected; (3) Technical extension services have been
strengthened; (4) More attention has been given to planting material development.

Suggestions: (1) The proportion of investment composition of this project should be
properly adjusted to facilitate the implementation of this project; (2) More consideration
should be put into resistance against risks of natural disasters and relevant
countermeasures in the stage of project appraisal and design.

Follow-up plans: (1) The follow-up management responsibilities will be further
clarified; (2) Follow-up management plans will be developed; (3) More efforts will be
inserted to loan repayment.

Annex 6. Comments of Co-financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Summary of Evaluation Findings of Final EU Report:

Relevance

The project is of central relevance to high level EU and China cooperation in that it
contributes to China‟s reform process supported by greater friendship, stronger trade, and
further human resource development relationships in natural forest related business with
emphasis on profit linked to carbon fixation by 2010.

Design

The design was not achieved through normal processes of problem identification and
consideration of many solutions. It came out of a 1999 World Bank programme process.
Luckily the financing agreement contained features that would allow for flexibility but
the profile of the European Co-Director proposed in the service contract was
inappropriate. In simple terms a director profile useful to the Chinese forestry reform
process was replaced by an administrator profile. This coupled with considerable delays
caused by the factors beyond the control of the project have limited achievements.
Limited monitoring and a weak MTR meant that design weaknesses were not properly
identified or corrected. The very late start of a practical approach from the European
consultants within the Project Management and Institution Building (PMIB) component
has also meant that new design problems have been added. These are mentioned in the
following sections.

Efficiency

The efficiency of the natural forest management (NFM) component was good. This led to
excellent reports, well characterised case studies, and motivated forest bureau
management teams and villagers. The Project provides a good base for follow-on projects
by member states. The efficiency of the community development component was very
good. The number of people whose lives have been enriched by the credit livelihood and
infrastructure inputs is in excess of 40,000. Some excellent forest friendly livelihood
improvements have come about eg. improved bee keeping. The efficiency of the
information training and dissemination component was also good, with thousands of
people trained and forestry manuals disseminated. This occurred despite the absence of a
component leader for much of the Project. The component was also constrained by the
late production of forestry wisdom to be disseminated. The design of the PMIB
component and the resulting lack of clarity on the best use of EU procedures, prevented a
result that would support and integrate the other components to the full. It did however
raise awareness in the excellent Chinese Co-Director and County forest bureau staff of
what kind of mistakes to avoid in follow on projects.




                                           65
Effectiveness
The NFM result was effective; it showed villagers how to reduce damage to forest and
how forest protection can be profitable e.g. by using bamboo. The CD component was
very effective in improving asset and income levels. The ITD component was also very
effective in changing attitudes. The PMIB component did not establish the systems for
helping the other components to be more effective so as to keep positive biodiversity
effects as a target. It did not help allocate duties in relation to management, direction and
fund leverage. The management information system did not work in terms of keeping an
instantly available accurate record on assets such as the length of road etc. It introduced
an inappropriate micro-proposal system for villagers‟ ideas that marginalized provincial
actors and gave rise to frustration in the village. It doggedly stuck to the 1999 World
Bank village list instead of being flexible in response to clear problems that would
provide valuable insights for China, identify champion villages for others to learn from
and play one area against another to maximize lessons learned. This lack of effectiveness
has a positive outcome in terms of showing others how to avoid pitfalls in the future. This
in itself is an important impact pathway.

Impact

The impact of the Project is good. It managed to spread (1) interest in forest tourism, (2)
improved beekeeping practice, (3) optimized firewood practice and (4) developed use of
participatory approaches in forestry. It has also created a demand for GIS and strategic
forest management manuals that will spread the word after Project closure. There has
been little impact on forest policy and procedures.

Sustainability

There are good prospects for sustainability of some Project elements such as credit
groups, cooperatives and profitable side-lines which will remain and flourish. Biogas will
carry on in areas with sufficient animals. However the lack of forest policy and
procedures is a serious impediment to more widespread take-up.
