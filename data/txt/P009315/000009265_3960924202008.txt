AFGHANISTAN - FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
(CREDIT 779-AF)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Fruit and Vege-
table Export Project in Afghanistan, for which Credit 779-AF in the amount of
IJS$18.0 million was approved on March 21, 1978.   The Credit was closed as
scheduled on June 30, 1985; an unused balance of US$16.9 million was can-
celled as the Project largely was not implemented due to internal strife in
the country. The date of final disbursement was January 20, 1981.
The PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office, and is based in part on a review of the Staff Appraisal
Report (No. 1782-AF) dated February 21, 1978, the President's Report (No.
P-2248-AF) dated March 9, 1978, the Credit Agreement cf September 27, 1978,
correspondence with the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda on project issues
as contained in relevant Bank files, as well as interviews with officials in
the Bank who have been associated with the project. In view of the unsettled
conditions in the country, a copy of the draft PCR was not sent to Afghani-
stan for comments.
This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
.AFGHANISTAN - FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
(CREDIT 779-AF)
EVALUATION SUNMARY
Introduction
The project was the seventh IDA-financed operation in the agricul-
tural sector in Afghanistan. It was directed at the horticulture subsector,
which faced a number of constraints, principal among which were uncertain
availability of irrigation water, continued preoccupation of farmers with
wheat production, low level of fertilizer use, poor extension service and
poor access to institutional credit, absence of trellised vineyards, and weak
marketing infrastructure.
Objectives
The main project objectives were to increase and promote the export
of raisins, vegetable seeds and fresh vegetables; increase production of
grapes and vegetables; and develop operational capabilities in the project-
related institutions.
Implementation Experience
The project was delayed nine months in getting underway due to a
disagreement between the Government and IDA regarding selection of heads of
implementing agencies and selection of consultants (para. 2.05).  Once these
issues were resolved by May 1979, when the credit became effective, the
project still could not start up due to internal strife in the country. No
missions could take place after November 1978 for security reasons.   The
credit was suspended in April 1980 and was closed as soon as the original
Closing Date of June 30, 1985 was reached.   As of November 1985, no Bank
group financed projects were under supervision in Afghanistan.
Results
Since virtually no physical investments under the project were
realized, none of the objectives was reached and no substantive results
materialized.



- iv -
Sustainability
There are no benefits to su%tain under this project.
Findings and Lessons
Even though the project was well conceived and appropriate, imple-
mentation could not take place due to unforeseen political circumstances in
the country. But even before the onset of civil strife, the project suffered
serious setbacks during the early stages of execution which delayed start-up
activities. Within a year after effectiveness, the credit was suspended; 94X
of the credit eventually had to be cancelled (para. 5.01).

FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EXPORT PROJECT
Credit 779-Ar
PROJECT CONFLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Agricultural Sector.  Agriculture is the key sector in the economy of
Afghanistan. At the time the project was prepared, the agricultural sector
employed about 54% of the labor force and accounted for 50% of GDP. About 60%
of export earnings came from agriulture, with fresh and dried fruits and nuts
accounting for 45% of total export earnings. Farm incomes were low (US$100
per capita) and 50% of the rural population was estimated to be below the
poverty level of US$89 per capita, as compared to the country-wide per capita
income of US$160 in 1976.
1.02     Horticulture Subsector.  Fruit and vegetable cultivation accounted
for about 6% of the total 8.2 million ha of cultivated area, 10% of seasonally
irrigated land and about 10-15% of permanently irrigated land. About 100,000
farmers were directly engaged in horticultural production, mostly vegetables,
while nearly the whole agricultural labor force was engaged in some seasonal
work in horticulture. The horticultural subsector, due to its nature of
relatively high-labor intensity, provided substantial employment within the
sector.
1.03     The subsector was faced with a number of constraints, which resulted
in low yields and slow growth in productivity. Principal among these were
uncertain availability of irrigation water, continued preoccupation of the
farmers with wheat production, low level of fertilizer use, poor extension
service and poor access to institutional credit, absence of trellised
vineyards, and weak marketing infrastructure.
1.04     The Seven Year Plan.  The targets in the seven-year development plan
(197b-83) called for a 4.2X increase in annual income from fruit production
and a 2.9% yield growth, which compared with 0.8% and 0.25% annual growth
respectively during the previous seven year period. The high export growth of
9% per annum over the previous seven years (1969-76) was at the expense of a
decline in domestic per capita consumption as the area cultivated was almost
unchanged. Substantial efforts to increase fruit production were therefore
necessary to maintain and increase exports in the face of rising domestic
consumption.



-2-
1.05      IDA Strategy.  IDA's agricultural strategy recognized that special
efforts would be required to help Afghanistan, which is among the 29 least
developed countries designated by the United Nations. IDA's objectives were
to establish a basis for financing projects which would expand production,
promote institution building, increase the foreign exchange earning capacity,
improve absorptive capacity, and enlarge government resources for development.
1.06      In early 1976, the Government of Afghanistan requested IDA to
assist in financing a fruit and vegetable export project to improve
horticultural production and provide markets for fruits and vegetables. The
Fruit and Vegetable Export Project was the seventh IDA financed operation in
the agricultural sector with Credits totalling US$69 million. The project
was prepared within the framework of the seven-year plan and IDA's overall
objective to develop the horticulture subsector.
II. PROJECT PROCESSING
2.01      Project Identification.  The project was identified by a IDA
Horticultural Subsector Survey Mission which visited Afghanistan in May
1976. The mission identified the following areas of activity; (a)
establishment of a Fruit and Nuts Trade Regulatory Commission; (b) a Fruit
Marketing Corporation; (c) a Vegetable Export Corporation; (d) development of
production of improved vegetable seeds and nursery stock; and (e) promotion
of fruit juice concentrates.
2.02      Project Preparation.  The preparation study was carried out by
international consultants funded by UNDP, with IDA as the Executing Agency.
The report was issued on April 25, 1977. It included the following six
components and was to be implemented by five government agencies:
(i) Raisin Marketing - expand and reorganize the Afghan Raisin
Institute (ARI) to enable it to implement a comprehensive
quality control program. At full development, about 60,000 tons
of raisins were expected to be processed annually;
(ii) Vegetable Seed Multiplication and Fruit Root Stock Production -
provide the Afghan Seed Company (ASC) with facilities, equipment
and technology to multiply vegetable seeds for export under
contract to an international seed firm and to produce fruit
rootstock, principally grapevine seedlings, to meet domestic
needs;
(iii) Vegetable Export - establish a government supported Afghan
Vegetable Export Company (AVEC) and equip it to export 8,500
tons of vegetables annually;
(iv)  Agroindustries Credit - provide investment financing for the
development of horticulturally based agroindustries through the
Export Promotion Bank (EPB);



-3-
(v)  On-tarm Credit - provide medium- and long-term credit, primarily
for trellising about 9U0 ha of vineyards for raisin and grape
production, through the Agriculture Development bank of
Afghanistan (AgBank); and
(vi) Raisin Marketing Credit - provide a line of short-term credit to
farmers through EPl to enable them to phase their raisin
marketing over a longer period and participate in the ARI
quality Control Program.
About 69 man-years equivalent of technical assistance was included in each
component. Internation41ly qualified experts would be hired to assist in
implementing the project and to train local personnel in management and
technical skills.
2.03      Appraisal.  Based on the preparation report, an appraisal mission
visited Afghanistan in June 1977. The appraisal mission made no significant
changes in the project components included in the preparation report. The
principal objectives of the project were to; (a) improve and expand existing
marketing channels for the export of raisins, vegetable seeds and fresh
vegetables; (b) increase production of grapes and vegetables, and raise labor
productivity by providing credit for fertilizers and on-farm investment; and
(c) develop and strengthen the institutions responsible for implementing the
project.
2.04      The total project cost was estimated at US$27.to million, of which
IDA would finance US$18.0 million (65%). The proceeds of the credit were to
be allocated as indicated in the following table;

The total estimated cost of technical assistance was USt5.1 million of which
IDA would finance US$4.0 million. UNDP agreed to cofinance the balance of
the technical component (US$ 1.1 million), with IDA as the executing agency.
2.05      Nesotiations and Effectiveness.  Negotiations were completed in
December 1977 without any major issues Seing raised. The major condition to
be met prior to Board approval was the establishment of AVEC. This was
Carried out and the credit was approved by the Board on March 21, 1978.
however, the credit agreements were not signed until September 27, 1978. The
delay was in part due to disagreements on certain required revisions to IDA's
legal agreements. The situation was exacerbated by the political turmoil
which resulted from a change of government in April 1978. The number of
agen.ies involved in effecting the required revisions also contributed to the
delay in signing of the agreement. In addition to these problems, the
Government objected to the requirement for prior consultation with IDA before
appointing new heads to the various project entities. A compromise solution
was reached whereby IDA agreed not to intervene in selection, but merely to
be informed of appointments made by the government. The Government only
later objected to the technical assistance component as being too large and
not giving government a sufficient role in the selection process of
international consultants. IDA maintained its position not to reduce the
size of the component and to remain as executing agency. The government
eventually agreed to this position and all outstanding issues delaying
effectiveness were resolved by early 1979.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01      Start up:  From March to November 1978 four supervision missions
visitea Afghanistan, mainly to resolve the issue of the size and execution of
the technical assistance component. No further supervision missions were
possible due to security reasons. The selection of consultants for the
technical assistance component was completed and a contract was signed in
April 1979. However, due to politicaL conditions, little work was done and
the contract was suspended in May 1980.
3.02      The credit was suspendea in April l96U and an undisbursed balance
of US$16.91 million was cancelled on the original Closing Date June 30, 1985.
IV. IDA's PERFORMANCE
4.01      The project was identified and prepared in accordance with the
needs of the borrowing country. Every effort was made to geL the project off
to a good start under the political conditions then prevailing in
Afghanistan. The four supervision missions were necessitated by the delays
in signing and effectiveness of the Credit. After the last supervision in
November 1978, annual updates to the supervision summaries were made based on
verbal reports received during the annual meetings.
V. CONCLUSIONS
5.01      The project was well conceived and appropriate.  However, thi.
project suffered serious setbacks during the early stages of execution which
delayed its implementation. Within a year after effectiveness, the credit
was suspended and the undisbursed balance was cancelled on June 30, 1985, the
original Closing Date. No substantive ex-post assessment of thU project is
possible.
