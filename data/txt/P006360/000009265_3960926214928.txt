MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR AN IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
irrigation subsector loan to Brazil for US$195 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms
with 15 years maturity, includin& five years of grace. It would help
finance private irrigation development in 10 Central and Southern states
and the Federal District.
2.       Background.  In the 1970s, agricultural growth in Brazil averaged
6Z per annum, based largely on the expansion of export crops (soybeans,
citrus, tobacco, coffee and cocoa) and sugar cane for the alcohol program.
In the early 1980s, the sector entered a period of relative stagnation,
caused in part by overall macroeconomic difficulties, limitations in the
availability of rural credit, consumer price controls and falling world
commodity prices. Agricultural exports have levelled off at around US$8
billion, per capita food production has declined and food imports-have
increased (from around US$1 billion in 1981 and 1982 to US$2 billion in
1986). As a consequence, and faced with falling commodity prices, the
Government is promoting cost-effective investments to increase productivity
and shift production towards domestic consumption needs. One of the
principal elements of this strategy is the promotion of accelerated
investment by farmers and the Government in irrigation.
3.       To plan and coordinate-thesc investments, the Government, in early
1986, established the National Irrigation Program-(PRONI) in the Office of
the President, headed by a Minister without portfolio. PRONI has legal
responsibility for formulating policy and coordinating the activities of
federal, state and private agencies towards expanded private irrigation
outside the Northeast Region, which has its own program. PRONI's main
objectives are to: (a) increase the production of food grains, vegetables
and fruits; (b) build a sound institutional and legal framework for the
continued expansion of private irrigation, consistent with sustained
availability and equitable distribution of water resources and with
environmental protection needs; and (c) expand direct and indirect
employment opportunities in rural areas. PRONI is expected to coordinate
closely with the Ministry of Agriculture, other federal irrigation
agencies, the Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras (ELETROBRAS), and state
extension and electric companies. From the technical viewpoint, PRONI is
expected particularly to encourage exploitation of recent technological
advances in irrigation and soil management in the riverine, but drought-
prone, cerrados (savannah lands) in the Center and South of the country.
These vast areas, 10 million ha of which are already under rainfed
cultivation, present a good combination of soil, climate and year-round
surface water for cost-effective irrigation development. Farmers have
demonstrated increasing interest in investing in irrigation. The main
constraints to further private irrigation expansion are the availability of
electric power and hydraulic infrastructure. Over the longer term, as
irrigation investments intensify, expansion will depend on sound management
and equitable distribution of water resources.



-2-
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's assistance strategy in
-Brazil is to support policies and investments that will encourage economic
growth and social development in a context of macroeconomic stability. The
emphasis is on efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in the
public sector and appropriate targetting and delivery of support systems
for the poor. Because of the agricultural sector's impact on trade
balances, rural employment and incomes, and urban wage levels, a resumption
of agricultural growth is critical for Brazil's economic recovery. Bank
lending is encouraging this growth through support for sector policy
reforms and for selected, high priority subsectoral investments. Private
irrigation, by intensifying production on existing agricultural lands, is
potentially one of the most cost-effective strategies for achieving the
growth objective.  Through the proposed project, the Bank would contribute
to the development of policies, institutional arrangements and
environmental protection measures to support more rational and sustained
expansion of irrigation over the long term.
5.       Project Obiectives.  The project has two related objectives.
First, by helping to overcome constraints to on-farm, private irrigation
development -- limited availability of electricity and hydraulic
infrastructure, including drainage works and small dams -- the project
would facilitate increased investment in private irrigation by farmers and
increases in agricultural production and employment. Second, it would set
the stage for continued expansion of private irrigation by supporting a
comprehensive set of institutional development activities. These
activities aim to decentralize management and decision making for
irrigation to the state level, increase knowledge about irrigated
agriculture, help shape future policies for rational, long-term management
of water resources for irrigation, and provide appropriate environmental
protection guidelines and enforcement measures.
6.       Project Description.  The project, to be coordinated by PRONI,
would help finance a five-year time slice of the PRONI program. Around
700,000 ha of new irrigation would be developed, benefitting over 50,000
farmers in 10 states in the Center West, Southeast and South of the country
and in the Federal District. It would inciude: (a) construction of
electricity distribution lines by state electric companies (782 of baseline
costs) to serve farmers in priority locations; (b) drainage of flood plains
and other small infrastructure investments by federal and state agencies
(17Z of baseline costs); and (c) institutional development (5Z of baseline
costs). This last component, to be executed by PRONI, would help PRONI and
the states to: (i) strengthen institutions, policies and legal frameworks
for irrigation development, water resource management and related
environmental protection measures; (ii) decentralize irrigation planning
and implementation to the states; (iii) promote irrigation-focused research
and training; and (iv) strengthen farmer services for irrigation. Credit
for on-farm development would not be financed under the loan, but would be
available to farmers through both the official and private banking systems.
Existing and proposed credit lines, to which banks would have access,
include a Japanese OECF loan of Y12 billion (US$95 million) and the First
Agricultural Credit Loan (US$300 million), which is expected to be
presented to the Bank's Board of Directors this fiscal year. For public
infrastructure investments, the criteria for selecting areas include
suitable soils for the production of crops, the availability of water and
energy at reasonable cost, adequate roads, crop storage and other
infrastructure, the existence of skilled farmers willing to invest in
irrigation and whose production could be increased substantially through
irrigation, and the exclusion of Amerindian and wildlife reserves.

7.       The project would provide funds for purchases of equipment and
materials, civil works and technical assistance. The total cost is
estimated at US$435 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$129 million (30Z). The Bank loan of US$195 million would finance 502
of total project costs (excluding taxes and duties). To facilitate an
early start to the project, retroactive financing up to US$10 million
equivalent would be provided for eligible expenditures made from
November 1, 1987 to the date of loan signing. Federal funds for the
project would be channelled through PRONI to the executing agencies. The
remaining funds would be provided by the state treasuries, farmers, and
from the budgets of the executing agencies.  Bank loan funds would be made
available to the executing agencies-on a grant basis, except in the case of
the electrification component, where funds would be on-lent to state
companies under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.  Cost
recovery of the public sector investments would take place: (a) directly in
the case of power distribution lines through connection charges and
electricity tariffs; and (b) indirectly for hydrological works through
taxation (16Z) on the gross value of farm output. A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map and Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7161-BR dated May 16,
1988 are also attached.
8.       Actions Agreed On.  Conditions of Effectiveness: (a) contracting
by PRONI of consultants for project startup and management activities, and
receipt by the Bank of a satisfactory consolidated annual operating plan
(POA) for 1988; (b) confirmation that the Government has budgeted adequate
funds from its 188 budget and that the funds have been made available to
executing entities in accordance with the 1988 POA; (c) establishment of
PRONI's Consultative Council, with membership satisfactory to the Bank; and
(d) receipt by the Bank of satisfactory federal coordinating arrangements
and of satisfactory contractual agreements between the Government and at
least seven state governments. Condition of Disbursement: for electricity,
hydraulic works and institutional development investments in each state,
that the Bank has received a satisfactory legal agreement between the
Office of the Minister of Irrigation and the state government. Agreements
Reached at Negotiations: (a) plans for power installations financed under
the project would be reviewed by ELETROBRAS at least annually to ensure
compliance with ELETROBRAS' technical and environmental guidelines;
(b) PROhI, in cooperation with the Special Environmental Secretariat, would
prepare environmental guidelines and monitoring and enforcement measures
for future irrigation development, and the guidelines and measures would be
submitted to the National Environmental Council for its consideration by
September 30, 1989; (c) prior to the guidelines going into effect, PRONI
would send to the Bank for its review and approval any electrification,
drainage or water control project to be financed under the loan that may
have adverse effects on the environment, including indigenous populations
and wildlands; and (d) a Project Management Unit, with a Project Manager,
key staff and operational structure and furctions satisfactory to the Bank,
would be established and maintained within PRONI.
9.       Benefits.  At relatively low cost, irrigation would allow cropping
intensities of up to 200% on areas presently growing single rainfed crops.
The value of incremental production generated annually upon completion of



-4-
the project in 1993 is expected to be around US$650 million for grains and
US$250 million for vegetables and fruit. Direct employmernt for some 20,000
workers and indirect employment in agricultural processing and service
industries for about twice that number would be generated. Financial rates
of return to on-farm development would be in the range of 19Z to 472. The
internal economic rate of return to the project is estimated at 212.
10.      Risks.  The main risk for the project concerns the institutional
arrangements and whether PRONI, a new program, will be able to organize
effectively the necessary coordination amongst the several federal, state
and private entities expected to be involved in carrying out the project.
This concern has been addressed explicitly in the design of the project.
The institutional development component includes substantial management
assistance to help PRONI and the state coordinating entities define their
planning and operating procedures and to help PRONI develop a longer-term
policy focus towards water resource management and environmental protection
measures.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
