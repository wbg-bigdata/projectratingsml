MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA
FOR A PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM PROJECT
1.        The  following  memorandum  and  recommendations  on  a  proposed
development credit to the Republic of Rwanda for SDR 3.4 million (US$4.4
million) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years and would help support the reform of
the public enterprise sector in Rwanda.
2.        Background.  Following a period of high growth, Rwanda's economy
began to show signs of financial stress in the early 1980s as a result of
unfavorable  terms  of  trade  developments  and  insufficient  domestic
adjustments. A contributing factor to Rwanda's economic problems has been
the poor performance of the large public enterprise sector (62 enterprises
with Government ownership account for an estimated 10 percent of GDP).
Government transfers to public enterprises represented about 10 percent of
Government revenues during 1983-87.   Given the deterioration of Rwanda's
economic situation, IDA's dialogue with the Government over the last three
years has focused on the need to restore the competitiveness of the economy
through the implementation of a comprehensive reform program addressing the
major structural problems, including exchange rate overvaluation, trade
distortions and public sector inefficiencies.   :hile there is a general
consensus in Rwanda that the public enterprise sezror is inefficient and
should be restructured the Government is still considering the adoption of
other macroeconomic reform measures. Recognizing the need to move forward,
and to address issues facing public enterprises before they reach crisis
dimensions as in many other countries, IDA agreed to assist the Government
in its PE reform efforts, while continuing the dialogue on the need for
structural adjustment to put Rwanda back on the rapid growth path of the
1970s.
3.        Project Objectives.  The major objective of the proposed operation
is to assist the Government to improve its capacity to implement its public
enterprise reform program. This program aims to (i) reduce the burden that
public enterprises have placed on the Government budget and administrative
capacity and (ii) to develop a streamlined and efficient PE sector that will
contribute to the growth of Rwanda's economy.   Specifically, the project
seeks to assist the Government to: (a) redefine the role of the Government
in the PE sector and formulate a policy framework and principles for future
interventions in new enterprises; (b) improve the institutional and legal
framework within which PEs operate; (c) increase the sector's efficiency
through rehabilitation of viable enterprises, divestiture of those which can
be privatized and liquidation of non viable ones; and (d) develop the
national capacity to design, implement and monitor such reforms.
4.        Project  Description.      The  project  would  provide  technical
assistance to the Government to help carry out its public enterprise reform
program in the following three areas: (a) a policy reform package covering
the whole PE sector; (b) restructuring of specific enterprises; and (c)
development of the institutional capacity to design, implement and monitor
PE reforms. The policy reform package for PEs would consist of the following
elements: (i) redefinition of the role of the public sector in the economy.
This would involve establishment of criteria for Government investment in



PEs and elaboration of a disengagement strategy, including adoption of
liquidation and privatization procedures; (ii) clarification of the relations
between the Government and public enterprises.   This would be achieved
through redefining the roles of the technical and financial oversight
ministries, improving the functioning of the boards of directors and
increasing the autonomy and responsibilities of PE managers; and (iii)
establishment of an efficient monitoring system to ensure proper supervision
of PEs by the Government.   The enterprise restructuring component would
consist of furnishing technical assistance under the project to help
liquidate non-viable activities and privatize/rehabilitate viable enterprises
on the basis of detailed restructuring programs prepared with technical
assistance under the project.  It is expected that 16 enterprises would be
restructured and/or privatized with project assistance and that a timetable
and procedures would be established to analyze and restructure the remaining
PEs. The institutional development component would involve the establishment
of a Directorate within rhe Finance Ministry responsible for PE reforms and
monitoring, strengthening of decision-making bodies in charge of PE reforms
and training of PE managers and Finance Ministry staff.   The proceeds of
the IDA credit would be used for: (i) technical asfiistance and equipment to
(a) revise public enterprise legislation; (b) help develop and implement
rehabilitation plans for viable enterprises; (c) assist in the liquidation
of non-viable enterprises and in the implementation of the Government's
privatization strategy; and (d) strengthen the Finance Ministry, which is
responsible for overall supervision of PE performance; and (ii) training of
PE managers and MINIFIN staff.
5.        The project would be carried out over four years.  Total project
cost is estimated at $4.4 million equivalent, with foreign exchange costs of
$3.1 million (70Z). Detailed costs and a financing plan are in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are in
Schedule B.  A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Rwanda are in Schedules C and D. Staff Appraisal Report
No. 8139-RW, dated February 22, 1990 is being distributed separately.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Improvement in the efficiency of
resource use by the PE sector is a key element for financial equilibrium and
growth in Rwanda. The proposed project would help improve Rwanda's financial
situation, while allowing IDA to continue the dialogue on the need to restore
the competitiveness of the economy through comprehensive structural reforms.
The project will also help strengthen measures being undertaken through other
IDA projects involving key public enterprises.
7.        Actions agreed at negotiations.  During negotiations the Rwandese
delegation presented (i) the Government's Policy Statement for Public
Enterprise Reform and (ii) a schedule for the implementation of key actions
that were signed by the Minister of Finance. The Policy Statement includes
the main elements of the reform program described in para. 4 above.   The
schedule includes a timetable for (i) the design and adoption of legislation
on public enterprises; (ii) the design and approval of a general
privatization strategy; (iii) the completion of privatization or liquidation
plans for nine enterprises; (iv) the signature of contract plans with eight
public enterprises; and (v) the completion of diagnostic studies and
rehabilitation or divestiture plans for an additional 23 public enterprises.



Institutional arrangements for the formulation and approval of the reform
progam, including the establishment of a new Directorate of Public
Enterprises within the Ministry of Finance, were also agreed at negotiations.
The actual establishment of this Directorate, which will be in charge of
implementing the public enterprise reform program, including the appointment
*           of a Director and appropriate staff is a condition of effectiveness.
8.        Benefits.   The project will assist Rwanda in achieving a more
*           streamlined,  efficient  and business-oriented  PE  sector with  a  reduced
financial and administrative burden on the Government. Another benefit of
the project would be derived from the restructuring of the sector.   The
closure of uneconomic enterprises would reduce resource waste, while the
sale of viable ones to the private sector and the rehabilitation of those
remaining under Government control are designed to maximize the economic
benefits of those enterprises.
9.        Risks.  Care has been taken in the project design so that it can
improve the economic and financial performance of selected public enterprises
even with some additional postponement of structural adjustment measures.
But if the necessary macroeconomic reforms are postponed indefinitely, there
is a risk that many of the project's expected benefits will not fully
materialize. The policy dialogue is, however, continuing and it is expected
that the Government will take the necessary measures before the economic
situation deteriorates further.
10.       At the program level, as the operation involves broad-ranging and
complex reforms both at the sector and enterprise levels, there is a risk
that vested interests within Government and the affected enterprises will
resist reform measures as these may imply increasing PE autonomy and
replacing  some  existing PE managers.    This  risk  is mitigated  by  the
Government's commitment to carry out the necessary reforms.  A second risk
relates to the privatization program which, if not implemented properly with
clear and transparent criteria, could result in creating a rent situation for
some private investors. Finally, there is the risk that the implementation
of the reform program may be slowied down by the capacity of the Government
administration to carry out the policy reform package and to monitor the
execution  of  enterprise  restructuring  programs.    These  two  risks  are
addressed through the establishment of a Directorate of Public Enterprises
in the Ministry of Finance which will be in charge of implementing the
reforms and providing technical assistance and consulting services to help
Rwandese institutions carry out the tasks envisaged under the project.
11.       Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit -ould
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommenu that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
