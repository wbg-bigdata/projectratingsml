REPORT A1ND RECOilYZNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO TIIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SKEGAL
FOR A HIGIIAY PROJECT
1.     I submit the following report and recommendation on a pro-
posed credit, in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$2.1
million-to the Republic of Senegal, to assist in financing a Highway
Project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.     The Government of Senegal has asked the Association to help
finance a highway project, which would be the third Bank Group opera-
tion in the transport sector in Senegal.
3.     The basis for the present project was laid by a mission from
the Bankts Permanent Mission to Western Africa (PT4IA), which visited
Senegal in 1965 and identified a need for improved feeder roads in
groundnut producing areas. Subsequently, a Senegalese consulting firm,
ORGATEC, carried out feasibility studies for a number of feeder roads
followed by additional economic work which showed at completion in
1969 that for four road sections, economic benefits were sufficient
to justify new construction. For the remaining groundnut roads in the
Sine Saloum region, improvement works rather than construction appeared
adequate. The inclusion in the proposed project of a road maintenance
and improvement study, together with the purchase of urgently needed
maintenance equipment, would provide the basis for a much broader four-
year improvement and maintenance program, for which further Bank Group
assistance is likely to be requested.
4.     Although an appraisal mission went out in iNay 1969, the project
was delayed by the need to-solve various outstanding matters on the
1966 railiwTy project (para. 7). Negotiation of the proposed credit
was completed on hay 6 wfith a delegation led by Iir. Adama Diallo,
Secretary of State for Planning.
5.     The followring is a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
to Senegal as of April 30, 1970:

Total undisbursed                  6.0     7.5      13.5
6.     Prior to independence, a Bank loan was made (Loan 100-FR, 1954)
for US$7.5 million to the Caisse Centrale des Chemins de Fer d' Outre Mer
for dieselization, part of which went to the then Dakar-Niger Railway.
This loan has been fully repaid.
7.     Progress on the railway project has not been satisfactory.   The
project is about two years behind schedule due to delays in bidding
procedures, weakness in the management of the railway and a delay on the
part of the Government in providing the railway with adequate funds.
Satisfactory action is notr bein-g talmn by both Government and
railway on these issues. Execution of the port project has been delayed
because of difficulties in preparing and awarding a dredging contract.
Progress on the agricultural credit project is slow. Unfavorable climatic
conditions and institutional problems, mainly regarding marketing and
extension services, have led to disappointing groundnut crops which, in
turn, reduced demand for agricultural inputs. The Government is making
a considerable effort to remedy the situation and to improve incentives
to farmers.
8.     In August 1968, IFC made an equity investment of US$1.0 million in,
and a long-term loan of US$2.46 million to Soci6te Industrielle des Engrais
du Sen6gal (SIES), a Senegalese company which operates a fertilizer plant
near Dakar. The above-mentioned events in the agricultural sector have
also affected the company which, from the time it began production, has
been faced with a considerable decrease in local fertilizer consumption.
As a result, the company has had to invoke the clauses in its agreement
with the Government which entitle it to receive a payment from the
Government in such circumstances.
9.     No further proposals for IDA credits are expected to be presented
to the Executive Directors before late this year. Preparatory work for a
resettlement project, a rice development project and an education project
is well underway.

PART II - DI CRIPTIOH OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
10. Borrower:               The Republic of Senegal.
Amount:                 In various currencies equivalent to
US$2.1 million.
Purpose:               Construction of four feeder roads; purchase
of road maintenance equipment and vehicles;
consultants' services for a road improve-
ment and maintenance study.
4mortization:          In 50 years including a 10-year period of
grace through semi-annual installments of
1/2 of 1% from September 1, 1980 through
Mlarch 1, 1990 and 1-1/2< from September 1,
1990 through March 1, 2020.
Service Charge:        3/4 of 1% per annum.
Estimated Economic     Road construction:  10-15%
Return on Project:     Equipment:          15-20%
PART III - TIHZ PROJECT
11.    A report entitled "Appraisal of a Highway Project - Senegal"
(PMR-32b) is attached.
12.    Groundnuts are the mainstay of the economy of Senegal and
account for about tlhree quarters of exports. Despite long-range plans
to diversify agriculture, groundnuts will remain the principal item
in foreign exchange earnings within the foreseeable future. The Sine
Saloum region where forty percent of the country's groundnuts are
grown is particularly suited for their cultivation. In this area
all-leather feeder roads are needed to replace uianLproved seasonal
tracls over whic.i goods and passengers nou move unreliabl- and at
high cost.
13.    The project concentrates on the Sine Saloum rogioii and consists of:
(a) construction of 78 km. of feeder roads, including supervision;
(b) purchase of road maintenance equipment and vehicles for
the most urgent needs; and
(c) consultantst services for a road improvement and maintenance
study with special emphasis on feeder roads.



-4-
14.    Total capital expenditures for the project amount to US$2.5
million equivalent of wjhich US$2.1 million or about 8h4 of the total,
representing the foreign exchange costs of the project, would be
financed by the proposed IDA credit.
15.    Procurement would be subject to international competitive bidding.
Construction would be carried 6ut by a prequalified contractor and
completed in one year. Consultants acceptable to the Associa-
tion would be engaged by the Government.  Disbursements would be on
the basis of the estimated foreign exchange component (66%) for feeder
roads construction, the CIF price for imported maintenance equipment
and the actual foreign e:.change expenditures for construction super-
vision and consultantst contracts.
16.    The 11inistiy of Public 'Jorks, Urban Development and Transport
will be responsible for execution of the project. In the construction
work, it will be assisted by the T,aboratoire d Bgtiinent et des
Travaux Publics ir Dakar W''IiiC' is responsible for materials testing.
17.    Improved roads in groundnut production areas will facilitate
the work of Governmentf agencies seeking to increase the output of this
crop. The quantifiable benefits associated with the construction of-
the feeder roads will yield economic rates of return of about 10-15%.
The road improvement and maintenance study would lay the basis for a
four-year improvement and maintenance program, to be carried out in
the first half of the decade writh special emphasis on the feeder road
network. The Government and the Association consider it desirable to
review and study in a broad context all aspects of road improvement
and maintenance work. One of the main items to be studied in the
program will be the improvement work required, on most of the feeder
road netwTork in the-Sine Saloum region. Pending completion and review
of this study, US$1.0 million would be provided under the project to
purchase the most urgently required maintenance equipment which rill
be defined early in the-study and therefore be placed in operation
with a minimum of delay. The improvement works to be executed and
the equipment to be purchased under the program are also expected to
yield high economic returns.
PO?T IV - LEGAL DISTERU1IMITS AUD AUTHORITY
18.    The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Government
of Senegal and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agree-
ment of the Association and the draft Resolution approving the pro-
posed Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors sep-
arately.



19.    The provisions of the draft Development Credit Agreement follow
the usual pattern in similar projects.
PART V - TIE ECOIVAY
20.    A report on "Current Economic Position and Prospects of 3enegal"
(AW-15) is bein& circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
21.    Since it became independent in 1960 Senegal has experienced low
economic growth rates, which are associated with severe problems of
transition after independence and poor crop results in recent years for
groundnuts on which the economy remains heavily dependent. Stagnating
government revenues and slowly increasing expenditures have contributed
to the erosion of public savings and treasury reserves have all but
disappeared. Economic growth is expected to be higher in the coming years
as Senegal has adjusted to some of the post-independence changes.
Groundnut production is expected to be at a more normal level. Graoth
trends in fisheries, cotton production, livestock and groundnut processing
are favorable and project preparation in the rural sector, mainly aimed
at agricultural diversification, has progressed considerably in recent
years. It is therefore expected that the difficult public finance
situation will gradually improve and that a slow increase in public
savings can be achieved in the ccming years.
22.    In recent years, the current account of thie balance of payments
continued to be in deficit, mostly due to trade deficits and outflows
of private investment income. Foreign aid disbursements, although
substantial, were insufficient to cover the current account deficit;
as a result external reserves dropped continuously, standing at $8
million by the end of January 1970. 3enegnal's etorra31 public debt is
Atill smGll and tho dUbt corvico ratio lcxi, 1.8 percent t1. 1956.
23.    In view of the substantial volume of investment needed to realize
the country's growth potential and the modest rate at which public savings
can be restored, a sizeable net capital inflow wqill be required for many
years to come. Considering the country's limited debt servicing capacity,
conventional borrowing should remain limited. Given its poverty, the
obviously difficult development task still ahead, and the country's rea-
sonably good performance in the face of great economic difficulties,
Senegal is considered eligible for IDA assistance.
PART VI - CCMIPANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEINT
24.    I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
