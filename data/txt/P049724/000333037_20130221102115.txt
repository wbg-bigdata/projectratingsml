2.      The Kyrgyz Republic Agribusiness and Marketing Project, financed by an IDA
Credit (SDR 5.5 million, US$8.1 million equivalent) and a PHRD Co-financing Grant
from the Government of Japan (US$4.75 million), was approved on December 14,
2004 and became effective on May 2, 2005. Currently, 92.3% of the IDA credit and
100% of the PHRD Grant have been disbursed.

3.      Most of the project activities were completed by June 30, 2012, with good
results contributing towards achievement of the Project’s Development Objective
                                         3
(PDO). The project has assisted 42 agro-processing enterprises with improvement of
technological processes, marketing, sales, and financial management and accounting.
Some 68 new products were introduced in client enterprises contributing to increase in
sales and profits. The Market Development Service (MDS) facilitated 142 trade deals
resulting in sales of 54,000 tons of products with a total value of US$17.5 million, of
which 89% went to the export market. In addition, the MDS has provided information
and consulting services to 1,971 clients. Under the credit line, 81 borrowers (including
11 cooperatives) have received sub-loans in the total amount of US$5.03 million, and
additionally 27 sub-loans in the total amount of US$1.73 million have been financed
by the Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) from reflows. Overall investments in
the agribusiness sector generated through the credit line amount to about US$14.8
million.

4.      At this time, only activities related to the establishment of the Food
Technology Training Center (FTTC), which is being set up at the Kyrgyz State
Technical University (KSTU), are still on-going. Establishment of the FTTC will
improve the capacity and knowledge of the country’s food technologists and enable
the agribusiness sector to meet the increasing consumer demand for high quality and
safe food products. To ensure timely completion of these activities, the project’s
closing date was extended to March 31, 2013. Significant progress have been achieved
to date: the refurbishment works of the building which will house the FTTC have been
completed, FTTC’s Supervisory Board has been established and held the first meeting,
Director has been hired, and staff training is underway.

5.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to ensure that sufficient budget is
available to complete the establishment of the FTTC. A detailed budget has been
agreed with the counterparts and serves as the basis for this reallocation. Under this
reallocation, all amounts remaining unused under the various disbursement categories
will be reallocated to the (1) Public Sector Investment Category.

6.     The project rating on financial management is “Satisfactory? and the project
has no audit reports pending.

7. This will be the fifth restructuring of this project.
