1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

(a)      General Economy

1.       When project preparations started in 2003, the Kyrgyz Republic was recovering from a
massive economic decline. Immediately after independence, output fell 50 percent, accompanied by a
decrease in tax revenues and the loss of support from Moscow, which resulted in a spike in poverty.
Beginning in the mid-1990s, gross domestic product (GDP) started to grow again and had, by the time of
project preparation, been increasing at a fairly stable rate of about 5 percent a year. However, structural
problems and bottlenecks in the economy impeded economic performance and poverty reduction,
including high levels of public expenditure and public debt, low tax revenues (below 20 percent of GDP),
slow progress with economic reforms (in particular, privatization and strengthening of the banking
sector), poor governance, and high levels of corruption. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) pointed
out the need for more private sector–led growth to decrease the reliance on public employment and to
increase tax revenues. This required improvements in the business and investment climate, reform of the
banking sector, and expansion of exports of goods and services, which were also a focus of the
government’s National Poverty Reduction Strategy and the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy.

(b)      Agricultural and Food Sector Performance

2.       At the time of project appraisal, agriculture accounted for roughly 35 percent of GDP and more
than 40 percent of GDP including agro-food processing and logistics. The sector employed more than 50
percent of the country’s working population. While the economic rebound since the mid-1990s was due in
part to strong agricultural growth, this was largely because of an increase in subsistence farming as a
result of the outflow of labor from other sectors and thus was not seen as an option for sustainable
growth. Agricultural growth rates fell from more than 10 percent annually in 1996 to 3.3 percent in 2002
and 3.9 percent in 2003. Although the poverty rate was falling steadily, poverty remained high in rural
areas, at 55 percent.1

3.       Sustained growth in the agribusiness sector was challenged by low value added, weak supply
chain linkages, low business management capacity, and poor marketing skills. The domestic agro-
processing sector consisted largely of Soviet-legacy state-owned enterprises, characterized by ample
unutilized production capacity, outdated processing equipment, and poor management and marketing
skills; however, Kyrgyz jams and pickles had a positive image and were in high demand in the former
Soviet Union countries. A new group of agro-food processors with diversified production was emerging.
Although some of them were relatively large, most were small and underinvested, lacked adequate
marketing skills and appropriate financial management systems, and did not meet food safety standards.
Their technologies were outdated, and personnel were operating with technical knowledge that was no
longer suitable to the changing market conditions. Lack of trust and contract enforcement led to
interruptions along the supply chains. At the same time, there was a gap in terms of agro-business
consultancy capacity in Kyrgyzstan, which left the agro-food processing sector with few opportunities to
improve technology and marketing. As a result, agricultural value added was limited in the Kyrgyz
Republic, and less than 15 percent of agricultural produce by value went into agro-food processing. The
domestic food market was increasingly captured by foreign food producers, especially from Kazakhstan
and Turkey, and Kyrgyz agro-food production was facing increasingly fierce competition from China and
Europe in the traditional export markets of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The weak supply

 The poverty rate fell from 68 percent in 2000 to 55 percent in 2004, according to the National Statistics
Committee.



                                                          1
chains, together with restrictive commercial transit policies, led to a decline in agro-food exports, from
US$120 million in 1995 to about US$60 million in 2001.

(c)      Banking Sector and Lending to Agriculture

1.      The Kyrgyz banking sector had, in the years prior to appraisal, become more robust
in both size and capacity. However, only about 5 percent of total lending by commercial banks
went for agriculture, agro-processing, and storage activities. An exception was the Kyrgyz
Agricultural Finance Corporation, a non-bank financial institution that had, at the time,
91 percent of its total portfolio in primary agriculture and 8 percent in agro-processing. The key
reasons for the limited lending to agriculture and rural sectors were systemic throughout the
banking sector: chronic lack of long-term resources along with inadequate skills to appraise
long-term agricultural loans. Lack of acceptable collateral in rural areas was another reason, as
commercial banks were reluctant to accept rural land as collateral, preferring real estate in larger
urban areas. Finally, lending to agriculture was perceived as very risky and tools, such as crop
insurance, were not in place to mitigate such risks. Besides production risk, which was a major
concern, commercial banks mentioned poor readiness of borrowers to take loans, especially
weak management capacity and lack of business planning, marketing, sales, and other skills.

2.       At the time of project design and appraisal, the Kyrgyz Republic had been under
the same political leadership since gaining independence in 1991. There was, at the time,
little indication of the domestic and global events that would affect implementation of the
project, namely, the revolution of spring 2005, the global food price crisis (2007–08), the global
financial crisis (2008–09), and the revolution and civil conflict of 2010.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

3.      The direct PDO of the Agribusiness and Marketing Project as defined in the PAD
was “to expand the level of activity of processing, marketing, and trade enterprises
downstream of the farmgate, to increase the number and economic importance of producer
organizations, and to improve the functioning of markets and trade linkages between
producers and primary- and secondary-level trade organizations.? The loan agreement
stated the same objective similarly phrased: “to assist the borrower in: (i) expanding the level of
activity of processing, marketing, and trade enterprises downstream of the farmgate; (ii)
increasing the number and economic importance of producer organizations; and (iii) improving
the functioning of markets and trade linkages between producers and primary- and secondary-
level trade organizations.? The ultimate objective was to increase the amount of value added to
Kyrgyz agro-food commodities, to increase the sale of those commodities both domestically and
abroad, and to improve the operation of domestic agricultural markets.

4.       The key outcome indicators were the following:
       Increase the share of agricultural production being processed

       Increase the role of producer organizations in agricultural marketing

       Improve the repayment performance of loans extended (repayment rate)

       Increase institutional lending to agro-industry clients.

1.3 Revised PDO (as Approved by Original Approving Authority) and Key Indicators and Reasons
or Justification


                                                    2
5.      After working under the original objective for the first two years, it became
apparent that the objective included areas outside the scope of the project and that
measuring progress quantitatively was complicated. Therefore, in order to make the PDO
more streamlined and quantifiable, the PDO was restructured in July 2009. The revised PDO was
“to assist the Borrower in increasing and enhancing the business activities of the Beneficiary
agribusinesses supporting the Borrower’s economic growth.? The revised PDO excluded the
objectives that were not supported by the project (for example, increasing the number of
producer organizations) and dropped the unrealistic target of increasing the share of processed
products in agricultural output. The latter would not have been possible due to the small size of
the project relative to total agricultural output in the country.

6.      The key outcome indicators were revised as follows:
      Increase the sales of agribusinesses supported by the project (in percentages)

      Increase the profits of agribusinesses supported by the project (in percentages).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

7.      The main beneficiaries were agro-food processors, who received consultancy
services provided by technical, marketing, and financial management specialists. This group
also gained access to the credit line under the project. Adding the grant component allowed
producer organizations and cooperatives to receive matching grants in addition to loans. An
extensive capacity-building program was also offered to producer cooperatives. Producers
benefited from the value chain development pilot. The participating financial institutions
received training to strengthen their capacity to provide investment lending in agriculture and to
offer new financial products tailored to the agriculture sector. Eventually, food industry staff and
students will benefit from the Food Technology Training Center (FTTC) set up under the project.
Finally, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources, and Processing Industry (MAWRPI)
benefited from the analytical products offered by the Market Conditions Analysis Unit (MCAU),
which was housed in the ministry and helped it to stay abreast of the latest developments in the
foods market. Indirect beneficiaries were agricultural producers supplying agro-food processors
involved in the project.

1.5 Original Components

8.     Component 1: Market Development Component (US$6.74 million) was intended to
address constraints in commodity supply chains through interventions in both the private
and public sectors. Through its four subcomponents, Component 1 sought to build the business
capacity of participants in agricultural marketing chains and provide them with the foundation to
work together more effectively.

        (i)     The supply chain management subcomponent sought to build the capacity of
                private sector participants in the marketing of Kyrgyz agri-food products.
                The project established an Agribusiness Competitiveness Center (ABCC) to
                provide clients—that is, beneficiaries—with co-paid technical assistance through
                contracting with international business consulting firms and teaming these with
                local consultants. The intention of the center was to build consultancy capacity for
                the agro-processing sector that would be sustained beyond the implementation of
                the Project. The ABCC also collected feedback from the private sector concerning
                limitations on competitiveness and efficiency. A Market Development Service
                (MDS) was established within the ABCC and tasked with identifying obstacles for
                businesses and facilitating market development.
                                                 3
       (ii)    The export promotion subcomponent was intended to support targeted
               interventions through a trade linkage contractor. The contractor was to link
               domestic sellers of Kyrgyz agricultural and food commodities with foreign
               buyers.

       (iii)   The public sector investment subcomponent sought to finance public sector
               investments and public-private partnerships that would address
               infrastructural and technological bottlenecks for supply chain development.
               Any proposal was to be tied to a business need identified in the supply chain
               work.

       (iv)    The public sector capacity-building subcomponent sought to give the
               supervisory board of the ABCC an important role in addressing public
               sector issues constraining the development of the private agro-processing
               sector. These issues included strengthening the public sector’s ability to carry out
               functions appropriate for a market system, building appropriate public-private
               linkages in the agro-food sector of the economy, and identifying regulatory
               constraints to competitiveness of Kyrgyz commodities.

9.      Component 2: Access to Credit Component (US$7.87 million) sought to (a) address
key constraints associated with access to capital by Kyrgyz enterprises in the agri-food
sector and (b) expand lending to the agriculture and food-processing sector by the formal
banking sector through introduction of risk-mitigating tools for commercial banks.
Technical assistance to the commercial banking sector sought to strengthen the capacity of the
participating financial institutions to lend to the agricultural and rural sectors. This training was a
prerequisite for participating in the investment credit facility under the project and focused on
investment lending to agricultural production and processing and structured finance for
agriculture such as contract farming. An Investment Credit Facility sought to provide access to
investment capital for the emerging producer organizations and private businesses involved in
processing and marketing agricultural commodities. International Development Agency (IDA)
funds were on-lent through participating financial institutions, which were selected on the basis
of specific eligibility criteria and were responsible for identifying prospective sub-borrowers.
The Structured Finance Facility was designed to test innovative financing schemes for the
Kyrgyz Republic. It had two main products: (a) transaction finance working capital loans to
agro-processing companies and (b) seasonal working capital loans for contract farming
arrangements. The expectation was that the training and piloting of deals with the participating
financial institutions would catalyze future development of structured finance in the Kyrgyz
Republic.

10.     The Credit Line Management Unit (CLMU), formerly the project management unit
of the Second Rural Finance Project (RFP II), was to be responsible for implementing
Component 2. The CLMU liaised with the commercial banking sector, was responsible for
financial management and disbursement functions for the project, and carried out other day-to-
day administrative tasks.

11.     Component 3: Project Monitoring and Advisory Office (US$0.10 million) was to be
established in the MAWRPI on the basis of the project preparation unit. It consisted of three
staff: a director, a liaison officer, and an assistant, and its functions included (a) acting as the
liaison between the MAWRPI and the MEDT with respect to the project’s activities; (b)
implementing the public sector capacity-building subcomponent on the basis of decisions of the
supervisory board of the ABCC; (c) acting as liaison for the flow of information between the
                                                  4
MAWRPI and the ABCC; and (d) acting as liaison between the MAWRPI and the CLMU in
respect of the project monitoring data reflected in the Financial Monitoring Reports.

1.6 Revised Components

12.     When the PDO was revised, a Farmer Cooperative Matching Grants Program was
added to Component 2. The purpose was to enhance the PDOs by supporting farmer
cooperatives in improving their participation in the sector. Eligible investments were productive
assets such as machinery, processing equipment, and storage facilities. Such investments were
expected to enable more effective participation of farmer cooperatives in value chain
arrangements and to strengthen agricultural supply chains. The matching grants constituted a
maximum of 30 percent per beneficiary (cooperative) of the total funding (subloan plus the
matching grant) extended to it. The matching grants subcomponent was implemented by the
participating financial institutions according to the Farmer Cooperative Matching Grants
Program Agreement and Guidelines and administered by the CLMU under the Ministry of
Finance. In order to enhance the ability of cooperatives to access the funds, the project provided
a complementary capacity-building program for cooperatives. No other revisions were made to
the components.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

13.    An important change under the project was to replace the Project Monitoring and
Advisory Office with the Market Conditions Analysis Unit (MCAU). The changing needs of
the ministry were better served by the terms of reference (TOR) of the MCAU, which were to
gather price information and analyze markets. The information was, to a certain extent, used to
support policy-making decisions in the ministry and the work of the ABCC.

14.     The idea of hiring a trade linkage contractor under Component 1 was eventually
abandoned. The trade linkage contractors were to be hired in nearby large cities in Russia. Their
role was to inform ABCC on gaps in supply on the markets in these cities so that ABCC could
organize suppliers and send trucks with this produce to the markets. However, the activity was
dropped because it was not operational in practice. By the time the trucks reached the cities,
other suppliers had already filled the identified gaps.

15.    The project was extended four times. The original closing date of December 31, 2010,
was extended to December 31, 2011, then to June 30, 2012, to November 30, 2012, and finally to
March 31, 2013. Due to the delays stemming from external circumstances (see Section 2.2 of this
ICR), some of the project activities took longer to implement. The primary reason for the last
two extensions was to complete establishment of the Food Technology Training Center.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

16.     Extensive background analysis ensured soundness of the project design. The
background analysis was extensive and detailed, covering a complex set of issues, including the
macroeconomic context and exchange rate advantages that influenced trade and the availability
of credit in the country. The PAD drew from market analyses carried out by the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) and Swiss Economic and Cooperation Office (SECO) to
identify some of the Kyrgyz Republic’s competitive advantages. The market approach of existing
agribusinesses (which was reactive rather than proactive in developing markets, developing
                                                5
products, and establishing trade linkages) and the many bottlenecks for marketability of Kyrgyz
agro-food products were also discussed. The analysis was partially quantitative and thus gave a
robust economic background to the circumstances in which the project was developed.

17.     Lessons learned from other projects were incorporated, which strengthened the
project design. Previous experience of working with traditional project implementation units in
the Kyrgyz Republic as well as with alternative arrangements under projects in other countries
(for example, the Mozambique Enterprise Development Project and private sector development
projects in Georgia, Moldova, and Slovenia) was drawn on in designing the institutional
structure for project implementation. Thus the technical assistance component of the project was
implemented by an autonomous, legally registered organization (the ABCC), which was to be
spun off into an independent private consulting company at the end of the project. This was an
innovative approach for the country.

18.     A social assessment was conducted to understand the views of private stakeholders,
including producers, processors, marketers, warehousers, and transporters. The main issues
that arose were the lack of trust among market participants and the weak negotiating power of
many producers. The project design addressed these issues through activities aiming to improve
communication among market participants, facilitate contracts, and support the interests of
producer organizations.

19.      The risks assessed and highlighted in the PAD were weak institutional capacity, the
existing business environment, commercial risk, political risk, the risk to the use of public
funds when borrowing for technical assistance, risks when picking winners, and project
complexity. All of these were thoroughly discussed in the project design and especially the
institutional set-up (i.e. the autonomy of ABCC) and some of the activities (such as the screening
process for selecting participating beneficiaries) were means to mitigate these risks.

20.     The project design was coherent and addressed the problems identified. The
project’s objectives directly targeted identified problems in the sector. As discussed in Section
1.1 of this ICR, there was a clear need to increase economic activity in response to market
demand and to develop linkages and functioning supply chains throughout the agro-processing
sector. The components were in line with the objectives of the project. Component 1 directly
supported the PDO through technical assistance, market facilitation, and analytical work.
Component 2 addressed the existing credit constraints in the sector and thus supported agro-
processing investments that would contribute to the objectives. Component 3 liaised between the
project and the MAWRPI, to ensure that they were working toward the same objectives, which
strengthened government ownership of the project. Due to the high concentration of agribusiness
in the south of the country, the original design foresaw a regional ABCC office there, but left the
geographic coverage to be determined by beneficiary demand.

21.    Project implementation arrangements ensured professional independence and a
focus on successful implementation. At first glance, the project design and its implementation
arrangements (two implementing units and a unit to maintain linkages with the MAWRPI) were
highly complex. The ABCC was set up as an autonomous, legally registered organization with a
supervisory board, led by the Ministry of Economic Development, Industry, and Trade (MEDT)
and consisting of representatives of both the public and private sectors. The access to credit
component was implemented by the CLMU under the Ministry of Finance. The MCAU, which
was set up in the MAWRPI, ensured the linkages between the project and the ministry. At the
same time, all implementing units provided regular progress updates to all three ministries.


                                                6
22.     This approach had three elements. First, it addressed the existing issues of the
agribusiness sector in a comprehensive way. The subject of agribusiness spanned the mandates
of more than one ministry. It was deemed at the time of appraisal that agribusiness development
was closer to the MEDT than the MAWRPI. However, the latter also had a stake in the project
(especially because the responsibility for agro-processing development was periodically shifted
between the two ministries). Second, it used the existing implementation capacities, as the
CLMU already had prior successful experience in implementing credit lines under Bank-
financed projects. Finally, it mitigated the risks that might have followed from having a single
project implementation unit. For successful implementation of the market development
component, it was imperative to have intensive interaction with private businesses that often shy
away from close contacts with government entities for fear of interference. Therefore, the ABCC
was positioned as a nongovernmental entity providing a voice for the private agribusiness sector
at the government level. This proved to be the right approach. Also, placing the CLMU under the
line ministry was a risk because the ministry might have exerted pressure and possibly
intervened in the lending process. Therefore, it was placed under the Ministry of Finance based
on the positive experience of past projects.

23.    The project had full government support. The government was fully committed to the
concept and design of the project. Revitalizing the agro-processing industry, increasing the share
of processed products, achieving growth in value added, and contributing to economic growth
were in line with the government’s priorities in this area. The team preparing the project had
observed an interest in and support for the project, which was continued under the subsequent
government. Establishment of the ABCC by a government resolution and the provision of
adequate office space for it are evidence to support this view.

24.     The original PDO was overly ambitious, which required a project restructuring. The
original PDO was too complex and broad. The PDO-level indicators included the “increased
share of agricultural production being processed.? The ICR mission was not sure whether this
indicator referred to the entire sector or to the beneficiary companies. It would have been very
difficult to demonstrate the project’s impact upon sectorwide performance, given the small size
of the project compared to the agribusiness sector; for this reason, the ICR focuses on the
project’s effects on beneficiary companies. However, more clarity on this issue in the PAD
would have been useful.

2.2 Implementation

25.   The project was approved in December 2004 and became effective in May 2005.
Throughout implementation, several major events occurred domestically and globally,
which had important impacts on project implementation and results:

          (i)      The March 2005 (Tulip) Revolution disrupted overall economic activities and
                   on the Government’s decision making process for 6 months. In March 2005,
                   shortly after the project was approved by the board and before it became effective,
                   the Tulip Revolution broke out, and the government of Askar Akayev, which had
                   been in place since independence in 1991, was replaced. This had an impact on all
                   activities in the country, and the economy shrank 0.18 percent compared with
                   growth of more than 7 percent in 2004.2 This delayed project implementation
                   from the start: the full launch of the project, planned for spring 2005, was delayed
                   until the fall. Perhaps even more important, this uncertain work environment, both

                  for the private sector and for the project, lasted much longer than expected.
                  Decisions were stalled or slow, and the start-up phase of the project (which
                  included establishing the ABCC offices in Bishkek and Osh, developing core
                  business activities, and developing partnerships with participating financial
                  institutions for the credit line component) took longer than originally foreseen.

         (ii)     The Global Food Price Crisis (2007–08) led to increased focus of the project
                  on producer organizations and eventually to a restructuring of the Project.
                  The Kyrgyz Republic was seriously affected by the global food price crisis of
                  2007–08.3 This shifted the focus of the government from increasing value added
                  and generating employment in the agro-food sector to ensuring food security. This
                  shift also had significant consequences for the project, as food security issues
                  directly affect the agribusiness sector. While continuing with the project activities,
                  the project also supported the government’s food security agenda: (a) the Farmer
                  Cooperative Matching Grant Program was used to support improvements in
                  agricultural productivity. Cooperatives were the intended beneficiaries of the
                  project, and this program was fully in line with the government’s National
                  Cooperatives Development Program; (b) a Food Security Unit in the MEDT was
                  financed, given responsibility for analyzing commodity price movements for
                  policy making, and in place for about a year (August 2008–August 2009); and (c)
                  the MCAU was assigned to monitor food security indicators, which were
                  developed by the ABCC and approved by the government.

         (iii)    Global Financial Crisis of 2008–09 increased overall risk aversion among
                  both creditors and borrowers and resulted in implementation delays for the
                  Project. The credit line disbursed well during the first years of project
                  implementation, but the financial crisis significantly slowed disbursement.
                  Because of the drop in demand and uncertainties in output markets, producers
                  were unwilling to borrow for investment and production. Similar to central banks
                  in many other countries, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic imposed more
                  stringent reserve requirements, which had a direct impact on the profits of banks
                  and increased their risk aversion. In this context, lending to agriculture was again
                  considered too risky. Further, partially as a result of the financial crisis, the BTA
                  Bank terminated its participation under the project. Since BTA Bank managed the
                  largest share of the credit line,4 this meant that almost half of the credit line was
                  returned to the Ministry of Finance instead of being revolved back into new loans
                  to the agribusiness sector, as originally designed. Nevertheless, the credit line at
                  the end of the project was fully disbursed to 81 borrowers (including 11
                  cooperatives). Another 27 sub-loans were financed from reflows.

         (iv)     The 2010 political turmoil caused a temporary stall in the economy as well as
                  in Government decision-making which caused further implementation delays
                  for the Project. Political turmoil in April 2010 resulted in another change in

  Based on data from various donors, average food inflation, which peaked at 48.2 percent (annual) in June 2008,
was the highest in Europe and Central Asia, with bakery and cereal products experiencing a 109 percent price
increase in the same period. In the first quarter of 2008, 20 percent of households or approximately 1 million people
were severely food insecure, and food expenditure reached 74 percent of total consumption expenditure in early
2008 among severely food-insecure households.
4
  Nevertheless, the BTA Bank’s contribution to project implementation was significant. It issued 42 subloans (39
percent of the total number of subloans under the project), including 30 from the direct credit line and 12 from
reflows.

                   regime followed by ethnic clashes in southern Kyrgyz Republic in June 2010.
                   This, once again, interrupted project implementation. Overall, the economy
                   shrank again (−0.47 percent compared with 2009),5 and the assets of parts of the
                   business community in the south (Osh and Jalal-Abad) were destroyed in the
                   conflict. The events were followed by a period of economic and political
                   uncertainty. Several project beneficiaries, especially in the south, terminated their
                   participation in the project (some had lost their property in the clashes). The
                   financial sector was reluctant to lend and invest, and processors were reluctant to
                   produce due to uncertainties in output markets. The decision-making process in
                   public agencies stalled, which slowed down decisions in the project.

26.       In addition, several factors internal to the project affected implementation.

          (i)      The public investment funding, use of which had not been precisely defined
                   at appraisal, led to several extensions of the closing date. The project allocated
                   US$1 million for investment in infrastructure with a significant public benefit,
                   which would remove a major bottleneck for agribusiness sector development. The
                   main challenge was to identify financially viable public-private partnership
                   investments or public goods investments. To advance this activity, the project
                   engaged external experts, but several proposals proved not to be feasible. Finally,
                   in 2009, the borrower submitted a proposal to set up of a Food Technology
                   Training Center under the Kyrgyz State Technical University (KSTU). This
                   investment was expected to increase the availability of qualified food
                   technologists for the food-processing sector, which struggled with inadequate
                   skills. The scarcity of qualified food technologists was raised repeatedly during
                   implementation of the technical assistance packages.

          (ii)     Engaging international technical assistance in setting up the ABCC allowed
                   the project to recover some of the lost start-up time. This became particularly
                   important given the project start-up delays due to the political situation. With the
                   help of a resident international consultant and CERMA (a Georgian private sector
                   support organization that contributed to the ABCC’s design), the ABCC initiated
                   its business activities within the first year.

          (iii)    The decision to “pick the winners? in selecting the companies for technical
                   assistance allowed the project to achieve impressive results on the ground.
                   The companies that received technical assistance under the project were selected
                   through a three-stage process. After an expression of interest, the companies
                   underwent a rapid process to assess the capability of the company to benefit from
                   the project. Key factors such as the commitment of management, ability to raise
                   funding, effective decision-making processes and others separated the winners
                   from the losers in the client selection process.

          (iv)     The setting up of the Central Agency for Development, Investments and
                   Innovation (CADII) added an extra layer to the approval process and
                   essentially shifted decision-making away from Ministries in 2009-2010.
                   Importantly, this had implications for the restructuring in that while approved by

               2010.

27.   Despite these challenges, the majority of activities progressed surprisingly well, and
were implemented as planned and beyond within the adjusted implementation period. For
more details on outcomes and results, see section 3.2 of this ICR.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

28.     As noted in section 1.3, the original PDO was broad and difficult to quantify, and
the results indicators did not fully capture the different areas of the PDO; however,
restructuring the PDO strengthened the objectives and the results framework. For example,
the results indicators under the original PDO covered impacts among producers and processors
but failed to capture other activities along the supply chain and the functioning of markets, areas
that were included in the PDO. In addition, the indicators in the monitoring framework did not
fully mirror the results framework. The results framework had, for example, indicators on (a)
repayment rates to participating financial institutions (PDO indicator) and (b) number of public
service staff trained (Component 3 indicator), neither of which was included in the monitoring
framework. Also, while the credit line and the support to the financial sector under Component 2
very much supported the PDO, the results framework focused mainly on the quantity of lending
and on repayment, rather than on the impact of increased lending to the agro-food processing
sector. Hence, there was a disconnect between the indicators relating to Component 2 and the
PDO. When the PDO was revised, most of the original indicators were replaced, and the results
framework was significantly strengthened as a result. The PDO indicators were decreased to two
that directly measured the project’s contribution to the PDO (increase in sales and profit of
agribusiness supported under the project); in addition, 10 indicators of intermediate results
measured the output of activities that supported the PDO indicators.

29.     For the most part, information was collected according to the monitoring
framework and recorded in the Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs). Several
surveys were also conducted, asking respondents to rate the level of accuracy of the survey
results in order to determine their robustness. The evaluation of the market linkage activity was
based on the amounts stated in the contracts between suppliers and traders, thus giving precise
amounts of impact. An important exception is that the absolute changes in sales and profits
among the beneficiaries, especially under the credit line was not monitored properly and both
baseline data and end of project results had to be collected at the time of the writing of the ICR.
Another flaw is that the reporting of results only included the impacts of the technical assistance
work of the ABCC, not the impacts on agribusinesses supported under other activities, including
the credit line. Thus the reporting did not capture all outcomes of the project that contributed to
the PDO. The results framework was not part of the client’s regular program and will not be used
after the project closes.

30.     In order to strengthen the monitoring of individual activities, the World Bank
requested additional M&E indicators outside those defined in the PAD and recommended
that the ABCC hire a consultant for this purpose. Thus the Market Development Service set
up its own framework for monitoring the impacts of the activities under the subcomponents and
making better use of the information in other project activities. A similar request was made to the
CLMU due to the volatility of the financial markets, and the CLMU therefore collected monthly
information from the participating financial institutions on their balance sheets, income
statements, loan portfolio breakdown, nonperforming loans, and liquidity ratio. Finally, the
World Bank requested a final impact survey to support the information for the ICR.

                                                10
2.4 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

(a)    Safeguards

31.     The project, which included small subprojects with no significant adverse
environmental impacts expected, was classified as Environmental Category B with the
Environmental Assessment Policy (OP/BP/GP 4.01) triggered. An Environmental
Assessment (EA) for the project was prepared, translated into Russian, and disclosed in the
Kyrgyz Republic, with feedback incorporated. The EA noted possible environmental impacts
through the financing of agro-processing industries, but the overall effect of the subprojects was
considered positive. Since the purchase of pesticides was not intended under this project, it was
considered that no significant pest management issues had to be raised, although the use of
pesticides by the sub-borrowers could not be precluded. It was also presumed that some of the
industries under the former socialist regime, which created significant environmental problems,
would be refurbished to operate more efficiently and without the major environmental
contamination of the past.

32.     Because no public land transactions took place under the project and because no
land would be expropriated for the investments under the credit scheme, no social
safeguard policy was triggered under the Project. Anticipated environmental issues under the
project were related to private investments under the credit line and investments in the
rehabilitation of public infrastructure. For private investments, the subproject beneficiaries were
responsible for mitigating any environmental effects; however, the Ministry of Ecology and
Emergency Situations (MEES) together with the CLMU, were to ensure that these mitigation
measures were implemented properly. The PAD also prescribed an assigned staff member or
consultant with an environmental background in the CLMU to ensure that the participating
financial institutions complied with environmental safeguards requirements. Finally, an
important activity under the credit line component was to train participating financial institutions
to screen the environmental compliance of subprojects. An EA for the project was disclosed in
the Kyrgyz Republic, and feedback was incorporated. The restructuring of the project did not
change the environmental category of the project or trigger any additional safeguards policies.

33.     Throughout implementation, safeguards were complied with and environmental
impacts were mitigated. The environmental training of the participating financial
institutions was initiated at an early stage of the project (December 2006) and included 11
loan officers in the first round. An environmental training manual was eventually developed,
and, as of end-2011, 166 staff from the participating financial institutions were trained. An
environmental specialist was contracted by the CLMU to support the institutions in their
screening of subprojects. Although no social safeguard was triggered, a social safeguards
specialist joined the World Bank team for the midterm review. He confirmed that no negative
social impacts were of concern under the project. At the time of the midterm review, the two
safeguards specialists submitted recommendations to the CLMU for how to monitor safeguards
compliance under the credit line. By the following mission in September–October 2011, these
recommendations had been implemented. There were no significant deviations or waivers of
safeguards under the project, and overall safeguards compliance was rated as satisfactory in the
ISRs throughout the project.



(b)                                         Procurement


                                                11
34.     A country procurement assessment carried out in 2002 concluded that the Kyrgyz
Republic was a high-risk country with regard to public procurement and that the general
institutional environment was not yet conducive to transparent, economic, and efficient
procurement. Procurement for the project was therefore assigned to the ABCC, and a full-time
procurement officer was hired for this task. TOR and technical specifications were developed by
the ABCC, the CLMU, participating financial institutions, and the government. The consultants
hired for the initial capacity strengthening and training of the ABCC took an active part in
drafting the TOR for the early round of procurement of technical assistance packages.

35.     The General Procurement Notice for the project was published in December 2004.
The procurement plan was updated once a year, and the approved procurement plans were
published on Bank external website. According to the Bank requirements, the contracts that were
not subject to prior Bank review were subject to ex post review on a sample basis. Four
procurement ex post reviews were conducted for the project, and the recommendations provided
by the Bank were partially implemented by the following ex post review mission. The project
was included in the Kyrgyz Republic Country Portfolio Fiduciary Review, and as part of this
exercise, the goods delivered and works constructed were inspected by qualified engineers
during the period from the end of September to early October 2008.

(c)    Financial Management

36.     Since the CLMU was built on the project management unit of the World Bank–
financed Second Rural Finance Project (RFPII), a financial management capacity
assessment confirmed that the CLMU had adequate capacity to manage disbursements,
operate special accounts, and prepare Financial Monitoring Reports for parts of the
project financed by both the IDA and the World Bank (Policy and Human Resources
Development, PHRD). A financial management manual developed by the board guided the
financial management processes under the project. Because of its status as an independently
operated government-owned legal entity, the ABCC needed to have its own financial
management system in place.

37.     The financial management arrangements at the CLMU, including accounting,
reporting, budgeting, and staff, were adequate and acceptable to the Bank throughout
project implementation. The financial management manual was in place, and the CLMU’s
system of internal controls was considered capable of providing timely information and reporting
on the projects. Regular audits were made by the participating financial institutions to ensure
compliance with World Bank requirements, and from 2009 onward the CLMU collected monthly
financial data from the participating financial institutions to monitor their stability (see section
2.3 of this ICR). The only issue that arose during project implementation was that submission of
the audit report was delayed for FY2011. This delay applied to all World Bank projects that year
because the Bank disqualified two local auditing companies and changed the accepted methods
for selecting audit companies. These changes resulted in a prolonged procurement process for
audit services that year.

2.5 Postcompletion Operation/Next Phase

38.     There is no dedicated World Bank–financed operation building on the project at
this point. However, some issues are still unresolved in the agriculture processing sector, value
chain development, and marketing of agriculture products, as a project of this size could not
resolve all of the problems, despite making a positive contribution. Therefore, the new CPS will
include a joint IDA-IFC study on agribusiness sector, to review the results achieved in the sector
to date, and identify the remaining gaps and proposed actions to address them. The commercial
                                                12
arm of the ABCC (that is, the MDS) ceased to exist in the form it had under the project, which
meant letting go many of its staff (the remaining part now functions as a project implementation
unit for another World Bank project).6 The technical skills of the local consultants working under
the project will remain in the country, as some of the consultants continue as independent
consultants or full-time employees with some of the processing companies involved under the
project. Further, since the launching of the Project, the agro-business consulting sector has
emerged and comprises today numerous consultancy companies. However, the size of ABCC
together with the substantial TA provided under the Project resulted in ABCC dominating the
market and other consultancy firms in the country expressed fear about being outcompeted by
the ABCC for various contracts. Thus, dissolving the MDS created a more level playing field for
the private sector, and the fact that the ABCC did not remain in the form it had under the project
should not be seen as negative.

39.     The participating financial institutions reported that the overall experience of
working with agro-food processors was positive and that the training provided new insight
into how to evaluate agro-processing investment proposals more completely. Discussions
with the participating financial institutions also revealed a general interest in continuing to lend
to agro-food processors.

40.     The main public investment under the project was the FTTC, created under the
auspices of the KSTU. The training will be demand driven and funded in part by the private
sector through fees. Other expected sources of funding for the center are KSTU and other
donors, such as GIZ7 and the European Union TEMPUS program. The training programs
provided by the FTTC are expected to improve the capacity and knowledge of the country’s food
technologists and, through this, to enable the agribusiness sector to meet the increasing consumer
demand for high-quality and safe food products. The FTTC is considered to be very important
for upgrading the food-processing sector in the country. Moreover, interest in cooperating with
the FTTC has been expressed by the Tomsk University of Russia and food technologists from
Tajikistan.

41.   The MCAU was dissolved as of June 30, 2012. It was not intended to become part of
the MAWRPI’s regular program.
3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

42.      The development objectives, design, and implementation remained highly relevant
at the time of project closing. According to the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) FY2012–13,8
Kyrgyz economic policies were guided by reliance on the private sector for growth in a liberal
trade environment. Based on the government’s priorities, the ISN FY2012–13 identified
economic stabilization for economic recovery, reconstruction, and growth as one of its three
pillars and agriculture sector development as a key activity in support of these pillars. After the
political turmoil in 2010, the newly elected coalition government developed a Plan of Action for
2011 that included financial and private sector development and food security, among other
priorities. Specific for the food sector was a commitment to address constraints on the

  After the political turmoil of 2010, the Bank worked in the Kyrgyz Republic based on an Interim Strategy Note for
FY2012–13.

                                                        13
importation of food, domestic production, and competition in the food sector. The National
Development Strategy for 2013–17 continues to support these objectives.

43.     The full Country Partnership Strategy for FY2014–17 is currently under
preparation and has established the state’s relationship with the private sector as one of the
pillars for the World Bank’s engagement in the future. It acknowledges that the Kyrgyz
economy is constrained by a narrow base of production and excessive reliance on mining.
Agriculture has excellent prospects, although better policies are needed to strengthen
competitiveness. Encouraging greater private sector participation is needed—for example,
strengthening farmers’ organizations and developing small and medium-size agricultural
enterprises.

44.     The project objectives, design, and results framework (both original and revised)
continue to be in line with the strategic areas mentioned in the above-referenced
documents. Implementation of the project further supported these objectives. (For more details,
see sections 2.2, 2.3, and 3.2 in this ICR.)

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

45.     The original and revised PDOs should weigh fairly equally when evaluating the
project results (see sections 1.2 and 1.3 for more details on key indicators). The PDO was
formally revised in 2009 (see section 1.3 in this ICR), and at that point, 47.2 percent of total
project funds had been disbursed.9 Although key indicators were revised at the same time as the
PDOs, the PDOs are overlapping, and two intermediate outcome indicators were converted into
key indicators; results therefore apply to both PDOs. In assessing the achievement of the PDOs,
the underlying assumption is that the intended objectives were meant to be achieved at the level
of project beneficiaries, not the entire sector.

46.     The original PDO was as follows: “to expand the level of activity of processing,
marketing, and trade enterprises downstream of the farmgate, to increase the number and
economic importance of producer organizations, and to improve the functioning of markets and
trade linkages between producers and primary- and secondary-level trade organizations.?

47.     The objective to “expand the level of activity of processing, marketing, and trade
enterprises downstream of the farmgate? was achieved under the project. The achievement
of this part of the original PDO was originally measured by an outcome indicator: increase in
share of agricultural production being processed from the base level of 12 percent to the target
of 17 percent. However, this indicator was found to be inappropriate because it went beyond the
scope, scale, and capacity of the project. A project of this size could not have changed the share
of the entire agro-processing industry so dramatically. Clearly, the indicator was faulty and
therefore was dropped. It is not considered for the assessment.

48.     Instead, in line with the intent stated in paragraph 48, it is assumed that this
statement applies to the companies benefiting from the project activities. Since the increases
in production were not measured in the project beneficiary companies, the increase in sales
indicator is used as a proxy to measure achievement of this objective. An inflation-adjusted
increase in sales of 114 percent in the companies assisted assumes that both the level of activity
and the level of production of companies increased, contributing to the increased share of

 The disbursements, based on the source, were as follows: IDA, 55 percent; PHRD, 49 percent; Government of the

processing at the national level. The results are described in detail in paragraphs 60–66.
Moreover, the increased level of activity also resulted (a) from the credit line component, which
provided 109 subloans to agribusiness companies, and (b) through the Market Development
Service, the commercial arm of the ABCC under the project. The service coverage was much
larger than the 42 beneficiaries of the technical assistance or the 109 beneficiaries of the credit
line. During the project period, the MDS assisted almost 2,000 clients with identifying sales
opportunities, business linkages, suppliers, and suitable equipment. These are not included in the
figures reflecting increased sales and profits but would still have contributed to the expansion in
the level of activities in the sector.

49.     The objective to “increase the number and economic importance of producer
organizations? was achieved under the project. For the purposes of the ICR, this was
measured through the increase in value of sales of producer organizations. This indicator was
not part of the formal monitoring framework and was not included under the revised PDO.
Nevertheless, the project’s activities with regard to strengthening cooperatives did ultimately
contribute positively to this part of the original PDO, even though many activities were
implemented mainly after the PDO was restructured. The investments made by cooperatives
using the credit line and support from matching grants, the training received by cooperatives
(overall, 259 cooperatives received training under the project), and the value chain pilot activities
all strengthened the economic importance of producer organizations. The results are detailed in
paragraphs 56, 65, and 67 of this section.

50.     The objective to “improve the functioning of markets and trade linkages between
producers and primary- and secondary-level trade organizations? was achieved under the
project. Although no key indicator specifically measured this objective, the project significantly
improved the functioning of markets for the individual processors and producers who
participated directly in project activities. The Market Development Service made key
contributions to establishing trade linkages. The MDS facilitated the trading and promotion of
Kyrgyz agricultural products both domestically and abroad, which led to an exponential increase
in the number, volume, and amount of contracts on the domestic and export markets. From 2006
to 2012, the MDS facilitated 142 contracts ensuring sales and marketing of client products, with
a total volume of 55,000 tons of produce valued at US$17.5 million, of which 89 percent was
exported to markets such as Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Moldova, the Russian Federation, and
Turkey. This can be compared with the 12 contracts valued at US$101,000 that were in place in
2006.10

51.     The MDS also provided consulting and informational support to more than 1,971
clients (agribusinesses and private entrepreneurs) on a wide range of subjects, including
marketing and promotion of products, legal issues, sourcing of raw materials, and
procurement of productive assets. The MDS provided assistance to domestic farmers and
cooperatives in establishing trade relations on the supply of agricultural products to several
countries, including Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and others. The
main types of products include potato, bulb onion, carrot, cabbage, bean, pepper, tomato,
cucumber, sweet cherry, apricot, peach, and Uzgen rice.

52.    Further, the value chain concept piloted under the project supported the linkages to
markets. The project supported access to markets for two commodities (beans and potatoes); the
value chain support pilot linked 130 organized producers in the Naryn, Issyk-Kul, and Talas
oblasts to new export markets. Linkages with the foreign markets resulted in bean exports

                                                 15
according to the following: 124 tons to Bulgaria, 198 tons to Russia, 20 tons to Romania, 110
tons to Moldova, and 60 tons to Kazakhstan. The value chain activity for potatoes was only in
place during the last year of project implementation, and only one contract was signed for the
export of potatoes to Kazakhstan. Nevertheless, this contract gave farmers a price of KGS 6.5 per
kilogram compared with KGS 4.5 per kilogram on the local market.

53.     The Information and Marketing Service (IMS), another activity under the project,
also supported the creation of market linkages. With IMS assistance, the ABCC clients could
submit enquiries and obtain information on producers of goods and services by region and
subsector of the economy, obtain live data on retail and wholesale prices for agricultural
products in the regions, find information on available proposals and requests in the market, and
use the database and analytical materials and news. The IMS created and regularly updated a
database that includes information on agricultural producers and farmer cooperatives,
agribusiness companies, processing companies, analytical information, suppliers of agricultural
and food equipment, financial and credit institutions, consulting companies, and international
donor organizations, among others. Since the ABCC website (www.agromarket.kg) was
launched in 2009 to the end of the project, 50,527 visitors and 36,725 unique visitors were
registered, and 97,766 pages were reviewed.

54.     The two remaining PDO-level indicators—“minimum repayment rate to
participating financial institutions of 95 percent? and “increased institutional lending to
agro-industry clients?—were fully achieved. There were no problem loans under the project,
and timely repayment stood at almost 100 percent. The second indicator was also fully achieved.
Financial sector lending to agriculture increased multiple times instead of the required 15%. The
agricultural portfolio of commercial banks was KGS 105.6 million at the end of 2004 and KGS
6,040 million at the end of 2012. Primary processing was KGS 72.2 million at the end of 2004
and KGS 88.1 million at the end of 2012, which is a 22 percent increase.11 As for the
participating PFIs, their combined portfolio from 2005 to 2011 from 1,656 million KGS in 2005
to 4,076 million KGS in 2011, or with 25.1% in real prices12.

55.     The revised PDO “to assist the Borrower in increasing and enhancing the business
activities of the Beneficiary agribusinesses supporting the Borrower’s economic growth?
was achieved under the project. This was measured through:
     Increase in sales of agribusinesses supported by the project (in percentages)

       Increase in profits of agribusinesses supported by the project (in percentages).

56.     The project successfully supported Kyrgyz agro-processing companies in efforts to
enhance their business activities and increase their profits and sales. A total of 42 companies
received co-financed consultancy services and 108 companies received credit under the Project.
Based on a sample of 86 companies (i.e. 57% of total participating companies), these activities
resulted in profits increasing by 107 percent (adjusted for inflation) and sales increasing by
114 percent (adjusted for inflation) in different years in different enterprises according to when
the TA and investment activities took place.13 The results per activity can be broken down as
follows:

57.    Expertise in food production technology obtained under the project helped
companies to improve their operational efficiency, expand their production lines, enhance
the quality of their products, and develop new products and markets:

       (i)     Organized visits to agricultural fairs abroad (in China, Germany,
               Kazakhstan, and Turkey) allowed processors to acquire modern equipment
               at prices that were significantly lower than would otherwise have been
               possible. For example, one company saved more than US$200,000 when
               purchasing new equipment. After modernization of their equipment, five client
               enterprises reportedly improved the quality of their products and the
               competitiveness of their products on the market.
       (ii)    Project activities improved operational efficiency and brought cost savings to
               client enterprises. For instance, with the project’s help, one company bought new
               equipment that reduced the time to produce tomato sauce by 33 percent. This
               investment is saving the company about US$5,000 equivalent annually in
               electricity costs.
       (iii)   New equipment and improved practices among the processors as a result of
               the technical assistance also had an impact on the quality and safety of
               products, resulting in more competitive products and enhanced access to
               markets. For example, laboratory equipment that analyzed the quality of milk for
               a short period of time (10 parameters for 2 minutes) was purchased for two dairies
               and resulted in an increase in the fat content of purchased milk from 3.2 percent to
               3.6–3.8 percent. With project support, a water-bottling company was HACCP
               (hazard analysis and critical control points) certified and obtained an FSSC 22000
               certificate, becoming the first company in Central Asia to receive this
               certification, thus strengthening its competitiveness and ability to access new
               markets.
       (iv)    Improving the quality of products improved sales. Activities focusing on
               decreasing the return of products from retailers due to production defects resulted
               in a 10 percent reduction in volume of returns and 10–15 percent in the number of
               defective products.
       (v)     With the support of technical assistance under the project, 67 new types of
               products were introduced in client enterprises. For example, with support from
               the ABCC, one company that used to produce only honey and bee products
               started producing apricot and plum marshmallow sticks as well as apple juice of
               direct extraction with support from the ABCC.

58.     Marketing consultants helped companies to rebrand their products and find new
markets, both domestically and abroad. Labels were redesigned for more than 30 types of
products, increasing the recognizability of company products and therefore sales. Support was
provided to introduce products in supermarkets of Bishkek City, which led to increased sales and
profits for the companies involved. Also in Bishkek City, the project helped a company to set up
a marketing department and to train staff in marketing, which extended the company’s regular
market territory and increased sales. Five companies found new markets for their products in 18
cities or markets. Client enterprises were assisted to increase the sales of their products to export
                                                 17
markets (Kazakhstan, Russia) for a total amount of KGS 15 million, of which about half were
from new products introduced with the support of ABCC consultants.

59.     Financial management support improved the financial basis for management
decision making, which had an impact on profits. The technical assistance activity also helped
to introduce the “1-C Accounting? automated accounting system in several companies. This
allowed management of the enterprises to obtain easy access to financial information and
improved their ability to make timely managerial decisions. It also helped them to save time in
preparing reports and to reduce operational expenses.

60.     The ABCC also helped beneficiaries to develop business plans, which had significant
results for their operations. Business plans to attract investments in the total amount of
US$4.9 million were developed for two enterprises; the business plan for one company resulted
in a contract, signed with a German buyer, to produce natural fruit juice for €200,000. The
business plan for another company was developed for an investment in equipment to produce
natural apple juice in five-liter packages; 35,000 liters of apple juice have been produced and
sold since November 2011.

61.     The investments made under the credit line further contributed to enhanced sales
and profits. In all, 82 borrowers received sub-loans under the credit line in the total amount of
US$5.1 million, and an additional 27 sub-loans in the total amount of US$1.73 million were
financed by the participating financial institutions from reflows. Total investments generated
through the credit line amounted to about US$16.6 million. In addition, 58 matching grants for a
total of US$800,060 were provided to cooperatives to co-finance investments in agricultural
machinery and other productive assets. This allowed agro-food processors to make investments
that increased their productivity and modernized their processes. For example, two cooperatives
acquired a modern harvester ("Dominator 130"), which allowed them to reduce harvest losses by
10 percent. A significant reduction in harvesting time allowed cooperatives to provide harvesting
services to local farmers. The project also financed the start-up of a dairy company. Credit was
provided for the construction of a small dairy plant, which allowed the purchase of modern
equipment and, over time, expansion of the product line. Current capacity of the plant is 10,000
liters of milk per day, and sales are three times higher than last year. This dairy now sells its
products not only domestically, but also in Kazakhstan.

62.     Information from the Kyrgyz Investment and Credit Bank on sales among the
borrowers indicates a general increase in sales in the time period following the investments.
In the impact survey at the end of the project, 32 percent of the respondents saw an increase in
their production output, 41 percent saw an increase in profit, 37 percent saw an increase in total
sales, and 47 percent saw an increase in market share compared to before the investments14.

63.     The training of loan officers in participating financial institutions (altogether 869
training spots under three different themes) broadened the base of eligible borrowers and
thereby increased their ability to invest in their businesses. Similarly, the training of
cooperatives (with 192 cooperatives participating) strengthened their management skills and
allowed them to apply for financing under the project. According to the cooperatives with which
the ICR mission met, this resulted in a more business-oriented approach to their activities and
strengthened their confidence in initiating new, entrepreneurial activities.



14
     The exact timeframe was not given in the survey.

                                                        18
64.    In addition, the results for achievement of the first PDO (improvement in market
linkage activities), described in paragraphs 54–57 of this section, contributed toward
achievement of the revised PDO.

65.     Summarizing the assessment, the achievement of the project development objectives
before the PDO revision is rated as “satisfactory? (score of 5) with a weight of 0.47 and
after the PDO revision is rated as “satisfactory? (score of 5) with a weight of 0.53.15

3.3 Efficiency

66.     The economic internal rate of return (ERR) to the project is estimated to be 221 percent
and the net present value (NPV) US$ 12,738,571. The financial analysis shows an internal rate of
return of 203 percent with a NPV of US$ 18,952,112. The rates of returns and NPVs were based
on the change in profits over one year generated from (a) the TA packages under Component 1
and (b) the investments made with support from the Credit Line under Component 2, and (c) the
value of the contracts facilitated by the Contract Facilitation under Component 1. For the TA
packages, profit data was available from about ¼ of the beneficiaries; for the Credit Line,
information was available from 70 percent of the total beneficiaries. No assumptions on changes
in profits have been made for the remaining beneficiaries. For the Credit Line, the investment is
assumed to continue to generate certain profit (10% of the original increase in profit) over six
additional years after the original increase was registered16. Other benefits of the Project stem
from the public sector work of the Project (infrastructure and capacity enhancement), the
introduction of regulatory and policy changes, work by the MDS, and the capacity building of
participating financial institutions. However, these have not been possible to quantify within the
scope of the ICR. The project is assumed to have generated positive environmental and social
externalities, but these have not been estimated the quantitative analysis. The PAD did not
calculate an ERR or NPV, so the above figures cannot be compared with the expected returns to
the Project.

3. Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

67.     Given the relevance of the project and the results that the project achieved, the overall
project rating is considered satisfactory. With very few exceptions, set targets were achieved or
overachieved and the activities and investments under the Project are expected to continue to
generate positive results for the beneficiaries under the Project. Also, despite only partial data on
monetary benefits from the Project and despite negative external events (discussed in section
2.2), the Project shows high EIRR and NPV.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

68.     The project facilitated and strengthened collaboration within the agribusiness
sector. An important finding of the social assessment done during project preparation was the
lack of trust between participants in the sector. The project worked to address this by facilitating

15
  5*0.47 + 5*0.53 = 5 (that is, 5 = satisfactory).
16
  The investments are, thus, assumed to generate benefits over a total of seven years, which is the average
amortization rate.



                                                         19
contractual agreements (for example, it helped agribusinesses to sign and deliver on supply
contracts as well as to develop relationships between agro-processors and farmers to support the
building of value chains), but also by strengthening the role of cooperatives in the Kyrgyz
Republic. The final survey under the project found that the training of cooperatives was
important for the latter; the number of members increased for 30 percent of the cooperatives that
participated in the training, and more than 50 percent of the cooperatives had been approached
by potential new members.

69.    The technical assistance provided to beneficiaries (agribusinesses) trickled, in some
cases, down to farmers. From meetings during the ICR mission, it was clear that some of the
beneficiaries under the technical assistance packages worked closely with their suppliers
(farmers) to improve the quality of their products, implying capacity building and improved
market orientation among farmers. However, not all processors who participated in the project
went to such lengths; some adopted a more traditional approach, simply looking for a new
supplier in case of deficiencies in input quality instead of helping current suppliers to improve
the quality of the raw materials.

70.     Although targeting women was not a formal objective, the project benefited many
women. Under the value chain development activity, many of the farmers with whom the
extension agents worked were women. However, because it was not part of the project’s
objective, there was no formal monitoring of gender aspects under the project.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

71.     The ABCC organized a range of policy seminars and roundtables for public officials
on issues that constituted obstacles to the agribusiness policy environment. For example,
given the government’s concern with food prices, the ABCC organized a series of events at
various levels of government (including the prime minister’s office) to discuss the cost of
transportation of Kyrgyz agricultural products to domestic and export markets, including costs
related to illegal payments on the roads.17 This information was also presented, for further
decision making, to the Ministry of Interior of Kazakhstan. Another example is the explanatory
work carried out to promote the concept of value chain development. Value Chain Development
Guidelines, prepared under the value chain pilot activity, were presented to the minister of
agriculture, heads of relevant units of the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Economic
Regulation, representatives of international projects, and value chain stakeholders.

72.     The other important institution that will remain in place after the project is the
Food Technology Training Center, established at the KSTU under the public
infrastructure development subcomponent. The project supported the refurbishment and
equipping of the facility, training of staff, development of training curricula, start-up marketing
and promotion activities for the FTTC services, as well as appropriate governance through
establishment of a supervisory board consisting of public and private sector representatives.
Establishment of the FTTC will improve the capacity and knowledge of the country’s food
technologists and enable the agribusiness sector to meet the increasing consumer demand for
high-quality and safe food products. The FTTC will offer training on state-of-art equipment,
laboratory testing services, opportunities to develop new products on its demonstration lines, and
a range of other services. Given the long-standing complaints about the scarcity of high-quality

17
  During the project, the ABCC conducted a series of “road trips,? accompanying actual sellers and exporters to
monitor the situation with illegal and legal payments on roads. The routes included Bishkek to Osh, Bishkek to
Astana (Kazakhstan), and Bishkek to select cities of southern Siberia in Russia.

                                                       20
food technologists, it is very important that the FTTC was set up at the university, as this will
help to improve the education of future food technologists. This is the only such training facility
in the Kyrgyz Republic; if operated successfully,18 the FTTC will become a key institution for
sector development.

73.     According to the PAD, the strategy behind establishing the ABCC was to create
industry-specific skills and capacity within the Kyrgyz Republic, to collaborate effectively
with foreign technical assistance providers, and to take over leadership of technical
assistance functions in the area of business development by the end of the project. While the
ABCC at the end of the project had the capacity to provide consultancy services to agribusiness
and processing companies, the limited willingness and capacity of potential clients to pay the full
cost of these services did not allow the ABCC to become fully independent financially and to
sustain the team of experts who were assembled and trained over the course of the project.
However, the local expertise nurtured under the project has been integrated into the industry. For
example, the ICR mission learned that, having seen the quality of local consultants under the
project, several of the beneficiaries were interested in paying the full cost of consultants, while at
least one hired the local consultant from the ABCC as its production manager. In other cases,
former client companies hired some technologists as permanent employees.

74.     Although two ministry units (MCAU and MEDT’s Food Security Unit) were
established under the project, they were only temporary, and their impact was not
significant. Their role was to add to the ministries’ capacity, and their roles became particularly
important during the food price crisis. In total, the MCAU produced 52 reports, some of them
requested by the ministry and beyond the TOR. Although the mission heard of occasions when
the reports of the MCAU contributed to the decision-making process in the MAWRPI, it was
difficult to get a clear sense of how many of the analyses, roundtables, and so forth prepared and
organized under the project contributed to significant policy changes or were communicated to a
broader audience outside the ministry.

75.     Finally, the capacity strengthening of the participating financial institutions will be
an important legacy of the project. The project provided training to almost 900 training spots
(some of the representatives attended training in more than one subject). The lending staff of the
participating financial institutions received a broader understanding of lending products used
globally to support agribusinesses, and this knowledge has been transferred in the Kyrgyz
Republic. The participating financial institutions reported that they benefited from the training
provided under the project and that this improved their ability to appraise agribusiness sector
borrowers in the future. "Ayil Bank", for example, at this time widely uses methods of

18
   The FTTC is expected to generate a large portion of its income through the sale of its services to the private
sector. A marketing survey was supported by the project to assess the interest of potential clients in the services of
the FTTC and their willingness to pay for services. The survey, conducted by the FTTC consultants, revealed a
strong interest among processing companies. All enterprises underscored the importance of the training for their
personnel and have indicated that they need training in the following areas: (a) processing technologies, 100 percent;
(b) laboratory testing methods, 85 percent; (c) hygiene and sanitation, 79 percent; (d) quality standards, 75 percent;
(e) marketing and sales, 66 percent; (f) financial management, 32 percent; and (g) other topics, 35 percent. In terms
of duration of the training courses, 85 percent of respondents preferred three to five days, with a possibility of
attending longer-term courses during off-season periods. As to the frequency of training, 76 percent of enterprises
were willing to be trained once a year, while 75 percent were intending to train their staff whenever a new product is
introduced. Management of 49 enterprises (72 percent) indicated that the FTTC could be helpful in testing and
introducing new products. Similarly, 43 enterprises (63 percent) said they were planning to use the FTTC laboratory
services for testing and research. From the financial perspective, the potential clients were willing to pay between
KGS 500 (35 percent of respondents) and KGS 2,000 (24 percent) per day of training. Within this range, 31 percent
were willing to pay KGS 1,000 (US$1 = KGS 47).

                                                         21
investment lending and leasing that they learned about during the seminar in their everyday
business. As a result of the knowledge gained, they also created a special subdivision dealing
with leasing, which has allowed it to achieve a leading position in the country’s leasing market.
Another PFI developed and implemented a new loan product, as the training had given it a strong
impetus to increase its customer base. Furthermore, the training encouraged the bank to exercise
more flexibility towards customers in its lending policies. Strengthening the capacity of PFI staff
also had an impact on the dissemination of knowledge in the banking sector, given the staff
movements among the country’s banks. This knowledge enables the PFIs to participate in other
donor credit lines. The PFIs also reported that, as a result of the training provided, they have
continued applying environmental risk assessment when evaluating loan requests outside the
project portfolio.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (Positive or Negative)

76.     The project strengthened the entrepreneurial spirit among beneficiaries. A positive
outcome of the project that beneficiaries of the consultancy services brought up on multiple
occasions during the ICR mission was their improved confidence and ability to put ideas into
practice. Beneficiaries reported that before the project they were inclined to do business
according to how they had always done it, but now they had many ideas that they wanted to put
into practice over the next few years. They also felt confident in their ability to do so, either with
the help of paid consultants or by themselves.

77.     The environmental skills acquired under the project became an asset for the
participating financial institutions outside of the project. According to the CLMU and one of
the financial institutions with which the team met during the ICR mission, the environmental
training has allowed the participating financial institutions to take part in other international
projects.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

78.    An impact survey was conducted during August–October 2012, which covered 200
beneficiaries under the project: 103 beneficiaries under the market development
component and 97 beneficiaries under the access to credit component. These included
processing companies, cooperatives, consultants, and financial institutions. The results of the
survey are referred to throughout this ICR and in annex 5.

79.    A project closing conference was organized during the ICR mission that allowed a
broad range of project participants to hold presentations or offer comments. Overall
beneficiaries had a positive view of the project activities and expressed a desire for services
under the project to continue. There was a call for expanding the base of agro-business
consultants in the country, especially in light of the limited availability of highly skilled
professionals, and there was positive feedback in this regard on the FTTC.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

80.     As always with projects that have large technical assistance components, there is a
risk that the investments made in human capacity will not be maintained. This is partly
because of the risk that staff in the participating companies or institutions will move to other
positions or countries and that the Kyrgyz Republic and its agro-food industry will not benefit
from their skills. An outflow of skilled human capacity could adversely affect the development
outcomes achieved. However, this risk is considered low, at least in the private sector, as the
                                                 22
positive contributions of the project have helped its many beneficiaries to achieve new targets
and motivated them to continue working. The capital investments made under the project are
unlikely to disappear. Therefore, it is assessed that no project-related factors pose a risk to the
development outcomes.

81.     Instead, the main risks involve factors beyond the control of the main beneficiaries.
An important risk is domestic and international food and trade policies. Experience from the past
years has shown that important export and import markets close easily at times of volatile food
prices (as happened during the 2008 food price crisis when Kazakhstan, which is the Kyrgyz
Republic’s main supplier of grain for human consumption, terminated its grain exports). This is
not within the control of the Kyrgyz Republic. Such a situation could affect both exports and the
availability of inputs, which would have an impact on the PDOs. While this general risk should
be kept in mind, the exact impact of the 2008 food price crisis on the project’s beneficiaries is
not known. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the extent of risk this poses in the future.

82.    During the ICR mission, one of the main concerns expressed by the technical
advisers and some of the beneficiaries was the poor quality of raw materials. This remains a
challenge for the success of the companies involved.

83.     Finally, there is a risk that support for the FTTC will not be maintained or that the
resources necessary to operate the center successfully will not be provided. Given the
reported need for skilled human capital in the Kyrgyz agro-food industry, this could adversely
affect the development outcomes. However, the KSTU has been extremely supportive during the
FTTC establishment process, and it is fairly safe to assume that this strong support will continue
in the future.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a)   Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84.     As discussed in section 2.1, the strategic relevance of the project was clear, and
preparation of the project was thorough, taking into account various aspects that could
influence implementation of the project and achievement of the objectives. Based on
rigorous background analysis and lessons learned from other projects, the PAD discusses in
detail the reasoning behind the approach to addressing the problems of the private agro-food
sector, the technical, financial, and economic context in the country and the sector, institutional
aspects and implementation arrangements (including monitoring and evaluation), risk
assessments, and so forth. Due to the nature of core beneficiaries and the objective of the project,
poverty and gender aspects were not covered in the preparatory documentation. Nor was the
impact on employment, although this is central in the country context and the government’s
strategy. However, development of the agribusiness sector through capacity building and
provision of financing were expected to result in higher demand for inputs and raw materials,
which was to generate employment in the farming sector. The Bank’s performance is assessed as
moderately satisfactory mainly due to the original too-broad PDO and the limited results and
monitoring frameworks, as discussed in sections 2.1 and 2.3.

(b)   Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                                23
85.      Overall, the quality of supervision was high. Regular supervisory missions were
conducted throughout project implementation, with more frequent missions in 2006 (three in that
year) to speed up implementation after the domestic unrest that occurred soon after the project
was implemented in 2005 and in 2010 to ensure proper implementation of remaining project
activities. To these ends, action plans were regularly agreed upon during project implementation.
The team identified the shortcomings in the original PDO and its indicators and restructured the
project to set realistic and measurable targets. A rural finance specialist was part of the team
from the beginning of the project and later took over as the task team leader. Similarly, also at a
second shift in leadership, the new task team leader came from within the core project team,
which ensured a smooth handover with minimum disruption to Bank supervision. Further into
implementation, the team was also staffed with an agro-business specialist and a value chain and
cooperative development specialist. The environmental safeguards specialist participated
regularly in missions beginning with the mid-term review. In addition, a social safeguards
specialist joined the team for the mid-term review, although no social safeguards were triggered.
Project audits were performed on a regular basis as well as audits of the participating financial
institutions, ensuring compliance with financial management requirements.

86.      However, it took a very long time to agree on and implement the first-tier
restructuring in summer 2009 and gaps in the client’s results monitoring slipped. As
mentioned in the Restructuring Paper, the need to reformulate the PDOs and simplify the
outcome indicators first appeared during the extended period between project board approval and
the start of project implementation (due to delayed ratification and the revolution of March
2005). During that time, other agencies, most notably GIZ and Reiffesen, scaled up their
involvement in cooperatives, making it redundant for the project to pursue the objective of
“increasing the number and economic importance of producer organizations.? This objective was
left to the GIZ. However, it took almost four years to agree with the government on changes to
the PDO and outcome indicators. Further, as discussed in section 2.3 of this ICR, there were gaps
in the client’s monitoring of changes in sales and profit among the clients and the team should
have followed up on this better and ensured that adequate data was collected for these two
indicators. The supervision rating is therefore regarded as Moderately Satisfactory rather than
Satisfactory.

(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

87.     The overall rating of Bank performance is considered moderately satisfactory. The
fact that the original PDO was too broad to be attributed to the project influenced the rating of an
otherwise well-designed project. Similarly, revising the PDO was a lengthy process, and
insufficient data was collected for monitoring of two key indicators. Overall Bank performance
is therefore considered Moderately Satisfactory.



5.2 Borrower Performance

(a)   Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

88.   The government of the Kyrgyz Republic showed a strong commitment to the project
during the design phase and made the institutional arrangements necessary to implement
Components 1 and 2 successfully. The government also saw the project as an effective tool
with which to address problems in the agro-food sector that arose with the food price crisis and
                                                24
used the project’s capacity as political priorities shifted. The operational cost of the FTTC, which
is currently under construction, is expected to be financed partially by the government via the
budget of the KSTU. If operated according to plan, the center will add significant value to agro-
food education in the Kyrgyz Republic and constitute a positive contribution of the government.
The delays with ratification of the project in 2005 were related to political events and considered
a force majeure. The main concern with the Government’s role in the implementation of the
Project is the delays caused by CADII, which in particular delayed the counter signing of the
first restructuring for one year.

(b)   Implementing Agency and Unit Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

89.      As noted in other sections, the performance of the implementing agencies (the
MEDT, the Ministry of Finance, and the MAWRPI) and units (the ABCC and the CLMU)
was high. The units, in particular, performed in line with and beyond their TOR. The ABCC was
proactive in initiating activities that were not originally planned and addressed problems that
arose in its work with beneficiaries. Both the MIS and the FTTC are results of this. Other
initiatives from the ABCC included an attempt to develop a common Kyrgyz label and
packaging for food products to communicate that products are of a certain quality and a
feasibility study of the export potential for sea-buckthorn. At project design, one of the foreseen
roles of the ABCC was to communicate the needs and challenges of the private sector to the
public sector and to identify solutions to obstacles for private sector development. In retrospect,
the ABCC managed this role very well, contributing to the successful outcomes of the project.

90.      The CLMU under the Ministry of Finance also carried out its functions
satisfactorily and provided important support to participating financial institutions in
implementation of the credit line. For instance, it conducted a monitoring visit to every sub-
borrower and checked the loan file for completeness. The training was well organized, which is
attested to by the high number of trainees reached. It also approached the TOR with creativity
that further contributed to the achievement of the development objectives. For instance, the
CLMU organized a special training session for senior management of participating financial
institutions on the new financial products in agriculture, realizing that, without their
understanding and buy-in, senior management would not allow loan officers to pilot these new
products. The overall experience of the financial institutions in working with the CLMU was
positive.

91.     The MEDT, the Ministry of Finance, and the MAWRPI all carried out their
responsibilities according to the Loan Agreement. As noted, delays in the decision-making
process affected the project’s implementation, but these were mainly due to events beyond the
control of the implementing agencies. The main concern, which affects the rating, is the lack of
data collection throughout the project over sales and profits of the clients.


(c)   Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

92.   Despite delays in decisions making and gaps in monitoring data, the overall borrower
performance can be considered moderately satisfactory due to the high commitment from
the implementing agencies and units, without which the project would not have achieved
such positive results.


                                                25
6. Lessons Learned

93.     A high level of commitment is required both from the World Bank team and from
the client to implement complex projects successfully. The mission documentation reflects a
high level of support from the World Bank team in project implementation and a high level of
activity on the part of the ABCC and the CLMU, which contributed to the originally planned
project activities as well as new initiatives. Individual consultants also formed a close
relationship with the processing companies, which resulted in mutual trust and commitment.
Given the complexity of the project, it is doubtful that implementation would have been equally
successful in the absence of such highly committed teams.

94.     The project design allowed for trial and error in piloting ideas and activities, which
was another factor in success of the project. For instance, the project design envisaged trade
linkage contractors—that is, individuals and companies working in other cities (markets)—who
would inform the ABCC of sales opportunities. This concept proved operationally difficult to
implement. The funding was reallocated to a matching-grant program for cooperatives, allowing
22 cooperatives to acquire productive assets. Another example was the attempt to develop
exports of sea-buckthorn to Germany. The Raiffeisen Fund Kyrgyzstan wanted to avail finance
to farmers’ cooperatives for picking and processing the berries, and the ABCC conducted an
analysis of the market potential of this sector. Although the analysis found that there was
significant market potential for developing this value chain, both the World Bank and the State
Agency of Environment and Forestry were concerned about the environmental impacts of the
harvesting methods, and the project was abandoned. Instead, the project supported the pilot value
chains. Nevertheless, international experience shows that this type of initial government support
for uncertain sectors has played an important role in some of the most successful efforts to
develop the agriculture sector and that success in certain sectors has been matched by failure in
others.19

95.      The flexibility of the design also ensured the demand-driven nature of the activities.
To mitigate for the limited capacity in the country to implement such advanced and somewhat
innovative activities, the project components were described in detail in the PAD, and detailed
steps were given for project implementation (6.5 pages only in the main text). Yet the design also
allowed the ABCC the flexibility to develop its approach to supporting agribusinesses and
facilitating market linkages, to ensure that the services provided under the project were demand
driven and addressed the needs of individual beneficiaries.

96.    Picking the winners allowed the project to achieve its full potential in terms of the
achieved results. A rigorous process of early selection, with tough key questions (including
whether management of the company is fully committed, whether the decision-making process is
streamlined, and whether the company is able to secure a loan or other funding, if needed)
allowed the project to pick future winners for participation in the technical assistance packages.
While some companies were adversely affected by the political or external economic events, the
majority of companies participating under the project achieved very good results.

97.     The individual design of each service package, according to the needs of the client,
was crucial for the good results of the project. Each service package was designed by the
consultants and committed to by the company. Detailed action plans that spelled out every
activity and provided a timeline were drawn up and agreed with management of the client
companies. The combination of technical assistance services (financial management, technical,

and marketing services) was essential to achieving sustainable results. Many beneficiaries
pointed out in the ICR meetings that single-service packages (for example, only marketing
advice) would not have been as useful. Also, the longer duration of technical assistance packages
(depending on the scope of work, the assistance was for up to 18 months) allowed the project to
demonstrate the quality of the consultancy services and gradually overcome the donor fatigue
that some beneficiaries were facing.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

       Component 1: Market Development20

       A. Enterprise Development Sub-component:

       Technical Assistance to Agribusinesses Implementation

       The main objectives and tasks of the sub-component included support to agro-processing enterprises
       through provision of technical assistance to ensure competitiveness of their products in the foreign
       and domestic markets. Enterprises of the food and processing industry of the country received
       technical assistance in terms of advice on a wide range of issues, organizing their participation in
       international exhibitions and workshops, and training of the personnel.

       Assistance to the client enterprises was provided by CA-17 International (France), an international
       consulting company with a wealth of international experience as well as a team of local consultants
       (17 experts) established by the ACC within the project and representing professional specialists in the
       appropriate areas. Technical assistance was provided in the areas of industry management, finance,
       marketing and introduction of international quality standards (??ССР, ISO).

       In order to implement the technical assistance, detailed action plans were developed for each client
       enterprise. These action plans focused on the above-mentioned areas. As a result of the technical
       assistance program, the following was expected:
       (1) Increase in the value added of food product processing in the selected client enterprises, in
       particular, increase in the product quality, reduction of production costs, increase in the volume of
       sales, improvement of managerial knowledge and skills of the personnel;
       (2) Strengthening capacity of the domestic market consulting services.

       Main results:
       The first technical assistance package to the processing entities was implemented in 2008-2009.
       Within the first TA package, Action Plans were implemented in the following 20 selected
       enterprises:

   Cooperatives Support Program

   Activities on implementation of the Farmer Cooperatives Support Program were
   implemented from 2009. The aim of the program was to combine efforts on development of
   the rural cooperatives system, which is focused on improvement of economic activity in the
   areas of production, processing and sale of agricultural products. Activities on
   strengthening the capacity of farmer cooperatives by conducting a series of training
   sessions listed below were undertaken within the Cooperatives Support Program:
   - Effective management and business planning

                                            35
    - Marketing of agricultural products
    - Training of cooperatives accountants
    - Financial management
    - Effective conducting of business negotiations.

    A total of 192 cooperatives (including 76 cooperatives during 2009 – 2010 and 116
    cooperatives in 2011) were trained under the program as part of their possible participation
    in a Matching Grant Program designed for Farmer Cooperatives under the project’s Credit
    Line component. As of today, 58 agricultural cooperatives have been financed under the
    grant program for cooperatives in the total amount of US$800,060.

    Other trainings to 67 cooperatives were provided in 2011. In general, 259 farmer
    cooperatives from all country regions have been trained. ABCC continued to support
    farmer cooperatives to enable them to get financial assistance within the grant line and to
    provide training for additional cooperatives, particularly, together with Raiffaisen
    Kyrgyzstan foundation.

   borders of 5 countries: the Kyrgyz Republic, Republic of Kazakhstan, Republic of
   Tajikistan, Republic of Uzbekistan and Russian Federation». The book is a practical
   guideline on legal aspects of agricultural products trade, and was disseminated to the

                                             36
     domestic private and public sectors and in CIS countries (Russia, Kazakhstan). This book
     was published with the financial support of USAID Trade Liberalization and Customs
     Reform project.
2)   Report on “Examining the real barriers restraining promotion of goods and trade
     development in the region» (with financial support of OSCE).
3)   Brochures:

     Within this sub-component the ABCC also conducted a number of large events with the
     aim to obtain a platform for dialogue between the public and private sectors in order to
     discuss problems which prevent development of the agribusiness sector, in particular, in the
     area of taxation, promotion of domestic products in the export markets, obtaining
     permissions and licenses.

     In addition, ABCC assisted the agribusiness sector in search of potential partners by
     organizing events. For instance, the International Agribusiness Forum on “Expanding
     regional trade of agricultural products and food items and means of their production? was
     organized on April 10, 2009. The aim of conducting the Agribusiness Forum was to set up
     direct business contacts between producers and buyers of agricultural products, food items
     and processing industry products of the Kyrgyz Republic, CIS countries and far-abroad
     countries. Domestic producers participated in an exhibition, where they were able to
     present a wide range of agricultural products. As a result of the Forum, 10 contracts and
     letters of intents were signed.

     The Kyrgyz – Kazakh Agribusiness Forum on “Regional cooperation in the area of
     agricultural products and food item trade? was conducted in Kordai village of the Kazakh
     Republic Jambyl oblast on October 29, 2010. Objectives of the Kyrgyz – Kazakh
     Agribusiness Forum included: development of stable trade in agricultural products and food
     items and expanding agroexport capacity of the Kyrgyz Republic; setting up mutually
     beneficial business contacts between vendors and buyers of the agricultural products;
     reviewing issues related to access regime, elimination of administrative barriers while
     moving agricultural products through the Kyrgyz – Kazakh border. As a result, 29 contracts
     of intent were signed between the entrepreneurs of the two countries on supply of
     agricultural products to the Republic of Kazakhstan.

     In general, 22 large events (round tables, workshops and conferences) were organized
     under this activity, dealing with problems of political, legal and normative nature that
     prevent improvements in the competiveness of the Kyrgyz agricultural sector goods. These
     were submitted to the interested ministries and government agencies for their review. The
     total number of participants at the conducted events amounted to 1,550.

     In addition, the ABCC regularly assisted the interested ministries with preparation of
     analytical information and other materials on the situation in the agricultural sector and
     food industry, participation in sessions and meetings, submission of proposals and

     sector.

     Informational and Marketing Service (IMS):

     The official web-site of ABCC, www.agromarket.kg was launched in 2009. Informational
     and Marketing Service (IMS) was established as a structure of ABCC. IMS collected,
     arranged and analyzed information on and for the agricultural sector of the economy. With
     IMS assistance, the ABCC clients could submit enquiries and obtain information on
     producers of goods and services by region and sub-sector of economy, live data on retail
     and wholesale prices for agricultural products in the regions, information on available
     proposals and requests in the market, use database and analytical materials and news.

     IMS created and regularly updates a data base, which includes information on agricultural
     producers and farmer cooperatives, agribusiness companies, processing companies,
     analytical information, suppliers of agricultural and food equipment, financial and credit
     institutions, consulting companies, international donor organizations etc. Regular weekly
     update of information on retail and wholesale prices on food products in Bishkek and Osh
     cities is done by the ABCC on its website.

     50,527 visitors and 36,725 unique visitors have been registered and 97,766 pages were
     reviewed on the ABCC website for period 2010 – May 2012.

     A pilot program on dissemination of weather forecasts to farmers was conducted for period
     May – November 2011 through SMS. 20 clients (farmers), of which 10 from Chui Oblast
     and 10 from Osh Oblast, participated. The service was provided free of charge. Monitoring
     of accuracy of the provided forecast was carried out, and, based on the assessment done by
     the clients, the accuracy of the provided forecast was 80 percent. Weather forecasts were
     provided daily, for 3 days in advance compared with official sources, which provide this
     information only for the next day. Many requests were received to continue with this
     service, including several farmers who were prepared to pay for it.

     ABCC regularly conducted promotional activities through mass media, publications and
     reporting in informational agencies, printing houses, on radio and TV informing of the
     conducted events and providing comments and analytical articles on urgent issues of the
     Kyrgyz Republic agricultural sector development.


Component 2: Access to Credit

     Credit Line Implementation Progress. The implementation of the Credit Line for
     agribusiness investments was fully completed. It should be noted that as a result of
     US$/SDR exchange rate fluctuations, the original US$5 million of the Credit Line as of end
     June 2012 had become US$5.11 million, all of which will be disbursed by that date. Total
     investments mobilized into the agribusiness sector amount to approx. US$16.6 million
     equivalent, including the required co-financing by Participating Financial Institutions
     (minimum 20 percent for all sub-loans after December 31, 2006) and beneficiaries
     (minimum 20 percent).

(ii)       including, 12 sub-loans in the US$0.497 million have been provided to cooperatives in
           support of the cooperative matching grant program (eligible cooperatives receive a
           matching grant for their investment in productive assets for agricultural production and
           processing, and the credit-line co-finances the grants).
(iii)      27 sub-loans in the total amount of US$1.73 million equivalent have been financed from
           reflows, which accumulate in the PFIs from repayments on principal amounts by the sub-
           borrowers and are used for repayment of the subsidiary loan in accordance with an agreed
           schedule to the Ministry of Finance, or revolved into new sub-loans using the same

      Farmer Cooperative Matching Grant Program. The program allowed eligible
      cooperatives that (i) had participated in the specialized training provided by ABCC (or
      obtained equivalent training elsewhere), and (ii) required investments in productive assets

                                                   40
      for agricultural production and small-scale processing, and (iii) met other criteria
      established in the Operational Guidelines for the matching grant program, to obtain a
      portion of necessary financing to procure the asset on a conditional grant basis. PFIs
      appraise such requests for grant financing, to ensure the cooperatives were financially
      viable, and filled in any financing gap (between the total amount of the sub-project and the
      grant financing) from their own credit line resources. The grant could be obtained in an
      amount of up to 30 percent of the loan amount21. It should be noted that the grant represents
      the last 30 percent of the provided financing – the loan portion (70 percent) had to be repaid
      in full and on time in order for the 30 percent to become a grant. In case of non-repayment
      of the loan portion, the entire matching grant amount becomes a loan, repayable with
      interest.

      58 grants were provided by PFIs in the amount of US$800,060 (i.e. 100 percent of the total
      allocation for the matching grant program). The grants predominantly financed agricultural
      machinery - 17 and the remaining 5 grants finance reconstruction and construction of
      facilities, equipment and other purposes. Discussions with the PFIs revealed that the
      interest in these grants, thus the pipeline, was strong. The Table below summarizes the
      implementation of the matching grant program as of the date of June 2012:

      Training of PFIs under ABMP. Training was carried out with PFIs under the project, and
      the original targets have been far exceeded. The project provided training to the staff of the
      PFIs in three subjects: Investment Lending and Leasing in Agriculture, Structured Finance
      Products in Agriculture, and Environmental Training. At the project outset, it was
      envisaged that about 150 banking sector staff would receive training in Investment Lending
      and Leasing, Structured Finance Products, and Environmental issues related to project

21
   For example, if a cooperative wanted to purchase a tractor, they have to invest 10 percent of own funds
(as borrower’s contribution). Of the remaining 90 percent, up to 30 percent could be obtained as matching
grant, and the remaining 70 percent was provided by the PFI as a loan from own resources or from the
ABMP credit line.

financing. The training was initiated by international consultants who delivered the first set
of the training courses and in parallel trained the local consultants who subsequently fully
took over the training activities. This allowed for a very efficient training of a large number
of financial intermediary staff under the project. As a result, 883 bank staff were trained
under the project, including: 380 staff trained in Investment Lending and Leasing in
Agriculture, 337 staff in Structured Finance, and 166 PFI staff in Environmental Training.

Component 3: Monitoring and Advisory

The Market Conditions Analysis Unit (MCAU) collected and provided price information
and market analysis on key food items to the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). It also
provided information in response to ad-hoc requests from the Ministry of Agriculture and
Melioration.

      Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The economic internal rate of return (ERR) to the project is estimated to be 221 percent and the
net present value (NPV) US$ 12,738,571. The financial analysis shows an internal rate of return
of 203 percent with a NPV of US$ 18,952,112.

The PAD expected economic benefits of the Project through two channels: (i) direct interaction
with clients of the ABCC; and (ii) assistance to other private sector actors, improvement in the
functioning of markets, and enhanced public sector capacity. The second channel of benefits
comprised the public sector work of the Project (infrastructure and capacity enhancement),
introduction of regulatory and policy changes, work of the MDS, provision of credit under the
two credit lines, and capacity building of participating financial institutions, which in turn would
avail more credit to the agri-food sector. Because of the demand-driven nature of the investments
and TA activities, ERR or NPV were not calculated at project appraisal, which makes it difficult
to evaluate if the Project reached the expected ERR.

Nevertheless, the assumptions of the PAD remain valid in general also after implementation.
Economic impact stemmed from the TA packages, the Credit Line, the Value Chain activity, the
contract facilitation, public sector interventions and public goods provision such as regulatory
improvements and the MIS. Because of the difficulties in measuring the economic impact of
several of these activities, the difficulty to prove attributability to the Project, and the delay in the
results of some (like the FTTC), the economic impact analysis focuses on three activities:
     (i) the TA packages;
     (ii) the Credit Line; and
     (iii) the contract facilitation.

The economic analysis leaves out the impacts on many of the beneficiaries, since it only takes
into account the actual available data on monetary impacts. It also does not make any
assumptions on continued benefits from the TA packages, nor possible spill-over effects on other
companies. Further, the analysis does not make any assumptions on the benefits from the FTTC,
from the price data bases, social impacts, or externalities. The results from the economic analysis
are therefore likely to be lower than actual.

Inflation and Exchange Rates

While Kyrgyzstan had limited inflation at the time of the design of the Project, inflation picked
up during Project implementation, in particular during the food price crisis. The following
inflation rate was recorded throughout the implementation period:

                                2006       2007           2008    2009      2010     2011       2012
 KG Consumer Price Index       5.56%      10.18 %        24.52%   6.9%     7.97%    16.5%      2.18%
 Value decrease                 0.94        0.90          0.75    0.93      0.92     0.84       0.98

Inflation rates have been adjusted for according to the comparing years, starting with the year
following the initiation of the TA packages, since profit and sales have been estimated as of the
end of the year. I.e. for the first TA package, inflation has been adjusted for from 2007 and
onwards, and for the second TA package, from 2009 and onwards. Data has been available for
2011 or 2012 and inflation has been adjusted for accordingly.

    Exchange rates are annual average exchange rates calculated from the exchange rate set by the
    National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic. Exchange rates for the period 2013-2016 have been
    assumed equal to the 2012 exchange rate. Using the average exchange rate was opted out since
    the 2012 US$ value to the KGS is the highest for the relevant period and the result of a
    continuous increase since 2008. Also, predicting the future exchange (and, thus, assuming that the
    US$ would increase further to the KGS) was deemed too risky.

                             2005      2006    2007       2008     2009     2010      2011        2012   2013-2018

    Project benefits:

    Despite significant effort, including a beneficiary survey, it was not possible to obtain annual data
    on profits within the scope of this assignment. Therefore, the benefits of both the TA packages
    and the credit line reflect only the profit for a certain period and not for all project years, and are
    therefore likely to be significantly underestimated. It can be noted that for both the TA
    Component and the Credit Line Component, profit figures are taken from the books of the
    companies and are not recall figures.

    The impacts of the TA packages compare the profits the baseline year (2009 or 2011) with the
    profit of 2011 or 2012, depending on the company. Data on profits were provided by 11
    companies and profits have been adjusted for inflation. As can be seen in the aggregate revenues
    for the TA packages, business activities in 2011 were influenced by the domestic conflict. (Data
    for 2012 has, however, not been possible to obtain.)

    The data obtained for the impact of the Credit Line is only for 6 months (measured as the profit 6
    months after the credit was granted and compared with the profit 6 months prior to the loan), and
    not the full project implementation period, and is thus likely to be even further underestimated.
    The inflation rate applied reflects that of the rate the year that the credit was granted. It is then
    assumed that the investment made will benefit the project for another six years, with an annual 10
    percent of the initial profit in real terms. Thus, total impacts from the investments are expected to
    last for seven years, which is the average amortization period.

    The Trade Facilitation Activity was regularly monitored and runs therefore over the full project
    implementation period. Because of the difficulties that the producers and processors had to sell
    their products and the fact that many of them had large stocks of unsold quantities, it is assumed
    that the Contract Facilitation Activity can be attributed 70 percent of the value of these contracts.

    Over the course of the Project, the data we have is the following:

      Note: Profits under the TA activities and the credit line have been adjusted for inflation.

      To obtain economic prices, a standard conversion rate (SCR) of 0.8 is applied on the revenues
      generated by the contract facilitation. While a share of these revenues came from foreign
      contracts, these contracts were also subject to taxes, customs duties, and other fees, and so the
      conversion rate is applicable also in these cases.

      Project costs:

      The costs of the Project were as follows:

                  Y1          Y2           Y3            Y4          Y5         Y6          Y7          Y8        Y9

      Without Project

      The without project scenario is developed based on interviews with project beneficiaries:

      Increase in profit without the TA Packages: All beneficiaries of the TA activities confirmed
      the importance of the Project for the results they were seeing. While beneficiaries were based on
      screening procedures that helped select companies for which activities had high probability to
      succeed, none of the beneficiaries that the ICR team talked to was of the opinion that this could
      have been achieved without the project. Also, beneficiaries had limited in-house capacity to
      improve processing and marketing, and thus would have had to cover costs for consultants. It is
      therefore assumed that the beneficiaries would have made about 25 percent without the Project
      (i.e. that about 75 percent of the change in profit was due to the Project).

      Increase in profit without the Credit Line: Several beneficiaries that the ICR mission spoke to
      mentioned that they were already applying for credit when the PFI that they were in contact with
      recommended the ABMP Credit Line. It is therefore likely that some of these investments would
      have been made also without the Project. Nevertheless, the PFIs would have been more risk
      averse and the interest rates would have been higher, making profit smaller for the beneficiaries.
      It can also be assumed that not all beneficiaries would have been granted credit by the PFIs
      without the credit lines. The without project profit initial increase is therefore set to 40 percent of
      the with project increase, and with the investment generating 15 percent the following four years
      as in the with project scenario.

      The contracts generated without the contract facilitation: As discussed in the PAD, contracts
      and trade deals were a challenge for the agro-processing industry and the MDS had an important
      role in linking producers and processors to buyers both in and outside Kyrgyzstan. The ICR
      describes the difference in domestic and foreign prices for a potatoes farmer for example (see
      paragraph 3.2.) Also, as discussed above, in many cases these producers had large amounts of
      unsold goods that they could not find a market for, and the Contract Facilitation Activity was thus
      crucial. Similarly, the Contract Facilitation assumingly led to fewer middlemen in the supply
      chains. Therefore, the without project impact is set to 30 percent of the with project value of these
      contracts.

Externalities:

Negative externalities of the project can be regarded as minimal. The most likely risk of negative
externalities under the Project was that related to negative environmental impacts, in particular
from increased production and potential waste related to reconstruction of production facilities,
etc. However, environmental impacts of the project seem to have been virtually non-existing (see
section 2.X of the ICR). Instead, the Project seems to have generated multiple positive
externalities, as confirmed in meetings with beneficiaries and in the survey. Positive social
externalities include the increased trust among actors in the sector, increased confidence and
entrepreneurial spirit among beneficiaries, the trickling down of quality awareness to farmers and
other input suppliers, etc. The PAD also foresaw that other firms would copy business models
from beneficiaries under the TA component and through this generate benefits, and the ICR
mission found scattered evidence that this did indeed take place Positive environmental
externalities include reduced waste in production and throughout the supply chain, and increased
energy efficiency with new production equipment. However, these externalities are difficult to
measure and are therefore not included in the economic analysis.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results 

A beneficiary survey was commissioned under the Project and was carried out in August-September
2012. The purpose of the survey was to ensure sufficient data and other information to complete the
ICR. The survey methodology was a combination of qualitative and quantitative approach. To
accommodate for the different groups of beneficiaries, seven different questioners were developed.
While the final report of the survey is over sixty pages, for the purpose of this ICR, this annex
includes the survey’s coverage, a summary of the results, and recommendations from the
beneficiaries.
Coverage
The survey covered seven target groups of beneficiaries of the “Market Development? and “Access to
Credit? components. In total, 200 respondents were surveyed, including 97 (48.5 percent)
beneficiaries of “Access to Credit? component, and 103 (51.5 percent) beneficiaries of “Market
Development? Component. The survey was held throughout the country.
The survey of the “Access to Credit? beneficiaries covered five Participating Financing Institutions
(PFIs), 56 enterprises of all ownership forms from seven oblasts of the country, which obtained
loans, 16 cooperatives from seven oblasts of the country, which received grants, and 32 employees
of PFIs who were trained on three topics, from six oblasts of the country.
The survey of the “Market Development? covered 13 enterprises supported by ABCC;
83 cooperatives from seven oblasts of the country that were trained by ABCC; 5 consultants that
were involved in the Project and 2 participants of VAC from the Naryn and Talas oblasts.
Summary of Results
Achievement of tasks under “Access to Credit? Component is represented by the following data:
actual ratio of timely repayment of sub-loans was 100 percent against 95 percent planned; actual
number of loans issued to agricultural producers, processors and agribusiness was 82 (as of July 16,
2012) against 50 planned; actual number of PFIs was 6 against minimum 3 PFIs planned; actual
number of trained credit officers was 883 against 150 people anticipated. The only indicator for
which data was less than anticipated, was increase of share of agricultural loans in overall PFIs
portfolio. It was assumed that PFIs will increase their credit portfolio for agricultural loans by 15%

The most useful for respondents was marketing consultations, followed by financial management
consultations. Production management consultations were fairly useful. As a result of trainings held
one third of respondents (by 38.5 percent) increased production output, profit, and sales of products
increased at 30.8%. Rise in assets, capital stock, total amount of attracted investments, and amount of
own contribution was observed at 15.4 percent respondents. The large majority of ABCC client
enterprises (77 percent) were satisfied with the cooperation.



                                                    51
Within “Market Development? subcomponent trainings were held for cooperatives in the following
areas: efficient management of cooperatives and record management; marketing of agricultural
products and business planning, training of accountants of cooperatives, financial management, and
efficient business negotiations. The cooperatives highly appraised trainings held. The most of
respondents evaluated training quality as “excellent? and “good? under 5-grade scale that
demonstrates relevance of selected topics to the needs of cooperatives. 92.8 percent of cooperatives
participated in the survey were satisfied with cooperation with ABCC. Despite the fact that
respondents highly assessed usefulness of training, as well as the fact that the trainings were provided
free-of-charge, 57.8 percent are not ready to pay for training in future. Within “Market Development?
Component 26 local consultants were prepared. Within this Research five of them were surveyed;
they work in different fields. It is interesting to note that regardless different assessments of the
quality of training events attended by ABCC consultants, this Project had yet a positive impact on
their activity. Practically all of respondents improved their level of proficiency, 40% of respondents
increased the number of clients, 60 percent of respondents had gained a better image and all
consultants increased services fee.

In general, Technical Assistance to enterprises led to specific changes. Five respondents increased
production output and profit. Four respondents increased the level of sales of goods. Rise in
assets, capital, and total amount of attracted investments took place at three respondents (Figure
2).

The TA also resulted in introduction of new products and in accessing new markets and
increasing sales (Figure 3).

    Other changes also took place in the enterprises as a result of the ABCC activities:

    Figure 4: Changes in scope of enterprises




    Eight of the surveyed companies participated in exhibitions under the Project and reported the
    following results:
   Purchase of new equipment and signed contracts for purchase of equipment
   Improved quality for inputs and outputs
   Improvement in design, labeling, food safety, and production processes

    The survey showed that the majority of the respondents (77 percent) are satisfied with the
    positive changes on their enterprises and therefore, they plan to cooperate with the Project in
    future; 8 percent of respondents are not satisfied with cooperation with ABCC, 15 percent
    respondents did not answer.

of cooperation with ABCC. 20 percent of respondents of total number of surveyed consultants
improved their skills. 40 percent of respondents expanded knowledge in the area of
specialization. 40 percent of respondents increased number of clients. 60 percent of respondents
improved image and 100 percent of consultants were able to increase their service fee by
increasing added value for consumers.

Survey of VAC participants caused difficulties for interviewers. Respondents constantly confused
about training received, program in which they participated. To the question what Technical
Assistance got participants of pilot VAC project respondents could name only three types of aid
out of seven proposed to them: training, practical training, search for partners. This help was
highly appraised – “4? and “5? mark (5-grade score).
To assess the Project’s impact on activity of pilot project participants the respondents were asked
about practical implementation of Technical Assistance received. All respondents (under 100%
scale) stated that owing to aid rendered under the Project the production quantity increased and
managerial skills of respondents improved.
Following the questionnaire it was found out that cooperatives/groups of respondents are
functioning. To some extent, it may be a positive effect of the Project as members of cooperatives
and farm groups in the period of Project implementation were involved into joint activity. The
reality is that lack of activity in a cooperative leads to the condition of a “dormant cooperative? or
its liquidation.
The achievement of training can be readiness of 50 percent of respondents to pay for training.
Ten-complex training program was built in a way that farmers should pay for training; the
amount would be insignificant and adequate. The approach based on paid training increases
responsibility of trainees, their interest in the results of training.

Figure 6: Percentage of the number of formed cooperatives depending on the year of
establishment




At the moment of the survey 86.7 percent of cooperatives were functional, 2.4 percent of
cooperatives stopped its activity, and 10.9 percent did not respond. Survey of respondents showed
that local population is strongly interested in joining to a cooperative. 56.6 percent of respondents
(members of cooperatives) marked demand for joining to cooperative, whereas an offer to join a
cooperative received only 30.1 percent of respondents (participants of self-help groups), who
have not become members of a cooperative yet.

Participant impression of the training provided to cooperatives under the Project and the
relevance of the training topics is provided in Figure 7.

                                            55
    The absolute majority of respondents (100 percent) answered that they put in practice the
    knowledge gained; knowledge of record management, accounting and managerial skills was
    improved (45.8 percent). Respondents mentioned the good organization of trainings (38.7
    percent). Trainings became a forum for sharing of experience (13.3 percent).
    Further, ABCC’s satisfaction rate in this regard was 92.8 percent among the participating
    cooperatives. Nevertheless, the following concerns about the training weres also raised:
   More practical lessons were needed
   Trainer poorly explained topics
   Time of training concurred with seasonal works
   Inadequate time was allocated for trainings
   Language used in training impeded participation (both Russian and Kyrgyz depending on beneficiary)
    Despite the high satisfaction rate with the training, only 14 percent would be willing to pay for
    training in future.


    Recommendations from beneficiaries
    Recommendations for the Access to Credit Component
    Below are given recommendations by beneficiaries who got loans under “Access to Credit?
    Component.
    Credit:
   Extension of loans for agricultural producers with low interest rates and for longer periods
   Bank officers should be friendly
    Training:
   Conduct trainings in the nearest cities
   We are ready to participate in all ABCC trainings
   Training on accounting
   Include more practical knowledge in trainings
    General:
   Reduce number of documents for getting a credit
   Organize congress of cooperatives
   More similar projects

                                                  56
   Give more time for collection of documents
   Extend grant aid

    PFI employees participating in training under the Project had the following recommendations:

   Conduct more trainings, especially on topic “Investment Crediting and Leasing?; other pressing
    topics should be also selected
   Give more time for solution of practical exercises
   The project is perfect. We recommend to introduce it at the government level
   Trainings on topic “Agribusiness and Marketing? should be held more often
   To hire more qualified translators on the workshop topics

    Recommendations for the Market Development Component
    To assess relevance of the Project to the needs of enterprises and impact of Technical Assistance
    respondents were asked to give recommendations for future similar projects. According to
    opinion of respondents (enterprises) they need not only consulting services, but financial support
    with the view to purchase equipment.
    In most cases enterprises continue to feel need in the Project’s services, in particular, three
    respondents mentioned assistance with purchase of equipment and two respondents – an
    opportunity to visit international exhibitions. Practical trainings for enterprises are also pressing;
    training on new technologies and training of competent personnel; possibility for privileged
    crediting, leasing; introduction of the system of quality standards.

    Inputs from cooperatives:

    Members of cooperatives and self-help groups provided the following recommendations for
    future projects:
   Conduct these trainings in autumn or winter, not in high season, at accessible locations or in the
    nearest towns
   Make selection of advanced cooperatives to share experience
   More similar projects to work with cooperatives, anticipating shared problem solution
   More topics on marketing; conduct training on receiving grants and consultations on new
    accounting technologies
   Free training, opening of training centers, technical support, conduct trainings in Kyrgyz
   More practical lessons, while trainings should be arranged at the good quality level
   Extend long-term credits with low interest rates

    Inputs from Market Development Consultants
    The consultants working with the Market Development Sub-component had the following
    recommendations.
   Development of VAC requires active interest and engagement by participants of supplies /VAC.
    It is necessary to conduct a purposeful work with cooperatives and farm groups to enlarge their
    farms, which would allow ensuring required quantity and standards of growing of agricultural
    products.
   Facilitation of VAC organizational process, financial and technical support is necessary.
    Consultation support, training and support of VAC participants are required. It is essential to
    provide assistance by donor community for this purpose.
   The Japanese experience in “One Village – One Product? Project can be used at VAC
    organization, which can also help to ensure quantity of products, their uniformity.
   To receive more added value it is necessary to strive for exporting processed products, rather than
    raw materials. When creating VAC it is important to identify a VAC initiator, which will become
    a “driver? for VAC development and incur a portion of financial costs on product promotion
    along supply chain, development of sustainable supplies, etc.


                                                  57
   Sustainable development of agricultural market requires operation of marketing centers, which
    can be founded in the form of secondary cooperatives. Additional effect of these marketing
    centers would be an impact on cooperatives of the first level and facilitation of their development.
   For the purpose of sustainable development of cooperatives as independent economic entities it is
    necessary that cooperative principles would become a daily practice and serve as the basis of
    cooperative’s activity. Thereto, it is essential to continue training related to creation and
    functioning of cooperatives.
   It is necessary to work purposefully on enlargement of cooperatives and shaping their
    specialization through re-structure of their activity into provision of services. Creation and
    development of secondary cooperatives also resolves the issue of enlargement of cooperatives,
    thus, the basis to strengthen capacity of cooperatives by themselves is created. This process
    requires intensive advisory support.
   There is a critical mass of cooperatives in the country. That is why the matter of practicability of
    regular training of cooperative community on the basis of training centers or higher educational
    institutions emerges.

1.      AGRIBUSINESS AND MARKETING PROJECT SUMMARY

1.1.    COMPONENT A: Market Development

The «Market Development» Component was implemented by the Agribusiness Competitiveness Center
(ABCC). This Component pursued the following objectives:
      Removing constraints to improved commodity chain performance.
      Enhancing functional capabilities of the parties engaged in agricultural product marketing
       chains for more efficient interaction with each other.
To achieve these objectives the following activities have been implemented under two key sub-
components:
      Enterprise Development;
      Market Development.

1.1.1. Enterprise Development Sub-component
The key goals and objectives of the "Enterprise Development" Sub-Component were to support to
agricultural processing enterprises by providing technical assistance to enhance competitiveness of
their products in domestic and external markets.
The expected outputs of the "Enterprise Development" Sub-Component included:
        Increased value added of domestic products of the food processing sector in selected
         enterprises-clients, in particular, the improved quality of decreased costs of products
         produced, the increased volume of sales, improvement management knowledge and skills of
         their staff;
        Enhancing capacity of the domestic market of advisory services.
Direct beneficiaries of the "Enterprise Development" Sub-Component were:
        44 enterprises of the agri-industrial sector;
        26 local consultants;
The "Enterprise Development" Sub-Component consisted of the two blocks:
        Technical assistance to processing enterprises;
        Capacity building for local consultants.

          Technical Assistance to Processing Enterprises
Technical assistance to processing enterprises included the development of detailed action plans with
activities aimed at improving production, finance management, marketing and adoption of international
quality standards. Technical assistance envisaged a mandatory agreement and involvement of enterprise
managers in enterprise reforms, as well as a mandatory contribution of the enterprise at a level
(initially) of at least 3% of the technical assistance cost. Later on the enterprises' contribution was
increased to 10%.
Implementation of activities under the technical assistance (TA) to processing enterprises was started in
early 2008. Initially four packages of TA have been envisaged. Due to the fact that the activities related
to enterprise development took considerable time, two TA packages have been implemented. In the
processing implementing the first TA package, it became clear, that it would be impossible to provide
assistance to enterprises within the timelines as envisaged by the TA package. Based on the request by
the client enterprises the TA was extended to complete all activities in full.
Profound changes in the country in the 90-s of the last century led to an acute deficit of qualified staff
for enterprises, especially that of technologists, which had a negative impact on the quality of produce;
under the new conditions enterprises had to procure raw materials and sell their products independently.
Lack of knowledge and experience in financial analysis and business plan development constrained
opportunities for growth of enterprises and attraction of investment. Therefore the TA was designed in
such a way as to provide a key support to enterprises in the form of advisory services and training and
was aimed at capacity building of enterprise leaders, managers and specialists.

                                                  69
In addition to direct support under the TA packages in the form of advisory services and training, the
beneficiaries have been also provided with other types of support. As the output of the TA should have
been an increased volume of production, sales, profit, the client enterprises have been supported
through study-tours, opportunities to share experiences, participation in exhibitions, round tables,
workshops. All this created opportunities for enterprises' growth.
Advisory services (as one of the areas of technical assistance to enterprises) have been provided in
several areas. Processing enterprises appreciated the most the advisory services in production
management, thus, confirming the experts' opinion that enterprises face a huge deficit of specialists-
technologists and marketing specialists.
On the whole, the technical assistance provided to the enterprises entailed some positive developments:
increased output and profits, growth in sales, assets, capital and the total amount of attracted
investments.
The following changes can be considered as a result of the Project's impact on client enterprises: the
increased number of workers at the enterprise, improved links with farmers supplying raw materials, a
growing number of business partners. The trends demonstrated by these developments emphasize the
importance of professional advisory services for enterprises.
This is proved by the fact that the benefits obtained by the enterprises as a result of business advisory
services provided under the project motivated enterprises to increase their share of co-financing to 10%
of the cost of provided services.
Besides, as a positive consequence of their participation in the project, the enterprises noted their
participation in exhibitions, procurement of new equipment, improved quality of raw materials supplied
to enterprises, and as a result - improved quality of their products.
It should be noted that the improved quality of products of the Subcomponent beneficiaries was related
to the improved quality of the external appearance (labeling and packing), adoption of food safety
standards, improved production processes. Without the Project this would be hardly possible as many
Kyrgyz enterprises are still in the development phase and can hardly survive in competition with
enterprises from more developed economies as capital investments in enterprise upgrading and human
capital are not affordable for many young companies.

        Capacity Development for Local Consultants and Staff of Client Enterprises of the ABCC
To provide technical assistance to enterprises the ABCC engaged local and international consultants.
The Database on local consultants (about 200 people) was established with the following areas of
specialization "agricultural product processing technology", "human resources management", "financial
management", " sales and marketing", "business management", "law", "quality standards".
One of the key achievements was introduction with the support of the ABCC of ISO 9001 Quality
Management System (QMS) and Food Safety System FSSC 22000 (ISO 22000 + PAS 220) at "Ak-
Bata" Ltd. which was started in 2008. This was the first experience in the post-Soviet space. The CJSC
"Shoro" continues adopting quality standards.
The key problem identified by many agricultural processing enterprises during TA implementation was
lack of qualified and technically competence personnel. This problem is especially challenging when
looking for technical and lab staff. In this connection, to enhance personnel capacity of the food
processing industry and effectively develop public infrastructure, the ABCC in cooperation with the
Kyrgyz State Technical University named after initiated a proposal to establish some training and
practice center to train and re-train specialists in the area of agricultural processing.
This center was decided to be established under the Sub-Component "Public Sector Investment", which
was aimed at identifying and taking adjustment measures to eliminate bottlenecks in relation to public
goods in the process of project implementation.

1.1.2. Market Development Sub-component
The «Market Development» Sub-component was implemented by an ABCC division – the Market
Development Service (MDS) and pursued the following objectives:
      Promoting products of agricultural producers to domestic and eternal markets;
      Developing the value chain of agricultural products and implementation of pilot projects for
       development of production and sales chains;

                                                   70
        Implementation of a program to provide support to farmers' cooperatives.
The «Market Development» Sub-component started to be implemented in 2006; its goal was to enhance
competitiveness of Kyrgyz agricultural produces and promote their products in domestic and
international markets by enhancing their export capacity.
These goals have been met by pursuing the following objectives:
        Providing advisory and information support to the agribusiness sector;
        Monitoring demand and supply of agricultural products in domestic and external markets;
        Development of value chain of agricultural products and implementation of pilot projects for
         development of production and sales chains. The participants included 6 cooperatives and 3
         self-help groups (126 farmers); implementation of the farmers' cooperatives support program,
         direct beneficiaries totaled 269 agricultural cooperatives;
        Review of administrative and other barriers impeding development of trade with agricultural
         products in domestic and foreign markets;
        Providing 'response' services on sales, marketing of clients' products in domestic and foreign
         markets and advisory and information support to the agri-business sector.
During 2006-2012 the MDS provided direct assistance to Kyrgyz agribusiness entrepreneurs
(cooperatives, farmers, agri-exporters and private entrepreneurs) in concluding 142 trade deals in the
volume of more than 54 thousand tons of fresh agricultural products for the total amount of US$17.45
million.
The MDS provided advisory and informational support to more than 1,971 agribusiness entities in the
following areas:
        Consultations on marketing and promotion of products;
        Legal support;
        Services in finding resources for procurement of raw materials and production assets.
With the support by the MDS local farmers and cooperatives were able to supply agricultural products
(potatoes, onions, carrots, cabbage, beans, bell peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, cherries, apricots,
peaches, Uzgen rice) to the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, Turkey, Moldova, Romania.

       Monitoring of Demand and Supply of Agricultural Products in Domestic and Foreign
       Markets
To achieve its objectives the MDS implemented the following work:
       Collection and analysis of data on supply and routes of commodity chains in the domestic
        market and when selling products of Kyrgyz agricultural producers in external markets;
       Monitoring of demand and supply in the market for certain types of products (meat and meat
        products, milk and dairy products, fruit and vegetables, grain and beans, fried fruit, etc.),
        changes in consumers' demand and problems of agricultural products import/export.
During 2006-2012 the MDS conducted 63 marketing studies.

       Farmers' Cooperative Support Program
The goals of the Farmers' Cooperative Support Program included:
      Joining efforts for development of a system of rural cooperatives;
      Improved economic activities in the area of production, processing and sales of agricultural
       products.
The Program objective was to enhance the capacity of cooperatives by:
      Providing continuous advisory and information support;
      Providing training;
      Organizing study tours to share experience;
      Support in participating in exhibitions and fairs;
      Organizing meetings with potential consumers;
      Supporting development of the value added chain.


                                                 71
To achieve the program objectives a series of trainings for farmers' cooperatives was conducted.
Training participants were members from the Union of Cooperatives of Kyrgyzstan (UCK) and
cooperatives – clients of the DGRV Project "Development of Raifaisen Cooperatives in Kyrgyzstan";
later all cooperatives operating in the agribusiness sector were invited to participate in trainings.
Training topics
         Effective management in cooperatives and records management.
         Marketing of agricultural products and business planning.
         Training for cooperatives' accountants.
         Financial management.

The trainings covered 269 representatives from farmers' cooperatives, of which 16 accountants were
trained in cooperatives' accounting, 50 managers – in financial management and effective negotiations,
as well as 250 managers – for participation in the grant program. The participation in the training
program was a mandatory condition to have access to the grant support program provided through the
CLMU. As a result of the training Effective Management of Cooperatives and Records Management,
60% of cooperatives developed business plans to obtain a loan, 30% of training participants developed
action plans for the next 1-3 years and 58 cooperatives out of those trained obtained loans. Following
the training Marketing of Agricultural Products, cooperatives concluded 28 contracts for supply of
agricultural products by training participants. A comparative analysis of the expected and achieved
results indicates that the number of trained cooperative members, the number of developed business
plans, the number of signed contracts exceeded the targets planned by the farmers' cooperatives support
program two and more times. On the whole the training program covered 3,015 members of
cooperatives.

1.1.4.   Lessons Learned and Recommendations
        The evaluation of the «Market Development» Component indicated that the expected outputs
         have been generally achieved, the Project beneficiaries have received substantial technical
         support, which enabled them to increase output, sales, enter new markets, conclude contracts
         and find partners.
        The evaluation of the Project outcomes and impact in relation to the «Market Development»
         component indicated that in future similar projects it would be advisable to link agricultural
         commodity producers with processing enterprises to achieve more tangible results.
        The approach to TA for enterprises developed under the Enterprise Development Complement
         shall be recommended for multiplication.
        The experience showed that enterprises are ready to pay for technical assistance, if it matches
         the enterprises needs.
        It is necessary to continue supporting the development of the training system to prepare
         qualified specialists, technologists, including through the TPC "Technologist".
        There is a need to support the development of leasing services for agri-processing enterprises.
        Development of the value chain requires active commitment and participation from
         suppliers/value chain. It is necessary to conduct targeted work with cooperative and farmers'
         groups to enlarge bundle together their farms, thus enabling to provide for required volumes
         and standards of agricultural products.
        There is a need to facilitate the process of organization of the value chain, to provide financial
         and technical support. There is a need for advisory support, training and assistance to value
         chain participants. This will required support from the donor community.
        When organizing the value chain, one can use the experience of Japan under the Project "One
         Village – One Product", which can help to ensure the necessary volume of produce and its
         standardization.
        To obtain a higher added value, they should try to export not raw products, but processed ones.
         When establishing the value chain, it is important to identify the leader of the value chain, who
         will become a driving force for development of the value chain and can take over some
         financial costs to promote a product along the supply chain, to contribute to sustainable
         supplies, etc.
        Sustainable agricultural market development requires functional information and marketing
         centers and electronic agricultural exchanges to trade commodities and processed agricultural
         products.
        To ensure sustainable development of cooperatives as independent economic entities, it is
         necessary to make cooperative principles a daily routine and a foundation for cooperatives'
         operations. This requires continuous training related to establishment and operations of
         cooperatives.
        Efforts should be targeted on enlargement of cooperatives and formation of their specialization
         by re-profiling their operations towards services. The establishment and development of
         secondary cooperatives will address the issue of cooperatives consolidation, while providing a


                                                   74
        basis for capacity building of cooperatives through the cooperative members. This process
        requires active advisory support.
       There is already a critical mass of cooperatives in the country. Therefore the issue is to provide
        regular training for the cooperatives community on the basis of training centers or higher
        educational institutions.

1.2. COMPONENT B: ACCESS TO CREDIT

The Component “Access to Credit? has been implemented by the Credit Line Management Unit
(CLMU) under the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic.
The key objective of the Component:
        An increased number and enhanced economic importance of commodity producers’
organizations.
To achieve the objectives under the Component “Access to Credit? the following three sub-components
have been implemented:
       Allocation of sub-loans to representatives from the agribusiness sector of the KR;
       Allocation of matching grants to cooperatives;
       Training for staff of participating financial institutions (PFIs);
The successful achievement of the objectives under the Component “Access to Loans? is characterized
by the following data:
       The actual timely repayment rate for sub-loans was 100% against targeted 95%;
       The actual number of loans allocated to agricultural producers, processing entities and
        agribusiness was 82 loans again the target of 50 loans;
       The actual number of PFIs was 5 as compared to the targeted minimum of 3 PFIs;
       The actual number of trained credit officers was 883 as compared to the targeted number of
        150 people.
The sub-component on grants has not been envisaged initially by the Project design. In 2011 a decision
was made to introduce the Cooperative Matching Grant Program (CMGP).
Especially important is that the received credits or grants have had a significant impact on business of
beneficiaries: growth in the production volume; increased profits; growth in sales; increased coverage
of the market as a result of the received credit (grant); growth in the number of signed contracts;
increased amounts of deals; introduction of new types of products.
A certain part of the Component beneficiaries were able to introduce new product quality standards.
The expected effect from the component “Access to Credits? were the following developments:
       Increased opportunities and willingness of commercial banks to provide loans to agricultural
        producers and processing entities;
       Increased investment in the agricultural sector.
As a result of implementation of the Project, in total US$16.6 million was attracted in the
agricultural sector (the total amount of sub-projects, including the Borrower’s contributions and co-
financing of PFIs), while the credit and grant line totaled US$5.9 million.

1.2.1 Training for PFIs Staff Sub-Component
Initially it was planned to conduct trainings in three areas: “Investment Lending and Leasing?;
“Structured Financing?; “Environmental Assessment of Projects?. Trainings have been conducted in
Bishkek, Osh and Cholpon-Ata cities.
Competitively selected international consulting company RIAS (Rabobank, the Netherlands) and a
group of local consultants were engaged to provide investment lending training to banks. The Training
Guidelines has been developed, on which the training has been conducted. After the contract with the
RIAS has been completed, the training has been conducted by local consultants, who acquired all
required skills when working with the RIAS based on “trainer-to-trainer? principle. Local consultants

                                                75
have also provided practical support to loan officers directly in banks in various regions both on
investment lending and on structured financing. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) Project
has been engaged to provide leasing training. Later on both programs have been combined. In total the
Investment Lending and Leasing training covered 380 people. In the process of investment lending
training wider knowledge on credit products in international practice was introduced to bank staff. For
example, currently the OJSC “Aiyl Bank? widely uses investment lending and leasing methods thanks
to the acquired knowledge, as a special division on leasing has been established.

        “Structured Financing? Training
As for structured financing the contract was signed with an international company - Trade Risk
Consulting (Singapore) and two local consultants. The international consultants drafted The Training
Guidelines. After the contract with the international company Trade Risk Consulting was completed,
local consultants continued conducting the training. In total 337 people have been trained. Thanks to
the conducted workshops, one of PFIs developed and adopted a new credit product. This training has
been a strong impetus for growth in the clients’ base. Besides, the acquired knowledge provided a
vision of conducting a more flexible policy in relation to customers.

         “Environmental Assessment? Training
Under the Project a leading expert on environmental assessment in Kyrgyzstan E. J. Shukurov
conducted training workshops “Environmental Assessments?, who drafted the reference materials and
the Training Guidelines, besides, environmental workshops were conducted by expert Kutmanova D.
A. Thanks to the acquired knowledge PFIs staff are capable to conduct project environmental
assessments and a comprehensive analysis (due diligence) of a sub-project independently. 166 people
have been trained on these topics.
According to the PFIs staff, who attended the training, the majority of them consider the ideas and
contents of the trainings as clear and comprehensible; they were able to obtain new knowledge and
skills, which are very valuable for the work with borrowers. Also PFIs officers noted a very practical
nature of the training, which resulted in acquiring practical work skills. PFIs staff capacity building has
also produced an indirect impact on knowledge dissemination in the banking sector, taking into account
human resources turnover. The acquired knowledge also enables PFIs to participate in other donor-
supported lines.

1.2.2. Sub-Loans to Agribusinesses Sub-Component
The Project Appraisal Document envisaged that this Sub-Component would provide access to the funds
for investment lending and structured financing. Investment loans have been allocated as planned. The
second type of funds have been planned to have two products: (i) financing of working capital for
processing enterprises, including warehouse management and commodity insurance, (ii) loans for
seasonal working capital for advance payments under contract-based farming. The only discrepancy in
practice as compared to the project implementation schedule was that such a product as lending secured
by inventory (commodities in the warehouse) has not been used due to lack of legal frameworks in
Kyrgyzstan for this. Thus, such products as investment loans, loans for seasonal working capital and
contract-based farming have been implemented successfully.
Sub-loans have been allocated through the following PFIs: OJSC «Aiyl Bank»; OJSC «Commercial
Bank Kyrgyzstan»; CJSC «BTA Bank»; CJSC “KICB?; CJSC MFC “Bai-Tushum and Partners?;
The main credit line has financed 82 sub-loans for the total amount of US$ 5.1 million. The average
size of a sub-loan was: US$62,100, while the average sub-loan maturity was 3.5 years or 42 months.
For comparison: the average weighted loan maturity in the banking sector in 2011, according to the
NBKR, was equal to 27.6 months. It should be noted that the sub-loan repayment rate was 100%.
The project has had a positive effect on beneficiaries of the Component, which is demonstrated by the
following actual findings of the borrowers’ business review. It indicated that 61% borrowers increased
their output volumes; they had an opportunity to increase profits and sell more products, cover a large
market share.



                                                   76
1.2.3. Farmer Cooperative Matching Grant Sub-Component
In June of 2011 the Ministry of Finance of the KR initiated a draft Law of the KR “On Amendments to
the Agreement on Development Loan between the Kyrgyz Republic and the International Development
Association on the Agribusiness and Marketing Project?. During WB missions representatives from
ministries and agencies of the KR and the WB noted the need to amend the project objectives and
design. The key goal of the changes – to introduce the Farmer Cooperative Matching Grant Program
and reallocate the Project funds (in the amount of US$800 thousand) from the Market Development
Component (Export Support Sub-Component) to the Access to Credit Component to launch the
Matching Grant Program. The rational was that in recent time one could observe an upward trend in
development of cooperatives as an individual market economy institute and that when extending sub-
loans to agricultural processing entities, a pressing need for soft financing for agricultural cooperatives
was identified. The matching grant arrangement was financed by transferring a part of undisbursed
funds and co-financing investments in warehouse facilities, agricultural machinery and processing
equipment.
The participating financing institutions under the PPGC were: OJSC «Aiyl Bank»; CJSC MFC “Bai-
Tushum and Partners?; OJSC “CB Kyrgyzstan?.
Matching grants were extended as co-financing for sub-loans and/or leasing loans invested in
production assets (agricultural machinery and equipment, primary processing equipment, warehouses).
Matching grants amounted to 30% of the total amount of sub-loans and leasing loans approved by PFIs.
Should a beneficiary fail to comply with the conditions specified in a sub-loan or a leasing loan
agreement, the beneficiary was obliged to return the total amount of the matching grant. The maximum
grant amount was US$50 thousand per beneficiary.

1.2.4. Lessons Learned and Recommendations
      The Component’s goals have been achieved successfully. As a result the number of loans was
       exceeded 1.6 times compared to the plan, thus a larger number of agribusiness representatives
       had access to financial resources. The actual number of PFIs staff trained is 5.6 more than the
       target indicator, as a result the banks’ capacity was enhanced significantly. Thus, the number of
       participating financial institutions has increased almost 2 times, thus creating more
       opportunities for the agricultural sector to have access to financing and create a competitive
       environment in this financial market segment.
      The positive experience of PPGC implementation shall be extended to future projects, as it
       enabled cooperatives to achieve a qualitatively new level thanks to the 30% grant financing,
       thus encouraging beneficiaries to observe financial discipline and targeted use of funds, while
       providing soft resources.
      While implementing the credit line, the PFIs noted the floating interest rate for the credit line as
       a deficiency. However, using fixed rate in future similar projects may pose a risk to the KR
       Government, as in case of a decreased inflation rate the foreign exchange risks will be a burden
       on the country's budget.
      The PFIs also noted complicated tendering procedures. However, it is recommended not to
       depart from requirements to bidders to present a full package of documents to increase
       transparency in the business environment in Kyrgyzstan. Nonetheless, if it is possible to
       simplify the procedures without jeopardizing transparency, future similar projects will only gain
       from it.
      Some of the planned risk mitigation arrangements for agricultural lending, such as the use of
       warehouse pledges, have not been used to the lack of legal frameworks. In this connection, for
       future projects with similar goals it will be advisable to plan drafting or improvement of legal
       regulation of financial services, which can promote the development of the agrarian sector of
       Kyrgyzstan.

1.3. COMPONENT С: MARKET CONDITIONS ANALYSIS UNIT

The Component "Market Conditions Analysis Unit" (MCAU) was implemented by a unit with the same
name established under the Ministry of Agriculture and Melioration of the KR.
The key goals and objectives of the Component are:
I.       Play the role of a connecting link between the Ministry of Economy of the Kyrgyz Republic and
         the Ministry of Agriculture and Melioration of the Kyrgyz Republic in the area of project
         activities;
II.      Participate in implementation of the sub-component on public sector capacity building based
         on the decisions of the Steering Council of the ABCC;
III.     Perform the role of a connecting link between the Ministry of Agriculture and Melioration of
         the Kyrgyz Republic and the CLMU on project monitoring data reflected in the Financial
         Monitoring Reports (FMRs).
In addition to the above mentioned functions, the MCAU specialists performed the following tasks:
        Regular monitoring of wholesale and retail prices for 33 types of agricultural products – both
         raw materials and processed products in all markets of Bishkek and Osh cities. The findings of
         such monitoring and the review were also prepared in the form of analytical notes, which were
         sent to the MoAM, MoE, ABCC and posted in the ABCC web-site.
        Regular monitoring of wholesale and retail prices for agricultural products (raw materials and
         processed      products)      in    the      markets    of     Central     Asian    countries.
         The findings of such monitoring and the review were also prepared in the form of analytical
         notes, which were sent to the MoAM, MoE, ABCC and posted in the ABCC web-site.
        As instructed by the MoAM and the MoE, preparation of analytical notes on one or other areas
         of the country's agrarian sector development.

1.3.1.   Lessons Learned and Recommendations
        The evaluation of the "Market Conditions Analysis Unit" Component indicated that the
         expected outputs have been mainly achieved, the beneficiaries of this Project component (the
         MoAM, MoE, etc.) have obtained a significant support enabling them to use the received data
         when developing national documents.
        The evaluation of the outcomes and impacts of the Project under the "Market Conditions
         Analysis Unit" Component showed that in future it is advisable for similar projects to
         implement similar components aimed at informational and analytical support to all government
         agencies involved in the process of development of the agrarian sector of Kyrgyz economy.

Dear partners,

CJSC Microfinance Bank “Bai-Tushum and Partners? has been collaborating with the
Department managing the credit line for the “Agribusiness & Marketing Project? (AMP) from
2011 till 2012. Within the framework of the project between the Bank and the Ministry of
Finance, a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with a grant component was entered into, providing for
financing of agricultural producers and co-operative farms.

Within the term of the agreement, eight co-operative farms received financing in the amount of
18.9 million Som under the AMP project. Two of the eight co-operative farms received
financing from the parent company MCA Finance Fund “Bai Tushum?. Through this leasing
program, agricultural co-operative farms were able to purchase agricultural equipment: new
harvester threshers; tractors; detachable equipment and breeding stock.

It should be also mentioned that in addition to providing project financing, the AMP project
offered training to the Bank staff on investment and structural financing, environmental
assessment of projects. That expanded the knowledge of staff on agricultural projects
financing. We are confident that the acquired knowledge will be applied in the future while
assessing other Bank projects upon the completion of the AMP implementation.

Taking the above mentioned into consideration, CJSC Microfinance Bank “Bai-Tushum and
Partners? expresses gratitude to the “Agribusiness & Marketing Project? for effective
collaboration and does not have any suggestions or comments on the Implementation
Completion and Results Report of the AMP project.
