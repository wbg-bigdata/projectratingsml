MATERNAL HEALTH AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                    Republic of Paraguay
Implementing Agency:         Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (MSPBS)
Poverty:                     Program of Targeted Interventions. The operation targets the poor
by providing primary health care and by serving areas of the country
in which the incidence of poverty is high.
Amount:                      US$21.8 million equivalent.
Terms:                       One loan for US$10.9 million on Currency Pool Loan (CPL) terms
and the other for US$10.9 milllion on fixed-rate US-Dollar-based
Single Currency Loan (SCL) terms. Both loans would be disbursed
at equal rates over the expected disbursement period of six years.
The SCL would be repayable in 15 years; each semester's aggregate
disbursements (Disbursed Amount) would have a grace period of
three years and a final maturity of nine years from the rate fixing date
of that Disbursed Amount. The CPL would have a grace period of
five years, a final maturity of 17 years and level repayment of
principal.
Commitment Fee:              0.75% on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days after signing,
less any waiver.
Financing Plan:              See para. 7.6.
Net Present Value:           Not applicable
Financial Benefits           The Borrower has selected both a US-Dollar SCL and a CPL in
and Risks:                   order to improve the management of its external liabilities and reduce
risks. The combination of Dollar-based SCL and CPL terms reduces
the risk from the non-US-Dollar components of the CPL. The
choice of having the bulk of financing in US Dollars reflects the
importance of US-Dollar based contracts in Paraguay's international
trade and Treasury receipts. The Government has selected a fixed-
rate SCL to ensure stability of debt-service payments.

1. BACKGROUND
A. RECENT ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
1.1   Background. Emerging from 35 years of dictatorship, Paraguay has undergone
numerous political and economic changes in its transition to democracy. While the legacy
of close to four decades of dictatorial rule is still visible, Paraguay has made important
strides in its quest to become a modern, democratic state. Despite poor macroeconomic
management in the 1 980s, extreme poverty continues to be lower than in many countries
with higher per capita incomes, because income distribution is more equitable than the
average for Latin America. Moreover, the new Government has made substantial
improvements in macroeconomic management, reducing inflation and public external debt,
and increasing foreign reserves. However, despite these improvements, the average
annual growth recorded for the 1992-1995 was less than 3.0 percent, the same as the rate
of population growth. Stagnating and sometimes declining per capita income threatens
the economic well-being attained thus far, and is already resulting in reduced access for
social services to the poor, especially in rural areas. A strengthening of health services to
underserved populations is central to improving welfare, ensuring more productive and
healthy lives and reduced population growth.
1.2   Economic Policy. The Government of Paraguay seeks to create an environment
for sustained private sector-led growth. To improve the climate for long-term investment
the Government seeks to strengthen financial intermediation, restructure and privatize
public sector enterprises, improve transportation infrastructure, and modernize the legal
and institutional environment. For the public sector, this means divesting itself of
responsibilities more appropriate for the private sector, containing the expansion of public
sector expenditures, and improving the management capacity of its institutions in areas
where it is to play a supportive role, such as agricultural services, infrastructure and
human resource development, enabling Paraguay to remain competitive in MERCOSUR
and the broader external economy. In human resource development and agriculture, it
seeks to strengthen service delivery capability, leading to improvements in the quantity and
quality of services provided.
1.3   Some steps have been taken along these lines, not all of them with the intended
consequences. To reduce the public deficit and improve efficiency, the Government is
promoting the privatization of some public sector enterprises, where appropriate. It is
also taking the necessary steps to decentralize some public services, namely health and
education, to the municipalities and departments. And, it has increased social spending.
1.4   The decentralization of government services began in 1989 with the transfer of
political power to municipal governments. Although prior to that time municipal
governments and councils were elected, mayors were appointed by the central
government. Since 1991, mayors have become elected officials. The 1992 Constitution
(Article 168) broadens municipal responsibilities to include urban planning, environment,
markets, tourism, health, police, traffic management and the supervision of public



2
transportation. To enable them to fulfill their new role, Article 169 transfers the property
tax previously collected by the central govemment to the municipalities. Municipalities
are allowed to retain 70 percent of revenues which altogether amount to less than 5
percent of the central Government budget. There are no transfers from higher
governmental levels to municipalities. Departments receive 15 percent of the property tax
collected by municipalities, a 15-percent share of the value-added tax from the central
Government, and a 30-percent share of gambling income. Departmental revenues amount
to less than one percent of the central Govemment budget. Thus, the amount of resources
transferred has been minimal. Because the operational arrangements to implement the
new legal framework have not been specified, the assignment of responsibilities across the
three levels of government is unclear, leading to a lack of accountability, duplication of
some functions and absence of others. The assignment of responsibilities across the three
levels of govemment has not been specified, leading to a lack of accountability,
duplication of some functions and absence of others. Moreover, municipalities and
departments lack the capability to manage their new responsibilities.
1.5    The Government has also increased expenditures in the social sectors. Although
social spending has been historically low in Paraguay, the Government increased public
health expenditures from 1.0 to 2.5 percent of GDP from 1989 to 1994. However, most
of the increase was absorbed by an increase in public wages and to a lesser extent on
capital expenditures. Both of these increased at the expense of materials and supplies.
Thus, increased spending did not lead to needed improvements in quantity and quality of
services provided.
B. POVERTY AND SOCIAL EXPENDITURES
1.6   Paraguay has low levels of poverty relative to other countries in the region. The
highest poverty levels are found in the northeastem departments, and some of the
peripheral areas surrounding Asunci6n (see Table 1). These include the most rural
departments and represent some of the areas where the Government has invested the least
in basic services. Due to years of underinvestment in such services, only one-fifth of all
rural dwellings have running water, and 16 percent have sanitation. Paved roads are
scarce and less than forty percent of households have electricity. Health resources are also
more scarce in the North. These departments contain most of Paraguay's indigenous
population and many of the new settlements of rural migrants.
1.7   Social Policy. The Constitution assigns the Govemment the responsibility for the
provision of social services to lower income groups. In the case of education, the
Constitution specifies the proportion of the budget to be earmarked for education. It does
not do so for health. But the Govemment's commitment to strengthen health services is
evident from the numerous health projects currently under preparation and implementation
with the financial assistance of KMl, JICA, UNFPA, USAID, the Spanish Government,
the IDB and the Bank (Asunci6n Sewerage Project, Ln. 3842-PA; and Third Water
Supply Project Ln, 3519-PA).

income, and the DHS indicator is based on an index of unsatisfied basic needs.
Source: World Bank Report No. 12293-PA and Special Tabulations.
1 .8    Despite the fact that poverty is concentrated in specific geographical areas, and can
therefore be easily targeted, few social programs target the poor, and those that do are
generally limited in scope. Existing social programs tend to be poorly managed and rarely
employ systematic targeting mechanisms. In the case of health care, resources are
concentrated in urban areas, primarily Asunci6n, where a small proportion of Paraguay's
poor are located', and program priorities have been on curative, hospital-based care.
Some efforts are being made to reverse this historical bias by increasing the coverage of
preventive care and giving a greater role to secondary and primary levels of care. The
proposed project would reverse this bias in six of the poorest departments.
2. OVERVIEW OF THE HEALTH SECTOR
A. HEALTH STATUS
2.1     Overall Health Profile. Paraguay's cause of death structure characterizes it as
being in a mid-epidemiological transition stage, with both infectious diseases and
chronic/degenerative diseases among the top five killers. Despite the low overall
investment in health, Paraguayans have a relatively favorable health profile. Life
expectancy at birth is equal to the regional average and infant mortality is slightly lower
than the regional average. Nutritional status is one of the best in the region (see Annex 1,
Table 1). The major exceptions to this benign pattem are Paraguay's high maternal and
Poverty estimates between the two surveys are not comparable. The IES survey employs income to
measure poverty, and the ENDS employs a basic needs scale. Although the former is a more
appropriate measure of poverty the survey only covers urban areas.

perinatal mortality rates. Paraguay's maternal mortality is surpassed only by that of Bolivia.
National health indices do mask some important regional variations. In the northem and
eastern departments, where investment in social services has been historically deficient, official
matemal mortality rates are as much as six times higher than in Asunci6n. Variations in infant
and child mortality are similar, with rates being two to three times higher in departments such
as Alto Parana, Alto Paraguay and Amambay than in Asunci6n (see Annex 1, Tables 2A and
2B).
2.2    Maternal Health. Ministry of Health statistics for 1991 report a maternal
mortality rate of 152 per 100,000 births. Ministry figures, however, provide only a partial
view of the problem as many cases are not reported because they occur in small private
clinics or simply because women never reach a health provider. Underreporting is greater
when maternal mortality is the result of an induced illegal abortion. Adjusting for
underregistration, studies have estimated maternal mortality to be as high as 386 per
100,000 births. The main causes of death are abortion (28 percent of all maternal deaths),
followed by toxemia (21 percent), hemorrhage (16 percent) and sepsis (11 percent).2
2.3    The high maternal mortality and morbidity rates are a direct result of insufficient
and poor quality prenatal and delivery care, and family planning services. Poorly
performed deliveries also account for an important share of infant deaths as birth lesions
are by far the main cause of death of children under one year of age. Only two-thirds of
all Paraguayan births are delivered by professional medical staff (physicians and nurse-
midwives). Close to half of all births are home births. Only countries with sizeable
indigenous populations such as Bolivia, Peruz and Guatemala have lower coverage.
Moreover, the coverage of institutional births has not improved in the last decade.3 In the
northem departments, the focus of this project, coverage of professionally attended
deliveries was only 42 percent in 1990, and close to three-quarters of deliveries were
home births. The poor and rural population rely heavily on the services of midwives.
Considering that access to safe water is minimal in poor rural households, home births are
likely to be more risky. Coverage of prenatal care by professional staff is also lower in the
North, where only 67 percent received prenatal care by trained personnel compared with
84 percent nationally (see Table 2).

Materna y Perinatal, MSPBS and PAHO, 1994.
3 A comparison of survey data from 1979 and 1990 showed no improvement in the coverage of
professionally attended births in the ten-year period. (1990 survey results come from the ENDS.
The survey classifies the Paraguayan territory into four regions as follows: Asunci6n includes the
Greater Metropolitan Area of Asunci6n, i.e., part of the Central Department; North includes
Concepci6n, San Pedro and Amambay; Center-South includes Cordillera, Guaira, Caazapa,
Misiones, Paraguari, Neembucui and the remainder of Central; and East includes Alto Parana,
Caaguazui, Itapiia and Canindeyu6.

2.4    Inadequate access to modern4 contraceptive services and information accounts for
the high proportion of women of high reproductive risk (women bearing children when
they are too young, too old, of high parity or within short birth intervals) and a high level
of unwanted fertility (as evidenced by the high number of induced abortions). One-third of
women giving birth in Paraguay can be classified as being of high reproductive risk.
Complications during pregnancy and delivery are more common among women in the
high risk category. Fertility is high, at 4.7 births per woman and is highest in northern
Paraguay at 6.7 births per woman. Fertility increases with poverty, with the poor having
as many as two more children than the average woman. Adolescent fertility is also high,
with 17 percent of women under 20 years of age having had at least one birth. In the
North, one-quarter of all girls under 20 have had at least one birth. Births are also closely
spaced, particularly among younger women. Two-thirds of all adolescent mothers (aged
15-19) and one quarter of mothers aged 20-29 had birth intervals that fell short of the
recommended minimum of 24 months. In the Northern departments, as many as 42
percent of women's most recent birth followed a birth interval of less than 24 months (see
Table 3).
2.5    Use of contraception' varies by region and age, with only 24 percent of women
using modern contraception in northern departments compared with 35 percent for
Paraguay as a whole. Among women under 20 years of age, only 5 percent use
contraception. Given that 35 percent of women report having had sexual relations by age
18, contraceptive use among women in this age group is low. Inadequate access to
contraception results in high rates of unwanted pregnancies and births. Unwanted
4 Modern contraception includes any of the following methods: hormonal methods (orals, injections, or
implants), intra-uterine devices, male and female sterilization, and barrier methods (condoms,
foams, diaphragms, etc.).
5The use of modern contraception has almost doubled since 1979, contributing to a reported 60 percent
decline in maternal mortality in the last 15 years. However, it has had a limited effect on fertility
rates because it has partially replaced abortion as a means of fertility regulation. The other reason
for the limited impact on fertility is that increases in contraceptive use have been greatest among
women aged 30-39 who have likely already had the children they want.



6
pregnancies often result in induced abortions. Given that abortion is illegal, many are
performed in unsanitary and unsafe conditions. Thus, complications are common, leading
to high maternal morbidity and mortality rates.

2.6    Infant and Child Health. Infant and child mortality have declined by one-third
in the last 15 years, and are at the same level as the average for Latin America. However,
there are some important regional disparities. According to survey data from 1990,
Asuncion was estimated to have an infant mortality of 28 per 1000 live births. In the
northern and eastern regions of the country, rates were above 40 per 1000. Census
figures for  1992 estimate rates of 37 per 1000 in Asuncion and over 45 per 1000 for most
of the North.6
2.7    The main causes of infant deaths, i.e., birth lesions, tetanus and infections of the
newborn, can all be easily prevented with adequate prenatal and delivery care. These
causes account for one-third of all infant deaths (MSPBS, 1992). Infant mortality among
children born to mothers who received neither prenatal nor delivery care was 48 per 1000
live births, compared with 26 for children of women who received both (ENDS, 1991).
Among  children under 5 years of age, one quarter of all deaths are due to acute
respiratory infections (ARI) and diarrhea, both preventable with adequate treatment,
improved nutrition, adequate breastfeeding and weaning practices, access to safe water
and health education.
2.8     Nutritional statu is far abovte  t average for the region. In 1990, seven percent
of births in Paraguay were underweight, and only five percent of Paraguayan children
under five years of age are underweight for age.7 Both of these indices are among the
lowest in the region. Seventeen percent of all children under five showed signs of chronic
malnutrition (height-for-age). This figure is also low, compared with other countries in
Alto Paraguay is twice as high, with 92 infant deaths per 1000 live births.
Children scoring two standard deviations below the mean were considered undernourished. U.S.
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) standards were employed.

the region. In the North, one quarter of all children under five are chronically
malnourished. Malnutrition tends to increase during the weaning period. In general,
malnutrition resulting from inadequate weaning practices has a greater effect on the health
of poor children, particularly in Asunci6n, where more than one-quarter of all infants in
very poor households are undernourished. Iodine deficiency, which affects all ages, is also
an important health concern.
2.9    Child Development. Poverty increases the probability that a child will be
undemourished and unhealthy. It also increases the likelihood of stunted mental development.
The most rapid mental growth occurs during infancy and early childhood. Inadequate
intellectual stimulation and affective care combined with malnutrition are likely to result in
irreversible damage to a child's physical and mental development.8 Early child stimulation
programs targeting infants and toddlers and pre-school programs can improve school
readiness skills. Other benefits include: the lowering of primary school enrollment ages,
reduction of repetition and dropout rates, and improvement in academic performance.
Parental involvement in programs also appears to strengthen the positive impact of early
childhood interventions.
2.10  Pre-schools are scarce in Paraguay. Less than four percent of children six years of
age and under are enrolled in pre-school. Other options for children are childcare centers
("guarderias" and "jardines infantiles"), the majority of which are privately owned and
managed. The only pre-school program targeting low-income children is the Mita i Roga
Program, established by the Ministry of Education and UNICEF in 1984. However, the
program has been seriously weakened due to lack of funding which has severely restricted
the training and supervision of its largely volunteer staff. Today, its coverage is
insignificant. The Social Welfare Directorate (DGBS) of the MSPBS also targets low-
income groups through its small network of community child care centers. However,
child care centers provide no educational inputs for the children. Only seven of them have
been specifically organized as child development centers where some early stimulation and
food supplementation is provided. Originally, the DGBS covered all installation and
operating costs. In the past two years, the DGBS has been developing a strategy to get
communities to cover operating costs and some installation costs.
2.11   Given the increasing participation of mothers in the labor force, demand for child
care options has increased in recent years, particularly in urban areas. Twenty percent of
all women are in the formal labor force. The proportion of women employed in the
informal sector is also likely to be sizable, particularly among the poor. Since poor
mothers have less purchasing power to obtain either child care or pre-school education for
their children, access to child development centers would improve children's welfare
directly through early stimulation programs, and indirectly by allowing the mother to work
and be able to better contribute to her children's education.

B. STRUCTURE OF THE HEALTH SECTOR
2.12   Sector Organization and Coverage. Health care in Paraguay is provided by the
Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (Ministerio de Salud Publica y Bienestar
Social, MSPBS), the Institute of Social Security (Instituto de Previsi6n Social, IPS), the
Police Health Service (Sanidad Policial, SP), the Armed Forces Health Service (Sanidad
Militar, SM), and through the four University teaching hospitals, two of them belonging to
the University of Asunci6n (Hospital de Clinicas (HC) and the Neuropsychiatric Hospital)
and two affiliated with the Catholic University. The MSPBS provides both curative and
preventive care,9 with an emphasis on the former. The rest of the public sector provides
only curative care. The HC is a highly specialized tertiary care facility which accepts
referrals from all institutions. Private health care is provided by hospitals, clinics, and
laboratories, some of which function through various private insurance systems, and by
various NGOs with limited coverage. The Mennonites also provide some hospital and
clinic care, and the Pastoral Social (formerly Caritas) provides some primary health care
at the community level. NGOs and the Pastoral Social provide primarily preventive care.
In addition, care is provided informally by pharmacies, midwives and traditional healers.
2.13   The MSPBS is responsible for the health needs of the Paraguayan population,
focusing its efforts on those not covered by other institutions, namely low income
households. In theory, MSPBS covers 60 percent of the population, [PS another 14
percent, SM 8 percent, HC 5 percent, SP another 1 percent and the private sector covers
the rest (about 12 percent). Actual utilization of services varies by type of care sought.
However, overall, about 30 to 45 percent of the population utilize MSPBS services. In
rural areas, utilization is about 50 percent. Low income groups, the focus of MSPBS
activities, rely on MSPBS and the HC primarily for more serious, expensive health
problems. They resort to pharmacies and traditional healers for minor ailments. In
Asunci6n, low income households are more likely to seek private services for minor
ailments. They also rely on services provided by religious institutions. The IPS covers all
salaried employees and their families, the SM all military employees and their families, and
the SP covers police employees and their dependents. As many as 40 percent of the
population covered by the IPS does not routinely utilize IPS services. The private sector
(excluding pharmacies) provides services to 30 to 40 percent of the population, and close
to half of the population in Asunci6n. Pharmacies play an important role in the delivery of
care, particularly in rural areas. Seven percent of the population relies on them. 10
2.14   Through DGBS, MSPBS provides childcare services to low income families
through a network of nurseries and child care centers installed in community facilities or
family homes. It also provides lodging for street children and other children at risk, day

infectious diseases, vector-borne diseases, and for providing water and sanitation to rural areas and urban areas
under 5000 inhabitants.

care centers for senior citizens, and counseling for battered women. In many of these
programs costs are shared with the community or other organizations. The coverage of
these programs is very limited.1"
2.15   Health Care Finance. Health care is financed with resources stemming from six
main sources: tax revenues from both central and municipal levels, social security payroll
taxes (including both employer and employee contributions), private insurance premium
payments, direct out-of-pocket contributions, foreign loans and donations (including from
UNFPA, UNICEF, USAID, Pastoral Social, and others). MSPBS financing comes from
tax revenues (55 percent), royalties from the Itaipu dam (23 percent), user fees (7 percent),
and in the case of SENEPA, from the 1.5 percent employer contribution to the IPS
(7 percent). "Other" sources, including foreign grants, account for 8 percent.
2.16   Public investment in health is limited in Paraguay. Including social security health
services, the Government of Paraguay spent less than 2.5 percent of GDP on health in
1994, compared with 2.1 percent in 1992. 12 MSPBS expenditures represented only one
percent of GDP. Public health accounts for 5.3 percent of total government spending.
The IPS absorbs one third of all public health expenditures and the MSPBS absorbs over
half (57 percent). The HC alone spends 5 percent of the allocated budget. Data on the
extent of private financing are lacking, but it is estimated to be higher than public funding.
Estimates of private expenditures suggest they represent at least 2.7 percent of GDP,
bringing total health expenditures in Paraguay to between 5 and 6 percent of GDP.
2.17   Although public spending for health was low in the early eighties due to the
recession, the trend reversed with the change of government in 1990. Between 1990 and
1992, central government spending for health more than doubled as a percentage of
nominal GDP, due primarily to salary increases unrelated to greater productivity. MSPBS
spending increased from 0.4 percent of GDP to 1.0 percent. It is estimated that about 80
percent of the MSPBS' recurrent costs cover salaries. Because of the dearth of medical
materials and supplies at the primary levels of care, salaries comprise 85 percent of
expenditures. Pharmaceuticals and supplies account for less than 10 percent. At the
tertiary level of care, where resources are concentrated, salaries account for 68 percent of
expenditures and pharmaceuticals and supplies account for 21 percent. The budget for the
DGBS represents 1.8 percent of the MSPBS' total budget.
At present only one center for the aged, seven child development centers, eight nurseries and six
Tazones de Leche ("glass of milk" supplementation centers) are in operation. Each center covers an
average of 35 children.
12 Budget execution averaged about 80 percent between 1992 and 1994. Most data on public
expenditures are based on budgeted rather than actual expenditures.

3. KEY SECTOR ISSUES
3.1    Public health care in Paraguay has been characterized by an inadequate allocation
of resources and a weak and technically inefficient delivery system. Both translate into an
inequitable coverage of services to the detriment of more remote and poor populations,
and to generally low quality services. The limited emphasis on prevention has led to a
concentration of resources away from some of the more cost-effective interventions.
Weak management and limited policy analysis and formulation capability, both at central
and more peripheral levels (Departments and Municipalities), are likely to restrain even
further the opportune and efficient delivery of services.
3.2    The main weaknesses of the Paraguayan health system can be grouped into three
closely linked issues: equity, quality and efficiency.
A. EQUITY
3.3    Lack of Access to Health Resources. Health infrastructure and resources are
unevenly distributed. Tertiary care is concentrated in and around Asunci6n'3 and other
urban areas. Seventy percent of tertiary care facilities are located in Asunci6n and the
surrounding areas, and only 4 percent in the northern and eastern departments which
contain 30 percent of the population. Secondary and primary care facilities are more
evenly distributed. However, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and equipment are
often scarce at lower levels of care. Thus, the rural population has limited access to
tertiary health care, and access only to resource-poor facilities at the secondary and
primary levels. Obstetric complications, an important cause of maternal morbidity and
mortality, cannot be appropriately cared for in rural facilities, and due to staff shortages,
also fail to be resolved in many secondary level facilities.
3.4    The lack of basic infrastructure and limited purchasing power of the population has
also discouraged private providers from establishing services in many areas. Although
both the IPS and SM have health centers outside Asunci6n, they are fewer in number, and
only accept individuals covered by social security (in the case of IPS) and members of the
military (in the case of SM). Outside Asunci6n, the only providers serving the poor are
the MSPBS, traditional community providers (midwives and healers), and religious
organizations such as Pastoral Social and the Mennonites. Moreover, given the emphasis
on curative care, available services have only a limited capacity to improve reproductive
and child health.
3.5    Even when facilities are available, their location is not always appropriate, making
it difficult for a system of referrals and distribution of supplies to work properly. Roads
are often unpaved and impassable during the rainy season, and river transportation is slow
13 Three of the most highly specialized hospitals (Hospital Nacional, Hospital del Quemado, and
Hospital de Cancer) are located in Central Department, a few miles from the center of Asunci6n).



11
and infrequent. The poor and inefficient communications system aggravates the problem
even further. Posts and centers lack radios and telephones. Regional hospitals possess
only one or two telephone lines. Staff in health posts have bicycles or motorcycles, but
often work alone and cannot leave the post. Thus, access to some remote populations can
be severely restricted.
3.6    Given existing infrastructure maldistribution and deficiencies, poor
communications and lack of amenities, health personnel have few incentives to work in
resource-poor regions. Precise figures regarding the distribution of health personnel are
difficult to obtain because many hold more than one post, and can be registered as working in
one department when they in fact work in another (usually Asunci6n). Available figures
indicate that most physicians, including the medical staff of the MSPBS, are located in
Asunci6n and Central, as are licensed nurses and auxiliary nurses. The northern departments
have the largest deficit of health personnel.
3.7    Unequal Distribution of the Burden of Disease. The unequal access to health
resources has contributed to higher morbidity and mortality in the more remote
departments and rural areas in general, than in Asunci6n and its environs. Infant mortality
rates are three times higher in Alto Paraguay than in Asunci6n. The same is true for
maternal mortality.
B. QUALITY
3.8    The deficient quality of care is reflected in low occupancy and utilization rates.
Many of the elements that determine quality of services need to be strengthened in
Paraguay. Among the more important dimensions of quality are: technical competence,
client/provider relations, timely availability of inputs (human resources, pharmaceuticals,
and supplies) and adequate service infrastructure. Quality deteriorates with the level of
care. Primary care lacks the most inputs. Posts lack the needed pharmaceuticals, are
inadequately staffed, and equipment is often lacking or malfunctioning. The limited
capability of the lower levels of care to resolve many of the cases they receive has broken
down the referral system and has forced patients to go directly to the regional hospitals or
to Asunci6n.
3.9    Weak Service Delivery Infrastructure. Health infrastructure, even in the case of
some recently constructed facilities, is in an advanced state of deterioration. Some
infrastructure is very old and outdated. In other cases, including recent construction, the
building materials employed have been of substandard quality, leading to rapid decay.
However, the most important reason for the deteriorated state of infrastructure has to do
with a lack of maintenance of existing facilities. Health facilities are given a very small
budget for maintenance, and the needed funds are partially covered by a sometimes
unstable source, i.e., royalties from the Itaipu hydroelectric dam. Construction, even
when in an acceptable physical state, is often designed without adequate functional
planning, particularly when renovations are made to existing facilities, causing some of the
existing infrastructure to be less effectively used.



12
3.10  Equipment, both medical and non-medical, is also deteriorated and outdated.
Medical equipment and instruments are often lacking due to insufficient resources. As in
the case of infrastructure, equipment maintenance has not been a priority in the past. Staff
employing the equipment often lack the training to do so, leading to a greater rate of
malfunction than would otherwise be expected. A lack of inventory and control of
equipment has resulted in significant losses.
3.11   Availability and Timeliness of Inputs. Health facilities, particularly health centers
and posts, often lack some basic medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. Patients have to
purchase supplies and medications in local pharmacies to receive treatment at centers and
posts. The current pharmaceutical supply system is administratively cumbersome and
exceedingly slow. Although regional facilities make periodic requests for pharmaceuticals
needed, they often receive neither the amount nor the products requested. Moreover,
budget allocations for pharmaceuticals and supplies are insufficient and favor hospitals,
leaving centers and posts with minimal supplies. Part of the problem stems from the fact
that, as is the case with funds for infrastructure maintenance, royalties from the Itaipui
hydro-electric dam have been employed to finance these items. And, the "social
pharmacies" established with revolving funds in each regional hospital to provide the
population with lower-cost pharmaceuticals several years ago have failed to replenish their
stocks because of inadequate inventory control. A lack of needed pharmaceuticals and
supplies at facilities can severely reduce effectiveness of treatment of emergencies.
3.12  Also lacking, particularly at the more peripheral levels, are physicians. Many
centers are understaffed and even when physicians are available, they generally work only
a few hours before going to their private practice.
3.13  Provider Technical Competence. Components of the service delivery system
designed to ensure the proper functioning of "hardware" inputs are also weak.
Supervision of services is minimal, normative standards are sometimes inadequate and
often not observed, training is limited and inappropriate, and management skills of
administrative staff are insufficient. Supervision of posts and centers takes place only two
or three times per year, and is generally limited to the collection of service statistics and
the delivery of goods. Auxiliary nurses, who are required to have a minimum of primary
school education (but in practice often do not), receive only nine months of training prior
to their employment as nurse's aides. Licensed nurses do receive four years of college
level training, but are few in number. Funding for training has been scarce, and often
personnel shortages do not permit existing staff to take the time to attend training
sessions. Moreover, the training methodology employed is inadequate. Courses have a
theoretical rather than practical orientation, with training materials often having a limited
bearing on the functions staff are expected to perform.
3.14   Client-Provider Relations. The human dimension of service delivery, i.e., the
quality of interactions between health staff and the client, is also deficient. Complaints
about poor attitudes towards patients are common. Providers also fail to communicate
important health information to clients during clinic visits, leaving patients with little
understanding of how to deal with their ailments.



13
C. TECHNICAL AND ALLOCATIVE EFFICIENCY
3.15  Insufficient Emphasis on Preventive Care. Curative care absorbs most of the
MSPBS' budget. As a result, many important preventive activities fall short of needs.
The emphasis on family planning is also insufficient. Despite the high levels of maternal
mortality and morbidity derived from complications of induced abortion, few women
receive any guidance regarding contraception while hospitalized. Health centers and
regional hospitals attend two women with complications of induced abortion for every
birth they deliver. Treatment of complications of induced abortion are high in comparison
to the costs of providing family planning services. The Government has relied completely
on foreign aid to satisfy this need and thus does not budget funds for contraceptives.
Contraceptive supplies are often lacking, and services and information are provided only
two or three mornings per week. Family planning counseling is not provided on a regular
basis, nor are high risk groups such as women under 20 years of age targeted. Basic
training of health personnel only recently began to include training on reproductive health.
3.16  Health education is not one of the priorities of center and post staff. Health
facilities lack educational materials for clients, and no structured health education sessions
are held. The only opportunity to transmit health information to patients is during clinic
visits, and few health staff take advantage of this opportunity to inform and educate
patients. Growth monitoring is not consistently performed. Community outreach is rare,
as health post staff are unable to leave their post due to a shortage of staff In 1990 (ends
1991), only about 50 percent of all children received the needed dosages of measles, polio
and DPT vaccination, and only 40 percent received it in the North. Only one-third of all
children receive all vaccinations. Tetanus toxoid immunization coverage is higher with
two-thirds of women sampled having received full tetanus immunization during their last
pregnancy.
3.17  One of the few programs that does focus on prevention is the child development
program of the DGBS. As part of its effort to address the mental and physical health of
children under 5 years of age, the DGBS has established community centers (Centros de
Bienestar de la Infancia y la Familia, CEBINFA) providing early childhood stimulation,
food supplementation, and facilitating access to health services. They also provide
training in childcare for caretaking mothers. However, the centers are few in number, and
educational activities do not focus sufficiently on health and nutrition education for
mothers.
3.18 Weak Management Capability. Management skills are deficient at all levels, and
are most deficient at peripheral levels. The MSPBS lacks the information required to
make rational resource allocation decisions. Many staff also lack the necessary training to
employ available information for policy and resource allocation purposes. In addition to
facing the same lack of inputs, regional managers also have had less experience in making
allocative decisions. Because all decision-making has been very centralized in the past,
they have had few incentives to improve their management skills.



14
3.19  The proposed project would improve the coverage and quality of maternal and
child health services by ensuring health facilities would have timely basic inputs such as
pharmaceuticals and supplies, adequate infrastructure and equipment, competent staff, and
an informed clientele. Coverage would be expanded by rehabilitating existing
infrastructure, by improving the communication between facilities to enhance referrals, and
by improving the quality of services in existing facilities.
4. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY
4.1   The Government's main priority is to improve the standard of living of its people
through private sector-led growth, a stable economy, and the protection of the most
vulnerable sectors of society. The Government sees public health and social welfare
services as playing a key role in the protection of the poor. Both the high rates of
maternal mortality and fertility have raised concern among Government officials. At
current rates, economic growth (at 3. 1 percent per annum, 1992-1994) has barely kept up
with population growth (also at 3. 1 percent), making it difficult for public services to
increase coverage. Because prior to 1989 the Government had a pronatalist orientation, it
was not until the beginning of democratic rule that the Government showed concern for
the high rates of population growth and took a more proactive role. The Constitution
drafted in 1992 protects the right of families to decide the number of children they want to
have. It also gives public services the responsibility to provide the low income segments
of the population with reproductive health services, paving the way for the provision of
family planning services in MSPBS facilities- Both high fertility and maternal mortality can
be reduced through effective reproductive health services.
4.2   In response to the current state of maternal and perinatal health, the Government
drafted a National Plan for the Reduction of Maternal and Perinatal Mortality in 1994, to
be implemented in conjunction with other public and private providers with both local and
external funding. Its goal is to reduce maternal mortality by 50 percent and perinatal
mortality by 30 percent by 1998. The Plan aims to increase human resource capacity,
improve infrastructure, increase availability of supplies, expand coverage, improve the
quality of care, strengthen local participation, improve the information, education and
communication capability, and develop an information system for effective decision-
making. Although general in nature, the Plan provides a policy framework under which
concrete interventions can be developed.
4.3    Activities performed as part of the Plan are being coordinated by the recently
established National Council on Reproductive Health and Family Planning, which consists
of representatives of Government ministries and institutions, international organizations,
local providers and NGOs involved in reproductive health. Donors participating in this
venture include UNFPA (the main donor, which is expected to provide US$2.2 million



15
between 1994 and 1996), USAID,'4 UNICEF, IPPF and PAHO. Support includes
primarily technical assistance, pharmaceuticals, equipment and training. USAID is
continuing support for the Centro Paraguayo de Estudios de Poblaci6n (CEPEP),
providing technical assistance for management, financing a reproductive health survey, and
providing some training and contraceptive supplies for the government program.
UNICEF and PAHO are supporting training programs, and UNICEF is also providing
some supplies for child health including birth kits for midwives. The Spanish Government
has also extended a $36.0-million line of credit for medical equipment, including
equipment for delivery and emergency care. Like the IBRD, the IDB is currently
preparing a project which will provide maternal and child health services in five
departments. The IBRD and IDB are closely coordinating project preparation to ensure
complementarity between the two and consistency with the objectives of the National Plan
for the Reduction of Maternal and Perinatal Mortality.
4.4   Commitment to improve the health and development of children has also been
visible. After the change in government in 1989, the Paraguayan Government has given
increased importance to social welfare issues. The section of MSPBS that was responsible
for social welfare has been converted to a full Directorate (DGBS), and has been allocated
its own resources. DGBS has been gradually increasing its institutional capacity and the
number and variety of programs it directs. The 1992 Constitution mandates that the state
shall promote family welfare through the provision of social welfare programs based on
health education and community participation.
4.5   Since the adoption of the new Constitution, a number of initiatives have emerged
which place considerably more weight on community financing and participation in the
operation of several of DGBS activities. DGBS is also working on strengthening its role
as a policy/norm setter, by providing communities technical assistance to establish their
own child care centers. The day care centers and technical assistance activities to be
supported under the proposed project aim to strengthen the DGBS' ability to provide
technical assistance, and to expand child care services with a strong role for the
community.
5. ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR THE SECTOR
A. THE BANK'S STRATEGY AND RATIONALE FOR INVOLVEMENT
5.1   In response to deteriorating macroeconomic management, the Bank suspended
disbursements of ongoing operations in Paraguay in the early 1980s. Government policies
during that period had aggravated the recession, and fueled corruption and inflation. By
1989, with the change in government, macroeconomic management improved
14 USAID funding for Paraguay is being considerably reduced. Funding, which was $643,000 in FY 1990
was reduced to $327,000 in FY1994. IPPF has also reduced funding in the 1994-1997 funding cycle.



16
dramatically, leading the Bank to reestablish its partnership with Paraguay in the early
1990s. In support of renewed operations, initial efforts focused on updating the Bank's
knowledge of the Paraguayan economy and current economic and social conditions. 15 A
new country assistance strategy (CAS) was developed on the basis of the results of the
economic and sector studies.
5.2    The Bank's assistance strategy in Paraguay16 seeks to support: (a) private sector
development; (b) agricultural development and natural resource management; and (c)
poverty alleviation with human resource development. The CAS identifies the
improvement of social service delivery as a priority to alleviate poverty and improve
human resources. It notes the importance of improving the targeting of health services,
service quality, and resource allocation within the sector. Maternal and child morbidity
and mortality were identified as being unnecessarily high given that they are easily
prevented. The need to strengthen institutional capacity, particularly in the areas of
investment and budget planning, management, accounting and control, and other measures
to increase administrative efficiency was stressed. The strengthening of management
capability at all levels was highlighted, in light of the decentralization and deconcentration
of social services that is beginning to take place. To date, three projects addressing the
third objective have been approved since the Bank resumed lending to Paraguay: the Third
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Ln. 3519-PA) approved in 1992, the
Asunci6n Sewerage Project (Ln. 3842-PA) approved in 1994, and the recently approved
Secondary Education Improvement Project (Ln. 3941-PA). The proposed project fully
supports the country assistance strategy since its main objective is to strengthen the
delivery of maternal and child health services. It would also assist in the decentralization
of health services through the strengthening of management capabilities at both central and
regional levels.
5.3    A poverty assessment conducted by the Bank in 1994 identified the characteristics
of the poor in Paraguay, and found poverty to be associated with low education, poor
health, recent migration, female headship and indigenous background. It also identified the
poor as being located principally in the periphery of Asunci6n, the northem departments of
the country and part of the East. The report highlights the deficient access to health
services in these areas and specifically among the poor. The report notes that the
inadequate distribution of health resources has resulted in significantly higher rates of
maternal and child morbidity and mortality in these areas.
5.4    The proposed project's design and objectives are also consistent with the key
recommendations of the poverty report. The report recommends improving maternal and
15 A Country Economic Memorandum - CEM (Report No. 9147-PA dated October 15, 1991), a Public
Expenditure Review: The Social Sectors (Report No. 10193-PA dated June 16, 1992), a study of the
implications of Paraguay's joining the MERCOSUR trade area (Report No. 10902-PA dated January 28,
1993), and a poverty assessment (Poverty and the Social Sectors in Paraguay, Report No. 12293-PA, dated
June 29, 1994).
16 The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Paraguay was discussed and approved by the Board of
Executive Directors on December 21, 1993, and is contained in Report P-5916-PA.



17
child health by: (i) targeting the poor; (ii) strengthening service delivery: (iii) increasing
the emphasis on preventive health; (iv) strengthening collaboration with the community,
NGOs and other providers to improve health status; and (v) improving management
capability in MSPBS and its programs. The project would specifically address all of the
above issues. It is expected that the project's integrated child development program
would not only enhance child development but would also improve working opportunities
for women. In line with the recommendations, the project would focus on six
predominantly rural departments in the North and East of the country. It would also
target the urban fringes of Asunci6n, another area of high incidence of poverty identified
by the report.
B. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST BANK EXPERIENCE
5.5   The lessons from previous Bank-financed projects in Paraguay have been closely
examined and have shaped the strategy adopted in this project. Lessons from health and
early childhood development projects supported by the Bank in other regions, and other
agencies have also influenced project design.
5.6   There has been no previous Bank experience with health sector projects in
Paraguay. However, previously financed education and water supply projects as well as
projects currently under implementation revealed problems related to weak institutional
capacity. To reduce potential problems caused by weak institutional capacity, the project
has been kept small and its design has been kept simple. The project contains only one
main component (health), and two very small components: a small child development
pilot to be implemented by a separate branch of the MSPBS (Bienestar Social), and a
small institutional strengthening component. The project will focus on a limited number of
priority interventions (maternal and child health care, family planning and early childhood
development). With the exception of child development activities, all interventions are
contained in the National Plan for the Reduction of Maternal and Perinatal Mortality, and
are thus not introducing new programs. All innovative activities not part of the MSPBS'
normal work will be contracted out to NGOs. The design of the subcomponents is
flexible, allowing adjustments to be made annually, responding to local capabilities. All
health activities will be conducted in contiguous, homogeneous departments requiring
similar approaches. The child development pilot will be conducted in Asunci6n, where the
need for those services is greatest and supervision is more easily conducted. Utilizing a
pilot approach has the benefits of providing ample information as to what works in the
Paraguayan context without the expense of a large operation.
5.7   Most Bank-financed projects in Paraguay have experienced implementation
problems associated with delays in counterpart funding, cumbersome administrative
procedures, a lack of experience with Bank procurement and disbursement procedures,
and poor staffing. Delays in the availability of counterpart funding due to poor
programming and budgeting have seriously delayed execution of several projects (three
Bank-supported education projects (Loans 1346-PA, 2373-PA, and 1992-PA), and the
two rural water and sanitation projects (Loans 1502-PA and 2014-PA)). Counterpart
funding has also been a problem in several projects currently under implementation.



18
Delays in access to counterpart funds would be minimized through the inclusion of clear
guidelines and procedures regarding the necessary planning and timing to ensure timely
access in the Project Operational Manual. This will be done under close consultation with
the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Counterpart amounts and disbursement mechanisms will
be agreed upon early on.
5.8   The implementation of all three Bank-supported education projects (Loans 1346-
PA, 2373-PA, and 1992-PA) was also seriously delayed by the cumbersome procedures
that procurement entails and by a lack of experience with Bank procurement and
disbursement procedures. Limited management capability has surfaced as a problem in the
majority of projects. The three education projects confirmed the value of establishing a
strong project implementation unit to mitigate the effects of bureaucratic delays.
Experiences from both the sanitation and education projects also revealed the importance
of (a) addressing procurement and disbursement issues early in project preparation and
promptly resolving problems that arise during implementation; and (b) adequate
supervision. To reduce procurement and disbursement delays, project staff will receive
ample training on Bank procedures during project preparation and prior to effectiveness
through the participation of project staff in procurement and disbursement seminars and
visiting ongoing Bank-financed projects. In addition, the preparation of detailed
Operational Manuals outlining procedures to be followed for both procurement and
disbursement will mitigate these problems.
5.9   The key lesson from the two completed rural water and sanitation projects (Loans
1502-PA and 2014-PA) is the importance of community participation for project success
and sustainability. This project would work closely with the community to deliver health
messages and some basic preventive care through community health workers and
midwives in rural areas. In urban areas the project would work with community mothers
to manage the child development centers. As the project becomes more established, pilot
experiences would be set up in which the community would work with MSPBS staff to
manage and supervise services.
5.10  Several reviews of the implementation experience of health projects have pointed
out the benefits of the following elements for effective project execution: (a) simple
project design; (b) built-in flexibility; (c) strong monitoring and evaluation; and (d) a focus
on existing government programs instead of new proposals. On the basis of a review of
worldwide experience in reproductive health care, the 1993 World Development Report.
Investing in Health (WDR) highlighted the need to include the following three
components in reproductive health programs: (a) an information, education, and
communications component to generate demand for preventive health services, inform and
educate women regarding their own and their child's health, and mobilize the community;
(b) a community-assisted reproductive health component with trained nurses-midwives to
provide prenatal care, normal deliveries, family planning information and nonclinical
methods, obstetric first-aid, and early referral of severe complications; and (c) support to
district hospitals to provide essential obstetric services. In keeping with lessons from
experience in health projects, and recommendations from the World Development Report,
all three components of reproductive health programs recommended will be included.



19
5.11  Reviews of experiences in early child development programs point out that, in
order to be successful, the design of such programs should pay close attention to: (a)
targeting the neediest communities and children at high risk within the communities; (b)
developing an integrated strategy that includes health, nutrition and education; (c)
securing family and community participation; (d) providing continuous training and
supervision to caregivers; and (e) guaranteeing adequate sanitary and safe water systems.
Child development activities will target low-income areas of Asunci6n, will entail
substantial community support and participation, will provide health, nutrition and early
stimulation interventions and will provide training and supervision for caregivers.
6. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT CONCEPT AND OBJECTIVES
6.1   The main objective of the Maternal Health and Child Development Project is to
improve the health status of the underserved Paraguayan population, particularly women
and children. To achieve this objective, the project would: (a) increase the coverage,
quality and efficiency of basic maternal and child health services in six underserved
departments in Northeastern Paraguay; (b) increase the population's knowledge about
adequate health practices; (c) pilot-test a strategy to enhance early child development in
Asunci6n, and (d) strengthen management capability in support of an eventual
decentralization of public health services in Project areas. Coverage and quality of
maternal and child health services will be strengthened by improving the physical state of
available infrastructure, ensuring availability of needed equipment and pharmaceuticals,
improving provider competence, increasing the emphasis on preventive care, and
expanding community outreach. Efficiency would be increased by prioritizing
interventions that address the key epidemiological concerns of the project area, and by
improving the management of services. Health education activities would enhance the
demand for preventive services and would increase awareness of health issues. The
Project would improve early child development by pilot-testing community-financed
and/or managed early child development centers. The early child development pilot, in
addition to providing direct benefits to participating children, would define investment
priorities for a possible future project.
6.2   The Project consists of one main component addressing maternal and child health
needs, and two small supplemental components: an early child development pilot, and a
component aimed at strengthening departmental readiness for decentralization and a
decentralized execution of the project. It is expected that the Project would (a) increase
the coverage and quality of institutional deliveries; (b) improve the safety of home
deliveries; (c) improve the detection, transport and treatment of obstetric complications;
(d) improve access to reproductive health services and information (including family
planning, sexually-transmitted disease (STD) prevention and treatment, reproductive risk
awareness); (e) improve immunization coverage (both for mothers and children);



20
(f) reduce the incidence of ARI and diarrheal disease; (g) improve children's schooling
readiness; and (h) increase community involvement in both health and child development
activities.
B. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT AREAS
6.3   The project will cover six of the poorest departments, all located in the Northeast
(Table 1, and Map on page 87). The departments covered by the project are Alto
Paraguay, Concepci6n, Amambay, Canindeyui, San Pedro, and Alto Parana. The child
development pilot will be implemented in the low-income areas of Asunci6n. The six
departments are predominantly rural, and have limited access to running water, electricity
and sewage disposal (Annex 1, Table 3). Infant mortality is above the national average of
43.3 infant deaths per 1000 live births, in all but one of the included departments. With
the exception of Alto Parana, fertility is also above the national average of 4.7 children per
woman. The total population to be covered (i.e. the poor) by the health component is
approximately 500,000, out of which 210,000 are children under five years of age and
women of reproductive age (Annex 1, Table 4). The child development pilot will cover
part of Asunci6n's 6200 poor children under five years of age.
6.4   Each one of the participating Departments corresponds to a health region. All but
one of the health regions'7 has a regional hospital, the highest level of care available in
each region. A total of five regional hospitals, 26 health centers and 144 health posts are
located in the Project area. All hospitals have very low occupancy rates (Annex 1, Table
5). Occupancy is lowest where physicians per population are the most scarce, i.e. San
Pedro, Canindey[, Concepci6n and Alto Parana.
C. PROJECT COMPONENTS
Component I: Maternal and Child Health Care (US$ 20.1 million, 74 percent of
total project costs).
6.5   This component would improve the health of women and children in project areas
by: (a) providing a predefined set of health interventions which respond to the
epidemiological profile of the area, including reproductive health; (b) strengthening the
delivery of services by improving the physical state of existing infrastructure, ensuring
availability of needed equipment and pharmaceuticals, strengthening referral capability (in
terms of transport, communications and procedures); and, improving provider
competence, (c) increasing the emphasis on preventive care through health education and
community outreach; and, (d) involving the community in health promotion and service
delivery by training community workers in the detection of pregnancy complications and
the main causes of maternal and child morbidity, the provision of some elementary
preventive services, and the organization of the community for immunization campaigns
and for the transportation of women undergoing obstetric complications.
17 Alto Paraguay does not have a Regional Hospital.



21
6.6   The four strategies outlined above will translate into the following services and
activities: (a) a package of health services for women and children containing:
reproductive health services, including prenatal care, safe delivery, postpartum care,
treatment of STDs (syphilis and gonorrhea), and family planning for all women, and
immunization, iodine supplementation, deworming, treatment of acute respiratory
infections (ARI) and diarrheal disease for children under 5 years of age, and growth
monitoring for children under 3 years of age, (b) the identification of women of high
reproductive risk, or with complications of pregnancy or negative side-effects of
contraception, and detection of child morbidity (ARI, diarrheal disease, malnutrition) for
referral to the health network and for community-based health education; (c) the provision
of health education and some basic preventive care, including some contraception, oral
rehydration salts, and growth monitoring, among others, by community midwives and
health workers; (d) the organization of community resources to transport women with
pregnancy complications to the appropriate level of care where MSPBS transportation is
unavailable. The MSPBS provides all services included under (a) as part of its maternal
and child health program. The protocols for all health services to be supported under the
project have been agreed between the Bank and the Government, and are described in
detail in Annex 2. Given the high rates of adolescent fertility, efforts will be made to reach
non-pregnant women, particularly women under 20 years of age, to ensure they are
adequately informed regarding reproductive health issues. The project will not finance
immunization and iodine supplementation as they are covered through separate programs
of the MSPBS. However, project staff will coordinate with those programs to ensure
timely availability in project areas.
6.7   Services will be provided by medical and paramedical staff at health facilities, and
by community health workers (CHWs) and midwives in the community. The services to
be provided in health facilities will differ by level of care, with facilities staffed with
physicians providing more comprehensive care. Given staff shortages in facilities at all
levels, the project is placing great emphasis on the role of CHWs in the delivery of some
services. Midwives will perform deliveries both in the community and at health facilities
where necessary. CHWs and midwives will have an important role in outreach activities
including individual and group health education, and in the identification of pregnant
women, malnourished or ill children for referral to a health facility. In addition, CHWs
will conduct growth monitoring of children under three years of age. Trained midwives
who currently deliver half of all births and provide some prenatal care will continue to do
so although with additional training and supplies provided by the project. They will also
provide family planning information and will supply oral contraceptives and barrier
methods. In order to ensure coordination of activities and quality of care, some of the
community visits will be conducted jointly by auxiliary staff at the health post and centers
and CHWs. Midwives will charge for deliveries. Pilot projects will be designed to
provide incentives for midwives to provide family planning information and some
methods, and to remunerate CHWs will be designed and tested.
6.8   In view of staffing problems, it was agreed that, to ensure the effectiveness of
project inputs, a health facility would have to be staffed with a critical mass to permit
regular functions to be conducted in order to be able to receive project funding for



22
infrastructure and equipment. According to MSPBS norms, regional hospitals should
have at least 13 physicians and centers should have two. Health posts should be staffed by
two auxiliary nurses. However, many health posts are staffed by only one auxiliary,
centers often have licensed nurses instead of physicians, and hospitals function with fewer
doctors than they need.'8 The minimum staffing would be as follows: Posts would have
to be staffed with at least a full-time obstetrical auxiliary nurse; health centers would have
to have a physician on the premises for at least 20 hours a week (20 physician-hours), 10
pediatrician hours per week, 20 obstetrician or obstetrical licensed nurse hours per week,
and 8 auxiliaries, 3 of which would be obstetrical auxiliaries; and regional hospitals would
have to have 20-physician hours per week in each of the specializations (OBGYN,
pediatrics, surgery and medicine). No minimums would be set to participate in the training
and IEC activities or to obtain pharmaceuticals and supplies. An inventory of health staff
working in project areas will be included in the Master Investment Plans for infrastructure
(see below).
6.9    The proposed project would finance, as part of Component I: (a) the rehabilitation
and maintenance of health infrastructure in regional hospitals and health centers, the
provision and maintenance of medical equipment for maternal and child health services,
and communications equipment for the three levels of care; (b) basic pharmaceuticals and
medical supplies; (c) training of health sector and community personnel; and (d) an
information, education and communications (IEC) program to improve households'
knowledge about good health practices, disease prevention and available MSPBS services.
The project would also finance vehicles for supervision, computers, and office equipment
and supplies.
6.10 Subcomponent I.A.: Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Infrastructure and
Equipment (US$ 11.2 million). Most public health resources are absorbed by salaries
(80 to 85 percent) and pharmaceuticals and supplies (10 to 20 percent), leaving very little
for rehabilitation and maintenance of infrastructure. Moreover, available infrastructure is
often constructed with poor quality materials and without adequate functional planning,
and the location of facilities did not take demand and access factors into account. This
subcomponent will: (a) rehabilitate deteriorated infrastructure; (b) replace obsolete and
non-functioning equipment; (c) establish an equipment and infrastructure maintenance
system; and (d) provide communications equipment and vehicles to improve the referral
system. Although all levels of care can receive equipment, infrastructure rehabilitation will
be limited to regional hospitals and health centers since communities often contribute to
the renovation of health posts. The project will not cover any equipment provided
through other international sources. Under this component, the project will finance civil
works, equipment, vehicles and recurrent costs (maintenance). The loans will cover
maintenance costs on a declining basis. It will also finance training for maintenance staff.
is It is difficult to ascertain the staffing of health facilities because public posts (i.e. the salaries
designated to them) can be assigned to individuals who neither live in the area in which the post is
located nor perform the functions the post requires. A position as auxiliary nurse in a health center
in Concepci6n may be filled by a clerk in Asunci6n. Thus, some facilities may appear, on paper, to
have an excess of licensed nurses when in fact they may have a deficit.



23
6.11   Most investments'9 to be made were identified during project preparation. Work
conducted during preparation will be complemented by an analysis of the health network
and communications system in order to determine which facilities form an integral part of
the referral system, and assess the rehabilitation needs of remaining health centers and
critical health posts. The network study will permit a prioritization of investments and will
serve as the basis for the preparation of a Master Investment Plan (MIP) for each health
region which will identify, for each of the six years of the project, the investments to be
made including their maintenance component, their timing, and approximate cost. The
MIP will also contain a human resource census by facility. The MIP, which will be
prepared regionally, would be revised on an annual basis and included in an Annual
Implementation Plan (AIP). The proportion of rehabilitation funds assigned to each health
region will be proportionate to the assessed rehabilitation needs of each health region. As
a condition of disbursement for this subcomponent, each eligible health region
would present an MIP acceptable to the Bank, and assign a maintenance chief for
the region.
6.12   Investments to be included in the MIP and AIP would be prioritized on the basis of
pre-defined criteria (see Annex 3 for details of eligibility criteria). These eligibility criteria
include the following: (a) subprojects must involve only infrastructure and equipment
employed primarily for maternal and child care and ancillary services; (b) subproject
execution should not exceed 12 months and costs should not be greater than US$200,000;
(c) subprojects should not generate additional recurrent costs; in cases where the
generated incremental recurrent costs exceed fifteen percent of the value of the
investment, evidence will have to be presented demonstrating that the additional costs
(including both maintenance20 and operation) have been included in the Annual Budget
Law for that period and all subsequent years; (d) subproject types would consist of repair,
replacement or purchase of equipment, replacement or purchase of vehicles21; and,
rehabilitation, replacement, improvement or construction of infrastructure or
combinations of the above; (e) all subprojects must incorporate a maintenance component;
(f) subprojects must be based on rehabilitation needs identified during preparation (in the
case of regional hospitals and two centers)22 and as part of the network study (other
health centers); and, (g) facilities must be staffed with a critical mass (i.e., be staffed
according to a basic minimum defined above). The equipment to be covered by project
19 The specific rehabilitation needs of the five regional hospitals and two health centers which function as
regional referral centers were identified in detail during preparation. They represent 80 percent of
the civil works and equipment needs to be financed under the project.
20 The MSPBS is conducting a pilot experience in Cordillera in which the MOF permits facilities to keep
fees collected and to reinvest them in the facility. The project will expand this pilot to allow
facilities to cover maintenance with funds from user fees.
21 Where possible, available vehicles will be reassigned to facilities based on the results of the MIP.
Where additional vehicles are needed they will be obtained/purchased by the Government and
contributed as counterpart funds. Vehicle repair and maintenance will be covered by the loan.
22 The two health centers include San Estanislao, in San Pedro, and Fuerte Olimpo in Alto Paraguay.



24
funds was identified during preparation. It includes basic medical, industrial and
communications equipment, and vehicles (including motorcycles). Only equipment
contained in the list of essential equipment will be eligible for purchase. The list of eligible
equipment will be contained in an annex of the Operations Manual.
6.13   The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will administer this subcomponent. The
Regional Coordination Offices (RCOs), together with the regional directors and technical
assistance from PCU staff, will prepare detailed MIPs as soon as the network study is
finalized. The Regional Health Council will be involved in the prioritization of
investments to be included in the MIP. In order to phase rehabilitation activities, a fixed
amount of funding will be available annually (approximately US$2.5 million). Each year,
on the basis of its MIP, each health region will prepare and submit rehabilitation and
equipment subprojects to the Regional Coordinating Offices (RCOs) who will review them
to ascertain their completeness and adherence to pre-established eligibility criteria (as
outlined in the MIP). The total sum of projects to be submitted under the MIP will not
exceed the total assigned to the health region on the basis of the needs assessment. Given
the unevenness in project development capability among the health regions, technical
assistance in subproject preparation will be provided to health regions with more limited
capability. The involvement of the RCOs and regional players in the preparation of MIPs
and preparation and execution of investment subprojects will enhance local capability to
make resource allocation decisions and improve readiness for the decentralization of
health services. The annual updating of the project implementation plans will provide
flexibility to make necessary adjustments in response to local capacity and changing needs.
Of the total amount allocated to this component, approximately 25 percent will cover
infrastructure rehabilitation, 30 percent will cover electrical and mechanical rehabilitation,
20 percent for medical equipment, 20 percent for maintenance of both infrastructure and
equipment and 5 to 10 percent for communications equipment and vehicles. New
construction will only be considered if deemed necessary to significantly increase the
functionality of existing or rehabilitated infrastructure. All procedures are outlined in
detail in an Operations Manual.
6.14   Subcomponent I.B.: Pharmaceuticals and Medical Supplies (US$6.6
million). The MSPBS allocates insufficient resources for pharmaceuticals, and its supply
system is very inefficient. Moreover, it relies on local manufacturers whose prices are at
least six times greater than international prices. This subcomponent will improve the
availability of the pharmaceuticals and supplies for basic maternal and child health services
by: (a) improving the efficiency of the supply system, and (b) providing pharmaceuticals
and medical supplies at reasonable prices. The project will cover the costs of
procurement, storage, transportation and distribution of the pharmaceuticals and supplies.
Only health facilities that have adequate storage conditions will be eligible to receive
project-financed pharmaceuticals. Facilities will be able to upgrade their storage areas
through the infrastructure rehabilitation subcomponent. Regional health storage areas are
also eligible for funding. The project will also cover training costs of regional staff for the
operation of the computerized inventory system (INVEC). Training for the operation
of INVEC cannot take place before the facility has an installed and functioning



25
computer. Activities in this subcomponent will commence simultaneously in all project
areas.
6.15  An assessment of the efficiency of the MSPBS' pharmaceutical supply system
noted that most procurement is done centrally, with health regions often not receiving
what they order, (both in terms of the amount and type of products) and receiving their
purchases late. Moreover, the current system shows preferential treatment to tertiary
care, leaving most primary level facilities with few pharmaceuticals. Some health regions
have begun to procure some of the products themselves, reducing many of these problems
although at a higher cost. To minimize supply problems, procurement would employ
centralized bidding and payment procedures, to allow for economies of scale, and
decentralized decision-making regarding procurement needs and regional participation in
bid selection committees, ensuring that the needs of the regions are met. The PCU will
assign, on an annual basis, a budget to each health region to procure pharmaceuticals and
supplies. The amount budgeted will be based on the size of the population covered by the
MSPBS. Every six months, each health region will determine its needs from a list of
essential drugs. Only medications and supplies included in a list of essential medications,
contraceptives, and medical supplies addressing local epidemiological needs will be
available to be purchased with the assigned budget. In order to ensure adequate access of
pharmaceuticals at the more peripheral facilities, semiannual orders for pharmaceuticals
will have to specify the amount to be assigned to each level of care.
6.16  The effectiveness of this arrangement to supply pharmaceuticals to project areas
will be reviewed after the first 18 months of operation. If procurement of pharmaceuticals
is severely delayed, compromising project implementation, alternate means will be
entertained, including contracting a reputable procurement agent.
6.17 Subcomponent I.C.: Information, Education and Communication (IEC)
(US$1.2 million). Health education activities are conducted by two Departments within
the MSPBS (the Direccion de Promoci6n, Prevencion y Educaci6n de la Salud and the
Direcci6n General de Participaci6n Comunitaria) and the Instituto Nacional de Salud, a
health training institute. There is little coordination among the two Departments and the
Institute and, with the exception of salaries, all rely completely on foreign assistance.
Their activities are varied, and lack focus and a systematic approach. However, they are
amply staffed. This subcomponent will: (a) educate the population in health promotion
emphasizing both self help activities and participation in MSPBS preventive health efforts;
(b) inform potential users regarding the availability of MSPBS services; and (c) enlist the
participation of the community in the delivery and management of health care services.
The project will finance an analysis of existing ethnographic and sociological information,
and existing educational materials to define the content of the media messages. Existing
information will be complemented by a series of Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) to be
conducted by an agency specialized in that technique. FGDs will be conducted to obtain
information regarding breastfeeding and weaning practices, child care and pregnancy care.
They will also examine attitudes and beliefs regarding disease prevention, family planning,
and health promotion. Material currently used by the MSPBS and other health providers
will be employed when appropriate. The project will also finance technical assistance for



26
the development of printed materials, as well as material for radio messages; the
transmission and distribution of those materials; and, transportation and per diem expenses
for outreach activities designed to inform the community, to identify potential CHWs, and
to organize events to obtain funding for CHWs.
6.18  Increasing community/household knowledge regarding good health practices will,
in the long run, reduce the need for curative care, and in the short run, increase demand
for preventive health services including prenatal care, family planning, immunization and
growth monitoring. Thus, care will be taken to transmit initially only those messages
promoting self-help preventive activities. Messages that would lead to an increased
demand for preventive health services would be transmitted only after most facilities in the
region have received the needed pharmaceuticals and equipment. The public would be
reached individually through counseling or small group talks at health facilities or in the
community, or through mass media, including radio and written materials (such as
materials explaining proper use of contraceptives, benefits of breastfeeding and
immunization, and oral rehydration salts).
6.19  The design, execution and analysis of the FGDs, the analysis of existing
information, the development of IEC materials and their reproduction will be
subcontracted to external firms or agencies. An Action Plan for the development and
dissemination of materials, including analyses of existent data, the content and
methodology for the FGDs, steps involved in the development of materials and a strategy
for their dissemination would be elaborated by a highly qualified (international) consultant.
The Action Plan would include terms of reference (TORs) for all separate activities to be
carried out by outside firms or agencies. A number of firms or agencies that could carry
out FGDs and the analysis of available information, and design IEC materials were
identified during preparation. The Direcci6n de Promoci6n y Educaci6n (DPE) of the
MSPBS and the PCU Technical Coordinator will work closely with the international
consultant in the development of the Action Plan, and with the firm or agency in the
implementation of the plan to ensure consistency with project objectives. The DPE will
participate in the selection of the subcontractors. The PCU will perform all contracting
procedures and will ensure compliance on the part of subcontractors. The PCU will
coordinate with the DPE and RCOs all activities related to the dissemination of materials
such as pamphlets, posters, organization of group talks and counseling services. The PCU
will make contracting arrangements for the transmission of mass media messages via
radio. An Action Plan for this subcomponent, acceptable to the Bank, would be
finalized before any of the other activities outlined in this subcomponent are
implemented.
6.20   Subcomponent I.D.: Training (US$1.0 million). Training for paramedical staff
in the MSPBS has employed a traditional format, i.e. a theoretical rather than practical
orientation, and with little participation and hands-on experience by trainees. This
subcomponent will improve the: (a) technical competence of MSPBS licensed nurses and
auxiliary nurses (including counseling techniques); (b) interpersonal skills of MSPBS staff,
(c) technical abilities of community midwives; (d) ability of CHWs to conduct health
education and the detection of community health problems; (e) operational capability of



27
each facility; and, (f) specific skills needed for project implementation. A limited amount
of funds will be available for refresher courses for physicians and other specific needs
identified during implementation. Given the shortage of medical staff in certain areas, the
training of paramedical staff (licensed and auxiliary nurses) and community workers
(including midwives and CHWs) will be prioritized and strengthened to improve their
effectiveness. Approximately 80 percent of the funds allocated to training will finance
technical training for paramedical staff and community workers, and the enhancement of
operational capability. Technical training will also include community work techniques
and interpersonal skills strengthening. The other 20 percent of funds will finance training
for trainers and a fund to finance other training needs as they arise, including physician
training. The project will finance technical assistance for the assessment of staff
competence (including auxiliary nurses and community midwives), the design of training
materials, the design of an evaluation instrument, the development and production of
training materials, the design of a training monitoring and evaluation system, the design of
training for licensed nurses, the operational aspects of the operational capability
strengthening and a system to follow up and reinforce training. It will also provide travel
and per diems for the provision of training.
6.21   The project will introduce a competency-based training program to replace the
traditional methodology currently employed by the MSPBS. This program will be
established to train auxiliary nurses, community midwives and CHVWs. The first step in the
design of the training program is to review current job descriptions making the necessary
adaptations to make them realistic in terms of the amount and type of responsibilities each
post is assigned. The new job descriptions will be employed to assess the level of
competency of auxiliary nurses and community midwives. The competency of CHWs will
not be assessed as their skills are basic and their knowledge quite general. They will
receive a basic course tailored to project needs. The evaluation will be conducted on a
sample of auxiliaries and midwives staff The results of the evaluation will be employed to
develop competency-based training materials for the two target groups and a short
evaluation/placement instrument to assess the rest of the staff's level of competence to
place them at the appropriate level of training. A basic module will be developed for each
target group, containing material that will ensure competency at a level that will permit an
adequate performance of the functions of that position. Additional modules on specific
topics will be developed for each group to allow staff to reach higher levels of
competency. Once the basic module and the placement instrument are prepared, the staff's
competency will be assessed. Staff not demonstrating the needed competence to
adequately perform their functions will have to take the basic module first. Staff showing
basic competence will have the option of selecting two or three of the additional modules.
CHWs will receive a basic training module initially. Additional modules will be developed
after the third year of the project. Material to perform training follow-up will also be
prepared. Follow-up will take place during supervision visits. Licensed nurses will
receive refresher training courses to be delivered by the School of Nursing and individual
professionals.
6.22   The content of the training will emphasize worker competency in the treatment and
prevention of the key epidemiological problems of the area. Thus, training will emphasize



28
the detection, proper referral and treatment of pregnancy and obstetric complications, safe
delivery, reproductive health (including both family planning and detection and treatment
of STDs), and detection and treatment of the key childhood diseases. Given frequent
complaints of the poor attitude on the part of MSPBS staff towards patients, training will
also include a module designed to improve staff's interpersonal skills. Training will
include counseling and community work techniques. The training itself will be conducted
in small, interactive groups, and through in-service training and follow-up.
6.23   Training will also seek to enhance the operational capability of service delivery
facilities. The operational capability of each facility will be strengthened through a
program which employs a system approach and emphasizes process, team work and has a
client focus. It seeks to improve the institution's image and staff attitudes, and to instill an
awareness of the need for change. Facility-level staff will be trained in problem
identification, solution development and local strategic planning and monitoring.
Managers will receive training on resource allocation, planning, monitoring, and
effectiveness. Facility staff would form multidisciplinary teams to identify and solve
specific facility-level operational problems employing data collected by the team. The
problems addressed would increase in complexity over time. The process itself would be
institutionalized to ensure improved operational capability at all levels of care. The project
will finance technical assistance to initiate the process, train local staff carry out the
process on their own, and travel and per diem to supervise the program. The MSPBS has
introduced this methodology in some facilities in the Cordillera health region with USAID
funding. The proposed project would introduce this methodology in participating health
regions.
6.24   Each health region will be assigned a budget for training based on the human
resources located in the region. In order to phase individual training within health regions
and give priority to staff who have the potential of benefiting the most and having the
most impact, staff members fulfilling pre-defined selection criteria will be trained first.
The criteria include: a record of active community work; positive attitude towards work;
working in areas where staff are more scarce. The regional director, in conjunction with
the RCO, will determine who will be prioritized. The actual training will be contracted
out initially and, as project execution advances, will be gradually transferred to the
MSPBS, giving MSPBS staff time to adopt the new training methodology. In the case of
training for the operational strengthening program, the process will begin at the regional
hospitals, gradually spreading to lower levels of care.
6.25   An Action Plan for the development of this component will be prepared by a highly
qualified specialist. It would include the detailed TOR for the competency-based training
methodology to be employed, including the evaluation of competency, preparation of
materials and the structure of the actual training. It would also outline the profile required
of firms/agencies that would need to be contracted to conduct some of the activities in this
subcomponent. The consultants will work closely with the PCU, the Direcci6n General de
Servicios de Salud (DGSS) and the Direcci6n General de Recursos Humanos (DGRH).
The DGSS and DGRH will participate in the selection of the contractor. Once the TOR



29
are defined, one or more firms/agencies will be subcontracted to execute the evaluation
and design of training materials, and to work with MSPBS training staff to deliver the
material themselves. The training system will include follow-up procedures, training
evaluation (of both trainers and trainees) and the development of a training needs
assessment instrument. The PCU will perform all contracting procedures and will ensure
compliance on the part of subcontractors. It will coordinate with the DGSS, DGRH and
RCOs all activities related to the implementation of the training sessions. An Action Plan
for this subcomponent, acceptable to the Bank, would be finalized before any of the
other activities outlined in this subcomponent can be implemented.
Component II: Early Child Development Pilot (US$ 2.1 million, 8 percent of total
project costs).
6.26  The Early Child Development Pilot will test a strategy to improve the health and
psychosocial development of children between two and five years of age in poor areas of
Asunci6n. The pilot will (a) establish integrated early child development centers
(CEBINFAs); and (b) strengthen the DGBS' ability to supervise CEBINFA-delivered
services and provide technical assistance to communities to provide these services
themselves. The pilot will also give poor working mothers an affordable childcare
alternative. The project will finance the rehabilitation needs of up to 40 centers, technical
assistance, materials, furniture and equipment for the centers, educational materials,
caregiving training for mothers and management training for DGBS staff, and, through
counterpart funding, will cover operating costs of the CEBINFAs (food supplementation
for children and stipends for educators). Each CEBINFA will have access to a maximum
of US$5,000 for rehabilitation. Labor will be provided by the community. The pilot will
be implemented in Asunci6n, where the utility of CEBINFAs is greatest and they are
easiest to monitor.
6.27  CEBINFAs will provide the child with needed mental stimulation for a healthy
psychosocial development, three daily meals, and will ensure needed health interventions
including immunizations and a pre-enrollment physical through agreements with the local
health centers. In addition, mothers will receive health counseling when their child
becomes ill. Each center will accept a approximately 25 children, averaging about 8 to 10
children per educator. Two to three educators (mothers) will attend to the needs of the
twenty children and will rotate between themselves cooking and cleaning responsibilities.
The DGBS currently has seven CEBINFAs in operation. The first was established in
1991. In the past, the Government has covered operational costs. The DGBS is in the
process of establishing a methodology to assist the community to finance the operating
costs of the centers. Community funds are already covering some of the CEBINFAs'
operational costs. The project will assist in this strategy.



30
6.28   CEBINFAs will be established in areas identified as being poor on the basis of the
1992 Census.23 (See Annex 4 for list a of neighborhoods classified as poor). Once the
location of the CEBINFA is selected, a cost-sharing agreement, acceptable to the Bank,
will be drafted between the MSPBS and the community outlining the proposed community
contribution to the installation and operation of the CEB1NFA. Once signed and
approved by the PCU, the DGBS and the Architecture Department of the MSPBS will
provide the necessary technical assistance for its installation. The PCU will provide funds
for rehabilitation, materials, equipment and training supplies. The DGBS will assist in the
identification and training of educator mothers. Educator mothers will be trained in early
stimulation techniques by specialists to be contracted by the PCU. They will also be
taught to detect childhood diseases, general hygiene concepts, to manage CEBINFA
resources, and to give educational talks. They will receive a stipend of at least US$125
per month derived from monthly payments made by parents for CEBINFA services (about
US$10 per month per child). To ensure adequate follow-up of child health needs,
cooperation agreements will be drafted with the corresponding health facility. These
agreements will be a pre-requisite for the installation of a CEBINFA. Ministry of
Education (MEC) staff will conduct the technical supervision of early stimulation
activities. DGBS will supervise other aspects of CEBINFA operations, visiting newly
established centers every two weeks for the first three months and on a monthly basis
thereafter. After three years of project implementation, DGBS will provide technical
assistance to community groups interested in establishing similar centers.
6.29   An evaluation of the CEBINFAs will be conducttd after the first 20 CEBINFAS
have been in operation for at least six months, or after the first 30 months of
implementation, whichever comes first. If the evaluation shows that CEBINFAs are
functioning properly and reaching their objectives, an additional 20 centers will be
established. The results of the evaluation will provide some of the needed inputs to
prepare a project to expand the CEBINFA model to other urban areas.
Component III: Strengthening Management for the Decentralization of Health
Services in Project Areas (US$1.2 million, 4 percent of total project costs).
6.30   The Government of Paraguay is in the process of defining the roles of
municipalities, departments and the state with regards to service provision in the context
of a decentralized operation of social services, including health. Given the lack of prior
experience in the management of programs at the regional level, the locus of much of the
proposed project's activities, this component seeks to strengthen the management
capability of health sector staff both at regional and central levels. This will improve
readiness for the eventual decentralization of health services and improve project
implementation. To improve management capability, the project would: (a) provide
training to strengthen the management capabilities of MSPBS staff at central and regional
levels, (b) establish management information systems to facilitate decision-making at the
23 The basic unsatisfied needs scale is heavily weighted by the access to water and sanitation indicator
and therefore lacked sufficient variability to be used as a poverty indicator. All neighborhoods
falling in the greatest need of education, categories (i.e. 4 and 5) were designated as poor.

regional level, and project monitoring and implementation at both central and regional
levels; (c) conduct pilot activities to increase program sustainability; and (d) establish a
systematic supervision scheme for maternal and child health services in project areas.
6.31   The project will finance management training for central and regional staff. As
part of project management, the information system will be adapted to incorporate some
management information to be employed at central and regional levels and indicators to
monitor project implementation. Funds will be available for each region to submit
subprojects for management information systems and management training. This will
permit health regions to progress according to their own ability. The type of courses to be
financed are included in the Operations Manual, as are the specifications for the type of
equipment that would be financed. In order to ensure sufficient comparability of
informatioii systems to permit project monitoring, all regions will have to employ
compatible software and hardware, and employ the same indicators for project monitoring.
The PCU will develop a standard format to be filled out for the submission of subprojects,
and will provide technical assistance in the preparation of subprojects. Subproject
implementation will be monitored by the RCOs. Some training will be contracted out
centrally. Part of the management training will be contracted out to a firm or academic
institution with expertise in the field.
6.32  In order to improve program sustainability, several pilot studies will be financed.
The type of pilots to be tested will focus on cost recovery issues for health facilities, and
on developing incentives to encourage community participation in health care
management, to attract physicians to resource-poor areas, and to remunerate community
workers. A pilot to assess the feasibility of using community midwives to deliver births at
health posts will be developed. These will be developed after the second year of operation
when all other aspects of the project are well established. The project will finance
technical assistance for the design of the pilots.
6.33   This component will also finance the additional costs that a systematic supervision
of project services would entail, including travel and per diem for supervisors for site
visits. A strategy to supervise service delivery, i.e. ensure all inputs are in place, and
detect service delivery problems will be developed. It will also be employed to follow up
training sessions to ensure material retention. At present, most supervisory visits are
employed to gather data for record keeping and delivering materials and supplies.
7. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. PROJECT COSTS
7.1   Total project costs, excluding physical and price contingencies, are estimated at
US$27.1 million. In addition to the three components described above, total costs include
US$3.2 million (12 percent of project costs) for project management, monitoring and
evaluation, and US$0.45 million (2 percent of project costs) for the repayment of the
Project Preparation Advance. Total project costs, including physical and price



32
contingencies, are estimated at US$3 1.2 million. Foreign exchange costs, local costs
excluding taxes, and duties and taxes amount to US$15.9 million (51 percent), US$14.0
million (45 percent) and US$1.3 million (4 percent) of total project costs, respectively.
Tables 4 and 5 summarize the estimated project costs by component and expenditure
account. Annex 5 provides further details on project costs.
7.2    Base Costs. Base costs are estimated at US$27.1 million and are expressed in July
1996 prices. Estimated costs of equipment, vehicles, and furniture were based on prices
of simnilar imported or locally available items. Estimated costs of civil works,
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, printed material, project operating costs, and
maintenance were based on recent price quotations, past experience, and expert opinion.
Costs for overseas and domestic consultant services and training were based on prevailing
rates for such services. Recurrent costs, excluding pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and
maintenance, were based on current MSPBS budget estimates.
7.3    Contingencies. Total contingencies amount to US$4.2 million (US$1.5 million
for physical contingencies and US$2.7 million for price contingencies), or 13 percent of
total project costs. Physical contingencies were applied to base costs as follows: 10
percent for civil works and 5 percent for all other items (consultant services, equipment,
printed material, vehicles, furniture, training, project operating costs, pharmaceuticals and
medical supplies, maintenance, and other recurrent costs). Price contingencies were based
on Bank estimates of foreign and local inflation rates.
7.4   Foreign Exchange. The foreign exchange component, which is estimated at
US$15.9 million or 51 percent of total project cost, is based on the following percentages
of base costs: (i) 100 percent for medical equipment, pharmaceuticals and medical
supplies, and international consultant contracts, (ii) 80 percent for non-medical equipment
and vehicles; (iii) 30 percent for printed materials and training; (iv) 20 percent for civil
works arnd furniture; and (v) 0 percent foi iocal consultant contracts, project operating
costs, maintenance and other recurrent costs.
7.5   Taxes and Duties. Local taxes and duties amount to approximately US$1.3
million or 4 percent of total project costs. Locally procured goods and services are
subject to a value-added tax (VAT) of 10 percent, excluding pharmaceuticals and medical
equipment and supplies. Import duties for computers are about 6 percent, 10 percent for
vehicles, 30 percent for furniture, and, on average, 10 percent for non-medical equipment.
Duties on pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and supplies are zero.
B. FINANCING PLAN
7.6   The proposed project would be financed by two Bank loans for a total of US$21.8
million, representing 70 percent of total project costs (refer to Table 6 for details of
financing plan). Bank financing would cover 71 percent of foreign exchange expenditures
and 75 percent of local currency expenditures net of duties and taxes. Contributions from
communities for the operation of CEBINFAs would amount to US$0.8 million, or three
percent of project costs. The Government of Paraguay would finance the remaining



33
US$8.6 million, which includes US$1.3 million in duties and taxes. The Government's
financing of foreign exchange expenditures (US$4.6 million) is for the foreign exchange
component of recurrent expenditures (particularly drugs and medical supplies) for which
the share financed by the Bank gradually declines to 20 percent by the end of the project.
During negotiations, assurances were sought from the Government on the overall amount,
budgeting and disbursement mechanisms to ensure timely provision of counterpart
resources. The actual disbursement of counterpart funds would be confirmed through the
annual independent audits (para. 8.20) and monitored on an on-going basis with support
from the Bank's Facilitating Office in Asuncion.

terms and the second loan for a total of US$10.9 million would be in fixed-rate US-
Dollar-based Single Currency Loan (SCL) terms. Both loans would be disbursed at equal
rates over the expected disbursement period of six years. The SCL would be repayable in
15 years. Each semester's aggregate disbursements (Disbursed Amount) would have a
grace period of three years and a final maturity of nine years from the rate ffxing date of
that Disbursed Amount. The CPL would have a grace period of five years, a final
maturity of 17 years and level repayment of principal. The Borrower has selected both a
US-Dollar SCL and CPL in order to improve the management of its external liabilities and
reduce risks. The combination of Dollar-based SCL and CPL terms reduces the risk from
the non-US-Dollar components of the CPL. The choice of having the bulk of financing in
US Dollars reflects the importance of US-Dollar based contracts in Paraguay's
international trade and Treasury receipts. The Government has selected a fixed-rate SCL
to ensure stability of debt-service payments.

maintenance of infrastructure and equipment (US$2.6 million, including contingencies);
(c) operating costs for early child development centers (US$1.8 million, including
contingencies). Additional annual recurrent expenditures at the end of the project are
estimated at about US$1.2 million in 1996 prices. Drugs and supplies, and maintenance
expenditures would be financed by the Bank on a declining basis from 80 percent in the
first two years of implementation to 20 percent in the last two years. All other items
would be covered by the counterpart financing requirements of the project.

8. PROCUREMENT, DISBURSEMENTS AND AUDITS
A. PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS
8.1   The Bank will finance approximately 70 percent (US$21.8 million) of the total
project cost of US$31.2 million equivalent. The loan funds will finance civil works,
goods, consultant's services, maintenance of equipment and infrastructure, and some
operational costs. Procurement procedures to be established for this project will follow
the Bank's Guidelines (January 1995, as revised in 1996). During appraisal the Bank
carried out a detailed review of procedures and documents in use in Paraguay. Some
discrepancies between Bank and local procurement practices were identified in a review
conducted in 1992 by the Bank. These have been resolved by using standard documents,
and ensuring that the Loan Agreements contain specific mention of each item for the
procurement of civil works, goods and/or consulting services (see Annex 6 for specific
procurement provisions for Paraguay).
8.2   The project design nrovides for a combination of centralized and decentralized
implementation mechanisms. Most drugs and medical supplies, some of the goods
(namely medical equipment), and most technical assistance will be procured centrally by
the PCU. Civil works and some goods and consulting services will be procured by each of
the RCOs at the regional level through NCB, international and national shopping. RCOs
would be monitored and audited by the PCU. In the case of health regions having limited
procurement capability, the PCU (the Coordinator for Investments and the Procurement
Specialist) will provide administrative and technical support to the RCOs and facilities to
procure those works, goods and services centrally, but with representation from the health
regions in all procedures, both to train local staff and to ensure local needs are taken into
account. In the case of civil works, the RCO and relevant regional staff will prepare, with
technical assistance from the PCU, the technical documentation (technical specifications
and draft bidding documents). The Coordinator for Investments has received training on
Bank procurement procedures and has ample experience in procurement for civil works
and medical equipment. RCO Coordinators will receive ample training on procurement
for civil works including procedural and technical aspects. The Operational Manual will
contain a detailed description of the procedures to be followed at every step.
8.3   Bid evaluation commissions for decentralized procurement will include the
regional director, the facility director, a representative of the Regional Health Council (the
Health Secretary), the RCO, and a representative from the bidding department of the
central MSPBS. In the case of centralized procurement, as will be the case with the
purchase of pharmaceuticals and most medical equipment, the PCU will ensure that the
health regions involved have majority representation in the bidding commissions and that
they have participation in the preparation of the technical specifications of the bidding
documents. Bid evaluation commissions for centralized procurement will include the
regional director, a representative of the Regional Health Council (the Health Secretary),
and the RCO for each of the regions involved in the particular bidding process, a



37
representative of the PCU, and a representative from the bidding department of the central
MSPBS.
8.4   Civil Works. The civil works to be carried out involve the rehabilitation of health
centers and regional hospitals in six health regions and the rehabilitation of CEBINFAs in
Asunci6n. The total estimated cost of the civil works component is about US$6.0 million
(Table 7), out of which approximately US$5.2 million equivalent (or 86 percent of the
total cost) will be financed by the Bank. Civil works contracts will be awarded on the basis
of National Competitive Bidding (NCB), with the average contract estimated at
US$120,000 equivalent and none expected to exceed US$200,000. Small works
estimated to cost less than US$50,000 up to an aggregate of US$0.8 million equivalent
may be procured under fixed-price lump-sum contracts awarded on the basis of a
comparison of at least three quotations from qualified suppliers (see Table 8 for a
summary of procurement arrangements).
8.5   Goods and Equipment. Goods to be financed under the project will include: (i)
medical and industrial equipment; (ii) computer hardware and software, and
communications equipment; (iii) printed material; (iv) other goods and furniture, and (v)
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies (see para. 8.9). The total estimated cost of these
goods is about US$13.6 million equivalent, with US$9.2 million (or 68 percent) to be
financed by the Bank.
8.6   Under current arrangements it is estimated that medical and industrial equipment
(estimated to cost US$3.6 million equivalent) will be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB). Where possible, packages for several subprojects would be
consolidated into larger packages by the PCU. Given that it will not always be possible to
consolidate regional packages into larger packages and that some items have limited
suppliers some of this equipment will be purchased through Limited International Bidding
(LIB) (estimated to cost US$0.7 million). A minimal amount will be procured through
international shopping (estimated to cost US$0.4 million). Only equipment included in a
pre-approved list of medical and industrial equipment can be procured through the project.
Procurement of medical and industrial equipment would employ centralized bidding and
payment procedures, and decentralized decision-making regarding procurement needs.
Bid evaluation commissions would have regional participation, ensuring that the needs of
the regions are met.
8.7   Communications and computer equipment, for an estimated amount of US$0.9
million, will be procured through LIB (up to an estimated cost of US$0.7 million) and
international shopping (up to an estimated cost of US$0.2 million). This equipment will
be purchased in small packages, and at varying times, depending on the needs of each of
the regions and facilities. When feasible, packages would be consolidated into larger
packages by the PCU and procured through LIB.
8.8   Printed materials for the Information, Education and Communication activities
(IEC) and training (several contracts estimated to cost US$0.8 million in the aggregate)
would be purchased through NCB. Other printed material, other equipment and furniture



38
to be procured in packages estimated not to exceed individual amounts of US$25,000 and
US$0.5 million in the aggregate would be procured through national shopping.
8.9   Pharmaceuticals and Medical Supplies. To minimize pharmaceutical supply
problems, procurement would employ centralized bidding and payment procedures, to
allow for economies of scale, and decentralized decision-making regarding procurement
needs and regional participation in bid selection committees, ensuring that the needs of the
regions are met. Drugs and medical supplies will be procured through ICB on a semi-
annual basis to make the necessary adjustments to changes in demand and to avoid
overstocking on pharmaceuticals with short expiration periods. ICB is considered the
most appropriate procurement method because only basic pharmaceuticals and medical
supplies will be purchased, all of which are available generically and have multiple
suppliers. Product quality will be assured through the technical specifications included in
the bidding documents. The total cost of these goods is estimated at about US$7.5 million
equivalent, out of which the Bank would finance 50 percent (approximately US$3.8
million). In order to permit the health regions to purchase pharmaceuticals and medical
supplies in emergency situations, some drugs and medical supplies may be procured by
each of the six health regions on the basis of national shopping for individual contracts not
to exceed US$25,000 equivalent and up to an amount equivalent to US$0.5 million in the
aggregate (approximately US$80,000 equivalent for each of the six health regions) during
the project's life. All requests for purchases of drugs and medical supplies will be
prepared by each of the health regions on the basis of a list of pre-approved items.
Bidding specifications will include delivery to the regions. The PCU will aggregate the
requests for each item and proceed with the agreed procurement steps. For all purchases
through ICB, the Bank would clear the final list containing the description, quantities and
destination of these items.
8.10   Consultant's Services. Consultant's services to be financed under the proposed
loans will be for the design of materials for IEC and training, the training evaluation,
design and analysis of Focus Group Discussions (FGD), the health network analysis;
institutional and operational strengthening; and for training, when these services need to
be contracted out. Also included under consultant's services are staff costs for project
management staff, including key PCU and RCO personnel. These shall be carried out by
individual consultants or consulting firms, contracted in accordance with Guidelines on
the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing
Agency (August 1981). A standard invitation package would be used, including the
Bank's standard forms of contract for consultants services and the model letter of
invitation. The estimated cost of these components is about US$4.7 million equivalent, all
of which would be financed under the proposed loans (100 percent).
8.11   Operational Expenses. Project operating costs to be financed under the
proposed loans cover travel expenses for supervision, office supplies, telephone, and other
recurrent items. The total cost is estimated at US$0.3 million out of which $0.15 million,
or 50 percent, will be financed by the loans. Only office supplies will involve
procurement, which would be carried out on the basis of comparison of price quotations
from at least three eligible suppliers.

8.12   Other Costs Not Involving Procurement. Approximately 18 percent of the
proposed project costs, or approximately US$5.5 million equivalent, would not involve
procurement. Of this amount, the Bank would finance US$1.9 million. These costs
include maintenance costs of equipment and infrastructure, training and other recurrent
costs. Training costs include only travel and per diems for trainers and trainees. Fees for
trainers are included in consultant's services and training materials are included under
goods. Maintenance costs for a total amount of US$2.6 million will be financed by the
loans on a declining basis. A total of US$1.0 million equivalent (or 40 percent on
average) will be financed under the loans.
8.13   Review of Procurement. Prior review by the Bank will be carried out for: (a)
procurement procedures and documentation for all tender packages and contracts for ICB
and LIB; (b) the first package for NCB for each civil works and goods for each health
region _c  calendar year, and all those estimated to cost US$150,000 or above, in the



40
case of civil works; and (c) all consulting services contracts (and selection processes),
except as noted in Table 9. It is expected that prior review limits for civil works will result
in an annual review of a maximum of 12 contracts. In the case of consultant's services, a
maximum of 8 consultant's services contracts will be subject to prior review throughout
the lifetime of the project. Standard bidding documents acceptable to the Bank will be
used for all NCB procurement. The Bank will review ex-post, on a selective basis,
contracts and bid evaluations for goods and civil works awarded under NCB and shopping
not subject to prior review by the Bank. It is estimated that under current arrangements
about 48 percent of the contracts representing 62 percent of the project cost, or
approximately US$18.0 million equivalent, will be subject to prior review by the Bank.

B. DISBURSEMENTS
8.14 The proceeds of the proposed loans are expected to be disbursed in accordance
with the schedule shown in Table 10 over a period of six years (i.e. seven IBRD fiscal
years). The project completion date is estimated to be December 31, 2002, and the Loan
Closing Dates would be June 30, 2003.

8.16  Disbursements will be made on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)
against expenditures for contracts for: (a) all civil works below US$150,000 equivalent;
(b) contracts of less than US$40,000 and US$20,000 for the employment of consulting
firms and individual consultants, respectively; (c) contracts for goods of less than
US$250,000, with the exception of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies for contracts for
goods less than US$25,000, and contracts less than US$50,000 in the case of medical and
industrial equipment; and (d) disbursements against expenditures not undertaken by
contract. Supporting documentation for these would be retained and appropriately
maintained by the Coordinating Unit and would be available for periodic review by the
Bank. Withdrawal applications for all other contracts will be supported by full
documentation.
8.17  The Project Coordinating Unit will be responsible for ensuring that requests for
reimbursement are made for eligible expenditures. These requests can only be made when
the PCU has incurred the expense and has sufficient supporting documentation (contracts,
invoices and payment orders). The PCU will prepare appropriate documentation as
required by the Bank at regular intervals (monthly) and present it to the Bank for
reimbursement.
8.18  Special Account. A Special Account in US dollars will be opened in the Central
Bank of Paraguay, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The authorized
allocation to this account would be US$1 million, which is equal to the average of four
months' eligible expenditures (net of anticipated direct payments). An initial deposit of up
to US$500,000 will be made available, and the full amount of the authorized allocation
will be released when disbursements reach a level of US$5.0 million. Funds from the
account will finance only the Bank's share of eligible expenditures. The Bank will
replenish the Special Account as requested upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that
expenditures paid were eligible for financing out of the account. Normal documentation
requirements apply, except that, in addition, a copy of the Bank statement from the
institution holding the account detailing the transactions made would accompany each
replenishment request.
C. AUDITS
8.19  Accounts and Audits. All executing agencies would maintain records and
accounts adequate to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the resources
and expenditures in connection with the execution of the project. Agreement was reached
during negotiations that the MSPBS would: (i) have the records and accounts for each
fiscal year audited by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to the Bank, with a
separate opinion provided for SOEs, with generally accepted auditing standards and
procedures; (ii) furnish the Bank no later than six months after the end of each fiscal year,
a certified copy of the agreed audit reports; and (iii) furnish to the Bank such other
information concerning the records and accounts as the Bank would from time to time
reasonably request. For all expenditures with respect to which withdrawals from the Loan



43
Accounts were made on the basis of SOEs, and all expenditures with respect to which
withdrawals were made from the Special Account, the coordinating units for the project
would provide to MSPBS upon request all records and accounts necessary to allow the
timely performance of its obligations, and to the independent auditor, both the records and
the supporting documentation.
8.20  The project's accounts would be available for inspection by the Bank. The annual
audit reports would include, inter alia: (a) an audit of the project; (b) an auditor's opinion
on the eligibility of expenses submitted through SOEs; (c) opinions on compliance with
the financial-managerial covenants in the Loan Agreements; (d) an audit of the special
account, (e) a management letter; and (f) a disclosure of the audit procedures utilized.
The terms of reference for the annual audits were agreed upon during negotiations.
9. PROJECT MANAGEMENT, SUPERVISION AND
EVALUATION
A. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION
9.1   The proposed project was identified in February 1994. The current design of the
project was defined in the Initial Executive Project Summary (IEPS) issued in October
1994 prepared jointly with MSPBS staff. Project preparation began at that time. A
Project Preparation Unit (PPU), which reports directly to the Minister, was established
within the MSPBS. The preparation team consisted of MSPBS professional staff. All
preparation work involved frequent consultation with regional staff and the key service
departments within the MSPBS. Project preparation has been closely coordinated with a
similar project being prepared by the IDB for neighboring health regions.
9.2   Preparation has been supported through a PHRD Japanese Grant to finance project
development in the social sectors in Paraguay, along with a US$450,000 advance from the
Project Preparation Facility (PPF). Portuguese Trust Funds in the amount of US$55,000
were also employed. Key activities have included: (a) training of PPU staff in Bank
procedures including procurement and disbursement; (b) regional study trips to observe
other Bank projects, (c) technical assistance in the design and preparation of key project
components; (d) assessments of physical health infrastructure and equipment needs; and,
purchase of equipment and supplies for the PPU.
B. INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
9.3   Institutional Responsibilities. The executing agency for the proposed project is
the MSPBS through a project coordination unit (PCU) reporting directly to the Minister
and the General Directorate of Projects with International Cooperation (OPCI). The PCU



44
will coordinate directly with the General Directorates within the Ministry and the Regional
Directorates. Each Regional Directorate will have a Regional Coordination Office (RCO)
staffed with one regional project coordinator with a professional profile, functions and
responsibilities as established in Annex 7, satisfactory to the Bank. The main executors of
the project are the health regions, with the support of the General Directorates at the
central level. As a condition of negotiations, the MSPBS passed a ministerial resolution
defining the PCU's organizational structure and responsibilities (including key posts and
the RCOs), its position within the MSPBS' organizational structure, and its reporting
responsibilities.
9.4   Lending Arrangements. The Loans would be made to the Republic of Paraguay.
Through the Annual Budget Law passed in December of each year, the MSPBS would
have access to the proceeds of the Loans. All resources would be managed centrally
through the PCU, but resource allocation decisions would be made at the regional level
for those aspects of the project that would be carried out in the regions. Each region
would be allocated a specific budget for project implementation depending on needs
determined in the annual implementation plan. The health region's use of project funds
will be accountable to the MSPBS.
9.5   Project Administration. The project would be administered by the PCU and
RCOs in the participating health regions. In addition to the Project Director, the PCU will
have 3 coordinators who would divide responsibilities as follows: (a) administration-
finances; (b) civil works, equipment, and maintenance; and (c) training, IEC, management
support and early child development. Procurement of pharmaceuticals would be carried
out by the Procurement Specialist under the supervision of the Technical Coordinator.
Each of these coordinators would be supported by two or three assistants. RCO
coordinators would be supported by one assistant. A diagram of the structure of the PCU
and the profile and functions of the four key positions within the PCU and the
coordinators for the RCOs are contained in Annex 7. The PCU is in charge of overall
coordination, planning, logistical support and supervision of the project, ensuring
execution is carried out in accordance with established guidelines, procedures and targets.
Together with the RCOs, it will also provide technical assistance to regional staff in the
preparation of bidding documents and annual investment plans (including infrastructure,
equipment and training). The RCOs will also be actively involved in the supervision of
project activities at the local level.
9.6   The Operational Manual sets forth the functions and structure of the PCU, TORs
for the director, the three key PCU positions and for the regional coordinators,
administrative and financial procedures, procurement arrangements and plans, and
reporting and auditing requirements. During appraisal, the Government agreed that the
four key posts in the PCU would be filled through a competitive process using the profile
and functions agreed with the Bank. In order to build project management capacity early
on, it was agreed that a project director would be selected and contracted prior to
negotiations, and that the selection and hiring of the three key coordinators would be a
condition of loan effectiveness. The contracting of two RCO coordinators is also a
condition of loan effectiveness. During negotiations assurances were obtained that the

PCU and RCO's would be staffed with high-caliber personnel satisfactory to the Bank
throughout the life of the project.
9.7   Implementation. A Project Implementation Plan was prepared as part of project
preparation and its contents are contained in the Operational Manual. The Operational
Manual specifies the objectives, activities, institutional arrangements, monitoring
indicators and implementation targets for each project component. An annex in the
Operational Manual contains a summary of the Technical and Operational Guidelines for
the services to be delivered at health centers and posts under the project. At present the
MSPBS has separate booklets defining service norms for many of its programs. Many
norms are not complied with because they are outdated or unreasonably strict. Moreover,
the volume of material that needs to be mastered discourages compliance. The MSPBS'
service norms were reviewed, updated and prioritized as part of project preparation, and
are contained in the Technical and Operational Guidelines annex in the Operational
Manual. Another annex contains a mini-operational manual for CEBINFAs. A detailed
outline of its contents was provided as a condition of negotiations. A draft version of the
Operational Manual was reviewed during appraisal and a final version satisfactory to the
Bank was presented prior to negotiations. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that no changes would be made to the Operational Manual without prior Bank
consultation. The MSPBS' approval of the Operational Manual, containing the final
version of the Technical and Operational Service Delivery Guidelines annex is a condition
of effectiveness. To allow for adjustments in project implementation, the PCU would be
responsible for the preparation of an Annual Implementation Plan (Plan Operativo Anual),
employing a format to be agreed upon prior to negotiations (refer to para. 9.13).
9.8   In order to prepare timely inputs to the Annual Budget Law, subproject
preparation will have to adhere to a strict schedule. Facilities will prepare subprojects,
with technical assistance when required, and submit them to RCOs for review at the
beginning of the calendar year. The RCOs will review subprojects and send them to the
PCU for review by March 31 st. The PCU will review subprojects to ensure that they
comply with the MIP and its eligibility criteria and consolidate all requests to prepare a
draft of the investment portion of the annual implementation plan for the Bank's
consideration no later than June 30 of each year, and in this way ensure that the required
amounts will be included in the Annual Budget Law by July 31 st. The consolidated
requests will form the basis of the Annual Implementation Plan for the following calendar
year, which will be furnished to the Bank no later than January 31 of each year.
9.9   An Administrative and Procurement Review would be held in Washington during
the second year of project execution between PCU, Government and Bank staff to review
the legal, procurement and administrative aspects of project implementation. This review
process would assess the experience with procurement arrangements, discuss the findings
of the first independent financial and physical audits, and analyze the project's
disbursement profile and arrangements, including counterpart funds. Agreement on the
scope and timing of this review was reached at negotiations.



46
9.10  Implementation Schedule. The proposed project would be implemented over a
period of six years, beginning on January 1, 1997, and ending by December 31, 2002. The
Closing Date would be June 30, 2003. The cost schedules for the various components
(Annex 4) and the annual work programs would be the basis for project implementation
planning.
C. PROJECT MONITORING AND SUPERVISION
9.11   Bank Supervision. The proposed project would require approximately 23 staff
weeks of supervision per year. A supervision plan is presented in Annex 9. A Project
Launch Workshop would be held close to the date of project effectiveness to ensure all
operational procedures are in place, present the final outlines of the proposed project to
key stakeholders in health and the general public, and confirm the arrangements and
activities presented in the first year Annual Implementation Plan. The Bank would carry
out at least two supervision missions per year as well as a Mid-Term Review. Supervision
missions would be timed to coincide with the Annual Reviews (see below) and the Mid-
Term Review.
9.12 Annual Review and Implementation Plan. Annual reviews of project
implementation progress would include the participation of PCU and RCO staff, regional
directors and Bank staff. The preparation of the Annual Progress Report and Annual
Implementation Plan (para 9.14) to be discussed during the annual reviews are the
responsibility of the PCU. The Annual Reports would include: (a) an analysis of the
previous year's performance regarding its fulfillment of the approved annual
implementation plan; (b) a quantitative analysis of project performance employing
monitoring indicators identified during appraisal; (c) identification of areas in which
implementation has failed to achieve expected targets and a discussion of the reasons for
this failure; (d) identification of areas requiring greater attention in the near future; (e) an
assessment of the effectiveness of cooperation with other agencies and programs related
to the project; (f) a financial report, including a summary of expenditures, analysis of the
financial management of the project and availability of counterpart funds; (g) a
procurement report, including completion of the procurement plan and identification of
any issues regarding procurement arrangements; (h) an analysis of PCU and RCO
performance, and (i) recommendations for future actions.
9.13   The Annual Implementation Plan would contain: (a) a description of activities and
implementation targets on a quarterly basis for each component and subcomponent of the
project; (b) estimated costs of the above mentioned activities disaggregated by category of
expenditure and source of financing; (c) identification of critical dates for specific
activities; (d) areas of cooperation with other MSPBS programs and outside entities; (e)
revised disbursement estimate and quarterly budget by source and use of funds; and (f) the
annual procurement schedule. A draft of the Annual Implementation Plan for the first year
of project implementation was presented during negotiations. The presentation of the
revised version is a condition of effectiveness. The PCU is also responsible for the timely



47
contracting of project impact evaluation studies, and the preparation of an Implementation
Completion Report that would be submitted to the Bnlk no later than six months after the
closing date of the loans. Agreement was reached dv' uin, negotiations that the MSPBS
would furnish the Bank an Annual Report no Sate,r haln eizry 28 and Annual
Implementation Plan no later than January 3 1 of e-achi year, and that a Joint Annual Review
would be held with the Bank no later than March of each year
9.14  Mid-Term Review. The Government agreed during negotiations that a joint
Bank-Government Mid-Term Review would be held during the Annual Review to be held
in March of the year 2000. The Mid-Term Review would evaluate, among other things:
(a) progress in the completion of the critical project stages defined in the implementation
plan; (b) the degree to which project objectives are being met; (c) compliance with the
Loan Agreements' legal covenants; (d) adequacy of available and programmed financing;
(e) compliance with procurement and disbursement arrangements; and, (e) results of
annual project audits. The MSPBS would furnish the Bank a Mid-Term Review Report
one month prior to the date of the Review.
9. 15  Project Monitoring and Evaluation. The PCU is responsible for the monitoring
and evaluation of the project. Periodic supervision visits will be made by project staff to
the field (para 6.33). Process and impact indicatofs have been defined for the project and
will be monitored throughout implementation (Annex 8 contains a summary of key
project performance indicators agreed upon during appraisal). Given serious
underreporting of vital statistics and the unreliability of service statistics to measure
project outcomes, the evaluation of the project's impact will employ survey data. A
national maternal and child health survey was conducted in lanuary 1996 by the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC) and CEPEP which will yield baseline information. Although
the national survey employs a very large sample, it is not representative at the regional
level. However, it does permit regional comparisons and provide regional estimates of
key maternal and child health and service indicators. T lhe project would finance a re-
analysis of data from the 1996 survey as baseline information, and would finance a survey
employing the same instrument in project areas to obtain endline measures at the
beginning of the fifth year of the project. The survey design and execution would be
contracted out to a firm or agency specializing in data collection and analysis. Ideally, one
would want regional-level baseline data, but given the cost it would imply, and the
availability of the CDC-CEPEP survey, this was deemed unnecessary.
10. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
10.1  The proposed project does not present any significant environmental risks. It has
been assigned a "C" environmental rating. It will, however, generate a favorable
environmental impact through (a) increased household information regarding general
hygiene and waste disposal; (b) and improved waste disposal at regional hospitals.



48
11. POVERTY AND PROGRAM OBJECTIVE
CATEGORIES
11.1  The project is in the Poverty Reduction and Human Resource Development
Category and is a program of targeted interventions. Although the project will not reduce
poverty per se, it is expected to reduce the burden of disease in population groups which
currently carry a disproportionate burden of disease in the country due to their income
level and the Government's low levels of investment in those regions. It targets six of the
most impoverished departments and the low income areas of Asunci6n, also identified as
containing a significant proportion of the low income population. The six departments
contain a large proportion of the indigenous and recent migrant population, considered
among the most vulnerable groups in Paraguay. The Child Development Pilot will target
low income areas within Asunci6n.
12. PARTICIPATORY APPROACH
12.1  Several meetings were held during project preparation with key regional staff
including regional MSPBS directors, Departmental Health Secretaries, hospital directors,
and head nurses both to discuss with them the details of project design and activities, and
to obtain feedback regarding its design and implementation. Regional views and
suggestions were incorporated into the project design. These consultations strengthened
the support for the project at the regional level and helped clarify implementation issues.
A short survey of users and non-users of MSPBS services was also conducted to
determine beneficiary perceptions of the quality of services provided, accessibility of
services, attitudes of health staff and service costs. The results of the survey confirmed
information obtained informally through interviews with MSPBS staff and other health
providers. In addition, Bank staff conducted in-depth interviews with the head nurse and
reproductive health nurse in three of the regional hospitals and two health centers to
determine what regional staff identify as being the main obstacles to service delivery in
their area.
13. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. EXPECTED PROJECT BENEFITS
13.1  The main medium-term benefit of the project would be the improvement of the
health of women and children in project areas through direct interventions designed to
improve the quality and quantity of care provided and through an increased emphasis on
preventive care in MSPBS services. Other benefits include: (a) an increase in the



49
population's general awareness and information regarding preventive care, health
promotion and good health practices; (b) strengthened regional health authority and
facility management and implementation capability; (c) savings of close to US$0.5 million
per year in resources currently employed to treat complications of induced abortion; (d)
the field testing of a pilot to increase access to early child development programs before it
is expanded to other regions; (e) field testing of pilots to improve health service
sustainability; (f) increased access to early stimulation programs for poor urban children;
(g) increased child care options for low-income mothers; and (h) a strengthened
collaboration with the community and NGOs to improve service delivery.
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
13.2  Paraguay's cause of death structure characterizes it as being in a mid-
epidemiological transition stage, with both infectious diseases and chronic/degenerative
diseases being among the top five killers. Infectious diseases, including upper respiratory
tract infections and diarrheal disease, are included among the main causes of death of the
population as a whole, along with cardiovascular disease, neoplasms and accidents. Death
from perinatal causes (birth lesions, infections and neonatal tetanus) is also significant.
And, maternal mortality is the highest in the region. Infectious diseases, perinatal and
maternal death are all characteristic of contexts with high fertility (young population) and
poor health delivery capability. And, all are amenable to effective, low-cost interventions
with short-term results. Institutional interventions designed to improve the quality and
coverage of prenatal and delivery care, child immunization, and family planning services,
combined with individual household level interventions designed to improve health
practices in the home and the community can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality
due to the above mentioned causes. Although inducing behavior change is sometimes
more costly than a highly specific and effective interventions such as immunization, it is a
necessary element of long-term, sustainable change. While the health of the population
can be also be enhanced through improvements in overall educational attainment, socio-
economic development, and the environment, they are more costly interventions and have
a less immediate effect.
13.3   Many activities financed under the proposed project do not lend themselves to
quantitative economic analysis. And, those that would in other circumstances, are difficult
to measure because of the dearth of reliable Paraguayan data on health indicators, service
availability and quality, health expenditures and costs. However, the cost-effectiveness of
most of the interventions to be financed by the project has been quantified in many other
contexts. Prenatal and delivery care, and family planning, for example, have been shown
to be highly cost-effective in other countries. According to the findings of the 1993 World
Development Report, Investing in Health, the annual cost per participant of prenatal and
delivery care in low income countries is US$90. The annual cost per user of family
planning services is US$12. Child health interventions were estimated to cost US$9 per
participant and treatment of minor trauma for all ages up to US$6 per participant. Thus,
the annual cost per participant for this package of services comes to US$117 per user.
This same package, including health education, which was not costed per participant, is



50
estimated to cost US$12 per capita. The estimated per capita cost of providing these
services within the Project comes to US$8.70, well below the estimated average. Costs
are low given the reliance on health care personnel other than doctors (nurses and
community health workers, such as midwives), who are less expensive.
13.4  In addition to employing cost.effective interventions, the project will significantly
reduce the current costs of deliveiing services by reducing the incidence of complications
of induced abortion. Fertility in Paraguay, at 4.7 births per woman, is the second highest
in South America. Judging by the levels of induced abortion, the most important cause of
maternal mortality, uLnwanted fertility is also high. Family planning services can
significantly reduce unwanted fertility and therefore induced abortion and its
complications. Family planning services, particularly when delivered through community-
based distribution (as in the case of this; project), are the most cost-effective means of
reducing maternal mortality, and improving maternal and child health. Using the average
costs of treatment of abortion-related complications derived from elsewhere in Latin
America (an average of $400 per abortion), this implies a cost to the health system of at
least US$480,000 dollars per year for the project areas alone24. Family planning services
can cost as little as US$20 per user per year.
13.5   The success of project interventions in meeting project objectives will be carefully
measured during the last year of the project. Given the poor quality of vital statistics and
service deliverv data, project impact will be measured by means of baseline and endline
surveys in project areas. The Centers for Disease Control conducted a large-scale national
maternal and child health household survey in January of 1996 which will be employed as
baseline information. The same questionnaire will be applied in project areas during the
final year of project implementation. Given the five-year interval, some mortality
indicators can be measured, namely, child, infant and perinatal mortality. Some morbidity
indicators are also available including prevalence of diarrhea, acute respiratory infection,
and reproductive morbidity. In additioni, indicators of coverage of professionally attended
delivery, prenatal care, tetanus toxoid imrnunization, family planning, child immunization,
are available as are service quality and utilization measures. The survey will also measure
population information regarding the benefits of these services and will identify the source
of that information.
C. FINANCIAL AND FISCAL IMPACT
13.6   The Government of Paraguay invests relatively little in health. Including social
security health services, the Government of Paraguay (GOP) spent less than 2.5 percent
of GDP on health in 1994. What the Government does spend on health is also poorly
allocated. It is estimated that salaries absorb 80-85 percent of public health expenditures.
24 Health regions report between 20() and 2 50 treatments of complications of induced abortion per year,
yielding an average of 1200 to 1500 per year for the project areas. Underreporting of abortion and
its complications is common and thus one can assume the actual figures to be considerably higher.
The costs of US$400 for the treatment of complications of induced abortion were obtained from a
detailed study conducted in Nicaragua.



51
This means that there are insufficient resources to cover maintenance of facilities and
equipment, to procure pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and to train staff.
13.7   The sustainability of project investments has been a concern from the inception of
the project. As a result, project design sought to optimize unit costs through: (a) an
expansion of maternal and child health care which relies on existing health personnel and
the incorporation of community midwives and health workers who deliver services
relatively cheaply compared to doctors, (b) using the results of a study of the network and
referral system for health facilities to guide the allocations for infrastructure rehabilitation
in order to ensure that investments are channeled to the facilities most used by the
population; (c) rehabilitating existing infrastructure instead of investing in new
construction, and (d) increasing the durability of investments by assigning greater
emphasis to maintenance of infrastructure and equipment. Cost savings are expected
particularly in the area of pharmaceuticals through the use of international competitive
bidding as local prices exceed international prices by a wide margin.
13.8   The only salaries to be financed by the project are for a small number of staff to
assist in project management and infrastructure maintenance. Thus the incremental annual
recurrent expenditures required when the program is in full operation is likely to be small
($1.2 million) consisting mainly of consumables (drugs and supplies) and maintenance
costs for the anticipated higher quality and level of service delivery. Not only does this
represent less than one percent of the current budget of the MSPBS, but it should be
easily absorbable given the potential cost savings resulting from the project's efforts to
improve maintenance and to lower the cost of drugs. In addition, the Government would
gradually take over more responsibility for recurrent costs over the life of the project
given the decreasing rate of Bank financing.
D. RISK ANALYSIS
13.9   The main project risks are associated with: (a) the weak implementation capacity
of the Ministry at the central and regional level; (b) poor programming of counterpart and
project resources; and (c) administrative difficulties and legal barriers that could slow
project execution. The risks associated with implementation capacity are being minimized
by limiting the scope of activities and phasing their implementation, employing a detailed
Operational Manual specifying the implementation responsibilities, procedures and timing
to guide implementation, and providing technical assistance and training for MSPBS
central and regional staff Programming of project resources will be improved through the
development of clear guidelines and procedures regarding the timing and steps required to
ensure timely access to project and counterpart funds. These arrangements will be
reviewed with the Ministry of Finance, and will be included in the Operational Manual.
Administrative delays would be reduced by ensuring PCU staff have ample training on
Bank procedures. PCU staff have already attended procurement and disbursement
seminars, and have visited other Bank projects. Additional training will be made available
prior to project start-up. In addition, the Operational Manual details all steps to be taken
with regard to procurement, disbursement, and Bank reporting. Finally, an Administrative



52
and Procurement Review to be held in the second year of the project will allow an early
analysis and solution to issues arising during implementation.
14. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND

furnished to the Bank no later than one month prior to the date of the Review (para.
9.14); an Annual Investment Plan would be presented to the Bank no later than June 30
every year (para 9.8); and that the MSPBS would conduct jointly with the Bank, a
Mid-Term Review no later than March 31 of the year 2000 (para 9.14).
h) The procurement of pharmaceuticals will be evaluated after 18 months. Should any
major problems be detected, available alternatives will be considered (para. 6.16);
i) that the training methodology to be employed to train auxiliary nurses and community
health workers will be akin to a competency-based methodology, employing a
participative format and with a practical rather than theoretical orientation (para 6.21);
and
j) that action plans for activities in the IEC subcomponent (para. 6.19), and training (para.
6.25) would be finalized before any other activities in the subcomponent can be

d) presented the final version of the Annual Implementation Plan for the first year (para
9.13).
14.4  As a condition of disbursement of the rehabilitation and maintenance
subcomponent for each health region, each health region will designate a maintenance
chief and present an MIP for the health region which identifies investments for the six years
of project implementation, estimates costs, and includes a detailed maintenance plan and a
human resource census (para 6.11).
B. RECOMMENDATION
14.5  Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project would
constitute a suitable basis for two Bank loans to the Republic of Paraguay for a total of
US$21.8 million equivalent. The first loan for a total of US$10.9 million would be a fixed-
rate US-Dollar-based Single Currency Loan repayable in 15 years. The second loan for a
total of US$10.9 million would be a Currency Pool Loan at the standard variable rate
repayable in 17 years.

DESCRIPTION OF PROTOCOLS
The following is a general description of project-related maternal and child services to be
delivered in project areas. A more detailed description is contained in the Operational Manual.
The content of each of the services described below will vary by the level of care in which it is
provided. Under normal conditions (i.e. when the option exists), an individual's first contact with
the health system will be at the primary level (health post). For preventive health services,
however, that initial contact may take place in the community. Staff at the primary level will
determine if referral to higher levels of care is necessary. The figure at the end of this annex
disaggregates services by type of care and level of care. It should be noted that although regional
hospital and health center services are included in the same box, some of the services they provide
differ in terms of the technology available. Regional hospitals are prepared to treat all obstetric
emergencies, whereas health centers are not.
Prenatal Care
Prenatal care in health facilities will include a physical examination to determine uterine
height, blood pressure, weight gain, the fetus' gestational age and heartbeat. In regional hospitals,
and health centers with laboratory facilities, the examination will also include blood and urine
laboratory work. Pregnant women will receive two tetanus toxoid immunizations during
pregnancy and a three-month supply of iron, micronutrient, and vitamin supplementation in each
visit. Tetanus toxoid immunization will be available at all health facilities provided they have
electricity. Pregnant women will receive two doses during gestation. Iodine supplements will be
provided through a separate program in the MSPBS once during pregnancy. Obstetric risk will
be evaluated at the health posts staffed with an auxiliary in obstetrics and health centers to identify
women who should be referred to higher levels of care for delivery. Health education on
reproductive risk factors, the benefits of breastfeeding, appropriate weaning practices, care during
pregnancy and infant care will be provided at all levels of care.
At the community level, CHWs will identify pregnant women in the community, and
provide them with health education either individually or in group talks, on the benefits of
breastfeeding, appropriate weaning practices, care during pregnancy and infant care. CHWs,
together with midwives, will organize community transportation to be used in the case of obstetric
emergencies in the community. Midwives will evaluate the obstetric risk of pregnant women
coming for prenatal care and refer high risk women to health centers. They will also refer
pregnant women to health facilities to receive tetanus toxoid immunization.
Delivery Care
Low risk deliveries will be performed at lower levels of care, reserving the space at
regional hospitals for high risk pregnancies. Only health posts with auxiliaries in obstetrics will
perform deliveries. Should a complication arise during delivery at a health center or post, the
patient will be transferred to a regional hospital through health service transportation when
available, or community-organized transportation. Only health posts staffed with an auxiliary
specialized in obstetrics will provide delivery care. The baby's weight, height and Apgar score
will be measured. Health education to be provided will include information on breastfeeding and



58                                  Annex 2
infant care. Midwives will perform deliveries in the community, as they always have, but with
further training and backup transportation in cases of emergency. They will also provide
information on breastfeeding and infant care. Midwives and health post staff will register infants
for growth monitoring. A pilot will be conducted to assess the feasibility and benefits of having
midwives perform deliveries in health posts which have no auxiliary specialized in obstetrics.
Postpartum Care
Postpartum care will include, at all levels of care, a pelvic exam, and health education
focusing on exclusive breastfeeding, appropriate weaning, infant care and family planning. CHWs
and midwives in the community will reinforce health education provided at health facilities.
Other Reproductive Health: Family Planning, Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases
(STDs) and Detection of Cervical Cancer
Family planning information and services will be available at all levels of care, and to
some extent in the community through midwives and CHWs. They will be instrumental in
identifying non-users who belong to high-risk groups, such as adolescents, and providing them
with information on reproductive health and, more specifically, on family planning. They will
provide barrier methods to current and new users and resupply oral contraceptives to current
users. A pilot will be conducted whereby midwives will be allowed to charge a nominal fee for
contraceptives and keep it as payment for their work. Hormonal methods to new users will be
prescribed at health facilities. Methods available at health posts include all non-clinical methods
(barrier methods, and hormonals (except implants)). They will make referrals to other levels of
care for other methods. Health centers will provide non-clinical methods and IUD insertion,
where staff are trained to do so, and will make referrals for other clinical methods. Regional
hospitals will provide surgical, clinical and non-clinical methods.
Community workers will also address some basic reproductive health issues in their
educational efforts including STDs and cervical cancer. All levels of the health care network will
provide STD screening. However, treatment will only be available at centers and regional
hospitals. STD screening will be performed during prenatal examinations or general
gynecological checkups. Health posts will employ simple, inexpensive diagnostic techniques (pH
dipsticks, and potassium hydroxide and normal saline). Health centers with laboratory facilities
and regional hospitals will provide more sophisticated screening procedures and will provide
treatment. Pap smears will also be available at health centers with laboratory facilities and
regional hospitals for women over 35 years of age. Positive test results will be followed up by
facility staff.
Child Health
Preventive child care services will be provided at health posts and in the community
through midwives and CHWs. They will be responsible for the identification of malnourished and
ill children in the community and make referrals to health facilities. In coordination with health
post and center staff, organize immunization campaigns. CHWs will provide health education for
mothers on oral rehydration therapy (ORT), child care, hygiene and nutrition. Growth monitoring



59                                   Annex 2
for children under 3 years of age will be provided at health posts. Health education will be
provided at all levels. Child health services at health posts and centers include: immunization,
iodine supplementation, deworming, treatment of diarrheal disease, acute respiratory infections
(ARI), measles and malnutrition. The more severe cases of diarrhea, ARI, measles and
malnutrition will be treated in higher levels of care.

62                              Annex 3
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SUB-PROJECTS
The PCU will apply the following eligibility criteria to determine whether the
subproject can be considered for funding and included in the Master Investment Plan
and Implementation Plan.
Eligibility criteria are characteristics a subproject is required to meet in order to be
considered for possible funding. Failure to fulfill eligibility criteria will result in the
exclusion of the subproject.
General Eligibility criteria:
*     Amount:
Subproject costs should not exceed US$200,000.
Location:
Only subprojects in health establishments in the departments of Alto Paraguay, Alto
Parana, Amambay, Canindeyu, Concepcion and San Pedro will be eligible. Only
subprojects addressing maternal and child health services will be considered.
Application:
Only those interventions previously identified as priority investment in the
assessment of needed rehabilitation of the 5 regional hospitals and 2 health centers
will be considered. In the case of other health centers, needs identified in the health
network study apply (as reflected in the Master Investment Plan). Priority
assignment must have the no objection of the Regional Health Council.
Operation:
Certification by the Regional Director and the facility that the facility possesses the
needed human resources that it needs to operate according to the norms established
in the Operational Manual. Define a critical mass, and that the subproject contains a
maintenance plan.
Implementation:
The estimated duration of implementation should not exceed 12 months from the
initiation of bidding process to its completion.
*     Coherence:
The subproject should be coherent with the strategy of the sector's development and there
should not exist overlapping of financing sources in the same subproject.



63                               Annex 3
Type:
Subprojects should belong to one of the following categories:
Elegibility Criteria specific to Infrastructure Subprojects:
Infrastructure subprojects should be justified in the context of a global and individual
analysis of the establishment and its rehabilitation.
Repair: Repair subprojects would be eligible when they are located in viable
facilities, and when the repair cost would not exceed 35 percent of the replacement
value.
Rehabilitation: Rehabilitation subprojects would be eligible whether or not the
rehabilitation implies a change in the facility functionality, when:
a)    The cost of civil works does not exceed 35 percent of the replacement value.
b)    They are performed in facilities which are considered viable and the total
value of civil works does not exceed 50 percent of its replacement value.
Replacement: These subprojects will be eligible for funding in the following cases:
a)    When patient and personnel safety may be clearly at stake.
b)    When the repair is not structurally viable.
c)    When the repair cost would exceed 35 percent of the replacement value.
Construction: This type of investment will be considered only in exceptional cases.
Eligibility Criteria specific to Medical Equipment Subprojects:
Acquisition: This activity addresses the need to either replace the equipment, or
increase the supply and the quality of services.
a)    Replacement: Equipment replacement subprojects will be eligible when
the equipment is no longer functional.
b)    New: When the incorporation of additional equipment is technically justified.
Repair: These subprojects will be accepted when:
a)    The repair cost does not exceed 35 percent of the replacement value and
results an increase of the useful life of the equipment in of least 50 percent
according to the manufacturer's technical specifications.



64                               Annex 3
b)    When the repair cost would exceeds 35 percent of the value, the equipment
would be replaced.
Eligibility Criteria specific to Industrial Equipment Subprojects:
*     Acquisition: This activity addresses the need to replace the equipment, or increase
the supply and the quality of services.
Replacement subprojects will be eligible for funding when:
a)    Replacement: the equipment is out of order or when its operation causes
inefficiencies in the establishment's normal operation, and when the
economic evaluation of the possible alternatives recommends such
replacement.
b)    New: when the incorporation of additional equipment is technically justified.
*     Repair: These subprojects will be eligible for funding in the following cases:
a)    When the repair cost would not exceed 35 percent of the replacement value
and when such repair would increase the useful life of the equipment by at
least 50 percent according to the manufacturer's technical specifications.
b)    When the repair cost exceeds 35 percent of the value, the equipment
replacement would be advised.
Eligibility Criteria Specific to Vehicles Subprojects:
Acquisition: This activity addresses the need to either replace or add additional
means of transportation (i.e. vehicles, motorcycles, bycicles). These may be
reassigned from other areas.
a)    Replacement: Subprojects will be given priority when vehicles are in need
of repair or when their operating conditions might cause inefficiencies in the
regular hospital operation.
b)    New: When the incorporation of additional vehicles is technically justified.
Mixed: Combinations of (a), (b), or (c).
The definitions to be used in the determination of type and category of subproject are
described in the "Guidelines and Forms for the Subproject Presentation".

Procurement Clauses for Loan Agreement and Procurement Arrangements
Special Provisions to be Included in the Legal Documents
In view of the discrepancies between Paraguayan law and Bank guidelines, the
following special provisions would be stated explicitly in the loan documents:
(a) foreign bidders may be required as a prerequisite for bidding, to be registered with
local authorities, provided, however, that the information to be requested by the
Borrower to such bidders is of such nature that it will not discourage their
participation;
(b) foreign bidders shall not be required to notarize their bidding documents with
Paraguayan authorities as a prerequisite of bidding. However, such foreign bidders
shall be required to notarize their bid documentation by the corresponding authority
of their domicile;
(c) there will be no prescribed minimum number of bids to be submitted in order for a
contract to be subsequently awarded;
(d) the lowest evaluated bid shall be selected for contract award;
(e) foreign bidders shall be allowed to participate in national competitive bidding;
(f) the price of contracts for works or goods which duration is for more than eighteen
months may be adjusted even if such price has increased by less than 15% of the bid
price;
(g) foreign consultants will be selected from those included on a short list on the basis of
evaluation criteria and terms of reference, both satisfactory to the Bank;
(h) in case of international competitive bidding or limited international bidding, Bank's
standard documents will be used; and
(i) in case of national competitive bidding documents acceptable to the Bank will be
used. Those "acceptable" documents should be prepared on the basis of the Bank's
standard, and may include provisions to accommodate local procurement practices to
the extent that such practices are consistent with the Bank's procurement guidelines.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
This annex provides a detailed justification for the project. It consolidates material
discussed in various sections of this report in order to address, step by step, the relevant
issues and considerations that led to the present project design. The analysis considers: (a)
linkages to economic and sector work; (b) analysis of alternatives; and (c) impact and
sustainability.
The primary objective of the proposed project is to improve maternal and child
health in six predominantly rural departments in northeastern Paraguay. This region of the
country contains most of the recent migrant settlements and a majority of indigenous
population. The six departments have limited access to running water, sewage disposal
and electricity. With the exception of four departments in the Chaco, which together
contain less than two percent of the population, five of the departments included in the
project have the highest poverty levels in Paraguay. The total poor population to be
covered by the health component is approximately 500,000, out of which 210,000 are
children under five years of age and women of childbearing age. Maternal and child
mortality and morbidity in these departments are among the highest in the nation.
B. Linkages to Economic and Sector Work
Resuming operations in 1990, after a long hiatus, the Bank conducted a number of
studies to update its knowledge-base of the Paraguayan economy and current economic
and social conditions. A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was developed on the basis
of the results of the initial economic and sector studies'. The CAS was discussed and
approved by the Board of Executive Directors on December 21, 1993 with the Eighth
Highways Project (Report P-5916-PA).
Country Assistance Strategy. The objectives of the Bank's assistance strategy in
Paraguay are to support: (a) private sector development; (b) agricultural development and
natural resource management; and (c) poverty alleviation through human resource
development. The CAS specifically identifies the improvement of social service delivery
as a priority to alleviate poverty and strengthen human resources. It notes the importance
of improving the targeting of health services, service quality, and resource allocation
within the sector. Maternal and child morbi-mortality were identified as unnecessarily high
given that they can be easily prevented. The need to strengthen institutional capacity,
particularly in the areas of investment and budget planning, management, accounting and
'Country Economic Memorandum - CEM (Report No. 9147-PA dated October 15, 1991), Public
Expenditure Review: The Social Sectors (Report No. 10193-PA dated June 16, 1992),and a study of
the implications of Paraguay's joining the MERCOSUR trade area (Report No. 10902-PA dated
January 28, 1993).



79                             Annex 10
control, and other measures to increase administrative efficiency was stressed. The
strengthening of management capability at all levels was highlighted, in light of the
decentralization and deconcentration of social services that is beginning to take place.
Economic and Sector Work (ESW). Early sector work shaped the content of
the CAS. The analysis noted that public health resources are poorly allocated, with most
health expenditures being absorbed by salaries (up to 80 percent). It also noted that public
resources are concentrated on curative rather than preventive care, and on tertiary care
over the lower levels of care. A report completed after the CAS was drafted, focused
specifically on the poverty and the social sectors (Poverty and the Social Sectors in
Paraguay, Report No. 12293-PA, dated June 29, 1994). This report showed the poor to
be located principally in the periphery of Asunci6n, the northern departments and part of
the East. It found that the poor are more likely to have limited schooling and poor health,
and that they are more likely to be indigenous and migrants. In its examination of the
relationship between health and poverty, the report indicated that health resources are
unevenly distributed, resulting in an overconcentration of resources in Asunci6n and other
large urban areas at the expense of poorer regions. This maldistribution has resulted in
significantly higher rates of maternal and child morbidity and mortality in these
departments. Sector work also noted the important role that community participation has
had in social development projects and recommends its incorporation into projects.
The Project. The proposed project fully supports the country assistance strategy
and findings of the ESW. The main objective of the project is to improve maternal and
child health in project areas through direct interventions designed to: (a) improve
available infrastructure and equipment; (b) improve competence of MSPBS paramedical
staff through a modified and enhanced training methodology; (c) increase general
awareness and information regarding health promotion and good health behavior among
the population; (d) increase the emphasis on preventive health in MSPBS services; (e)
facilitate access to less expensive pharmaceuticals; (f) improve regional management and
implementation capability; (g) increase access of early stimulation programs for poor
urban children; (h) increase child care options for low-income mothers, and (i) strengthen
collaboration with the community and NGOs to improve service delivery.
The project also seeks to enhance early child development through a small pilot
designed to establish integrated child development centers. The project's integrated child
development activities would also improve working opportunities for women. The health
component would target six of the poorest departments in Paraguay. The child
development component would target the urban fringes of Asunci6n, another area of high
incidence of poverty identified by the poverty report.
C. Analysis of Alternatives
Why a Health Care Intervention? Several avenues are available to improve the
health of the population. Health can be enhanced through improvements in educational
attainment, socio-economic development, individual life-styles and the environment as



80                              Annex 10
much as it can be by the health care system itself The greater the importance of
communicable diseases in the overall burden of disease, the greater the potential impact of
health care improvements. The more chronic and degenerative disease in a population, i.e.
the older the population, the greater the role of economic development, education, life-
styles and the environment in improving health. In Paraguay, communicable diseases are
important contributors to the burden of disease. Thus, direct interventions in how services
are delivered will have an important effect on health status. Also, the Bank is already
financing a secondary education project, a rural water supply project, and, in Asunci6n, a
sewerage project.
Why Maternal and Child Health? Paraguay's cause of death structure
characterizes it as being in a mid-epidemiological transition stage, with both infectious
diseases and chronic/degenerative diseases being among the top five killers. Infectious
diseases, including upper respiratory tract infections and diarrheal disease are included
among the main causes of death of the population as a whole, along with cardiovascular
disease, neoplasms and accidents. Death from perinatal causes (birth lesions, infections
and neonatal tetanus) is also significant. And, maternal mortality is the highest in the
region. Infectious diseases, perinatal and maternal death are all characteristic of contexts
with high fertility (young population) and poor health delivery capability. And, are all
amenable to effective, low cost interventions with short-term effects. Cardiovascular
disease and neoplasms are more typical of a low fertility (older) population, and accidents
are more common in more urbanized settings. Reducing mortality from these causes is
considerably more expensive, and prevention is very long-term. Investing in maternal and
child health will have longer term effects as children have a whole life ahead of them
(cardiovascular disease and neoplasms affect older generations), and shorter-term results,
and tackling them will be considerably less costly.
It may be argued that in order for the MSPBS to make sustainable changes in the
quality and coverage of health services, projects would need to address the manner in
which health care is financed, how resources are allocated within the sector, and how
allocated resources are used. It would require a careful analysis of how the system
functions and of the feasible alternatives to guide change. ESW has not focused on the
health sector and thus little is known regarding health financing, sector efficiency and
effectiveness, and equity. Little is known of the extent of private sector delivery and
finance, and how it is regulated. There is no information on the quality of private services,
nor of the coverage of private health insurance. What is known is that not enough
resources are spent on health, and that 80 percent are absorbed by salaries, leaving
managers little room to "allocate" resources. Moreover, given the Government's intention
to decentralize the health sector, the current paradigm could change significantly. A
project designed to introduce some structural changes would require a detailed analysis of
the sector and a clear view as to which way the decentralization is headed.
The proposed project seeks to reduce the ill-effects of the maldistribution of
resources on the poor, and will, to the extent possible, correct some of the allocation
problems. By investing in secondary level facilities it reduces the tertiary care bias, and by



81                              Annex 10
investing in preventive care it reduces the curative care bias. Moreover, the project will
finance activities to improve the management of health services at the regional and central
levels to ensure more effective decision-making at least regarding project inputs.
The project's objectives, to reduce maternal and child morbidity and mortality, are
in line with the Bank's assistance strategy for Paraguay and the GOP's health priorities.
In response to the poor state of maternal and perinatal health, the Government drafted a
National Plan for the Reduction of Maternal and Perinatal Mortality in 1994, to be
implemented in conjunction with other public and private providers with both local and
external funding.
Why this Project Design? The main causes of maternal death in Paraguay are
abortion, toxemia, hemorrhage, and sepsis. The high maternal mortality and morbidity
rates are a direct result of a lack of appropriate prenatal care, unsafe delivery care, and
absence of family planning services. In project, areas one-half of all birth are delivered by
midwives, many of which work in unsanitary settings and are improperly trained. Poorly
performed births account for an important share of infant deaths as birth lesions are by far
the main cause of death of children under one year of age. Inadequate access to modern2
contraceptive services and information accounts for the high proportion of women bearing
children in situations that are more likely to result in pregnancy and birth complications
(i.e. bearing children when they are too young, too old, of high parity or within short birth
intervals) and a high level of unwanted fertility (as evidenced by the high number of
induced abortions). One third of women giving birth in Paraguay can be classified as
being of high reproductive risk. Besides reducing the mother's risk of infection and other
complications, safe delivery will reduce the incidence of birth lesions, sepsis and asphyxia
in newborns. Family planning has beneficial effects both for the mother and for the
survival of her child as well. Family planning reduces maternal mortality by reducing the
risk of induced abortion, and by reducing exposure to childbirth complications. Family
planning also helps women lengthen the interval between births allowing them to recover
fully between births, and in this way increasing the chances of survival of their newborn.
The health service delivery interventions to be provided in project areas will be
complemented by an information, education and communications program aimed at
generating health promotion behavior at the household level. The information/education
will be provided massively through a radio campaign and individually in health facilities
and the community. Inducing behavior change leading to improved health practices will
facilitate and enhance the effects of service delivery system interventions. The effects of
health education are more difficult to measure but it has been widely demonstrated that
health education leads to a more effective utilization of health care and to lower levels of
morbidity of easily preventable causes. The cost per "illness" averted varies by type of
morbidity.
2 Modern contraception includes any of the following methods: hormonal methods (orals, injections, or
implants), intra-uterine devices, male and female sterilization, and barrier methods (condoms, foams,
diaphragms, etc.).



82                             Annex 10
Improved prenatal care, safe delivery and family planning are the three main
interventions designed to reduce maternal morbi-mortality in the project. All three have
been shown to be highly cost-effective in other countries, particularly when combined with
health education, as is the case in the proposed project. According to the findings of the
1993 World Development Report, Investing in Health, the annual cost per participant of
prenatal and delivery care in low-income countries would be US$90. The annual cost per
user of family planning services is US$12. The total cost per participant of prenatal,
delivery and family planning services would come to US$102 in low-income countries.
The main causes of infant deaths, i.e., birth lesions, tetanus and infections of the
newborn, can all be easily prevented with adequate prenatal and delivery care. These
causes account for one-third of all infant deaths. Other important causes of death among
children under 5 years of age are acute respiratory infections (ARI) and diarrhea
(accounting for one-quarter of all deaths), both preventable with adequate treatment,
improved nutrition, adequate breastfeeding and weaning practices, access to safe water
and health education. Thus, improved prenatal and delivery care and access to family
planning services would reduce maternal and child mortality and morbidity significantly.
Complementing these services with treatment of common infectious diseases children are
vulnerable to and health education would address most of the health problems of these
target groups. Among children under 5 years of age, one quarter of all deaths are due to
acute respiratory infections (ARI) and diarrhea, both preventable with adequate treatment,
improved nutrition, adequate breastfeeding and weaning practices, access to safe water
and health education. These interventions are also very cost-effective. Treatment of
common childhood illnesses comes to US$9 per participant, and treatment of minor
trauma for all ages up to US$6 per participant according to the 1993 World Development
Report.
The 1993 World Development Report estimates the annual cost per participant to
receive a package of services equivalent to what will be delivered under the project at
US$117 per user. The per capita annual cost of providing this package of services
(including health education, which was not costed per participant) comes to US$12. The
estimated per capita cost of providing these services within the Project will come to
US$8.70, well below the estimated average. Costs are low given the reliance on health
care personnel other than doctors (nurses and community health workers, such as
midwives), who are less expensive.
In addition to employing cost-effective interventions, the project will significantly
reduce the current costs of delivering services by reducing the incidence of complications
of induced abortion. Fertility in Paraguay, at 4.7 births per woman, is the second highest
in South America. Judging by the levels of induced abortion, the most important cause of
maternal mortality, unwanted fertility is also high. Family planning services can
significantly reduce unwanted fertility and therefore induced abortion and its
complications. Family planning services, particularly when delivered through community-
based distribution (as in the case of this project), are the most cost-effective means of
reducing maternal mortality, and improving maternal and child health. Using the average



83                                Annex 10
costs of treatment of abortion-related complications derived from elsewhere in Latin
America (an average of $400 per abortion), this implies a cost to the health system of at
least $600,000 dollars a year for the project areas alone3. Family planning services can
cost as little as US$20 per user per year.
The success of project interventions in meeting project objectives will be carefully
measured during the last year of the project. Given the poor quality of vital statistics and
service delivery data, project impact will be measured by means of baseline and endline
surveys in project areas. The Centers for Disease Control conducted a large-scale national
maternal and child health household survey in January of 1996 which will be employed as
baseline information. The same questionnaire will be applied in project areas during the
final year of project implementation. Given the five-year interval, some mortality
indicators can be measured, namely, child, infant and perinatal mortality. Some morbidity
indicators are also available including prevalence of diarrhea, acute respiratory infection,
and reproductive morbidity. In addition, indicators of coverage of professionally attended
delivery, prenatal care, tetanus toxoid immunization, family planning, child immunization,
are available as are service quality and utilization measures. The survey will also measure
population information regarding the benefits of these services and will identify the source
of that information.
D. Financial and Fiscal Impact
The Government of Paraguay invests relatively little in health. Including social
security health services, the Government of Paraguay (GOP) spent less than 2.5 percent
of GDP on health in 1994. What the Government does spend on health is also poorly
allocated. It is estimated that salaries absorb 80-85 percent of public health expenditures.
This means that there are insufficient resources to cover maintenance of facilities and
equipment, to procure pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and to train staff
The sus.ainability of project investments has been a concern from the inception of
the project. As a result, project design sought to optimize unit costs through: (a) an
expansion of maternal and child health care which relies on existing health personnel and
the incorporation of community midwives and health workers who deliver services
relatively cheaply compared to doctors; (b) using the results of a study of the network and
referral system for health facilities to guide the allocations for infrastructure rehabilitation
in order to ensure that investments are channeled to the facilities most used by the
population; (c) rehabilitating existing infrastructure instead of investing in new
construction; and (d) increasing the durability of investments by assigning greater
emphasis to maintenance of infrastructure and equipment. Cost savings are expected,
3 Health regions report between 200 and 250 treatments of complications of induced abortion per year,
yielding an average of 1200 to 1500 per year for the project areas. Underreporting of abortion and
its complications is common and thus one can assume the actual figures to be considerably higher.
The costs of US$400 for the treatment of complications of induced abortion were obtained from a
detailed study conducted in Nicaragua.



84                              Annex 10
particularly in the area of pharmaceuticals through the use of international competitive
bidding as local prices exceed international prices by a wide margin.
The only salaries to be financed by the project are for a small number of staff to
assist in project management and infrastructure maintenance. Thus the incremental annual
recurrent expenditures required when the program is in full operation is likely to be small
($1.2 million) consisting mainly of consumables (drugs and supplies) and maintenance
costs for the anticipated higher quality and level of service delivery. Not only does this
represent less than 1 percent of the current budget of the MSPBS, but it should be easily
absorbable given the potential cost savings resulting from the project's efforts to improve
maintenance and to lower the cost of drugs. In addition, the Government would gradually
take over more responsibility for recurrent costs over the life of the project given the
decreasing rate of Bank financing.
E. Risk Analysis
The main project risks are associated with: (a) the weak implementation capacity
of the Ministry at the central and regional level; (b) poor programming of counterpart and
project resources; and (c) administrative difficulties and legal barriers that could slow
project execution. The risks associated with implementation capacity are being minimized
by limiting the scope of activities and phasing their implementation, employing a detailed
Operational Manual specifying the implementation responsibilities, procedures and timing
to guide implementation, and providing technical assistance and training for MSPBS
central and regional staff. Programming of project resources will be improved through the
development of clear guidelines and procedures regarding the timing and steps required to
ensure timely access to project and counterpart funds. These arrangements will be
reviewed with the Ministry of Finance, and will be included in the Operational Manual.
Administrative delays would be reduced by ensuring PCU staff have ample training on
Bank procedures. PCU staff have already attended procurement and disbursement
seminars, and have visited other Bank projects. Additional training will be made available
prior to project start-up. In addition, the Operational Manual details all steps to be taken
with regard to procurement, disbursement, and Bank reporting. Finally, an Administrative
and Procurement Review to be held in the second year of the project will allow an early
analysis and solution to issues arising during implementation.
