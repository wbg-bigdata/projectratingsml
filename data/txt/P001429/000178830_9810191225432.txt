APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH POWER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Introduction
i.        The Government of Liberia and the Liberia Electricity Corporation
(LEC) have requested assistance in financing a power generation expansion to
cover the electricity consumption of LEC's system up to 1985. A Bank loan
of US$10 million is proposed.
ii.       The Borrower would be LEC, an autonomous Government agency, created
in 1973 and entrusted with the responsibility for generation, and distribution
of electric energy for public use in Liberia.
iii.      This would be the fourth Bank operation in the power sector of
Liberia. The first two (Loan 684-LBR of US$7.4 million in June 1970 and
778-LBR of US$4.7 million in July 1971) helped finance a 34 MW expansion of
the Mt. Coffee hydro plant, two 19 MW gas turbines at Bushrod Island, and
associated transmission and distribution facilities. The Bank made a sup-
plementary loan of US$2.9 million in 1973 to cover project cost increases
arising from (i) currency fluctuations and (ii) an increase in the size of
gas turbines chosen for installation. Physical aspects of the operations
were completed in a satisfactory manner with some minor delays. Subsequently,
however, the two 19 MW gas turbines have developed operational problems.
LEC has been able to obtain cooperation from the manufacturers in solving
these problems. The third power Loan (Loan 1150-LBR for US$1.8 million in
1975) currently underway, is providing technical assistance to improve sector
management, particularly in areas of senior staff, financial management and
development planning. As observed in the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) report (No. 1551), dated March 31, 1977, for loans 684-LBR and 778-LBR,
the institutional objectives have not been achieved--the Liberian staff is
still unable to assume senior management responsibilities, energy losses are
high, and the financial position of LEC is weak. These are serious problems.
Attention is being focused on these and other problems under the proposed
project.
The Power Sector
iv.       The gross electricity consumption in Liberia was about 1,000 GWh
in 1976 of which 62% was produced by the iron-ore and rubber industries and
38% by LEC. LEC's Monrovia System (installed capacity 138 MW) covers a
coastal strip in Western Liberia--100 km by 200 km--from Robertsport to
Buchanan. LEC also operates, on behalf of the Government, several small
provincial systems with a total generating capacity of about 8 MW. Exclud-
ing the mining consumption, annual per capita generation is 250 kWh which
compares favorably with other countries in West Africa. However, public
electricity supply is presently connected to only 10% of the country's total
population. The project includes components which would permit the connec-
tion of about 5,000 low-income households presently without electricity in



- ii -
the Monrovia area and studies for extension of service to adjoining rural
areas.
v.        LEC's main generating facilities consist of a 64 MW run-of-the-river
plant at Mt. Coffee on the St.. Paul River and a 74 MW gas turbine and diesel
electric power generation plant on Bushrod Island. Since the river flow at
Mt. Coffee is unregulated, the power output during the dry season drops con-
siderably to about 10 MW. The firm capacity of LEC's generating facilities
is therefore much lower than the installed capacity reaching only 65 MW. This
firm capacity is just sufficient to meet the current peak demand in the
Monrovia system which stands at 65 MW. Hence, additional generating capacity
will have to be provided to meet the expected load growth. The project would
address itself to this subject.
The Project
vi.       The Fourth Power Prcoject consists of seven components,  (a) a 26 MW
extension of diesel generating capacity of the Bushrod power station; (b)
service connection and arrangements for interior wiring for about 5,000 urban
poor households; (c) maintenance vehicles and tools; (d) staff training
facilities and employment of instructors; (e) employment of a management team
to assist LEC's Liberian personnel; (f) a frequency conversion study; and (g)
a study of transmission to supply the Gbarnga rural area.
vii.      The Fourth Power Project is an interim project needed to fill the
supply gap and to meet the demand forecast in the Monrovia area through 1985
until a new hydroelectric generating facility can be built. The project has
no negative impact on the environment.
viii.     The project is estimated to cost US$31.6 million with an off-shore
component of US$29.4 million. Project costs include provision for physical
and price contingencies. CofiLnancing is contemplated and several inter-
national lending agencies (EIB, BADEA and Saudi Fund) contacted by both the
Liberian Government and the Bank have approved in principle their participa-
tion. The on-shore cost of the project, amounting to US$2.2 million, will be
financed from internal cash generation.
ix.       The risks involved in implementation of the physical aspects of
the project are not greater than normal for projects of this type. The
non-physical aspects (i.e. management, training, and financial viability)
depend on finding adequate personnel and the political will to make and carry
through difficult decisions. Akppropriate assurances have been obtained from
the Government and LEC to reduce these risks to the extent possible.
x.        LEC has engaged the service of qualified consultants, Motor Columbus
(Switzerland), who are acceptable to the Bank, to assist in engineering,
preparation of bidding documents, evaluation of bid proposals, equipment
fabrication inspection, and construction supervision of the Bushrod power
station extension. Motor Columbus has had ample experience with similar
works, and with its assistance, LEC should be capable of successful execution
of this main component of the project. The implementation schedule is based



- iii -
on the need to have the first unit of the proposed extension in operation in
January 1980 at the beginning of the dry season.
xi.       All work and equipment items of the project involving foreign
financing will be procured through international competitive bidding. Items
to be financed by the Bank will be contracted through international competi-
tive bidding following the Bank's guidelines. Retroactive financing of about
US$600,000 is recommended to cover the engineering and management services.
xii.      The extension of the Bushrod power station with low-speed diesels
is the least cost solution for meeting the electricity demand forecast in
the Monrovia System through 1985, for all discount rates up to 12%. It is
also the most practical solution taking into account advantages not directly
quantifiable, such as simpler and more reliable operation. On the basis of
benefits evaluated at the current tariff level, the rate of return on invest-
ment of the power expansion project covered under the proposed loan would be
17%.
The Borrower
Organization, Staffing and Management
xiii.     In recent past several people besides the Managing Director (MD)
have been involved in LEC's operational activities. Assurances have been
obtained that MD will be permitted to exercise the management responsibilities
accorded to him under the legislation establishing LEC. The Bank would be
notified prior to appointment of MD. LEC, with a staff of about 800, is
over-staffed at the non-professional levels. LEC has agreed that there would
be no increase in non-professional staff during project implementation and
that surplus staff would be trained and productively utilized on the expanded
facilities.
xiv.      LEC is short of qualified and experienced Liberian staff at high
levels, and has to rely heavily on expatriate staff for management. Accord-
ingly, LEC/Government has recently signed a contract satisfactory to the Bank,
with Tata Consulting Engineers (India) for the provision of a management
support team. It has been agreed that (a) the management team would devote
about half of their time to training senior Liberian staff and execution of
the proposed project; (b) senior Liberians who have reasonable potential would
be given departmental responsibility, with expatriates functioning as their
advisers; for the remaining expatriate posts, a tentative schedule of Liberian-
ization and an appropriate training program would be a part of the manpower
plan which would be completed within six months of signing of the proposed
loan agreement; and (d) at least two Liberians should be identified and
prepared for each expatriate post.
Training
xv.       Agreement has been reached on essential elements of a comprehensive
training program for Liberian staff at each level. It is agreed that: (a) a



- iv -
training manager/adviser be provided as part of the management team; (b)
senior Liberians who will not immediately become departmental heads but who
are expected to do so would receive the required training; (c) a course
for supervisors currently offered by a local mining company should be util-
4zed; (d) for training technical, accounting and administrative staff, a
training school would be esta'blished on LEC premises; US$0.75 million has
been included in the project for this purpose; and (e) all staff members
receiving extended training should continue to sign employment contracts
with LEC requiring them to serve for an agreed period.
Branch Stations
xvi.      Branch stations, which are operated by LEC as an agent of the Gov-
ernment, currently face severe technical, managerial and financial problems.
The Government and LEC have agreed to continued separation of branch station
finances, pre-financing of capital expenditure and estimated losses by the
Government, recruitment of required personnel, submission of a revised fuel
transport contract, and maintaining of the recently established branch stations
department in LEC headquarters. With these agreements, it would be appropriate
for LEC to operate the branch stations.
Accounts and Audits
xvii.     LEC has been able to submit audited reports on time.  In addition to
maintaining the present covenant regarding external audit, assurance has been
obtained that LEC will forward a detailed letter to the Bank yearly, within
two months after completion of the external audit indicating the corrective
action that is being taken on issues raised by the auditors in their audit
report and the internal control report.
Finances
xviii.    The financial posit:Lon of LEC has been very weak--energy losses are
high (at about 29%), collection of accounts receivable is poor, rate of return
(1.9%) and debt service coverage (0.85) are low, and the liquidity problem has
been serious. In order to reduce energy losses, block mapping (clearing of
fraudulent consumption) would 'be continued and the legislation which treats
theft of electric energy as any other theft would be vigorously enforced.
Accounts receivable would be reduced through a vigorous disconnection program
and agreement with Government 'has been reached on a mechanism for prompt
settlement of its electricity bills. A tariff increase of 23% on non-mine
customers effective March 1, 1978, introduction of a fuel adjustment clause,
provision of a $2.8 million soft loan from the Government, and controls on
operating expenses have been agreed. Even with the introduction of these
measures the rate of return on historically valued assets is estimated to
be only 1.9% in 1977 compared to the 10% rate of return on revalued assets
required under the existing loan agreements, and 8.2% in 1978. However, based
on the assumptions outlined int this report, the return will be above 11% on
historically valued assets in each year through 1982. On completion of the
asset revaluation exercise in 1978, LEC should earn an annual rate of return
on currently valued net fixed assets of not less than 8% starting calendar



- v -
year 1979. LEC is expected to have a tight cash position through mid-1979 and
might use overdraft; however, cash position would improve thereafter. Debt
service coverage would improve from 0.85 in 1977 to 1.6 in 1978 and over 2
thereafter. Internal cash generation over the 1977-82 period would amount to
38% of total requirements. With implementation of all the measures proposed,
the overall financial position of LEC should be satisfactory.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Liberia has asked IBRD and several cofinanciers
to help finance a project of the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC), the
Government-owned utility responsible for the generation and distribution of
electricity in public consumption areas of Liberia. The project comprises:
(a) the extension of the Bushrod power station; (b) service connections
to Monrovia's urban poor population; (c) maintenance vehicles and tools;
(d) staff training; (e) employment of a management team; (f) frequency con-
version study; and (g) a study of transmission to supply the Gbarnga rural
area in northcentral Liberia.
1.02      This would be the fourth Bank Group operation in the power sector
of Liberia. The first two (Loan 684-LBR of US$7.4 million in June 1970 and
778-LBR of US$4.7 million in July 1971) helped finance a project consisting
of a 34 MW expansion of the Mt. Coffee Hydroelectric Project, two 19 MW gas
turbines for the Monrovia system, and associated transmission and distri-
bution facilities. The Bank made a supplementary loan (Loan 778A-LBR) of
US$2.9 million in 1973 to cover the project cost increase because of currency
fluctuations and an increase in the size of the gas turbines chosen for
installation. Physical aspects of the operations were completed in a satis-
factory manner with some minor delays. The two 19 MW gas turbines have
subsequently developed operational problems which are discussed later in this
report. The third power loan (Loan 1150-LBR for US$1.8 million) currently
underway is providing technical assistance to improve sector management,
particularly in the areas of senior staff, financial management, and long-
range development planning.
1.03      OED report dated March 31, 1977 for loans 684, 778 and 778A-LBR
has commented mainly on (i) lack of progress towards 'Liberianization' of
senior management, (ii) low rates of return, (iii) liquidity problem,
(iv) increase in energy losses due to illegal connections, and (v) increase
in accounts receivable. Even today these remain as serious problems. A
number of measures are proposed in Chapters 5 and 6 to deal with each of
these problems. The rate of return is expected to improve starting in 1978.
Liquidity is expected to improve substantially by 1980. However,
'Liberianization', reduction of energy losses and substantial improvement in
accounts receivable will take longer.
1.04      The proposed project was appraised in May 1977 by Messrs. A. Memon
and A. Posada. Training aspects were reviewed by Mr. Chittleburgh in August
1977.
2. THE POWER SECTOR
The Country and the Economy
2.01      The Republic of Liberia lies at the southwestern extremity of the  2
western bulge of the African continent. Its area is approximately 110,000 km
and its population is estimated at 1.6 million. The country, therefore, has a
relatively low density of population--about 15 persons per km .



- 2 -
2.02      In recent years there has been a population shift toward larger
towns. The annual population growth rate for Monrovia, the capital city, was
8% between the years 1962 and 1974 versus 3.3% for the whole country. The
majority of Liberia's population is concentrated in the Monrovia and Harbel
areas and along the principal highway connecting Monrovia with Gbarnga and
Sanniquellie in the northeastern part of the country. About 30% of the
country's population lives in urban settlements of 2,000 or more persons;
the remaining 70% lives in rural areas, and is mainly dependent on subsis-
tence farming.
2.03      The economic structure of Liberia is characterized by the co-
existence of both a modern and a traditional sector.  The modern sector--in
which iron-ore mines and rubber plantations play an important role--is based
on market-oriented productio,n and use of modern technology.  There is little
interaction between the trad:itional sector, organized on a subsistence basis,
and the modern sectors of the Liberian economy. Annual per capita income,
which averages US$450, is unevenly distributed--70% of the population has
US$100 or less.
2.04      The dominant contribution to GDP (US$840 million in 1975 at current
prices) is provided by the modern sector with 86% of the total GDP. A main
portion of this modern sector corresponds to the concessions which account
for 37% of the total GDP. Concession activities are carried out by private
investors (mainly foreign) who have specific agreements with the Government.
The largest one is iron-ore mining which contributes 28% to the total GDP.
Liberia has an abundance of iron-ore reserves and is one of the world's
largest exporters. In 1975, the exported iron-ore and concentrates--18 mil-
lion tons, with a total value of US$294 million--accounted for about 75% of
total export earnings. Three mining companies, namely LAMCO (Liberian-
American-Swedish Minerals Co.), BMC (Bong Mining Co.) and NIOC (National Iron
Ore Co.), operate in the country. About 11,000 persons are permanently
employed in this sector.
2.05      A major share of Liberia's rubber production is also controlled by
foreign interests under concessions, the largest being Firestone, a US-owned
corporation. Although the production and processing of rubber under con-
cession accounts for only US$46 million, 6% of GDP, it represents an important
source of employment and income for about 42,000 persons.
Power Sector Background
2.06      Until 1975, Liberia's public electricity supply was the responsi-
bility of the Public Utilities Authority (PUA), an autonomous statutory
corporation created in 1962 to provide Monrovia's electricity, water supply
and sewerage. Earlier PUA's role was changed to a Government holding company
with subsidiaries for power, water and sewerage, telecommunications and
broadcasting. The Power Division of PUA then became LEC. In 1975, the
Government abolished PUA and made LEC an independent corporation. LEC's
financial and managerial weaknesses which had originated under PUA, and were
the main reason for this reorganization, have not noticeably improved (see



Chapters 5 and 6). Liberian staff is still unable to assume senior management
responsibilities, electricity losses are high, and the financial position
of LEC is weak. A number of corrective measures are outlined in chapters
5 and 6 to deal with each of these problems.
2.07      LEC's Monrovia power system, i.e. the system serving a narrow
coastal area from Robertsport to Buchanan, is the main source of public power,
although LEG also operates eight secondary centers, called "branch stations",
as an agent of, and with funds provided by, the Government. LEG generates
about 37% of the country's total electric energy produced (1004 GWh in 1976)
Industrial producers--mainly the iron-ore mining and rubber companies--
produce the remaining 63%. To serve its Monrovia System demand, LEC pre-
sently has 138 MW of generating facilities, of which 64 MW are hydro and 74
MW thermal. The branch stations generating facilities are all diesel elec-
tric and total about 8 MW name plate rating.
2.08      When the mining companies started operations, PUA served only
Monrovia and could not supply their power and energy requirements as the
mining concessions were in remote areas. Consequently the companies in-
stalled their own generating facilities and were later reluctant to depend
on a power supply outside their own control. Nevertheless, LEC sells power
in bulk to one mining operation, Bong (BMC), which is closer to Monrovia than
the other companies (see Map IBRD 13140). Until the beginning of 1977, when
the exhausted mine was closed, LEC was also furnishing power to the Bomi Hills
iron-ore mining operations of the Liberian Mining Company (LMC).
2.09      The privately owned power generating facilities total 143 MW; the
principal ones being LAMCO's 48 MW (12 MW at Nimba and 36 MW at the port of
Buchanan), Bong Mine's 68 MW, and Firestone's 7 MW at Harbel rubber planta-
tion. Excepting 4 MW hydro at Harbel, all these generating facilities are
thermal (diesel). Adding LEC's installed capacity of 138 MW, the total
generating capacity installed in Liberia is therefore 281 MW, of which only
68 MW are hydro. The country is served with AC, at 60 cycles per second;
Liberia, being the only country in West Africa employing this frequency, all
other countries use 50 cycles per second.
2.10      The role of mining and its impact on power consumption (commerce,
especially in Monrovia), is reflected by the annual power generation per
capita of 630 kWh which is unusually high for a country with such a low
level of income. Excluding the mining systems, the generation per capita
is 250 kWh a relatively high specific consumption for West Africa. Public
electricity supply presently serves 15 towns with some 400,000 people,
(about 25% of the total population of Liberia) only 40% of whom live in
households with a connection. The degree of electricity coverage is, there-
fore, very low, reaching only about 10% of the country's population. The
project addresses itself to this situation, particularly to providing connec-
tions for urban poor households and studies for extension of service to
adjoining rural areas. Rural areas are primarily served by branch stations
(para 2.15).

Energy Resources
2.11      The only indigenous source of energy, hydro electricity, is limited.
There is little slope in the river valleys and stream flow varies widely
between the six-month rainy and dry seasons. Except for the Mano and Cavalla
rivers bordering Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast respectively, there are no
favorable sites for storage. The national hydroelectric potential located
wholly in Liberian territory is estimated at about 1,300 GWh per year with
limited storage. The installation of about 220 MW at an average capacity
factor of 67% would be possible but only about 50 MW of this capacity would
be firm. Substantial parallel investment in thermal plant would still be
needed to firm up hydro-electric production. The hydroelectric potential of
the Mano and Cavalla rivers, which would be divided equally with Liberia's
neighbors, is estimated at 2,000 GWh per year; installed capacity would be of
the order of 500 MW, 50% of which would be firm. Altogether, Liberia's
hydroelectric potential can, therefore, be assessed at about 2,300 GWh
average annual production capability and 175 MW firm power capacity (paras
2.17-2.20).
Existing Facilities
Monrovia Power System
2.12      The Monrovia Power System serves the capital city of Monrovia
(population 240,000); Buchanan (population 35,000) the railhead and port for
the LAMCO operations; Kakata (population 5,000), a small but important trad-
ing center northeast of Monrovia; the international airport at Robertsfield
in the center of Firestone's Harbel operations; and the BMC concession area.
Robertsport will soon be connected to the Monrovia System.
2.13      LEC's Monrovia System consists of:  the Mt. Coffee hydroelectric
power plant on the St. Paul river, equipped with four units, two 15 MW and
two 17 MW; and (b) the Bushrod thermal power station with four gas turbine
units, one 13 MW, one 14 MW, and two 19 MW, plus five diesel electric units
with a total capacity of 9 MW. Mt. Coffee is a run-of-river plant with
pondage for limited peaking operation; during the rainy season (lasting from
May to November) the river's flow normally exceeds the requirements of the
four existing units, but in the dry season it drops to a level where only one
unit can be run at about 10 MW power output. While the 13 MW and 14 MW gas
turbine units at Bushrod have operated satisfactorily the availability record
of the two 19 MW units purchased with funds from Loan 684-LBR has been very
poor; the serious problems which account for this are discussed in Annex 1.
LEC has been able to obtain cooperation from the manufacturer in correcting
these p blems. On the assumption that both of these units will be in
normal working condition and that both units will be normally available during
dry seasons 1/ (at least for a limited number of hours of peaking operations)
1/   The gas turbines will operate only for peaking duty once the proposed
project is implemented. Moreover, these units will be operating in a
more stable electric system due to the large inertia of the new proposed
units and, therefore, will be less subject to thermal and mechanical
stress from frequent tripping as is presently the case.



the Monrovia System's present firm capacity is 65 MW (Annex 15). This firm
capacity is just sufficient to meet the current peak demand of the system
which stands at 65 MW, so that additional generating capacity will have to be
provided to meet expected load growth. This is the principal justification
for the project.
2.14      LEC's transmission and high voltage distribution network has been
improved with the help of Bank Loans 684-LBR and 778-LBR, and a Credit from
KfW; it consists of 450 km of 69 kV transmission lines (see Map IBRD 13140)
and 1,400 km of 12.5 kV distribution feeders. The 69/12.5 kV installed
transformer capacity is shown in Annex 4. Monrovia's downtown area is served
by an underground distribution system. LEC has applied to KfW for an addi-
tional credit of US$2.6 million to complete this underground distribution
system. Secondary distribution voltage is 120 V, although, voltage in the
downtown area will be stepped-up to 220 V when the underground system is
completed. Altogether the transmission and distribution network is ade-
quate to handle the medium-range loads foreseen through 1985.
Branch Power Systems
2.15      The eight small centers operated by LEC on behalf of the Govern-
ment are not connected to Monrovia's grid. Most of the diesel electric
units in these small systems are worn-out or require complete overhauls;
LEC has presented to the Government a program to improve the situation in
the short run by replacing some of the generating units and by creating a
new department to supervise the operation of these branch stations (see
also para. 5.10). LEC has decided to complete the 69 kV line from Monrovia
to Robertsport, of which about two thirds already exist, and to study the
extension of electric service from Mt. Coffee to Gbarnga; in both cases the
small generating sets will be phased out.
The Power Market - Monrovia System
2.16      Development of LEC's Monrovia System was affected by an abrupt
change in growth pattern in 1973. Until the oil crisis, electricity demand
had developed rapidly (at an annual rate of 12% between 1969 and 1973), as a
result of industrialization in the capital city area. However, growth was
sharply affected by high tariff increases (40% to 60% in 1974) and by slug-
gishness in economic activity reflecting the world-wide recession, and fell
to an annual rate of 3% during the period 1974-1976 (the tariff increases
were introduced to compensate for the high cost of thermal generation caused
by the steep increase in petroleum fuel prices and by the lower than average
hydro-electric generation due to the Sahelian drought of 1972/73). Electri-
city generation reached 384 GWh in 1976 with a peak demand of 65 MW. Recent
studies by LEC's consultants, Motor Columbus, indicate that electricity
generation will tend to grow during the next decade at a somewhat faster rate
(7% per year) than it has in the last three years, and will reach 686 GWh in
1985 with a peak demand of 112 MW. This forecast is reasonable and has been
developed both by adding up demand projections by consumer categories and
special loads, and by macroeconomic correlation. Annex 4 provides details on



- 6 -
which the forecast is based, as well as statistical data on past generation by
sources of energy, peak demand, sales by categories of consumers, and losses.
The Table below summarizes the main features of the market.

between 1969 and 1973 is due to re-classification of consumers in 1970,
and energy conservation measures in Government offices.

/4   Decline in this category is due to the closure of the LMC's mining
operation.
Note: ( ) indicates negative figures.
The above tabulation shows that electric energy sales to residential consumers
decreased in recent years. Such a trend cannot be explained solely by economic
recession or tariff increases; it originates mainly in the increasing un-
accounted for consumption of energy (reflected in the very high total losses--
29%--in 1976) which probably took place in the category of residential
customers. After taking normal line losses into consideration, the unaccounted
for consumption has been estimated at 50 GWh in 1976, representing about 13%
of net generation. If this type of consumption is added to residential sales,
a more normal growth pattern of 5% per annum results for the period 1969/76.
Based on these considerations, residential usage, including illegal connec-
tions, is projected at an average annual rate of growth of 5% for the period
1976/85 which results in an 8% per year increase in sales taking into account
the projected reduction in losses to 23% by 1985 (see Annex 4),

24,000 households. There is evidence that a number of urban poor concentrated
in certain areas of Monrovia already have access to electricity through
illegal connections.

2.24      The provision of service to about 5,000 hitherto unserved low-income
households (representing approximately 50,000 people) in areas with already
existing low-tension lines is a feature of the proposed project. For this
purpose, measures would be devised by LEC, with the assistance of consultants
(para. 3.18), to make these service extensions possible. These measures would
include, inter alia (a) exempting low income households from payment of
connection charges, including deposit and (b) providing financing for interior
wiring installations (of the bare minimum type) through LEC or Government, to
be recovered through monthly installments on the electricity bills.   The cost
of the connections between the network and households would be included in
LEC's rate base and recovered through tariffs; the off-shore component of the
cost of these connections would be financed under the proposed loan, for which
an amount of US$350,000 has been provided. Details of the plan for providing
service to the urban poor keeping in view their ability to pay, and its imple-
mentation will developed by LEC in consultation with the Bank. Assurances
were obtained from the Government/LEC that by June 1979 (a) LEC would commence
to install current-limiting devices at all new connections to low income
households where montrhly consumption of electricity is expected not to exceed
40 kwh (b) connection charges for hitherto unserved low-income households will
be eliminated and that arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for financing of
their interior wiring installations will be made; and (c) a social block of
tariffs will be introduced so that monthly electricity bill of target group of
urban poor will not exceed their capacity to pay e.g. 5% of their income.
Sector Objectives
2.25      Against this background, the major sector objectives to be pursued
at this time may be summarized as follows: (i) Increase generating capacity
as soon as possible to meet expected demand in the Monrovia System; (ii)
Plan an orderly future generating expansion; (iii) Extend in the short-run
the Monrovia System to nearby secondary rural centers (giving second priority
to the extension of supply to more outlying rural districts); (iv) Extend
electric supply to a wider section of population particularly the urban poor
in Monrovia; (v)  Improve LEC s management including a program of gradual
Liberianization; and (vi) Maintain the financial viability of LEC.
3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The project proposed for Bank financing comprises seven components:
(a) extension of the Bushrod power station; (b) service connections and
arrangements for financing installation of interior wiring for urban poor
households in Monrovia; (c) provision of maintenance vehicles and tools; (d)
staff training facilities and instructors; (e) employment of a management
support team; (f) frequency conversion study; and (g) study of transmission
to supply the Gbarnga rural area in northcentral Liberia. Each of the com-
ponents is discussed below and detailed in Annex 2. The location of the
physical components of the project is shown on Map IBRD 13140.



- 10 -
A.   Bushrod Power Station Extension
3.02      The main component of the project would consist of a 26 MW diesel
electric extension of the existing Bushrod power station which is located on
Bushrod Island about eight km north of Monrovia.
3.03      The civil engineering works for this extension would be designed
to accomodate three 13 MW units, although initially only two would be in-
stalled. The generating units would be 13.8 kV, 60 cycles per sec., driven
by low-speed two-stroke diesel engines designed to burn heavy fuel oil.
Sea water will be used for cooling. The generators will be connected to the
existing 69 kV switchyard through 13.8/69 kV step up transformers. The units
will be designed to convert ito 50 cycles per second operation at a later date.
B.   Service to Urban Poor
3.04      This component is intended to provide offshore cost of the connec-
tions between the network and households of about 5,000 hitherto unserved
low-income families in Monrovia. Disbursement for this component will be
conditional upon completion of arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for
financing of interior wiring installations for urban poor (para. 2.24).
C.   Maintenance Vehicles and Tools
3.05      This component is Lntended to provide vehicles and tools to ade-
quately equip the crews dealing with customer service connection and discon-
nection, and with the controL of fraudulent electricity consumption (see para.
6.04-6.07), it would include about ten utility vehicles of diverse types,
tools for distribution work (Annex 2), testing stands and workshop facilities
for testing and repairing meters and other instruments.
D.   Staff Training
3.06      This component would include the establishment of a formal training
school for LEC personnel (see para. 5 07).  It is proposed to construct a
modest school building of about 600 m with classrooms and workshops, to
provide appropriate training equipment, and 12 man-years of expatriate
instructors.
E.   Employment of Management Support Team
3.07      This component would provide about 25 man-years of expatriate
assistance to replace the expatriate management team hired under Loan 1150-LBR
whose contracts expired in 1977 (para. 5.03-5.04). Half of the time of this
team is planned to be devoted to training activities and project execution.
F.   Frequency Conversion Studvy
3.08      The proposed project includes about six man-months of consultant
assistance to carry out a study of the cost, timing, and economics of



- 11 -
changing the frequency (60 cycles per second) to 50 cycles per second, to
help the Liberian Authorities to make a decision on this matter. Power
interconnection with neighboring countries and the development of the hydro-
electric potential of the rivers bordering Liberia with Ivory Coast and Sierra
Leone would be facilitated if the frequency is standardized at the 50 cycles
per second used by all other countries in West Africa.
G.   Study of Transmission of the Gbarnga Rural Area
3.09      This component of the project would consist of:  (i) the feasibility
studies of a possible transmission line from the Mt. Coffee power plant to
Gbarnga (175 km) and associated rural distribution system to replace present
high cost diesel generation; and (ii) engineering design and tender documents
if the results of the feasibility studies are found to be satisfactory.
Project Cost
3.10      The project, comprising the seven components described in paras.
3.02 to 3.09, is estimated to cost a total of US$31.55 million, including
US$29.38 million in off-shore costs. The cost of the major component of the
project, the Bushrod power station extension, is estimated at US$28.65 million
with an off-shore cost of US$26.93 million. The cost estimates assume that
the power station extension would be executed in accordance with the project
implementation schedule in Annex 3. The cost estimates, including contingen-
cies, are summarized in the table shown on the following page. The cost
estimates exclude all duties and taxes; the Government will reimburse LEC of
any import duties or taxes paid by LEC.   Assurances to this effect were
obtained during negotiations.
3.11      The base line costs (in terms of early 1978 price levels) estimated
for the Bushrod power station extension were established by LEC's consultants,
Motor Columbus.  The base line costs estimate for the civil engineering works
has been developed using the bill of quantities of the tender documents and
the technical specifications for each piece of work. For the mechanical and
electrical works, proforma quotations were obtained from reputable manufac-
turers; the quotations were then compared with recent supplies for the same
type of equipment. Bids for the civil works and the equipment were received
in February 1978. Results of the bidding are in line with the costs estimate
in the present report. The engineering services cost is based on the existing
contract with Motor Colombus which provides for 154 man-months of professional
assistance at US$6,000 per man-month. The estimate includes physical con-
tingencies amounting to 13% for civil works and 5% for equipment. In order to
take into account future cost escalation, price contingencies have been pro-
vided at the rate of 7% (1978), 6.5% (1979) and 6% (1980) for equipment and at
the rates of 8% (1978), 7.5% (1979) and 7% (1980) for civil works.
3.12      The cost of the service connection and interior wiring for the low-
income households component is estimated at about US$100 per household. The
cost estimate for the maintenance vehicles and tools component has been
established on the basis of a preliminary list of requirements presented by
LEC.

building facilities and workshops, US$0.15 million in equipment and US$0.6
million for 12 man-years (at US$50,000 per man-year) of expatriate instruc-
tors.   Ie foreign cost of the. management team is estimated at US$60,000
per man-year or a total of US$1.5 million. About 50% of the work of this
team would be directly relatedl to the operation of LEC, the other 50% would
be spert on training of Liber:Lan staff and execution of the proposed project.
Accordingly, US$0.75 million (50% of total) is included in the cost estimate
of the project, and would be capitalized.



- 13 -
3.14      The frequency conversion study would require about six man-months at
US$6,000 per man-month plus travel and expenses. An amount of US$50,000 has
been provided in the cost estimate for this study. Engineering services for
the study of transmission to the Gbarnga area were calculated at US$500 per km
(approximate length of the line, 170 km), including surveying and soil test-
ing; the latter were based on actual costs of similar studies.
Implementation Schedule
3.15      The project's implementation schedule is based on the need to have
the first unit of the Bushrod power plant extension in operation in January
1980 at the beginning of the dry season and the second unit one year later,
in January 1981 (see para. 2.21). The time schedule for the Bushrod extension
is therefore tentatively planned as follows:

Commissioning of second unit                        December 1980
Annex 3 shows the implementation schedule for each component of the project.
Completion of the project would be in March 1981.
Status of Project
3.16      LEC has retained the services of Motor Columbus for the feasibility
studies of the new generating facility and for the preparation of conceptual
design, technical specifications and tender documents. Motor Columbus com-
pleted the feasibility studies and conceptual design in March 1977 and has
prepared the technical specifications and tender documents.
Prolect Execution
3.17      LEC has entrusted the construction supervision of the Bushrod
extension to Motor Columbus, who will also provide inspection services at the
manufacturer's premises. The supply of equipment, its installation, and the
necessary civil works will be done under contracts. Regarding the Bushrod
extension, three contracts are contemplated for (i) diesel engines and mecha-
nical equipment (US$14.86 million); (ii) generators and electrical equipment
(US$4.37 million); and (iii) civil works (US$7.92 million). The values of
these contracts are total off-shore and on-shore costs. The estimates for the
equipment contracts include transport, installation, and physical and price
contingencies; the amount for the civil works contract includes physical and
price contingencies.
3.18      LEC will employ an individual consultant to prepare the program for
connecting urban poor households in the Monrovia area and to provide these



- 14 -
households with interior wiring. It is estimated that three man-months (at
US$5,000 per man-month) will be required for this purpose. The implementation
of the program will be carried out by LEC's own personnel. The prQject pro-
vides funds for vehicles and tools for this task.
3.19      Contractors, under LEC supervision, will build the facilities for
the training school. Engineering consultants will be employed by LEC for the
study of the transmission line to Gbarnga. Based on the experience of fre-
quency conversion studies in other countries, LEC will request an electriq
utility which has undergone a frequency changeover to provide two specialists
in this field. One specialist will examine the physical problems associated
with the frequency changeover and the second, the economic and financial
implications.
Project Financing
3.20      It is assumed that the off-shore cost component of the proposed
project, amounting to US$29.4 million, would be financed by foreign loans.
Tentative commitments have been obtained from the EIB, BADEA and the Saudi
Fund; EIB will contribute up to US$5.0 million to finance jointly with the
Bank the contracts for electrical equipment and for civil works; BADEA and
the Saudi Fund will finance jointly about US$15.0 million for the mechanical
equipment contract. The Bank's contribution of US$10.0 million will be used
as follows: (a) US$6.1 million for the electrical and civil works contract
and (b) US$3.9 million for engineering services and other components of
the project. On-shore costs amounting to approximately US$2.1 million will
be financed from LEC's internal cash generation.
3.21      The project's financing has been tentatively apportioned as follows:

Procurement and Disbursement
3.22      All work and equipment involving foreign financing would be procured
through international competitive bidding. Items to be financed jointly by
the Bank and EIB would be contracted through international competitive bidding
open to manufacturers of all Bank member countries and Switzerland in accord-
ance with the "Guideline for Procurement under World Bank Loans and IDA
Credits." Items financed by the Arab Agencies, would be contracted through
international competitive bidding following these agencies procurement guide-
lines. Consultants will be employed on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank. Bids for the Bushrod extension contracts were received and opened
publicly in Monrovia on February 16, 1978. LEC's consultants, Motor Columbus,
have completed the evaluation of the bids and submitted to LEC their recommen-
dation for the award of the contracts. LEC has accepted these recommendations.
The Bank has been kept informed of all proceedings, which conform to Bank's
guidelines for procurement.
3.23      The proposed Bank Loan would be disbursed as follows:

3.24      As the project components proposed for Bank financing should be
completed by March 1981, at the time of the commissioning of the second unit
of the Bushrod power station extension, a closing date of June 1982 is pro-
posed to allow for final payment to contractors at the end of the warranty
period of 12 months. The schedule of disbursement is given in Annex 5.
Disbursements will be fully documented. In order to ensure commissioning of
the first unit in January 1980, it was necessary to begin early on design
work, specifications and preparation of tender documents. Also, the new
management support team is required as soon as possible since several ex-
patriates have already left. Retroactive financing of about US$600,000 is
recommended to cover (i) the cost (US$500,000) of engineering services provided
by Motor Columbus from January 1977 and (ii) the cost of management services
from June 1977 (US$100,000).

Environmental Impact
3.25      The diesel-electric units proposed for installation in the Bushrod
power station extension use heavy fuel oil which is not clean burning, how-
ever, the plant is located on an island away from dense housing and in a
location where a fairly strong breeze disperses the fumes of the engines.
Project Risks
3.26      The risks involved in the implementation of the physical aspects of
the project are not greater than normal for projects of this type, since all
phases of the work will be supervised by a reputable consultants acceptable
to the Bank. As in the case of the previous projects the non-physical
aspects of the project, i.e. management, training and financial viability,
can be seriously affected by difficulties in finding adequate personnel or
the lack of political will to make and carry through difficult decisions
regarding management, tariff adjustment, prosecution for theft of electricity
and cost control. Appropriate assurances have been obtained from the Govern-
ment and LEC during negotiations in the form of covenants to reduce the risks
to the extent possible. However, it must be recognized that in spite of
efforts to anticipate possible problems and devise measures to control them,
many risks still remain. Obviously there are no guarantees. (See Chapters 5
and 6.)
4. JUSTIFICATION
Bushrod Power Plant Extension
Demand and Available Supply
4.01      The Bank has reviewed the electric demand forecast prepared by Motor
Columbus, LEC's consultant, for the Monrovia System for the period 1976 to
1985, and concluded that the Eorecast is reasonable (see para. 2.16). LEC's
Monrovia System load growth is expected to average 7% per annum over the
forecast period reaching a peak demand of about 112 MW in 1985. Failure to
meet this load would seriously inhibit industrial and commercial develop-
ment. At present, there is no surplus of firm capacity in the Monrovia System
(since a firm capacity of 65 MW is just sufficient to meet the present peak
demand which stands also at 65 MW) and additional generating capacity is
required as soon as possible. The project, therefore, is urgently needed to
help meet the projected increment in demand.
Least Cost Solution
4.02      As indicated in paragraph 2.21, LEC has no alternative but to in-
stall additional thermal capacity because of the long lead time needed for a
new hydroelectric development. A steam power plant presents a similar prob-
lem of long lead time for imp:Lementation, although, somewhat shorter (4-4.5
years) than for a hydro-scheme. Hence, the choice of a technically feasible



- 17 -
generating plant is narrowed to the following alternatives: (a) low speed
diesel, (b) medium speed diesel and (c) gas turbines.
4.03      Despite the different characteristics of the three types of prime
movers, all can be considered technically suitable for the extension of the
Bushrod power station. The low-speed diesel (100-250 rpm) engine has a higher
investment cost per net kW (see para. 4.10) than medium-speed (400-500 rpm)
diesel engines (from 25 to 33% higher) or gas turbines (3 times higher).
However, the higher investment cost is compensated by a longer lifetime (40
years versus 20 years for medium-speed diesels and gas turbines), lower
operating cost, more robust and simpler design, which increases not only the
reliability of operation but also contributes to the extension of intervals
between over-hauls and the fact that low cost heavy fuel oil can be burn
readily in these low-speed units. The medium-speed units also can burn heavy
fuel oil which requires special treatment or lighter but more expensive fuel.
Moreover, medium speed units require more careful maintenance which is diffi-
cult to insure at Bushrod. The gas turbines' low investment cost per in-
stalled kW is offset by a shorter lifetime, a higher heat rate (about twice
that of large diesel units) and the use of light fuel oil (costing about 25%
more than heavy fuel oil).
4.04      In Liberia it is important to have equipment which assures reliable
and continuous service during the dry season and which is as simple as pos-
sible to operate and control; another important factor is the need for simple
maintenance in order to avoid the use of highly qualified personnel--both
expensive and difficult to find--and to reduce standstill times. Based on
technical characteristics and operating and maintenance aspects at equal
cost, the following would be the order of precedence for selecting the prime
movers for the units of the Bushrod power station extension would be: 1) low
speed diesels, 2) medium speed diesels and 3) gas turbines.
4.05      A comparison of the present value of the costs of the three alter-
natives considered to produce the same output shows that for all discount
rates up to 15% and based on 4,000 hours annnual usage after 1985 the
proposed solution of low-speed diesel units costs less than the medium-speed
diesel units and the gas turbines. Assuming a low level of utilization (2,500
hours per year), the equalizing discount rate is 12%. Annex 4 gives the
details of the analysis. Thus, the low-speed diesels constitute the least
cost solution for discount rates above the opportunity cost of capital in
Liberia of 10%.
4.06      A sensitivity analysis shows that the low and medium speed diesels
are economically equivalent if the estimated cost for the main parameters
involved in the cost comparison such as capital, maintenance and fuel cost
of the low speed diesel increase by 17%, 78% or 19% respectively, maintaining
the corresponding cost for the medium speed diesel unchanged; a situation that
has a low probability of occurrence as cost increases normally would affect
both alternatives.

Return on Investment
4.07      The return on investment required to serve the incremental power
demand served by the Bushrod power station extension (1980/85), which is
nart of the proposed project, has been calculated by equalizing the present
worth of costs (investment and operation) and the present worth of benefits.
The revenues and operating cost for the period beyond 1985 have been calculated
on the basis of the contribution of thermal generation required under average
hydrological conditions.  As indicated in paragraph 2.14, LEC's present
distribution capacity is sufEicient to serve the incremental demand for the
period 1980/85, therefore, with the exception of the investment required for
low income household connections (para. 3.04), no additional investment was
considered for distribution in the computation, because the existing distribu-
tion facilities, measured in terms of kVA transformer capacity in distribution
substations exceed by 100% the generating capacity including the proposed
project. The benefits have been evaluated on the basis of the incremental
consumption at the average price paid at present by the ultimate consumers.
This is a minimum estimate of benefits because the consumers' surplus portion
of the consumers willingness to pay has been ignored. Attachment 6 of Annex 4
shows the basic assumptions used in the rate of return calculation. Fuel
costs have been evaluated on the basis of early 1977 international prices.
Under such assumptions, the rate of return on investments as defined above is
13%. With a 23% increase in non-mine tariffs, no significant reduction in
demand is expected. The rate of return would be about 17%.
4.08      A sensitivity  analysis has been made, based on existing tariffs, to
determine the percentage of variation of the most important factors involved
(capital cost, volume of sales and shadow exchange rate), that will result in
a rate of return on investment of 10%. The results are as follows: Capital
cost + 25%; Sales - 11%; Exchainge rate (percentage over market value) + 13%.
An increase in capital cost in excess of 25% in this case is unlikely because
of the clearly defined nature of the project and the relatively small amount
of civil works involved. A decrease in sales below 11% is not probable since
the growth in demand is projected at a fairly low rate (7%) which is exceeded
in practically all countries. Considering the open nature of the Liberian
economy and the low level of customs duties, it is also unlikely that the
shadow price of off-shore coslts would exceed 13% over market prices. Variations
in fuel prices do not affect ithe return on investment since any increase in
fuel costs is passed automatically to the consumers by means of the fuel
adjustment provision of the tariff and no significant drop in demand is
expected for anticipated fuel price increases.
4.09      The investment cost of the proposed low speed diesel generating
units for the first stage of the Bushrod station expansion (two 13 MW units)
is estimated at US$820 per kW, including a step-up substation. The combined
investment cost for the first and second stages (three 13 MW units) is
estimated at US$785 per kW.

5. THE BORROWER
Organization
5.01      LEC is vested with the responsibility for generation, transmission
and distribution of electricity for public use throughout the whole country.
So far LEC has exercised the prerogative only in Monrovia and the surrounding
area. It also manages branch stations as an agent of the Government ( paras.
2.07, 2.15 and 5.10). LEC has a nine-member Board of Directors consisting
of the Minister of Finance (Chairman), Ministers of Justice, Public Works
and Planning, Managing Director of LEC and four other representatives of public
and private sectors appointed by the President. In the past, operational
management lay with the Managing Director. However, recently the Ministry
of Finance, Comptroller General of public enterprises and members of LEC's
Board of Directors have become increasingly involved in LEC's operational
activities. In future the MD will be permitted to exercise his executive and
management responsibilities fully and effectively, and (b) the role of the
Board would be limited to formulation of policies and direction of management
as defined in the Act establishing LEC.
Staff
5.02      LEC has a staff of about 800, i.e., one employee per about 19 con-
sumers, which is high. The staff consists of 72 professionals (managers,
engineers, accountants); the others being non-professionals. There is a clear
over-staffing at non-professional levels. Assurance has been obtained from
LEC that the number of non-professional staff would not be increased during
project implementation and that surplus staff would be trained (para. 5.07(d))
and productively utilized on the expanded facilities.
Management
5.03      LEC is, however, short of qualified and experienced Liberian manage-
ment personnel, and has to rely heavily on expatriate staff. Liberianization
of Senior Management has turned out to be more difficult than anticipated
earlier. One objective of Loan 1150-LBR was to help LEC obtain experienced
managerial staff to improve its operations, strengthen its management and to
train Liberian staff to fill key management positions. To accomplish this,
eight expatriates were recruited. However, this experience has not been
successful because (a) the eight persons who were recruited individually did
not operate as a team, even though there was individual loyalty to LEC;
(b) support for the management decreased with the death of one Finance
Minister, and the resignation of another, both of whom had played key roles in
its recruitment; and (c) separation of responsibilities was not clearly
defined between the MD and the General Manager which led to personality and
other conflicts between them. It is recognized by both the Government and
LEC's new MD that expatriate assistance is necessary for the proper management
of LEC.



- 20 -
5.04      In view of this, the consensus is that the vacancies should be
filled L; a team preferably seconded from an electric utility company rather
than by individual recruitment because (a) the staff of such a team would have
job security in their company; (b) an unsatisfactory or unhappy employee
could be more easily replaced; (c) there would likely be team cooperation; and
(d) LEC would have the backin,g of an experienced utility with its far greater
resources. Accordingly, the Government and LEC have recently signed a con-
tract with Tata Consulting Engineers, a division of Tata Sons Ltd. of India.
Tata Group owns and successfuLly operates a large electric power system in and
around Bombay. They have (a) experience in the operation and development of
hydro, gas turbine and diesel generation; (b) English-speaking staff; (c) an
organization large enough to second the required staff; and (d) familiarity
with problems of developing countries.
5.05      Under the contract Tata would initially provide a management support
team of five highly qualified managers. The team will be supplemented by
other specialists as and when they are required. It has been agreed that
(a) the management support team would devote half of its time to operations of
LEC and the other half to training senior Liberian staff and execution of the
proposed project (see para. 5.07). For this purpose US$750,000, approximately
50% of the off-shore cost of the new management team over the next three
years, has been provided under the proposed project; (b) Liberianization
should be viewed as a long-te¶nm objective over several years. However, senior
Liberians who have reasonable potential should soon be given departmental
responsibility, with expatriates functioning as their advisers. For the re-
maining expatriate posts, a tentative schedule of Liberianization along with
an appropriate program of training would be a part of the manpower plan re-
ferred to in para 5.08; (c) LEGlC would identify and prepare at least two
Liberians for each expatriate post in order to ensure that at least one
qualified and adequately motivated individual would be available to replace
the expatriates; (d) the present expatriate position of General Manager should
become Senior Advisor to the MED and should be held by the management support
team co-ordinator. With this exception, the present organizational structure
should be continued for the tSime being. It should be reviewed and modified if
necessary after cconsultation with LEC, the incoming management team, and
the Bank; and (e) the Government would notify the Bank reasonably in advance
before making any appointment to the post of MD.
Training and Manpower Planning,
5.06      Training was one of the major objectives of Loan 1150-LBR to LEC,
but the expatriate managers, unider pressure of day to day work, were not
succes-ful in training junior or senior Liberian staff. In 1976, the National
Rural    :trification Association of USA completed a manpower development plan
for LEC. Based on this plan, a few months ago LEC initiated an ad hoc train-
ing program under which about 20 staff members at various levels are currently
undergoiag different types of technical training. While this is helpful, it
is not sufficient to meet LEC's needs.



- 21 -
5.07      It is therefore proposed to organize a comprehensive training
program aimed at all levels of staff. A program of adequate scope to provide
the quantity and quality of training needed will provide permanent results
only in the long term. Such a program, some essential elements of which
appear in Annex 16, has been agreed with LEC and Government during negotia-
tions. In brief it is agreed that: (a) a training manager/adviser be
provided as part of the management team; (b) senior Liberians who will not
immediately become departmental heads but who are expected to do so at a later
time should receive the required training; (c) a course for supervisors
currently offered by a local mining company should be utilized; (d) for
training technical, accounting and administrative staff, a training school
should be established on LEC premises; US$0.75 million has been included in
the project for this purpose; and (e) all staff members receiving extended
training should continue to sign employment contracts with LEC requiring them
to serve for an agreed period.
5.08      In order to determine its present and future needs, LEC has agreed
to revise its draft manpower program for its personnel with the help of the
management support team and furnish it to the Bank for comments within six
months from the date of the Loan Agreement.
Branch Stations
5.09      As discussed in paras. 2.07 and 2.15, LEC, as an agent of the Gov-
ernment, operates eight branch stations scattered in rural areas of the
country. These stations face severe technical, managerial and financial
problems: equipment breakdowns are frequent and repairs take months; system
losses are in excess of 50% primarily due to illegal connections and in-
accurate billing; production costs in 1976 amounted to about 34 cents/kWh
while average revenue was about 8 cents/kWh. The high production costs are
explained, among other reasons, by the pilfering of fuel (valued at about
$600,000 during 1976) and excessive transport charges. The Government is slow
in reimbursing LEC for capital and operating costs.
5.10      The Government would like LEC to continue to manage the branch
stations. To regularize arrangements and improvve operational efficiency,
the Government and LEC have agreed to the following:
(a) continued separation of branch station finances;
(b) prefinancing of all budgeted capital and operating losses
by the Government;
(c) immediate training of personnel and completion of
recruitment of qualified managers for each station,
within 10 months from the date of the loan agreement;
(d) submission to the Bank of an acceptable fuel transport
contract containing measures to ensure reasonable charges
for delivery and elimination of fuel pilferage; and



- 22 -
(e) maintaning of the recently established Branch Station
Department in LEC headquarters in order to provide
adequate supervision of branch operations.
Insurance
5.11      LEC is insured for Eire, lightening and explosion for all genera-
ting stations, main substations and fuel storage tank on Bushrod Island.  The
coverage is increased periodically to reflect realistic values of assets
based on replacement costs. ]LEC also makes regular provision for its self-
insurance reserve to cover costs of major repairs. LEC is now evaluating a
proposal from its insurance broker on whether to extend its commercial in-
surance coverage or to increase its provision to self-insurance reserve.
LEC's approach to the problem is satisfactory. Adequacy of insurance coverag¢
will be followed up regularly during supervision.
Accounts and Audit
5.12      About two years ago the Government introduced a uniform accounting
system for all public corporations including LEC; the new system is more
oriented to internal management and cost centers than the previous system, and
is working well.
5.13      Under terms of the three existing Loan Agreements, LEC is requlred
to revalue fixed assets from time to time for the purpose of computing rates
of return. Recently, LEC's consultants Messrs. Coopers and Lybrand (U.K.) in
conjunction with the engineering firm of Merz and McLellan (U.K.) have carried
out the physical count and evaluation of the fixed assets,  Their draft repprt
is awaited. Assurance has been obtained during negotiations that the results
of the asset revaluation will be incorporated in the 1978 accounts and audit.
5.14      In accordance with provisions of the existing loans, LEC is able
to provide the Bank with audited accounts within four months after the end
of the year. The audit arrangements are satisfactory. The auditors have
repeatedly drawn attention to: (a) large energy losses; (b) inadequacy of
provision for uncollectable accounts; and (c) required improvement in billing.
A number of steps are now proposed to deal with these problems (para 6.04-6.11).
In order to ensure timely action on future comments by the auditors, the
existing covenant on audit report has been supplemented by requiring LEC to
forward to the Bank annually aL detailed letter within two months after comple-
tion of the external audit, indicating the corrective action being taken on
issues raised by the auditors in their Audit and the Internal Control Report.
Tariffs
5.15      The present tariff schedule, shown in Annex 7 has been in force
since March 1978. It consists of five consumer categories: (i) residential and
small commercial; (ii) large commercial and industrial; (iii) Government; (iv)
street lights; and (v) mines. Average price/kWh is about 7 cents (US).



- 23 -
5.16      Under the terms of Loan 1150-LBR, LEC and consultants completed a
tariff study in November 1976. The study was based on the analysis of fully
allocated historical costs rather than long-run marginal costs. As a result
of the study, LEC plans to restructure tariffs to classify customers accord-
ing to voltage level rather than nature of use and a fuel cost adjustment
clause has been recently introduced. These are steps in the right direction;
however, further restructuring of the tariff to incorporate a social block to
supply the needs of low income consumers plus a high consumption block based
on long-run marginal cost are also desirable. LEC and the Government are
receptive to these questions, which will be further reviewed in the context of
providing electric service to the urban poor (para. 3.04).
5.17      With regards to mining consumption LEC has ten-year firm and second-
ary hydropower contracts with Bong Mines. The firm power contract includes a
fuel adjustment clause. LEC currently collects US4.53 4/kWh for firm power
(compared to an overall average rate of 7 4/kWh) and 2.3 i/kWh for secondary
power. The next review of rates under the contract is scheduled for 1979;
however, LEC is currently in the process of exploring the possibilities of
sharing of the recent tariff increase with Bong Mines. Intervention by the
Bank is not proposed.
6. FINANCES
General
6.01      The financial performance of LEC remains weak--energy losses are
very high, collection of accounts receivable is poor, debt service coverage
is low, the liquidity problem is serious and the rate of return has been
consistently below the agreed rate. Causes of the problems include in-
effective management, insufficient forceful prosecution of persons suspected
of theft of electricity and delay in tariff action (para 2.06). One objective
of the proposed Bank involvement is to improve performance in all these areas.
Gorrective measures include better management, staff training, vigorous
measures to deal with       theft of energy and non-payment of electricity
bills; introduction of fuel adjustment clause; $3.8 million increase in equi-ty
contribution by the Government, $2.8 million soft loan from the Government and
23% increase in non-mine tariff increase. Success of the corrective measures
would depend on finding adequate personnel and the political will to take
timely decisions as difficult as the decisions might be.
Past and Present Finances
6.02      Past financial performance has been unsatisfactory for several
years. Key operating indicators for the past three years may be summarized as
follows (details in Annexes 8, 9 and 10):



- 24 -
1974      1975       1976
Energy Losses (% of Gross Generation)                      27         30         29
Energy Sales (GWh)                                        268        248        276
Average Price/kWh (US cents)                              5.1        5.5        5.6

Accounts Receivables as No. of weeks of sales              14         17         20
Current Ratio (Excluding Current Portion of
Long-Term Debt)                                         1.7        3.3        2.1
Debt/Equity Ratio                                       73/27      70/30     65/35
Debt Service Coverage                                     1.2        1.2        1.1
6.03      Following a tariff increase in 1974, LEC's energy sales decreased
during 1974 and 1975, and barely surpassed the 1973 level in 1976 (para.
2.16). Operating expenses during the period increased sharply due to (a)
drought in some years resulting in reduced hydro-power generation; (b) sharply
increased fuel prices; and (c) general inflation. In 1974 tariffs were
increased 40 - 60%, depending on consumer category, in order to meet operating
expenses. The rates of return were 5.1% in 1974, 6.6% in 1975 and 6.9% in
1976 on historically valued assets and were substantially below the required
annual rate of 10% on revalued assets. Throughout the period LEC had liquidity
problems and was always late in paying bills, particularly those for fuel.
Apparent improvement in the current ratio can be directly attributed to a
large increase in accounts receivable from private consumers, a substantial
amount of which will be difficult to collect. Although the debt/equity ratio
has improved through increases in equity, debt service coverage has been low
throughout the period. As of December 31, 1976 LEC had a weak financial
position with little cash, large accounts receivable and low debt service
coverage.
Energy Losses
6.04      Gross energy losses, including station use, increased sharply in
1974 following the tariff increase, and presently remain very high at about
30% of generation. It has been estimated that at least one third of the loss,
(currently valued at about US$2 million a year) is energy consumed through
illegal connections and errors in meter readings. During early 1976 under
Loan 1150-LBR, LEC initiated a block mapping project in the main problem area,
the city center of Monrovia. This means that special crews work block by
block to detect illegal connections and to verify that each connection has an
accurate meter, and is included in the company records so that consumption may
be billed. Illegal connections are removed or made legal and consumers with
unpaid bills are made to settle their accounts. To date about 3,000 connec-
tions out of more than 15,000 have been verified.  A large amount of work
remains and another two years are required to verify all parts of the network.
Additional equipment would be required to accelerate the program and to
maintain the surveillance. An amount of US$0.45 million for the purchase of



maintenance vehicles and tools is included in the proposed project. The block
mapping is now a function of LEC's Commercial Department anid should be con-
tinued as long as required.
6.05      During the block mapping, a large number of meters has been found
damaged (in some cases deliberately), automatically resulting in charges at
the minimal monthly rate for the consumers. LEC is now building a new work-
shop to repair the faulty meters and to ensure continued maintenance.
LEC has decided that in future, consumers with faulty meters will be billed on
the basis of their estimated consumption rather than minimum charges.
6.06      Part of the problem lies in the billing of the legally connected
consumers. The total number of LEC consumers, for whom bills are issued,
continues to be around 15,000 in spite of the fact that about 1,000-1,500 new
consumers have been officially connected each year during the last ten years.
Even taking into account consumer turnover, there is an obvious problem in
the billing department. Attempts to deceive LEC by some of its own staff
are suspected.   Progress will be monitored during supervision.
6.07      LEC and Government will make intensified efforts to prosecute
persons suspected of illegal connections and Government is also reviewing
the adequacy of existing legislation to protect LEC against fraud.
6.08      With the above measures, it should be possible to reduce losses to
about 20% over the project period through 1982. Assurances have been obtained
during negotiations that in addition to forceful implementation of the pro-
posed legislation and continuation of the block-mapping, LEC will take any and
all required steps to reduce the energy losses to the following level:
1978   1979   1980   1981   1982
Losses (percent of gross        28     26      24     22       20
generation)
Accepting 15% as reasonable level of technical losses, this implies reduction
in unaccounted energy from estimated 14% in 1977 to 5% in 1982.  However,
keeping in view (a) unsatisfactory experience in Liberia, and (b) the wide-
spread problem of electricity theft, there would be a substantial risk that
these targets would not be met. Accordingly, the financial projections are
based on more conservative assumptions as outlined in Annex 4 (Attachment 3).
Accounts Receivable
6.09      Accounts receivable, net of provision for bad debts, have increased
from US$3.8 million (or 14 weeks of electricity billings) in 1974 to US$6
million (or 20 weeks of billings) in 1976. As of December 31, 1976, private
consumers owed US$4.7 million and the Government and public corporations owed
a balance of US$1.3 million. Large private consumers (commercial, industrial



- 26 -
and mines) are fairly prompt in settling their bills; however, small commer-
cial and domestic consumers have accumulated large unpaid bills. Because of
inadequate postal service in Monrovia, delivery of bills to small domestic
consumers is made through LEC's meter readers. This has not worked satis-
factorily. LEC is examining the alternative solutions.
6.10      Until about a year ago, a system of clearing accounts existed
between the Government and LEC under which LEC netted the Government elect-
ricity bills and payments for branch stations against the amount owed to the
Government for debt service. Last year, the Government decided that mutual
debts would be settled by simultaneous outright payments. This new arrange-
ment has not functioned well.. As a result, as of December 31, 1976, the
Government including Government-owned corporations owed LEC $1.3 million for
electricity bills and $1.6 m-illion for outstations, while LEC owed $1.7
million to Government for debt service payments. Government has recently
settled its outstanding bills with LEC and assurances from Government have
been obtained during negotiations that they will settle future accounts
separately quarterly by (i) offsetting their electricity bills against LEC's
debt service payments or any other items relating to the Monrovia system; and
(ii) prepaying capital expenditure and operating losses of branch stations to
LEC on the basis of approved budgets.
6.11      With the implementiation of the above measures, it should be possible
to reduce the accounts receivable quickly and to decrease the amount of the
bad debts provision. However, the financial projections are based on more
conservative assumptions, which are as follows:
1978    1979    1980    1981    1982
Acounts Receivables equal to
No. of weeks of Sales                       17       16      15       14      13
Assurance has been obtained during negotiations that LEC will take any
and all required steps to reduce accounts receivable to at least the above
minimum levels.
Financing Plan
6.12      LEC's capital investment and working capital requirements during
the 1977-82 period, along with the sources from which they would be met, are
summarized in the financing plan below. The plan assumes that: (i) branch
operations would be pre-financed separately by the Government; (ii) the fuel
adjustment clause, protecting LEC from increases in price and quantity of
fuel, which is already operational, would remain in force; (iii) tariff
adjustments to yield a 23% increase in non-mine revenue would be introduced
effective March 1, 1978 (iv) Government has made a $2.8 million soft loan
(20 years), 2% with 5 years grace on interest and amortization) to LEC to
compensate it for long delay, in approval of tariff increase; and (v) energy
losses and accounts receivable would be decreased to meet the minimum targets
set in paras. 6.08 and 6.11 respectively. Necessary additional assurances
have been obtained from the Government and LEC with regards to items (i)
through (v).

6.13      The proposed IBRD loan of $10 million would be at the prevailing
Bank rate for 20 years including 5 years of grace. Signature of the required
loan agreements with co-financiers would be a condition of effectivAeesA of
the proposed loan. Terms from the cofinanciers as they would be psgped on
from the Government to LEC, are assumed to be the same as those from the
Bank.
6.14      "Other construction" includes the third diesel unit at Bushrod, con-
struction of the transmission line to Gbarnga, KfW financed future distribution,
office building and several on-going items shQwn in Annex 6. The propoped KfW
loan for underground distribution is expected to be on the same terms as the
existing KfW loan, i.e., at 6% interest for 33 years including ten years of
grace. The only other future loan is for the third diesel unit. 'erms fqr it
are assumed to be the same as the Bank terms. Details of various loans and
their terms are shown in Annex 12.

Revenue Covenant
6.15      Implementation of the measures specified in para. 6.12 would provide
internal cash generation equal to 38% of total cash requirements and result
in an average rate of return of about 10% on historically valued assets in
service in the period 1977-82.. Although the ongoing assets revaluation will
only be completed in late 1978, preliminary indications are that planned
actions could result in an average of 6% return on currently valued assets in
the period after completion of- the revaluation exercise (1979-82). The 6%
would be low from a financial point of view. In addition, there is uncertainty
about allowing for the uncertain outcome of the asset revaluation and margin
of error in forecasting. Hence an 8% rate of return is desireable. Accord-
ingly, LEC and the Government have agreed, effective 1979, to adjust tariffs
as necessary to yield 8% on currently valued assets. Tariff increases which
may be necessary to achieve the 8% rate of return would be moderate or even
eliminated if the line losses referred to in paras. 6.04-6.08 are reduced to a
normal level. It is expected such level would be sufficient to discourage
electricity wastage and to ensure LEC's financial viability. In the event the
proposed covenant results in excessive cash generation, dividends are expected
to be paid to the Government.
Future Financial Position
6.16      The financial forecasts for LEC for the years 1977 through 1982 are
shown in Annexes 8 through 10; they have been prepared on the basis of de-
tailed assumptions outlined in Annex 11. As outlined in para. 6.12, a revenue
increase of 23% on non-mine consumers effective March 1, 1978 has been assumed.
Key operating indicators during the 1977-1982 period are expected to be as
follows:
1977   1978   1979   1980   1981    1982
Energy Sales (GWh)                  271    280    305    352    397        423

Debt Service Coverage              0.85    1.6    2.0    2.4    2.3        2.2
6.17      Energy sales and operating revenue are expected to increase by
average annual rates of about 9.5% and 11% respectively. Because of the in-
troduction of the fuel adjustment clause, fuel cost is estimated at present



- 29 -
price levels and on the basis of an average hydrological year. Fuel cost/kWh
is estimated to decline after the commissioning of more efficient diesel
generating units under the project. Operating costs, excluding fuel, are
expected to increase at an average rate of only about 9% in view of the
assumed cost controls and increase in operating efficiency. The annual rate
of return on historically valued assets is expected to be only 1.9% in 1977,
8.2% in 1978, but above 11% in each of the remaining years (see para. 4.09).
In spite of all the corrective financial measures LEC is expected to have a
tight cash position through mid-1979. If needed during the period, LEC could
use a commercial overdraft; availability of the overdraft was confirmed during
negotiations. Cash level should improve and be satisfactory after mid-1979.
The debt equity ratio would remain at a satisfactory level as a result of the
Government's equity contribution during 1977. Debt service coverage would
increase from 0.85 in 1977 to 1.6 in 1978, and over 2.0 thereafter. Between
1980 and 1982, an estimated US$13 million are to be set aside for partially
meeting the local costs of the next hydro project. With implementation of all
the measures proposed, the overall financial position of LEC should be satis-
factory. Indicators to measure LEC's performance are given in Annex 13.
6.18       It is recommended that improvements in operating efficiency (e.g.,
energy loss, accounts receivable by different categories, status of block
mapping) and controls on operating expenses (number of staff, transmission
and distribution costs, other generating expenses, administration, inven-
tories) be monitored by requiring LEC to submit for review a monthly report
according to a format agreed during negotiations.
6.19      LEC agreed during negotiations that (a) no new long-term debt other
than that assumed in this report, would be incurred without consulting the
Bank, unless maximum total future debt service is covered 1.5 times by its
operating income before depreciation, (b) short-term borrowings up to one year
will not exceed LEC's two months' cash operating expenses for the preceding
year or for any 12-month period, whichever is greater, and (c) no capital
expenditures (including composition and amounts) exceeding those in Annex 6 of
this report will be incurrred without consulting the Bank.
7. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Govern-
ment that:
(a)  together with LEC, it will make arrangements satisfactory
to the Bank for providing electricity to urban poor along
the lines described in para. 2.24;
(b)  LEC would be fully reimbursed for all duties and taxes
through 1982 (para. 3.10);

7.04      Prior to effectiveness, the required loan agreements with the co-
financiers must be signed.
7.05      Disbursement of that part of the loan allocated for connection of
low income households would be conditional upon Government having made satis-
factory arrangements for financing interior wing of such households.
7.06      On the basis of the above arrangements, the project is suitable
for a Loan of US$10 million. Retroactive financing of about US$600,000 is
recommended to cover the engineering and management services.

MONROVIA POWER SYSTEM
Existing Power Facilities
1.        LEC's Monrovia System serves an area of 110 km x 200 km, from Totota
in the northeast to Buchanan in the southeast and Bomi Hills in the north-
west. The main centers of population and of electrical load are Monrovia (the
capital city); Buchanan (an important iron-ore shipping port); Robertsfield
(near the international airport); and Bong Mines and Bomi Hills (iron-ore min-
ing centers).
Generating Plant
2.        There are two generating stations to serve the area described in
para. 1; one at Mt. Coffee and one on Bushrod Island.
Mt. Coffee. This hydroelectric plant, located on the St. Paul River 24 km
from Monrovia, was completed in 1967 with two 15 MW units and provision for
four additional units. Two 17 MW units were added in 1973. The initial
installation was financed by USAID, Bank Loans 684-LBR and 778-LBR provided
funds to install the two 17 MW units. Transmission to Monrovia is done at 69
kV. Mt. Coffee is a run-of-river plant constructed as the initial phase of a
proposed development of the St. Paul River's hydroelectric potential. Full
utilization of the existing as well as the future expanded Mt. Coffee facili-
ties depends upon the construction of water storage facilities upstream to
regulate the river flows during the dry season each year. On the average, for
about 280 days each year, unregulated flows in the river are sufficient to
operate at least one unit continuously at full output; during the remaining
85 days the output only reaches 10 MW. Six units can operate continuously at
full load for about 160 days during2the rainy season. The total drainage area
above Mt. Coffee is about 21,000 km . The river rises in the plateau country
of southern Guinea and flows southwest to the Atlantic Ocean near Monrovia.
At Mt. Coffee a series of rather sharp rapids drop the river nearly 30 m to
near sea-level at White Plains, 20 km from the Atlantic. The principal
features of the Mt. Coffee project include the main dam across the St. Paul
River (30 m height), a forebay channel, forebay, six intakes, four penstocks,
power house with four units, tail race channel, and substation.
Bushrod Island. The plant consists of five diesel units with a total capacity
of 9 MW and four gas turbine units with a combined capacity of 65 MW.
Gas turbine units 3 and 4 were financed with Bank Loan 684-LBR. Transmission
to Monrovia and Mt. Coffee is at 69 kV. The first two gas turbine units



ANNEX 1
Page 2
installed at Bushrod, which were supplied by Brown Boveri (Switzerland),
have operated satisfactorily.. Units 3 and 4, also supplied by Brown Boveri,
have been unreliable since their commissioning in 1973, including several
major breakdowns; the last and most recent in February 1977 was the result of
an explosion in the turbine chamber of unit 4. The explosion threw out two
turbine blades through the stack and damaged several rows of blades. In July
1976, after both units had suffered repeated breakdowns, LEC requested the
Bank's assistance in locating a gas turbine specialist to help LEC's staff
in their technical discussions with Brown Boveri. Servicios Electricos del
Gran Buenos Aires (SEGBA) (Argentina) was contacted by the Bank, and made
available to LEC the chief of its gas turbine division. In his report to LEC,
the consultant indicates that these units were the second and third machines
produced by Brown Boveri of a new type of gas turbine different from the two
units previously supplied to LEC. The consultant considers the purchase
of untried units by LEC an unwise decision since, as a general rule, electric
utilities do not order equipment without evidence of sufficient trouble-free
experience. His main conclusions are that design defects caused the repeated
breakdowns and that the location of the power plant in an environment (near
the sea shore) unsuited for high-temperature gas turbines has aggravated the
problem. The consultant's opinion is that the gas turbines had been weakened
by corrosion and that the modifications introduced by Brown Boveri to these
gas turbines still had to be proven in actual operation. Brown Boveri,
however, attributes the problems with unit 3 and 4 to the low operational
standards in LEC and to stressing of the gas turbines by frequent tripping due
to electric instabilities in LEC's system. The accident in unit 4 described
above occurred after the consultant's report had already been issued. This
accident occurred when the units were operated by a team of the manufacturers
own personnel. Recently LEC has obtained the cooperation of the manufacturer
in dealing with the problem of these gas turbines. The cooperation includes
sharing the cost of past repaLir for the turbines, preparation of a training
program, provision of the services of an engineer to train LEC's technical
staff and of a gas turbine erector during the dry seasons.
Transmission System
3.        The Monrovia System is served by a 69 kV transmission system (see
attached Map). Of the 450 kmi of 69 kV transmission lines, only 4 km are
underground. The 69 kV lines are mainly of single wood-pole standard cross-
arm construction; about 55 km are on steel towers. The system is essentislly
radial with emergency tie-in; 69 kV lines radiate from Bushrod, Mt. CLff2e
and Paynesville and supply the outlying areas. Bong Mine is supplied over a
56 km 69 kV line from Mt. Coffee. The Bomi Hills area including Kle, is fed
from Bushrod over a line 62 km long. A line from Paynesville extends 58 km
to the northeast to supply the Kakata-Totota area, and another line extends
eastward for 120 km to Robersfield and Buchanan.
Substations
4.        The following 69/12.5 kV substations supply the Monrovia System:

FOURTH POWER PROJECT
LIBERIA ELECTRICITY CORPORATION
MONROVIA POWER SYSTEM
Detailed Description of the Project
General
1.        The project proposed for Bank financing is made up of seven com-
ponents:
(a) the extension of the Bushrod power station;
(b) the service connect:Lon and interior wiring for urban
poor households;
(c) maintenance vehicles and tools;
(d) staff training;
(e)  employment of a management team;
(f) a frequency conversion study; and
(g) a study of transmission to supply the Gbarnga rural
area.
Bushrod Power Station Extension
2.        The main component of the project consists of a 26 MW diesel
electric extension of the existing Bushrod thermal power station. The
power station is located on Bushrod Island about 8 km north of Monrovia.
3.        The civil engineering works for this extension will be constructed
to accommodate three 13 MW units, although initially only two units will be
installed. Soil investigations led to the conclusion that a piling down to
approximately 23 m-deep rock surface will be necessary to support the power-
house building and the units' foundation blocks. The powerhouse, consisting
of prefabricated steel structures, will ultimately incorporate the three
generating units and their electrical and mechanical auxiliaries. An overhead
crane with a lifting capacity sufficient for the heaviest part of the equip-
ment will be installed in the powerhouse.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
4.        The generating units (13.8 kV, 60 cycles per second) will be driven
by low-speed two-stroke marine diesel engines designed to burn fuel oil No. 5.
Power transformers will connect the new power plant output to the existing
69 kV switchyard and thus, to the Monrovia System grid. The possibility of
providing the generators with the conversion arrangement for 50 cycles genera-
tion hss been adopted (para. 11).
5.        Water for cooling the generating units will be taken from the
Monrovia harbor about 1.5 km distant. The pumping house will be constructed
on the harbor's northern breakwater. Sea water will be transported to
the powerhouse by plastic pipelines and conducted back to the ocean through
an open discharge channel. The actual cooling media in the engines and
auxiliaries will be fresh water in closed circuit, which will be cooled by
sea water in heat exchangers.
6.        Since the new units will burn heavy fuel oil instead of the light
fuel oil used by the gas turbines and existing diesels, an additional oil
storage facility will be needed. A new tank for 14 days of full load opera-
tion will therefore be installed close to the existing light fuel oil tanks.
The tank will be filled by a pipeline connecting it to the oil refinery and
the port.
Service Connections and Interior Wiring for Urban Poor Households
7.        In the Monrovia System the number of residential customers is
approximately 13,000 while it is estimated that not less than 24,000 house-
holds exist. It is proposed to study the connection of roughly 50% of the
households still without electric service in areas with existing low tension
lines. This segment of the population (about 50,000 persons) makes up the
majority of urban poor in Monrovia. The study will examine, among other
issues, the problem of interior wiring and the various alternatives for
financing the materials and installation. As a result of the study, a pro-
gram is expected to be prepared and implemented by LEC. Under this plan
the connection charge would be eliminated and the value of the service line
(connection for the low tension line to the house entrance) will be incor-
porated with LEC's assets. The unit cost of these connections is estimated
at $65 and would be financed under the proposed loan. The estimated cost
for a minimum household installation is estimated at $35.
Maintenance Vehicles and Tools
8.        The control of fraudulent consumption of electricity and the
connection of customers is hampered by insufficient vehicles and tools.
Moreover, LEC has no proper facilities for testing and repairing watt-hour
meters. This component of the project is intended to provide the necessary
equipment for these tasks and for improving service reliability. It is
estimated that ten vehicles of several types will be required.

from the 60 cycles per second presently in use in Liberia to the 50 cycles
per second employed in the rest of West Africa. The problem of different
frequencies between Liberia and its neighbors, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast,
has already arisen in the studies being conducted on the hydroelectric de-
velopment of the Mano and Cavalla rivers. At present Liberia's degree of
electrification is quite low so that it appears feasible to effect a change-
over to 50 cycles per second. It is therefore considered desirable to ex-
amine at this time the implications of changing the frequency.
Study of Transmission to Gbarnga Rural Area
12.       Preliminary studies indicate that it would be economically feasible
to supply the Gbarnga area from the Monrovia System. Gbarnga is presently
supplied by a small diesel electric station consisting of 2.5 MW in three
units. The peak demand is iLn the order of 1.8 MW.
13.       A 69 kV transmissiLon line from Mt. Coffee would be about 175 km
long and could carry up to 6 MW, which the Gbarnga area could reach in the
1990's. An economic analysiLs indicates that for discount rates up to 11%
this solution would be more advantageous than continuation of local diesel
electric generation.
14.       The proposed study will examine the technical and economic feasi-
bility of this line on the basis of a market study. Once the feasibility
is established to the satisfaction of the Bank, a survey of the line route
will be performed and the detailed design carried out, including the prep-
aration of tender documents.

APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Bushrod Power Station Extension
Justification
The Load and Consumption Forecast - Monrovia System
1.        Historical statistics of energy generation and peak demand in the
Monrovia System are given in Attachment I to this annex. From years 1961 to
1976, the energy generation grew from 45 GWh to 387 GWh and peak demand from
9 MW to 65 MW. Two periods with distinctly different patterns of growth can
be distinguished in this 15-year period. Between years 1961 to 1970 a fast
growth was experienced. An average annual growth rate of 22% reflects the
general economic boom of the 1960's. After 1970, a marked slowdown of the
growth in energy generation followed. The growth rates declined gradually
until even an absolute decreas-e of energy generation was recorded in 1975.
In 1976, a certain recovery took place reflected by an increase of 9%. The
average growth rate for the period 1970 to 1976 was only 6%. The marked
slowdown of the growth after 1970 had the following reasons:
-    High growth rates in the order of 20% are characteristic
of the initial period of the public electricity supply,
when the demand of consumers who can afford to pay for
electricity is by far not yet saturated. This initial
period seems to have reached its end in the 1960's. It
would require a new impetus, such as the establishment
of new large industries, to achieve the high growth rates
again.
-    The general economic situation in Liberia was affected
adversely by stagnation and recession trends in the
world economy. Due! to the close relationship between
the economic situat:Lon and the energy consumption, the
latter was affected negatively.
-    Two tariff increases in 1974 totalling 66% were neces-
sary to compensate the drastic increase in fuel prices
and the lower than average hydroelectric generation due
to the Sahelian drought of 1972/73, consumers reaction
to these measures was to reduce their demand and to
increase illegal consumption of electricity.
2.        Similarly to the growth of energy generation, the growth of energy
sales slowed down considerably after 1970.  However, while energy generation
grew at an annual rate of 6% in the period 1970-1976, energy sales showed an
average annual increase of only 3%. In percentage terms, the difference



ANNEX 4
Page 2
between gross energy generation and energy sales increased from 14% to 29% of
gross energy generation between 1970 and 1976. This phenomenon cannot be
explained by technical reasons, such as sudden deterioration of the condition
of the transmission and distribution networks. It originates mainly in the
increasing unaccounted for consumption of energy which took place probably in
the residential category of consumers. The unaccounted for consumption of
energy can be determined by subtracting the energy used in the power station
and the effective transmission and distribution losses from the difference
between gross generation and energy sales. The power station usage is rela-
tively small; it varied between 2 and 3 GWh in the said period. On the basis
of experience from other power systems of similar structure and magnitude
the transmission and distribution losses can be estimated at about 15% of
net generation (gross generation less station use). This assumption appears
justified in view of the losses recorded in the Monrovia System prior to
the period of growing unaccounted for use of electric energy (for instance,
13% of net generation in 1969 and 14% in 1970.) Under these assumptions,
the unaccounted for use of energy was as follows in the 1969 to 1976 period:
1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976
Gross generation (GWh)                  224  277  303  329  349  365  356  387

A breakdown of energy sales by consumer category is shown in Attachment 2
to this annex.  It can be observed that the electric sales to residential
consumers decreased in recent years. If the unaccounted for energy consump-
tion is added to the residential sales billed, a more rational growth trend
results as shown below:



ANNEX 4
Page 3
Average Annual
Rate of Growth
1969   1973   1976         1969/1976
Residential sales billed (GWh)             77      66      61
Unaccounted for consumption (GWh)           -      23      50
Residential energy usage (GWh)             77      89     111            5%
3.        According to load projections by consumer categories prepared by
LEC's consultant Motor Columbus, the peak demand in the Monrovia System
is likely to decline slightly in the next two years and to reach the present
level of 65 MW again in 1979 and to exceed 100 MW in 1984. The peak demand
stagnation in the first years is due to the closing down of LEC's second
largest consumer, the Liberian Mining Co. at Bomi Hills. The average annual
growth rate of the peak demand in the period 1976-1985 is estimated at 6%,
that of energy generation at 7%.
4.        Attachment 3 gives details of the load projection for the Monrovia
System. Residential energy cc,nsumption (including unaccounted for consump-
tion) is projected at a rate of 5% per annum, i.e. equal to the 1969 to
1976 rate of growth. Residential energy sales billed show a somewhat
higher annual rate of growth of 8% because unaccounted for energy consump-
tion is presumed to decline from 13% in 1976 to 7% in 1985 with better system
control now being instituted by LEC.
5.        The projection of non-residential load, which is mainly industrial
load, at an annual rate of 11% takes into consideration the establishment of
some new industries in the industrial free zone for which infrastructure is
being provided on an area adjoining the port of Monrovia. According to the
current time schedule, the first factories should be in operation late in
1978. At the end of the first development stage in 1980, the total demand of
the industrial free zone is expected to reach 4 MW, and 12 MW at the end of
the second stage in 1985.
6.        Bong Mines intends to continue purchasing power from LEC as a sup-
plement to its own generation. According to the present agreement, primary
power of 8 MW at a load factor of 70% is supplied to BMC by LEC. In addi-
tion, secondary power may be supplied if agreed by both partners. Doubling
the primary power supply from LEC is foreseen after 1980, to cover increasing
consumption at the mine due to gradual exhaustion of the best iron-ore
reserves.
7.        The category "other" energy sales comprises the Government of
Liberia, street lighting and some other minor consumers. Energy sales in
this category decreased in recent years, particularly due to energy conser-
vation measures in Governmental offices. An annual growth rate of 10% is



ANNEX 4
Page 4
projected for the 1976-1985 period. This rate of growth already takes into
account additional energy requirements of the new conference center of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Virginia, north of Monrovia. The
center including apartments for accommodation of delegates is under construc-
tion and is to be finished in 1979. Its peak load is estimated at 4 MW.
8.        To check the load projection on a sectoral basis, an analysis of
the relationship between GDP and use of electricity has been carried out.
In the past there was a strong correlation between these two variables in
Liberia (correlation coefficient 0.9974). Consequently, the correlation
function has been extrapolated to the future, and the growth of energy gen-
eration determined on the basis of GDP projected at an annual rate of 4%
between 1977 and 1980 and 5% for the period 1981 to 1985, assuming that
some large investments in the mining sector in the early eighties will
stimulate the Liberian economy. The resulting forecast of energy genera-
tion on this macroeconomic basis shows an average annual growth rate of
approximately 7% thus confirming the general trend of the load projection
by consumer categories.
Peak Demand/Generating Capacity Balance
9.        The unregulated flow of the St. Paul River permits the operation of
only one unit at 10 MW level at the Mt. Coffee hydro plant in the dry season.
The firm capacity of the Monrovia System's generating facilities in the dry
season is computed at 65 MW which is just sufficient to meet the current peak
load. Additional generating capacity will have to be commissioned as soon as
possible to take care of projected load growth. A staged extension by 39 MW
with three 13 MW diesel-electric units is proposed at the Bushrod power
station to help meet the demand until 1985 when a large hydro project is
assumed to be commissioned on the St. Paul or Mano rivers. Attachment 4 shows
graphically the projected demand and the firm capacity that will be available
during the 1976 to 1985 period. The role of the new units in the period 1980
to 1985 will consist of covering the intermediate load between the Mt. Coffee
hydroelectric station and the existing units at Bushrod. Its annual utiliza-
tion will be in the order of 4000 hours per year until 1984. The major part
of the generation will be concentrated in the dry season. From 1985 on, the
new units will help firm up the hydroelectric capacity. A minimum of 2500
hours of operation per year of the new units will probably be necessary to
perform this role.
Least Cost Solution
10.       The only technically feasible alternative to take care of the
projected demand is the extension of the Bushrod power station because of
the long lead time needed to develop a hydroelectric project or a steam power
plant. The installation of additional units at Mt. Coffee would not solve
the problem, since the water flow of the St. Paul River is insufficient in
the dry season even for the existing units.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
11.       The choice of techniLcally feasible generating plants for the Bushrod
power station extension is between the following solutions:
-    Low-speed diesel units
-    Medium-speed diesel units
-    Gas turbine units
12.       The ratings of the alternative plants considered for the Bushrod
extension have been selected to achieve a net output of approximately 40 MW.
This is roughly the capacity required to cope with the demand in the period
1979 to 1985. The following alternative plant programs have been compared
by means of the discounted cash flow method:
-    Three 17.5 MW gas turbines
-    Two 27.0 MW gas turbines
-    Four 11.0 MW low-speed diesel engines
-    Three 14.0 MW low-speed diesel engines
-    Five 8.5 MW medium-speed diesel engines
-    Three 14.0 MW medium-speed diesel engines
Due to the site conditions characterized by a maximum cooling water tempera-
ture of 300 C, maximum ambient air temperature of 40 C and sea level baro-
metric pressure, the differences between the nominal rating and net rating
at plant terminals are shown in the table below, as well as the rotating
speed of the units in each alternative.
Low-Speed        Medium-Speed

13.       In order to have a common basis for the comparison of alternative
plant programmes, their capital costs have been adjusted to a net output
of 40 MW. Unlike the other alternatives the medium-speed diesel units re-
quire maintenance works of about 4 days' duration after every 2000/2500
hours of operation. Since the annual utilization of the new plant will be
in the order of 4000 hours, and the major part is concentrated in the dry



ANNEX 4
Page 6
season when only one hydro unit can be operated, it is necessary to add one
more unit to each of the medium-speed diesel alternatives. With these addi-
tions the adjusted capital costs for the solutions considered are as fol-
lows:
Low-Speed        Medium-Speed
Gas Turbines           Diesels           Diesels

Since the service life of the low-speed diesel units (160,000 hours) is twice
as long as that of the gas turbines and medium-speed diesel units (80,000
hours), a replacement of the latter units has been assumed after 20 years to
guarantee the same effect in the power system.
14.       Figures on expenses for operation and maintenance provided by sup-
pliers of diesel units indicate that there is a considerable difference be-
tween medium and low-speed diesel engines due to less maintenance and sim-
plified operation of the latter engines. However, the figures from suppliers
are in absolute terms rather optimistic and do not take into consideration
special conditions in countries like Liberia. The experience gained so far
with the existing plants at Bong Mines, Buchanan and Bushrod must obviously
be taken into consideration when estimating the operation and maintenance
costs of the proposed Bushrod extension. The following assumptions used in
the comparative analysis are based on the experience in the above-mentioned
power plants and refer to a net output of 40 MW:

Two 27 MW gas turbines                                 0.60

Three 14 MW medium-speed diesels                        1.44
15.       While both medium and low-speed diesel units can use heavy fuel
oil, the gas turbines require light diesel oils. Characteristics of fuels
currently available in Liberia and their prices (international levels) are
as follows:
No. 2 Diesel Oil   No. 5 Fuel Oil
Cost                 US cents per US gall.              39                  31
Specific gravity                                      0.92               0.99

Specific cost        US cents per MJ                 0.261              0.205
Taking the net heat rates of the units at 75% of their ratings the different
alternatives have the following fuel costs per kWh:

16.       The new power plant will contribute to meeting future generation
requirements estimated as follows:
Year                   GWh
1980                    50
1981                    99
1982                   108
1983                   131
1984                   145
The utilization of the new power plant, and consequently its generation
after 1984, will depend heavily on the characteristics of the new hydroelec-
tric project to be commissioned in 1985 or later. Since the corresponding
studies have only been recently initiated these characteristics are not
yet known. The comparative analysis has therefore been carried out for
two assumptions regarding the annual utilization of the Bushrod extension
after 1984, a minimum usage of 2000 hours per year and a maximum of 4000
hours per year.
17.       The lubrication cost of the gas turbines has been estimated at 1%
of the fuel cost. For the diesel units the consumption of lube oil varies
between 0.8 and 2.0 g per kWh depending on the type and size of the machines.
At a cost of US$1000 per ton the lube oil costs are as follows:
Lube Oil
Alternative                        Consumption      Lube Oil Cost
(g. per kWh) (US cents per kWh)
Three 17.5 MW gas turbines                   0.5               0.05
Two 27 MW gas turbines                       0.4               0.04
Four 11 MW low-speed diesel engines          1.0               0.10
Three 14 MW low-speed diesel engines         0.8               0.08
Five 8.5 MW medium-speed diesel engines   2.0                  0.20
Three 14 MW medium-speed diesel engines   1.5                  0.15
18.       Curves of the present worths for the different alternatives con-
sidered in function of the discount rates are shown in Attachment 5 to this
annex. These curves show that for all discount rates up to 15% the proposed
solution of low speed diesel units costs less than medium-speed diesel units.
The proposed solution is also less costly than gas turbines but in this case
the advantage depends on the annual utilization after 1984. For 2000 hours
utilization per year the equalizing discount rate is 11% while for 4000 hours
it is 15%.

19.       The sensitivity of these results to change in the particular com-
ponents of the cost streams can be measured by the percentage increase or
decrease required to equalize the present worths of the different alter-
natives while holding constant all costs for the alternative at a discount
rate of 10%, which is considered to represent the opportunity cost of capital
in Liberia. The break even points are as follows:
Low-Speed Diesels   Vs.   Medium-Speed Diesels
Capital cost                          +  17%          or           - 18%
Operation and maintenance             +  78%          or           - 44%
Low-Speed        Vs.       Gas Turbines
Capital cost                          +  40%          or           - 95%
Operation and maintenance             + 180%          or        no solution
Some of these changes are so extreme that the likelihood of their happening
is practically non-existent. It should be noted also that most changes are
likely to affect all alternat:ives simultaneously in some degree; this for
instance would be the case of the capital cost of the different alternatives.
Fuel cost variations would affect all alternratves simultaneously as heat
rates are not expected to change among alternatives. Since a reduction in
fuel cost is unlikely, the low speed diesels would always remain the least
cost solution. Any increase :in fuel cost would increase the attractiveness of
low speed diesels versus either medium speed diesels or gas turbines.
Return on Investment
19.       The return on investment required to supply the incremental power
load served by the Bushrod power station extension (1980/85) has been cal-
culated as the discount rate which equalizes the present worth of costs
(investment and operation) and the present worth of revenues. The revenues
and operating cost for the period beyond 1985 have been calculated on the
basis of the contribution of thermal generation required under average hydro-
logical conditions and present: tariffs.
20.       The benefits of the Bushrod power station extension consist of
the contribution of the new units to meeting future demand in LEC's Monrovia
system, The return on investment under estimates the economic rate of
return slnce no estimation of consumers' surplus has been made and present
tariffs represent the minimum value of benefits to consumers as evidenced by
their willingness to pay the existing price.

21.       Load flow computations carried out by LEC on the Monrovia System
have shown that no reinforcement of the existing transmission grid would be
necessary for peak loads up to 110 MW. Since the full utilization of the
additional units at Bushrod will be reached at a peak demand in the order
of 100 MW it will be therefore possible to transport all power generated
at Bushrod by means of the existing transmission network. LEC's present
distribution system (including work in process) has, likewise, sufficient
capacity to serve the incremental load supplied by the proposed Bushrod power
station extension and only minimal investments will be required to connect
new customers. No additional investment for the purpose of transmission
and distribution is therefore considered in the computation, excepting the
amount of US$400,000 1/ for extension of service to urban poor in Monrovia.
22.       Attachment 6 to this annex shows the basic assumptions used in the
rate of return calculation. Fuel costs have been evaluated on the basis of
the early 1977 international price for No. 5 heavy fuel oil (US cents 31 per
US gallon).
23.       At market prices the rate of return of the Bushrod extension under
these assumptions is computed at 13%. Attachment 6 gives the tabulation used
in computing the rate of return. Sensitivity to change in the conditions
assumed in this computation is measured by the percentage of increase or
decrease in their values required to equalize the present worth of the
stream of revenues and costs at a discount rate of 10%. This rate of return
of 10% represents the opportunity cost of capital in Liberia. The results
of the sensitivity analysis are as follows:
Capital Cost                                  + 25%
Sales                                         - 11%
Shadow price of off-shore costs               + 13% over market prices
Because of the clearly defined nature of the project and the small amount
of civil works involved, it is very unlikely that capital costs could ex-
ceed 25% over cost estimate. A decrease in sales below 11% is not prob-
able since the growth rate in consumption is projected at a fairly low rate
(7%) which is exceeded practically everywhere. It is also very unlikely
that the shadow price of off-shore costs would exceed 13% over market prices
given the open nature of the Liberian economy and the low level of custom
duties. Variations in fuel prices do not affect the return on investment
since any increase in fuel costs is passed automatically to the consumers by
means of the fuel adjustment provision of the tariffs and no significant drop
in demand is expected for anticipated increases in fuel prices.
1/   Total investment in extending electric service to urban poor is esti-
mated at US$500,000 including US$100,000 contingency for cost escala-
tion.

Asaumptions:
1. Generation attributable to new units for the period 1980/84 was computed for the average hydrological year from typical load curves of the Monrovia System for
the rainy and dry seasons. After 1984 the new therv-sl plant will be used an average of 4000 hours per year to firm up hydroelectric generation.
2.  Increment in sales (including sales to urban poors) has been computed by deducting 15X losses in the tranmission and distribution systems.
3. Capital investment has been taken at the base cost of the new plant plus physical contingencies. No additional investments in tranmission *nd distribution
(excepting that investment required for extending service to urban poors) were considered, since present capacity of these systems (including work in progress)
is sufficient to accomodate the entire output of the nev plant.
4. Operation and maintenance cost is the incremental cost over the present 0 & M cost of the existing Bushrod generating facilities.
5.  Fuel cost (at US$ 0.0187 per kWh) in computed on the basis of the international price for fuel oil No. 5 (US$ 0.31 per gallon) and a fuel usage of 0.0603
gallon per kWl.
6.  Benefits have been computed at the average price (US$ 0.056 per kWh) paid by the ultimate consumers plus a fuel adjustment of US$ 0.0028 per kwh applied since
May, 1977.  This fuel adjustment correspond to a US$ 0.04 per gallon differential over the international price which was approved by the Liberian Government
for sales within the country.
7.  Service life of the low-speed diesels 160.000 hours or 40 years at 4,000 hours per year*

Tariffs
The new rate structure of the Liberia Electricity Corporation
effective as of March 1st, 1978 is the following:
1.   Residential and Commercial
This rate will apply to all residential customers and to small
commercial customers:
-   First 400 Kilowatt hours per month    94 per Kilowatt Hour
with a minimum bill of $3.60
-   Next 1100 Kilowatt hours per month    84 per Kilowatt Hour
-   Over 1500 Kilowatt hours per month    7-1/24 per Kilowatt Hour
2.   Industrial
This rate will apply to large commercial and industrial customers:
-    First 2000 Kilowatt hours per month  84 per Kilowatt hour
-    Over 2000 Kilowatt hours per month   6-1/24 per Kilowatt hour
3.   Fuel Adjustment Charge
The rate of charge for each kilowatt hour on both tariffs will be
subject to a Fuel Adjustment C(harge.



ANNEX 7

Fuel Adjustment Clause
A fuel adjustment clause is now a necessity in electricity tariffs
to protect the power sector financially from the effects of oil price in-
creases. The nature of a fuel adjustment clause depends on the nature of
generation. Where electricity is generated totally from fuel sources then
it is reasonable for the fuel adjustment clause to vary solely in relation
to the increase in fuel cost. This is because additional fuel consumption
would be proportional to additional unit sales. However in a mixed system
such as in Liberia where the increase in fuel costs depends upon both the
price and the amount of fuel used, which varies in relation to the amount of
water available, it is necessary to consider both variables in the fuel
adjustment clause. Accordingly, LEC has introduced a fuel adjustment clause
protecting it from price and volume variations.
At the beginning of each year LEC would determine the fuel costs
it expects to incur per unit sold on a month by month basis for an 'average
hydrological year.' This means estimating (i) unit sales (ii) fuel consump-
tion and hence fuel cost at the base price. The actual fuel costs per unit
sold can then be calculated each month and the figure compared with the
estimated figure. The difference between the two figures would be the fuel
adjustment charge and could be either an increase or decrease per kwh.
The fuel adjustment per unit billed would be charged two months
following the month upon which calculations would be based and would there-
fore be applied to a different number of units than those upon which the
calculations would be based. Therefore the actual increase or decrease in
revenue would vary from the required amount. In order to ensure that the
correct revenue is obtained per annum it would be necessary to incorporate
a year-end adjustment.
The basic formula would be as follows:-
Fuel adj. charge per kWh = (Actual fuel cost)       -      (Est. fuel cost)
(Actual units sold)           (Est. units sold)
To successfully operate this system it would be necessary to have
the following figures available for each month by the middle of the succeeding
month:-
(i) Fuel price at beginning of month in question
(ii) Fuel consumption for month
(iii) kWh billed during month.
In addition it would be necessary for the unit sales and generation
statistics to be estimated monthly rather than quarterly as is the existing
case. The procedural problems if any would be corrected as they arise.

ANNEX  11
Page a
LIBERIA
APPRAISAL OF THE FQURTIH POWER PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions Regarding the Financial Statements
of Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC)
1.        The financial statements for the period 1974-76 are based oi
auditor's reports. These have been adjusted to reflect the lates1 stvUable
information and rearranged to meet the Bank's requirements. Stotem*A#8 for
1977 are based on actual figures for the first 3 months of the year and LWC's
budget for remainder of the year.
2.        Financial Statements are for calendar years.
3.        Income Statements 1977-82
(a) Sales in GWh - See Annex 4, Attachment 2.
(b) Operating Revenue - These have been calculated separately
for each class of consumers.  A 23% increase in non-mine
revenue effective March 1, 1978 has been shown separately.
See Annex 8.
(c) Average Price per kWh - The variations in average price
are explained by changes in sales to different categories
of consumers (Annex 8) and particularly to mines which
are the lowest priced consumers.
(d) Fuel - Gas oil and heavy fuel prices increased from 394
and 31/gallon to 434 and 35d/gallon respectively effec-
tive May 10, 1977. A Fuel Adjustment clause protecting
LEC from (i) future price increases and (ii) unusual dry
climate conditions as compared to a normal hydrological
year resulting in larger quantities of fuel, effective
January 1, 1978 has been enacted. LEC has already adjusted
the rates to reflect the last increase in price of fuel.
(e) Transmission and Distribution Expense: 1977 figures are
based on actual budget. Projections starting in 1978
are based on 10% annual increase.
(f) Other Generation Expense: 1977 figures are based on
actual budget. Projections, starting in 1978, are bape4
on (i) compound annual increase of 10% plus (ii) in-
creased cost for maintenance of additional generating
units amounting to $150,000 in 1980, $300,000 each in
1981 and 1982.



ANNEX 11
Page 2
(g)  Administration Expense:  1977 figures are based on
budget. Projections, starting in 1978, are based
on a growth rate of 12% per annum.
(h)  Provision for Bad Debts:  It is assumed that 100%
collections will be made on time from the Government,
mines and Government: institutions (which are treated
as commercial and industrial consumers and represent
about $0.5 million of billing per year). Provision
for bad debts is made for all other consumers. During
1976, collections for these "other" consumers amounted
to 85% of billing. In view of the increased effort
under way, the collections and provision for bad debts
are assummed to be as follows:
1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982
Collections (%)                 88   90   91   92   93   94
Provision for Bad Debts (%)   12   10    9    8    7    6
(i)  Depreciation - 3.5% composite depreciation rate on
historically gross fixed assets in operation.
(j)  Other Income (net):  It includes interest income and
operating results of: rechargeable jobs.
(j)  Interest Charged to Operations - Details of all out-
standing and future loans along with total interest,
commitment fee, capitalized financial charges (interest
and commitment fee) and amortization are shown in
Annex 12. Terms of all future borrowings are assumed to
be 8.5% interest, 3/4% commitment fee, 20 years maturity,
including 5 years of grace. The Government of
Liberia may be able to obtain the loans on softer
terms; however, the above terms are assumed for re-
lending where applicable.
Balance Sheet - 1977-1982
(a)  Exchange Rate Changes  - Assets and liabilities in
foreign currencies are converted each year at the
rates of exchange rtling at December 31. Exchange
losses on long-term debts are carried forward by LEC
as deferred expenditure to be written off over the
repayment periods of the loans to which they relate.
Cumulative deferred expenditure as of December 31,



ANNEX 1 1
Page 3
1976 amounted to $1.75 million. Since this amount
relates to financing of fixed assets, the fixed assets
as presented in this report have been revalued to that
extent. This is being reviewed in connection with the
asset revaluation exercise now under way.
(b) Fixed Assets in Operation: The partly revalued assets
are increased each year by the cost of new plants put
into service (including cost of training but excluding
capitalized interest) as follows:
Year            $US '000
1977             10,120
1978              4,330

1981             16,470
1982              5,730
No major assets are expected to be withdrawn from
service during the period.
(c) Work in Progress - Calculated in relation to the con-
struction program and commissioning schedules at the
end of each year.
(d) Cash - Derived from Cash Flow. LEC may require an overdraft
during 1978. However, cash level is expected to be
satisfactory starting in 1979.
(e) Accounts Receivable - During 1976, accounts receiv-
able (net of provision for bad debts) as % of billing
amounted to 38%. This is expected to be improved
through (i) improved bill settlement arrangement with
the Government as proposed in this report, (ii) block-
mapping now under way and (iii) disconnection campaign
now under way. Accordingly, the accounts receivable
as % of total operating revenue billing are conservatively
expected to improve as follows:
1977  1978  1979  1980  1981 1982
38    33    31    29    27   25
(f) Inventories - 1977 figures are based on LEC's budget.
These have been increased at the rate of $100,000 per
year to take account of the expanding operations.



ANNEX 11
Page 4
(g) Other Current Assets: largely consist of amounts due
from Government for outstations. The level is assumed
to equal about 6 months' deficit on outstations.
(h)  Equity - Capital has been assumed to increase by $3.8
million in 1977 due to the Government's equity contribu-
tion. Retained earnings are adjusted each year in accordance
with the operating results.
(i) Accounts Payable - 1976 actual was unusually high
because of some capital expenditure bills; for projec-
tions, LEC's 1977 budget figure has been increased at
the rate of 10% a year.
(j) Refinery reflects the cost of fuel consumed in December
each year. Payment is made in the first part of the
following year.
(k)  Customer deposits have been gradually increased each
year to reflect expansion of LEC. Deposits from new
urban poor consumers are likely to be small, if any,
and have not been included.
(1) Long-term debt - Details are shown in Annex 12. The
Government loan of $2.8 million is assumed to have been
received in December 1977. It is reported that the
amount was actually received in early 1978. LEC managed
by postponing payment of fuel and other bills.

FOURTH POWER PROJECT
Outline of Training Measures
(a) The management team (para. 5.05) should include a training
manager/adviser with the necessary expertise in curriculum
design, training methodology and the use of visual aids;
(b) Senior Liberian staff who will not immediately assume de-
partmental responsibilities but who are expected to do so
at a tentatively agreed time (para 5.05 (c)) should re-
ceive required training, including on-the-job training
with overseas utilities in order to prepare them for their
planned assignments;
(c) Suitable training programs for foremen and supervisors will
become available during 1979 at the Monrovia Vocational
Training Centre (MVTC) which is being financed under the
Second Education Project (Loan 1266-T-LBR).  Prior to this
date, a course for supervisors currently conducted at the
training center of a local mining company (LAMCO) which is
suitable for and available to LEC at a reasonable cost
should be used or alternative arrangements be made;
(d) For skilled technical manpower, in the long run LEC would
rely on MVTC which will offer basic courses in mechanical,
electrical and construction trades. However, in order to
meet its specific needs, LEC would establish a modest
training school on its premises. The school would consist
of three workshops--for (i) heavy electrical and mechanical
maintenance and operation, (ii) distribution and trans-
mission construction and maintenance, and (iii) meter-
ing relays, instruments ad other small equipment;
library with required technical, financial and management
books; and three classrooms equipped with audio-visual
aids capable of accommodating seminars for financial/
accounting and administrative staff. In addition, space
would be available for the outdoor training of overhead
crews on transmission and distribution lines. US$0.75 mil-
lion has been included in the project for the school
including three man-years of instructors;
(e) Basic training for accounting/financial staff will con-
tinue at the local university. LEC's in-house training



ANNEX 14
Page 2
will take place at the proposed training center. Overseas
practical training will be provided to the senior staff
as required;
(f) Staff will be encouraged, through various names, to take
correspondence courses to prepare themselves for pro-
fessional qualifications;
(g) Salaries for selected categories of staff should be
reviewed to attract and keep Liberian staff; and
(h) LEC should continue the recently initiated practice
of insisting that all staff members receiving extended
training sign employment contracts with LEC for a
minimum period (twice the length of training) after
termination of training.
