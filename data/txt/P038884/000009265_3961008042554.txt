MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON PROPOSED LOANS
TO THE STATES OF BAHIA, CEARA AND SERGIPE
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A NORTHEAST RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROGRAM
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on proposed loans
to the States of Bahia, Ceard and Sergipe, with the guarantee of the Federative Republic of Brazil, for
the equivalent of US$105 million, US$70 million and US$36 million, respectively, to help finance a Rural
Poverty Alleviation Project in each state, under a Northeast Rural Poverty Alleviation Program. The
loans would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 15 years, including five
years of grace.
2.     Background. Poverty in Brazil has a strong rural and regional dimension. About 50 percent
of the poor live in rural areas, where the incidence of poverty is more than twice that of the large cities
and urban centers. The Northeast Region has long constituted the single largest area of rural poverty,
not only in Brazil, but in all of Latin America. This Region, covering nine states and part of a tenth,
accounts for about one-fifth of the total land area and 30 percent of Brazil's 147 million population.
More than half of all Brazilians living in poverty, and almost two-thirds of the country's rural poor, live
in the Northeast. According to a recent study by the Ministry of Planning and Budget, some 12 million
rural inhabitants in the Northeast live in extreme poverty, with per capita incomes under US$214 per year
(less than one-tenth the national average). Among the underlying causes are the relatively poor resource
base in large parts of the Northeast and variable agro-climatic conditions which make these areas
vulnerable to periodic droughts. Skewed access to land and the virtual absence of a functioning rural
financial system for the poor are additional constraints. Northeast agriculture is characterized by low
input use and slow rates of technology adoption. Productivity is low, with output per farm worker less
than half that of other regions. Overall Northeast agricultural GDP growth was negligible during
1991-94.
3.    Macroeconomic instability and chronic fiscal deficits over the past decade have undermined the
effectiveness of the Government's efforts to address these issues. The "inflation tax" penalized the poor
disproportionately, and slow growth has depressed rural employment and, hence, exacerbated poverty.
Since introduction of the Plano Real in July 1994, some degree of macroeconomic stability has been
achieved, and inflation has already been cut significantly. Nonetheless, in the short to medium term,
stabilization also implies very strong fiscal adjustment, with a tightening of government expenditures,
high real interest rates and, hence, a deepening of the investment pause in the farm and rural sector. The
consequences in terms of rural employment and social services may be quite serious, and clearly call for
offsetting safety net actions. While successful macroeconomic adjustment in Brazil should promote
longer-term economic growth, with benefits extending to rural areas, international experience suggests
that targeted programs and policies for the socio-economic development of the poorest are an essential
component of the adjustment process.
4.     The Federal and State Governrments have been involved since the early 1970s in financing
programs to alleviate rural poverty in Northeast Brazil. The World Bank has been associated for many
years with these efforts through its financing of a series of programs, including area-specific and state
rural development projects, various sectoral operations and a regional Northeast Rural Development



- 2 -
Program (NRDP). The latter was established by the Brazilian Government in 1985 to reduce rural
poverty and improve the living standards of small farm families in the Northeast. Under the NRDP, the
Bank during 1985-87 approved ten individual state loans totalling US$826.7 million.
5.     Through 1993, with the exception of one component supporting small community projects
(APCR), implementation of the NRDP lagged behind schedule and performance in meeting basic program
objectives was weak. In 1993, the NRDP was reformulated and transformed in its entirety into a
community-based development program, drawing both on the successful experience of the APCR
component and on the lessons learned with similar schemes elsewhere in Latin America, particularly the
Mexican Solidaridad program.  Performance has improved markedly.  Rural communities are
participating in the identification, financing and implementation of subprojects that meet their most
pressing needs, increase their sense of project ownership, and have a much sharper focus on poverty
alleviation. After the first year of reformulation, loan disbursements were double the average rate
achieved under the original NRDP. Evaluation of the reformulated program indicates that it is providing
a cost-effective mechanism for reaching poor rural communities with small-scale and low-cost investments
which are having a significant socio-economic impact on recipients, through increased incomes,
employment generation and improved quality of life.
6.     The new Brazilian administration which took office in January 1995 is extremely concerned with
the level of poverty in the country, particularly in the Northeast and its rural areas, and has declared the
Northeast a priority area for public development programs. The President has established a new social
action program, Comunidade Solidaria, to address poverty through decentralized implementation and
direct involvement of beneficiary communities. Parts of this strategy draw heavily on the design of the
reformulated NRDP. The current NRDP loans are scheduled to close between end-December 1995 and
end-March 1996, and the Brazilian Government has requested the Bank to start preparation of follow-up
projects for the Northeastern States. The proposed Loans to Bahia, Ceara and Sergipe would constitute
the first set of three such follow-up projects.
7.     As in the rest of the Northeast, poverty in the states of Bahia, Ceara and Sergipe is closely
correlated with rural location. The rural poor are primarily smallholders, tenants, sharecroppers and
landless laborers, with a diverse range of income-earning activities in which production of subsistence
crops predominates. Socio-economic indicators attest to the predicament of each State's rural population:
(i) in Bahia, 90 percent of households have only precarious access to safe water, 56 percent of the adult
population is illiterate, and 74 percent of heads of household earn one minimum salary or less per month;
(ii) in Ceara, these levels rise to 97 percent, 59 percent and 83 percent, respectively; and (iii) in Sergipe,
the levels stand at 87 percent, 60 percent and 68 percent, respectively. The State Governments' poverty
alleviation strategies aim to provide these rural poor with the socio-economic infrastructure and network
of services necessary to improve the quality of life and generate income and employment opportunities.
The development of sustainable income-generating alternatives to offset extended periods of low rainfall
in the semi-arid regions of the states, and thereby to stem intermittently heavy migration to urban areas
where rural poverty becomes urban, is an important supporting objective of these strategies. Recognizing
the extent of the problem on the one hand, and their own financial constraints and the limited capacity
of many state institutions on the other, the Governments plan to draw upon the rich community tradition
in the rural areas to be the primary impetus for community-based identification of needs and service
delivery.



- 3 -
8.    Project Objectives. The project would assist the States of Bahia, Ceara and Sergipe, to increase
access by the rural poor to basic social and economic infrastructure and to employment and income-
generating activities, thus alleviating poverty by: (a) supporting rural communities in planning and
implementing their own development initiatives; (b) leveraging revenue mobilization at the community
and municipal levels; and (c) providing a safety net for the rural poor during the early stages of
macroeconomic reforms, when fiscal adjustment will necessarily constrain the Government's ability to
finance essential investments and services. The projects would ensure that funds are targeted and reliably
transferred to the poorest communities, expand the successful strategy of community participation tested
under the reformulated NRDP, and promote decentralization of decision-making to municipal and local
levels.
9.    Project Description.  The projects would provide matching grants to rural community
associations to finance small-scale subprojects identified by these groups as investments that would
improve community well-being. The process would be demand-driven. The types of investments likely
to be financed include: rural water supply, local road improvements, small bridges, day care centers,
school or health post rehabilitation, small-scale agro-processing such as rice or manioc mills, and minor
irrigation works. Community subprojects would have cost limits of US$50,000 each, and would follow
technical, economic, environmental and sustainability criteria established in the Project Operational
Manuals agreed between each State and the Bank. These manuals are based on the Operational Manuals
already in use for the reformulated NRDP, with some fine-tuning and additions to reflect lessons learned
during the past year and a half of implementation. Targeting will be based on a series of poverty-related
criteria at the beneficiary, community and municipal levels.
10.   The projects would have three main components:
(a)    Community Subprojects (93 percent of base cost). This component would finance
small-scale investments selected, implemented and subsequently operated and maintained
by the beneficiaries. Three different delivery mechanisms would be used for screening,
approval and management of funds: (i) Municipal Community Schemes (FUMAC, about
50 percent of base costs), for which decision-making on subproject selection will be
delegated by the State Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) to Municipal Councils (MCs),
with community members and representatives of local civil society comprising at least
80 percent of Council membership, and the State PCU releasing the funds directly to the
communities; (ii) Pilot Municipal Corfmunity Funds (FUMAC-P, at least 10 percent of
base costs), under which the MCs would not only approve the subprojects submitted by
rural communities but would also administer the funds on the basis of an annual budget
envelope and annual operating plan agreed with the State PCU; and (iii) State Community
Schenmes ! PAC, about 33 percent Of base costs) for which the State PCU would screen,
approve and release funds for subprojects, interacting directly with communities. This
approach vwould :avoid placing at a disadvantage communities within municipalities which
iack either the capacity or pohtical wvillingness to participate directly. The existence of
the PAC would also serve as an incentive to encourage local mayors to join the FUMAC,
knowing that othcrunise their comrniiniPes could access project funds directly at the State
level. It is expet-ctd that the need for the PAC subcomponent would diminish over the
life of the project, and that the FUM AC and FUMAC-P subcomponents would expand.
Flexibility is built into the projects to enable reallocation among subcomponents to
accomnmodate these changes.



- 4 -
(b)   Institutional Development (4 percent of base cost).   Under a decentralized
implementation framework, capacity building of the various participating entities--
community associations, MCs and the PCU--is central to project success.  This
component would support activities to help provide each group with the skills necessary
to carry out its project responsibilities effectively. Technical assistance and training
would be packaged into four categories: (i) a basic introductory capacity-building
program for MCs, organized by the PCU; (ii) specialized skills training for the PCU and
MCs contracted with local experts, on topics such as environmental assessment,
monitoring techniques and financial administration; (iii) technical assistance for
participating commnunities, organized and contracted by the PCU and the MCs, and
including community mobilization and organization, subproject preparation, and operation
and maintenance; and (iv) workshops and seminars for the MCs and beneficiary
associations, to facilitate exchanges of experience. Potential service providers include
NGOs, private extensionists, local consultants and universities.
(c)    Project Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation (3 percent of base cost). This
component would finance some project coordination and supervision costs, and activities
to provide feedback on project performance and impact.  It would support the
establishment of a monitoring system, including maintenance and use of a project
Management Information System (MIS), drawing on the MIS in use for the reformulated
NRDP. It would also finance consultant services to develop and implement studies to
evaluate the impact of community subprojects, including annual physical performance
reviews, an assessment of community-based procurement, a Mid-Term Review of project
performance in the third year, and a comprehensive impact evaluation comparing baseline
indicators at the start of the projects with results at mid-term and project completion.
11.   Project Costs and Financing. For the Bahia project, the total project cost is estimated at
US$175 million, of which the proposed loan would provide US$105 million, the State Government
US$54 million, and beneficiary communities US$16 million. For the Ceara project, the total project cost
is estimated at US$116.7 million, of which the proposed loan would provide US$70 million, the State
Government US$36 million, and beneficiary commnunities US$10.7 million. For the Sergipe project, the
total project cost is estimated at US$60 million, of which the proposed loan would provide US$36
million, the State Government US$18.5 million, and beneficiary communities US$5.5 million. The State
Governments are expected to meet their counterpart funding obligations without difficulty. They have
consistently done so under the reformulated NRDP, and the annual project counterpart funding
requirements for the new projects would be equivalent to 1 percent or less of each State's total budget.
The loans would disburse against 100 percent of expenditures for technical assistance, training and
evaluation studies; 59 percent of expenditures for community subprojects; and 20 percent of incremental
project coordination costs (except salaries) and monitoring. Beneficiaries would provide a minimum of
10 percent of the total costs of cornmmunity subprojects. The estimated project costs and financing plan
for each project are shown in Schedule A. The amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement
and the proposed disbursement schedule for each project are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
processing events and the status of BRank Group operations in Brazil are shown in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Reports (No. 14390--Bahia, No. 14395--Ceara, and No. 14394--
Sergipe), dated June 6, 1995, are attached.



- 5 -
12.   Project Implementation. For the Bahia project, the Conmpanhia de Desenvolvimento e A,cao
Regional (CAR), a decentralized entity of the State Secretariat of Planning, Science and Technology,
would be designated the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), charged with overall responsibility for project
coordination. CAR was created to implement the NRDP and other predecessor projects, and is now one
of the most effective entities of the Bahia State Government. For the Ceara project, the PCU would be
the Departamento de Programas Especiais (DEPES), a department of the State Secretariat of Planning
and Coordination, which has been in charge of overseeing the implementation of NRDP and its Bank-
financed predecessors since 1974.  For the Sergipe project, the PCU would be the Unidade de
Administrafao do Projeto Nordeste de Sergipe (PRONESE), an autonomous entity under the State
Secretariat of Planning, Science and Technology, which has been overseeing the implementation of the
NRDP in Sergipe since 1984. While the monitoring and supervision functions of these PCUs would be
increased by virtue of the fact that the new projects will cover much greater areas, their executive role
would be reduced as many decision-making and implementation responsibilities would be with project
Municipal Councils (MCs) under the FUMAC and FUMAC-P subcomponents. To facilitate this
decentralization, CAR, DEPES and PRONESE are reorganizing to accommodate the needs of the new,
community-based strategy of the reformulated NRDP and the proposed projects. The project MCs in
each state would be responsible for: (a) publicizing and promoting the project in their areas; (b)
prioritizing, through local consensus-building, community subproject proposals and screening them for
approval; (c) assisting the communities in subproject preparation and execution; and (d) monitoring and
supervising implementation of the approved subprojects. Under FUMAC, the MCs will present
subprojects which they have approved to the PCU for financing. Under the FUMAC-P, the MCs will
also manage the funds allocated to them yearly on the basis of annual operating plans. The Completion
Date for all three projects is June 30, 2000, and the Closing Date is December 31, 2000.
13.   Within this framework, the communities in each state would take the lead in proposing,
preparing, implementing and maintaining subprojects. They would organize into legal associations (as
required under Brazilian law), and would participate in financing the subprojects on the basis of cost-
sharing arrangements defined in the Operational Manuals. Associations could solicit technical assistance
when necessary. To ensure quality, the Operational Manuals would contain, inter alia, standardized
technical designs for the most common kinds of subprojects, model terms of reference for consultant
contracts, guidelines for environmental assessment, a cost-sharing matrix and cost indicators for typical
investments. Disbursement of funds for subproject implementation would be based on agreements
(convenios) between the community associations, the PCUs and the MCs. Physical and financial progress
would be monitored on-site by the PCUs and MCs; the PCUs would maintain the MIS and oversee
accounting and auditing arrangements. The Bank's Recife Office would supervise progress through field
visits to sample subprojects, access to the project MIS database, and review of monthly disbursement
summaries.
14.   Project Sustainability. Expectations for sustainability of the proposed projects are quite good.
The community-based subprojects would finance relatively small investments (simple water supply
systems, improvements in local social and economic infrastructure, etc.) which can be maintained by the
communities themselves, from both the technical and financial standpoints. Experience with these
activities under the NRDP, even prior to the 1993 reformulation, confirms this assessment. Equally
important is the fact that client-driven subprojects, identified and implemented by the communities, have
been shown to have a high degree of ownership by the beneficiary groups, which are therefore more
willing to maintain project investments. Under the NRDP, a commitment by each community group
concerning operation and maintenance is a condition for approval of subprojects, and forms part of the



- 6 -
agreement signed with the association. Compliance has been good and these same features have been
built into the proposed projects. Finally, the formation and strengthening of MCs, piloted under the
NRDP, has begun to improve local government participation. The institutional development component
of the projects will further enhance this participation and thus foster longer-term project sustainability.
15.    Lessons from Bank Experience. The lessons learned from the reformulated NRDP are borne
out by the Bank's experience elsewhere in Latin America and other regions with similar community-based
development programs. These are: (a) Decentralization of fiscal and investment decision-making
responsibility from federal to state and local governments ensures more effective project administration.
Excessive bureaucracy at the Federal and state levels under previous rural development projects in Brazil
created administrative bottlenecks and, by distancing the beneficiaries from the decision-makers, obscured
accountability for project performance.  Nevertheless, decentralization of resource allocation and
investment decisions to rural municipalities and communities should be accompanied by a clearly defined
and well-disseminated system of checks and balances to discourage the misuse of funds. (b) Participation
by beneficiaries in the selection, execution, supervision and financing of project investments generates
a greater sense of ownership and a willingness to share responsibility for the future operation and
maintenance of investments. It also helps to ensure that project investments respond to true perceived
needs, generate cost savings, and increase local accountability. (c) Sustainability of project investments
has greater potential when municipalities and communities contribute to subproject financing and when
there is active beneficiary participation. For example, the participatory process introduced in the
FUMAC component of the reformulated NRDP has ensured better selection and prioritization of
subprojects by beneficiaries.  (d) Poverty targeting mechanisms should be simple, explicit and
monitorable; should be based on objective criteria; foster transparency and minimize political interference
in project resource allocation; and ensure that funds do reach the poorest communities. (e) Technical
assistance should be accessible to rural communities to enable them to identify, prepare and implement
their own subprojects, thereby augmenting their capacity to compete for investment funds. Such
assistance should also be targeted to weaker communities to improve their planning, management and
financial capacity.  (f)  Standardization of subproject documents, technical designs and unit costs
simplifies the subproject preparation and evaluation process, facilitates the efficient procurement of goods
and works, avoids overdesign and improves the quality of subprojects, encouraging greater participation
by poorer communities and reducing bottlenecks in the subproject cycle. (g) A user-friendly monitoring
and evaluation system facilitates the subproject evaluation process, provides quick feedback and necessary
information to improve targeting and efficiency, and is an essential management and planning tool. These
lessons have been taken into account in the design of the Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects.
16.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed projects are consistent with the Brazilian
Government's broad strategy for poverty alleviation, as articulated in its new Comunidade Soliddria
program, with the Bank's last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on June 29,
1993, and with the new CAS which will be discussed concurrently with these projects. Poverty reduction
is the main focus of the Bank's assistance strategy in Brazil, to be achieved through stabilization and
resumption of broad-based economic growth, appropriate structural reforms and sector-specific policies,
and better targeting of social and economic infrastructure and services to the poor. This strategy calls
for improvements in poverty alleviation programs, such as the reformulated NRDP, which has piloted
an effective model to address rural poverty in the Northeast. The proposed projects would thus make a
central contribution to meeting the Bank's overarching objective in Brazil. They would also support the
complementary objectives of decentralization of expenditure and implementation responsibilities from the
Federal Government to States, municipalities and local communities. As the principal donor engaged in



- 7 -
a long-term partnership with the Brazilian Government to address rural poverty issues in the Northeast,
the Bank is particularly well placed to support this next phase of development initiatives for the Region.
17.   Agreements Reached. During negotiations, the Bank reviewed complete drafts of the revised
NRDP Operational Manuals for each state. Assurances were provided by each State that: (a) all project
components would be carried out in accordance with the Project Operational Manual; (b) annual operating
plans and budgets for each project year would be made available for Bank review and comments; (c)
adequate and timely counterpart funding would be provided by the States for the projects; (d) a
satisfactory project information and monitoring system and reporting arrangements would be maintained
throughout the project period; (e) a baseline evaluation study would be completed within one year of loan
effectiveness and a Mid-Term Review of each project would be carried out during the third year of
implementation; (f) a Special Account would be established and all project accounts would be audited in
a manner satisfactory to the Bank; and (g) procurement would be in accordance with procedures
satisfactory to the Bank and a study of procurement by community contracting would be carried out
during the first year of each project and recommendations adopted expeditiously. Conditions of loan
effectiveness for each State would include: (a) adoption of the Project Operational Manual, including final
models of agreements between the PCU, MCs and community associations; (b) signing of satisfactory
agreements needed between the State of Bahia and CAR, and the State of Sergipe and PRONESE,
governing project coordination and administration responsibilities; and (c) establishment of effective
project monitoring arrangements.
18.   Project Benefits. The proposed projects would improve the quality of life for some 2.7 million
people (or about 541,000 families) in the rural areas of Bahia, Ceara and Sergipe, by providing improved
access to water supply and other basic social and economic infrastructure and services, and by increasing
their production, incomes and employment. Project-financed rural water supply and minor irrigation
works will be particularly important in reducing vulnerability to drought. Productive subprojects will
provide a vehicle for financing improvements in input use and technology, thus raising productivity and
incomes. Female community members will benefit directly from water supply subprojects as well as
several types of productive and social subprojects, e.g., day care centers for children and the elderly,
which enable them to seek employment and contribute to family cash incomes. Another important project
benefit will be the strengthening of the capacity of poor municipalities and communities to define and
address priority needs, and to plan and execute development projects. It is also expected that the new
projects will have a similar impact in the mobilization of additional community and municipal resources,
as has the reformulated NRDP (thus far ranging from 10 to 20 percent of resources invested by the
projects), thereby improving the longer-term sustainability of investments. Finally, the projects will
provide a safety net for some of the poorest segments of the States' rural populations who will likely be
affected by constrained public investments and services during the period of fiscal adjustment and
macroeconomic reform.
19.   Environmental Aspects. The proposed projects have been classified as "B". Given their
relatively small size and nature, most community subprojects would not have a significant impact on the
environment. The projects would, however, ensure proper environmental screening and enforcement
measures to prevent any negative environmental effects that certain types of productive or infrastructure
investments could produce. The Operational Manuals would specify environmental criteria, screening
procedures and enforcement mechanisms to be followed.



- 8 -
20.   Poverty and Program Objective Category. The proposed projects are part of the Bank's
Program of Targeted Interventions. The Northeast Region has the greatest incidence of poverty in Brazil,
and Bahia, Ceara and Sergipe together contain nearly half of the poor in the Northeast. The projects
employ a targeting methodology at the beneficiary, community and municipal levels, which takes into
account poverty-related criteria and other key parameters to ensure that the projects' resources reach those
communities in each state which contain higher concentrations of rural poor.
21.   Participatory Approach.   The projects' emphasis on beneficiary participation in the
identification, implementation, financing and management of local subprojects is consonant with anti-
poverty policies based on community mobilization efforts. Beneficiaries' views have influenced the
design of the new projects. First, several studies assessed, inter alia, popular participation under the
NRDP and its 1993 reformulation, surveying beneficiaries to determine the impact and lessons of the
community-based approach. Second, supervision of the ongoing NRDP has involved meeting with
municipal and State officials, Mayors, members of project Municipal Councils, NGOs and other entities
for their suggestions concerning needed improvements. The stress on participation is likely to bolster
sustainability and strengthen the capacity of poor communities to take the lead in formulating and
implementing their own development agendas.
22.   Project Risks. Bank experience in Latin America and elsewhere suggests that the main sources
of risk for this type of project derive from: (a) irregular funding which can erode community confidence
and participation; (b) technical shortcomings and inadequate supervision of large numbers of widely
dispersed subprojects; (c) mistargeting of program resources; and (d) over-centralization of decision-
making, which often has the corollary effect of depressing local initiative and community involvement.
The funding risk will be reduced by the fact that the Bank loans will be taken directly by the States,
thereby eliminating those disbursement delays previously encountered at the Federal level. Secondly,
counterpart funding responsibilities would be shared with the communities, decreasing the relative burden
on the States. Third, and perhaps most important, the strong sense of ownership by the States,
municipalities and communities should help to protect project counterpart funding needs during the
process of allocating scarce budget resources. The risks of overdesign and weak supervision at the
subproject level should be substantially reduced with the establishment of technical standards and cost
criteria for the most common types of subprojects, and reinforced institutional strengthening components.
Mistargeting and lack of participation have not been serious problems under the reformulated NRDP.
However, to prevent this from happening in the future, a system of operational disincentives against such
behavior has been built into the projects' design. For instance, a community or municipality would
receive fewer funds the following year, or be cut off entirely from the program, in cases of
misappropriation, mistargeting or insufficient participation.
23.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve them.
