MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE 2EPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PROJ.ECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent
of US$60 million to help finance a project for environmental iesearch and
education. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate,
with a maturity of 15 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.        Background.  The spectacular development of Korea over the last
three decades has been accompanied by rapid industrialization and
urbanization, and the restructuring of agriculture which resulted in a
declining farm population together with rising agricultural productivity and
incomes. As a result of the rapid growth of industry and the cities and
steadily rising living standards, environmental problems began to emerge in
the eighties. Air, soil and water pollution increased with the rapid increase
in motor vehicle ownership, rising volumes of household and industrial waste
and the growing use of agrochemicals. In response to the need to alleviate
environmental degradation and manage waste disposal, the Government has
created an appropriate legal and institutional framework.
3.        The first major step was taken in 1977 with the establishment of
the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) under the Ministry of Health and
Social Services (MOHSA). This was followed in 1978 by the Environmental
Preservation Law, the first major environmental statute in Korea. This law
introduced a number of imporcant regulatory devices such as the promulgation
of environmental standards, environmental monitoring, environmental impact
assessments for new projects, emission standards and control. To strengthen
implementation of the law, the EMB was upgraded in 1980 to the Environmental
Administration (EA) with the status of an independent agency under MOHSA.
Six regional environmental monitoring offices were set up under the EA.
4.        The increasing complexity of environmental issues and the growing
sensitivity to them in the 1980s led the Government to conclude that existing
legislation needed to be broadened and its implementation strengthened. This
resulted in 1990 in the upgrading of the EA into the cabinet-level Ministry of
Environment (MOEN) and the introduction of new basic legislation (the Basic
Environmental Policy Law) supported by separate laws dealing with specific
problems such as air pollution, water pollution, noise control, hazardous
substance control, solid waste management and marine pollution. MOEN plays an
important policy and planning role, undertakes environmental research and is
responsible for monitoring air, water and soil quality. Since mid-1992 many
of the day-to-day monitoring and enforcement activities have been
decentralized to municipal and provincial authorities.
5.        Although many of the more visible environmental problems are in the
cities and industrial areas, the rural areas where agriculture is the major
activity, also suffer significant environmental degradation. The major
problems relate to the pollution of soil and water from household and
livestock waste and agrochemicals, and also to the conservation of soil,
forests and fisheries. A great deal more needs to be learned about the impact



of polluting and depleting agents on the rural environment. The Government is
looking to the schools of agriculture and veterinary science in the
universities to expand their research efforts and to provide better trained
professionals in environmental fields. The latter are needed in increasing
numbers in the agencies concerned with measuring and controlling pollution,
managing waste disposal and improving the conservation of natural resources.
The schools are responding by moving their focus increasingly away from the
traditional concentration on food production and animal health, towards issues
affecting the rural environment.
6.        Lessons from Previous Bank Experience.  The major lesson of
relevance to project design concerns the effective scheduling of visiting
experts and the close integrat-.on of experts into institutional activities.
The proposed project has an agreed schedule for the visiting experts and clear
terms of reference for each expert.
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Over the past decade, the
Government has begun to address seriously the environmentel problems that have
emerged from three decades of rapid growth. Wide-ranging legislation has been
enacted and agencies have been established to implement this legislation and
to provide policy and planning guidance on environmental issues. To reinforce
these activities, environmental education has been introduced into primary and
secondary schools' curricula and into teacher training programs. College-
level science courses are focusing increasingly on environmental issues and
university research programs are also moving in this direction. A number of
Korea's national research institutes (NRIs) are also giving priority to
developing environmental technology and to expanding their environmental R&D
services to industry. Selected NRIs will be assisted to strengthen these
activities under an Environmental Technology Development Project, which has
been proposed for Bank financing.
8.        Within the above context, which represents an approach to
addressing the broad range of environmental issues, the main emphasis has been
on the urban environment. The proposed project would focus on the problems of
the rural environment and help to strengthen selected agricultural and
veterinary colleges to deal with these. The project would therefore help to
bring balance to Korea's environmental efforts. The agricultural and
veterinary colleges have a particularly important role to play in environment-
related teaching and research in a densely-populated country with scarce
cultivable land and abundant forests (21% and 66% of total land area
respectively). Cultivable land is becoming increasingly polluted through
household, industrial and animal waste, and agrochemicals; inland and coastal
waters are being polluted in a similar manner. Korea's forests, although
extensive, need to be better managed to ensure effective conservation of soils
and watersheds, efficient harvesting and replanting, reduction of pest damage
and improved tree health, etc. This requires better trained professionals to
measure and control pollution, manage forests and fisheries and operate the
regulatory system. There is also a priority need to improve and expand
research into key environmental problems related to land, water and forests.
Within the overall framework of environmental policy, the proposed project
provides the opportunity for the Bank to support Korea's plans for
environmental improvement by strengthening environmental research and teaching
in selected agricultural and veterinary colleges.



9.        The project would assist in moving the colleges more firmly towards
addressing environmental concerns and in acceleratiug the pace of such
involvement. The project also provides the opportunity to introduce important
institutional improvements through cre- ig an efficient mechanism for
centralizing common research activities (NICEM), which would be of particular
benefit to smaller institutions, and through the establishment of suitable
arrangements for the review of environment-related r3search and teaching
programs.
10.       The Bank's country assistance strategy has been discussed with the
Government in the context of the graduation plan for Korea. Priority areas
for Bank operations will be the social sectors, social infrastructure, the
financial sector and environmental protection. The rationale for continued
Bank lending in these sectors is that the Bank can add value, apart from the
resource transfer itself, through transferring technical expertise and cross-
country experience to Korea. The project, with its focus on strengthening
environmental education and research, its inclusion of overseas training for
key personnel and visiting experts in priority environmental fields, is fully
consistent with the country assistance strategy.
11.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project aims to assist selected
agricultural and veterinary colleges to: (a) upgrade their capacity to
undertake research into key environmental problems; (b) establish facilitz.es
for effective common research activities; (c) reinforce the environmental
aspects of basic science programs in the colleges, in order to strengthen
professional training in environmental fields; and (d) establish suitable
arrangements for the review of environment-related research and teaching
programs.
12.       Project Description.  The project would:  (a) establish the
National Instrumentation Center for Environmental Management (NICE?) to
promote cooperative research efforts in environmental fields and finance
specialized equipment (estimated baseline cost US$10.7 million) to make NICEM
operational; (b) finance research and teaching equipment for selected
agricultural colleges (US$34.7 million) and veterinary colleges (US$13
million); (c) finance complementary inputs (US$21.7 million) related to making
the equipment operational and maintaining it thereafter, namely, local
transportation and installation costs, O&M and consumables; (d) finance a
program of overseas training and visiting experts to be implemented by NICE?
(US$1.7 million); (e) finance library materials for NICEM (US$0.1 million);
and (f) establish the Environment Research Advisory Committee (ERAC) and the
Environmental Education Review Committee (EERC) to ensure the continued
relevance of environmental research and teaching. The loan, to be disbursed
over five and a half years, would finance about 83% of the foreign exchange
cost of the project, or about 62% of the total project costs, net of duties
and taxes. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Korea are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 11429-KO, dated April 15, 1993, is being distributed
separately.
13.       Project Imnlementation.  Overall responsibility for project
implementation would lie with the Ministry of Education (MOE) with its



-4-
Education Facilities Bureau handling the detailed activities. Education
inputs and related technical advice would be provided by MOE's Science and
Technology Education Bureau and University Education Office. The Project
Coordinating Committee, set up under the Universities Science and Technology
Research Project (Ln. 3203-KO), would provide general oversight of the
project. MOE would also act as the link between the project institutions and
the Ministry of Environment on matters of environmental policy. Equipment
proeurement would be undertaken by the Office of Supply, Republic of Korea in
conjunction with MOE. The project would be implemented over a period of five
years.
14.       Project Sustainability.  The project would be implemented within a
sound environmental policy framework and strong Goveinment commitment to
addressing environmental problems. Thus, the project's long-term benefits are
likely to be sustained. Previous experience under a number of education
projects has shown that Bank-financed equipment has been well-maintained and
effectively utilized. This situation is likely to cont'nue. The commitment
to addressing environmental concerns is also likely to ensure that NICEM will
be adequately staffed and financed, and operate effectively in the future.
15.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed that:  (a) NICEN would
carry out its assigned functions during implementation of the project and
thereafter; (b) the program of overseas training and visiting experts would be
implemented according to an agreed schedule; and (c) initial meetings of the
EERC and ERAC would be held by September 30, 1993 and the committees convened
thereafter on dates to be determined by the chairpersons, but no less than
once in each academic year.
16.       Environmental Asnects.  The project would help to strengthen
Korea's efforts to address environmental problems, especially as they relate
to rural areas, by improving environment-related teaching and research in
selected agricultural and veterinary colleges.
17.       Benefits.  The project would assist the agricultural and veterinary
colleges in strengthening the teaching of environment-related courses which in
turn would lead to better-prepared professionals bec.ming available to work in
environmental fields in the public and private sectors. The project would
also help to strengthen environmental research which would lead to a better
understanding of key environmental problems thereby improving the basis for
policy making and increasing the effectiveness of environmental protection
programs.
18.       Risks.  There are no major risks associated with the project.
19.       Recommendato. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
