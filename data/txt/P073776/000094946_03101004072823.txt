2.0     Methodology
The project, as per the relevant legislation of the Govemment of lIdEa (Gol), is subject to a clearance from the
ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) on account of the possible adverse environmental impacts
(includes impacts on land use, natural drainage and affected peqple also). As per the World Bank (WB)
Operational Directives/Policies/Guidelines, given the potential direct, induced and cumulative magnitudes of
environmental and social impacts, the project attracts provision of (i) OP/BP/GP 4.01: Environmental
Assessment, (ii) OP 4.12: Involuntary Resettlement, and (iii) BP 17.50: Disclosure of Operational Information.
During the process of project preparation various inter-linked studies were conducted in which environmental
and social impact assessment are of significance. These cover evaluaion of the impacts of the project on natural
habitats, cultural properties and indigenous people. As a part of EIA/SIA study community consultation was
conducted and demand/ suggestion made by the local people was incorporated to the extent possible in prject
design. Separate EMPs and RAPs were prepared. The emphasis in the project was in integration of the
mitigation measures into the project design and mainstreaming environmental and social concerns in all stages
of planning, implementation and operation.
The EIA, EMP and RAP have been subjected to a review by independent consultants as the project has been
categorized as category 'A' project due to its cumulative magnitude of social and environmental impacts.
2.1         Environmental Assessment Process Adopted
Incorporation of Environmental considerations into the project planning and design has been taken up as an
integral part of the project preparation. The major steps in EA process that have been adopted for this project are
presented below:
2.1.1       Environmental Screening
The feasibility study incorporated a social and environmental screening. In the screening stage all environmental
and social aspects of bypass were identified. The impacts or various environmental and social aspects were also
considered in project influence area. Informal local level public consultations were held during screening to
assess likely impacts on project influence area (PIA). Based on sreening, EIA was focused on potentially
significant environmental issues.
2.1.2      Environmental Impact Assessment and Management Plans
The detailed designs of bypass alignment have been closely coordinated with the preparation of Environmental
Impact Assessment Study. The EIA preparation led to identificatior of potential environmental hotspois and
their feasible remedial measures (including avoidance, mitigation and enhancements) that were made a part of
environmental management plan.

EA Process Summary of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
2.1.2.1    EIA Process
It consists following steps:
1. Study of Baseline status: The potentially affected area was defined and the baseline conditions were
documented.
11. Assessment of Potential Impacts: Potential significant impacts were identified on the basis of an
analytical review of baseline data, and the scope ofthe project.
Ill. Community Consultation: Consultations with concemed officials, agencies, potenlially affected
persons and communitics and various other stakeholders continued through the prtSct-preparation
phase, and will continue as the project is implemented. The issues rose by the comrmnities and the
various stakeholders were incorporated, as far as possible, in the design and consnition/operation
plan of the project.
IV. Integration of Environmental Assessments in the Design Process: The design and drcision-making
process integrated environmental and resettlement and rehabilitation issues and prompted the early
identification of appropriate action.
V. Assessment of Alternatives: The EA is made on the selected alignment but altemativs of RoW were
continuously assessed throughout the process. A more formal assessment was also undertaken as a part
of the environmental assessment process, including the assessment of the "No Action' altemative.
VI. Mitigation & Enhancement Measures: Mitigation measures were delineated for each ef the potential
significant negative impacts. Positive actions to not only avoid adverse impacts, but X capitalize on
opportunities to correct cnvironmental degradation or improve environmental conditions were
determined.
VIl. Environmental Management Plans: The EMP detailed out the measures to be taken for the
implementation of the various measures proposed. This includes the monitoring plan and gives details
of the implementation arrangements and budget.
2.2 Rehabilitation and Resettlement Action Plan
A.      Social Impact Assessment: To prepare the RAP, social impact assessment had becn carried out on
the basis of primary data collected, consultation with the stakeholders and information from
secondary sources. Socio-economic baseline survey was conducted, including on the socio-economic
and demographic profile of the affected communities. An understanding was deveoped about the
physical, social, economic, and cultural set-up in the project influence area.
B.      Resettlement and Rehabilitation Action Plan
1. Verification exercise: Strip plans of the project road and the details of RoW were collected. The legal
boundaries of the RoW provided the basis for identifying and enumerating the number of project
affected persons. The verification exercises and consultations have largely helped to rnodify the design,
thus minimizing negative impacts. Accordingly the strip maps were updated. Also the PAPs (as per
modifications in the designs) were identified and considered for further surveys.
I. The census: A census was carried out to ensure that all impacted persons are identified so that the
entitlements could be worked out and budgeted. The census was conducted through door-to-door
personal interviews. All persons and families located within the Corridor of Impact (Col) were
enumerated. The census also collected information on assets and livelihood of the PAPs and PAFs, and
recorded likely impacts on such assets and livelihood.
Ill. Soclo-economic baseline survey: A socio-economic survey was conducted on 25% of the PAPs to
provide a database to develop indicators for the monitoring and evaluation of the RAP. Selection of the
stratified samples was based on of the categories of losses.
IV. Entitlement Framework: The entitlement framework was derived entirely from the NHAI's R&R
Policy and as per the World Bank Guidelines.

EA Process Summary of
Allahabad Bypass of NH.2
V. Community Consultations: Consultations were undertaken to disseminate information about project
to the potentially affccted people. and to incorporate their views and suggestions in the RAP as well as
the design. Consultations were carried out at v-arious levels, at villages level and district levels (focus
group discussions), and the state level (public hearing and the stakeholders' consultations).
Different social groups were consulted based on the sample size decided for the socio-economic surveys. Focus
group discussions were held with women, SC, ST and other vulnerable group. This enabled the RAP to be
suitable to the needs of the community and the impacted groups.
At the district level, consultations were to build awareness amongst, and enlist support'from the people,
govemment agencies and the NGOs. At the state level, consultations were held with key project stakeholders
such as the Allahabad Development Authority, Revenue Department, the State Planning Board and several
experts, on various related issues.
2.3 Independent Review of ElAs, EMPs and RAP documents
The independent consultants* carried out a review and finalized the EIA, EMP and RAP reports with additional
inputs, as was required with respect to the deficiencies identified, and ensured that these meet the relevant
World Bank requirements, are in compliance with the environmental and social safeguards, and are consistent
with Category A projects. Further, it was confirmed that the EA/SA has been carnied out in an acceptable
manner, and has been able to influence the project design by mainstreaming the key environmental and social
issues'.
3.     Institutional and Legal Setting
3.1 Institutional Setting
The NHAI is mandated to implement the NHDP comprising 13000 km out of 30,000 km National Highway
network in India within 2011. The NHAI is created as a corporate body, to work as a facilitator and supervisor
to the various responsible agencies, such as consultants, contractors and NGOs. The overall responsibility for
implementation is vested with the PlUs established at the project locations for each project packages consists of
one project director, and two managers (one Technical cum Environmental and other one for R&R). PIU works
in close association with local communities, NGOs, and district level comnmittees in various stages of
implementation of the project.
To assess, advise and monitor the environmental performance of the various projects being executed by the
NHAI, an ESDU has been established at the Corporate Office of the NHAI. The General Manager
(Environment), who is assisted by a Deputy General Manager (DGM) and two managers - one each for the
Environmental and Resettlement aspects, heads ESDU. The ESDU works in close interaction with the
environmental managers at the various PlUs.
.3.2 Legal Setting
The project would need total statutory clearances from Govemment of India and Govemment of Uttar Pradesh

4.1     Plans for Continued Participation
It is essential to involve communities and affected persons in the process of implementation for successful and
time bound implementation of RAP as well as EMP of the project. Additionally for disclosure of project
information to the community, the project documents will be displayed at the public places, with unrestricted
access.
4.1.1 Information Disclosure
The EIA, EMP and RAP documents will be disclosed at several locations, for the benefit of the interested
community and the stakeholders. The following are the components of disclosure of project information.
*   The NGOs involved in implementation of the RAP will organize public meetings and will appraise the
communities about the progress in the implementation of R & R works
*   There will be Grievance Redressal Committees (GRCs) for each district. The PAPs will be associated with
such committees (each of the committees will include representative of the PAPs)
*   The resettlement sites, and other amenities and facilities to be made available to the PAPs will be decided in
consultation with the communities
*   The NGOs will organize public meetings to inform the community about the compensation and assistance
to be paid. Regular update of the progress of resettlement component of the project will be placed for
public display at the PIU office
*   All monitoring and evaluation reports of the environmental and R & R components of the project will be
disclosed to the public.
4.1.2  Continued Participation
Moreover, the project has planned for continued community consultation and participation. NGOs will play a
very important role in this process. NGOs will be responsible to ensure that all grievances of the_
community/individuals are solved, and communities are consulted periodically at regular intervals in various
stages of the project, i.e., implementation, monitoring and evaluation of EMP and RAP suggested measures.
5. Selection of Alternatives
Over a period of time traffic volume has increased many fold on National Highway -2 and one encounters acute
traffic congestion within city of Allahabad. The reason for intensified traffic in Allahabad city is besides NH-2,
four other major roads that are connecting major cities and other district head quarters are also merging to this
town. As per the latest traffic census, 42.3 % of traffic on NH-2 within the Allahabad city is through traffic. Due
to the increased traffic and restricted width of carriage way average operative speed on NH-2 in Allahabad town
is 10 kmph. In order to achieve higher operative speed for 'through traffic' in future years, three options were
explored i.e., widening the existing NH-2 to four lanes; construction of elevated structure above the existing
NH-2 carriageway; and construction of bypass. Bypass to the city was found to be the most viable option.
5.1         Selection of Alternative Bypass Alignments
Seven altemative alignments to bypass the Allahabad town were considered. A separate study was under taken
and a report named, as "Selection of Altematives" was prepared for finalizing the bypass alignment. This report
has been submitted to the World Bank and accepted by them. Among seven, one alignment (ASI) was on
southem side, five (AN I through AN5), were on the northem side of Allahabad Town and the seventh one was
elevated structure with four lane above the existing National Highway within Allahabad town. These
altematives were assessed by a weighted marking scheme, the weights were allotted to various factors which
could influence the choice i.e., capital cost, scope of future widening, land acquisition, user cost, impact on
environment, suitability of alignment etc. Based on the evaluation, altemative 'AN-4' was found to be the most
viable option. The map showing all altemative alignment is given in Figure 2. The select alignment (AN4) of
bypass was adopted for detailed DPR.
5.2     With' & 'Without' Project Alternatives
At present Allahabad District Authority controls the traffic in peak hours, 10 am to evening 6 pm adopting 'NO
Entry' regulations for Heavy Vehicles to the city. As more development is coming up in the region, traffic
volume on NH-2 is growing rapidly, and there is no feasible altemative highway for the through traffic to

unsafe conditions and the advcrsc cnvironmcntal consemnces (in terms of cnvironmental quality along the
existing NH-2, particularly, air and noise pollution within ihe town) would continue to worsen in absence of the

6.2.2 Hydrology and Drainage: The proposed bypass is passing through almost a flat terrain. Slope of the
area is from northwest (kml58, Kokhraj) to southeast (Km 245, Handia) with an avenge gradient of 16 cm/Km.
a) Surface Water: The proposed bypass alignment is crossing numerous streams, drains, canals and three rivers
namely Ganga, Doab and Mansaita. Following Table gives the summary of water bodies located along the
project routes.

b) Ground water: There are 26 water tanks, 26 pump houses, 37 hand pumps and 44 wells are coming on the
alignment. In general the ground water table of the study area varies between 10-15m. The water table also
varies in various seasons.
The quality of water is by-and-large acceptable except for alkalinity and hardness for some bore wells and a
high TSS has been observed in all the three rivers i.e., Ganga, Doab, and Mansaita rivers (320, 195 and 190 ppm
respectively).
6.3     Land Environment
6.3.1 Geology/Physiography: The project area is geo-morphologically a part of the Ganga plain. It has 400-
1500m deep alluvial covers. The base in the project area is quite deep, probably more than 1000-4000m below
the ground. The slope of the area is from northwest (Km 158, Kokhraj) to southeast (Km 245, Handia) with an
average gradient of 16 cm/km. Thus, the project area of the proposed bypass is almost a flat terrain.
6.3.2 Seismicity: The entire length of Allahabad bypass falls in Zone 11 with a seismic coefficient of 0.02 as
indicated in IRC-6-1996 clause 222.3 and appendix 5 of IRC of IRC 78-1979.
6.3.3 Soils: The Allahabad bypass area as a whole is the alluvial plain of Ganga river. In general the soil is
alluvial, pale brown to whitish in color and loam to sandy loam in texture (sand 40-45%, silt 28%, and clay
27%). The soils are neutral to moderatcly alkaline with accumulation of calcium in the form of lime at varying
depths and sizes.
6.3.4 Soil Erosion: Soil erosion Is not a prominent feature in project influence area.

EA Process Summary of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
6.3.5 Land use: Proposed bypass alignment is passing through predominantly rural agricultural land, with
scattered community water bodies, orchards, villages etc. It is not affecting any major human settlements. Only
97 village households are getting affected. Total land required is 781 ha. Out of which, 80 percent is cultivated
land, about 7-8 percent is fallow land, and balanced 2-3 percent is water bodies.
6.4     Construction Materials
6.4.1 Fill Materials: Total 14.073 million cum of fill materials axe required for this project. Which will be
partly filled by earth from identified borrow pits and rest will be met by fly ash from Unchhahar Thermal Power
Plant.
a) Borrow Pits: Borrow pits are identified within 100 - 600m from the RoW. Based on the total requirement
and availability of each soil type, estimates of soil quantity to be obtained from each of the borrow areas were
worked out in accordance with the National Standards, recommended by the Indian Roads Congress (IRC).
Total 4.4 million cum of earth will be available from these borrow pits.
b) Fly Ash: Balance quantity of fill materials, 9.63 million cum will be met from Firoz Gandhi Unchhahar
Thermal Power Station.
6.4.2 Quarries and Crushers: Total 1750,000 cum of stone & aggregates and 290,000 cum of sand will be
entire Allahabad bypass project. The potential quarries identified for the Allahabad bypass project are Dalla,
Birohi, Kabrai, Banda and Shankargarh quarries for obtaining sand and aggregates. These are UPPWD approved
quarries by and already in operation with the required environmental clearances. No new quarries have been
proposed for this project.
6.4.3 Water: Total 2222680 cum of water will be required for the project (including earthwork, concrete work
and drinking/ house hold use of water for labour and construction camp). The required water would be extracted
from ground water source by dedicated bore well separately bored for this project.
6.5     Noise
The noise levels at start and end point of bypass have been found to exceed the prescribed limits due to heavy
traffic. But at rural locations the day and night 'Leq' values are wdl within the stipulated limits of CPCB for
residential areas. A variation of more than 5 dB (A) to 10-dB (A) was observed at the monitoring locations
between the day and nighttime noise levels. The values arrived for day and night from the measured noise levels
at an interval of I minute at various locations along the project route presented below:

Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
6.6    Terrestrial Ecosystem
6.6.1 V'egetation and Habitats: 'rhe study area is predominantly cultivated land interrupted by scattered
human settlements with cluster of thatched houses, orchards and common native trees. Narrow strip of grasses
are encounter at the riparian zone of the river Ganga/ other flowing water bodies.
Crops in the fields are the predominant features of the study area. The agricultural lands through which bypass
alignment passes are highly productive and give four crops annually.
A total of 3298 numbers of trees have been identified to be cut from the RoW. In which about 1046 fruit bearing
trees from the thirty affected orchards have been identified. The project-influenced area does not have any
forests land or endangered species of vegetation.
The entire length of Allahabad bypass falls mainly under the administrative control of Kausambi and Allahabad
forest divisions. No natural park, sanctuary, wild life reserves or reserved forests are present in near vicinity.
The nearest wildlife sanctuary (Chitrakoot) is beyond 60 kms from the bypass alignmnent.
6.6.2 WVild Life: The wild fauna are negligible within the study area. Common native fauna like Neelgai,
Hyaena, Jackal, Rabbit, Porcupine etc. are rarely encountered in village out skirts and in the bank of
rivers/streams. Total 33 varieties of animals (10 varieties of mammals, 7 varieties of reptiles and 16 types of
birds) are enlisted from various secondary sources. None are endangered/ vulnerable/rare species except Pavo
cristatus (Peacock), the national bird of India, which is one of the common bird species found in this area.
6.7    Aquatic Ecosystem
The ecological status of the existing surface water bodies including Ganra indicate that oligotropic to
mesotropic in nature, average productivity ranges from 1800-6900 calories/ m /day) as per the secondary data
collected from CICFRJ, Allahabad. Almost all the species of planktons recorded from these water bodies are
most common in clean water as well as in partially polluted freshwater contaminated by organic matter.
Dominance and diversity of planktons indicates that organic pollutants do not enrich the water bodies. Large-
scale commercial fisheries are lacking within the study area. The State Fisheries Department has recorded 15
varieties of fishes and one variety of prawn from this area in which 10 varieties are commercially important
major carps. No endanger species recorded from any aquatic system of the area.
6.8     Human Use Values
Settlements: 781 ha of land are required for this proposed bypass in which 94 ha is Government land and
balance is private land, Few hamlets kind settlements are present on the RoW. No protected archaeological
properties or monuments along the bypass alignment are present. Four small temples are on the Row. Besides,
six schools are also coming within the RoW.
7.0    Impact Assessment
The impacts have qualitatively been weighed on low, high or moderate based on level of impacts due to the
project during various stages i.e., planning and design stage, construction stage, and operation stage.
7.1     Climate
No change in the macro-climatic setting (precipitation, temperature and wind) is envisaged due to the project.
The overall impact on climate of the region is not going to be significant and therefore has been categorized as
low.
7.2     Natural and Biophysical Environment
7.2.1 Air: The area will be impacted by air pollution both during construction and operation stages. Major
impacts are:
i) Dusts: Generation of dust is a critical issue and is likely to have adverse impact on health of workers in
quarries, borrow areas and stone crushing units during Pre Construction and Construction Stages. This is a direct
adverse impact will last almost throughout the construction period.
ii) Generation of Exhaust Gases: Generation of exhaust gases is likely during the pre-construction stage due to
movement of heavy machinery for clearance of the RoW for construction. High levels of S02, HC and NO, are
likely to be emitted from hot mix plant operations, and heating process during bitumen production. If adequate

measures are taken, impacts from generated gases can be considerably reduced. In the Operation Stage the
major impact on air quality will be due to plying of vehicles.
The Mathematical model study has been carried out to predict the anticipated pollution load using CALINE-3.
As SPM level is already high in some locations and its emission from vehicles will be minimal, therefore
particulates are not modeled only CO and NO level have been assessed. The predictions have been carried out
for 2006, 2026 and 2036. As per the modeled study predicted CO values are well within the limits and NOx
exceed the prescribed levels at start and end points of bypass.
7.2.2   Hydrology and Drainage:
a) Alteration of Drainage: The impact on the flowing water bodies will mainly during construction period for
the diversion of watercourses. This will cause constriction, increase velocity at the downstream of the bridge
and increase sediment load with the flow. However, the impact shall be restricted during construction period of
the project
The drainage pattern of the area has been studied and cross drainage structures have been provided to facilitate
natural drainage across the alignment. Therefore, the road design itself takes care of the cross-pavement
drainage and local flooding or water logging.
b) Increased Sedimentation and Degradation of Water Quality: Soil in the study area is alluvial type with a
high silt composition, which will cause siltation of near by water bodies. Numerous irrigation canals that criss-
cross the study area are unlikely to be subjected to run-off discharges because they have properly raised berms
on their banks.
Degradation of water quality is also possible due to accidental discharges into watercourses from drainage of
workers' camps and from spillage in vehicle parking and/or fuel and lubricant storage areas. Since the soil is
alluvial and contains a large proportion of silt, percolation to underlying aquifer will be very fast. Therefore, any
pollutant discharge may quickly percolate into the depths of the earth.
In the operation phase, there is little chance of degradation of water quality and the aquatic ecosystem during
normal operations. The implications of accidental discharge are potentially disastrous. But, it must be
emphasized that the probability of such an accident is quite low.
c) Loss of surface water bodies/ natural drainage: All the surface water bodies of the area like rivers,
streams and culverts are retained providing culverts and bridges over them. Besides, 61 additional cross
drainage structures also will be provided along the natural depression across the bypass road to maintain the
natural sheet flow of water during rain. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed bypass would not have any
significant influence on the drainage pattern of the area, Moreover this will also maintain the soil fertility on the
land of either side of the alignment.
d) Groundwater sources: A number of groundwater sources-wells and hand pumps are located within the RoW
proposed alignment will be lost for the bypass .The loss of these sources of drinking water would be a direct
negative impact. However, the project envisages replacement of each source of water supply before removing
them. Therefore, the eventual impact of the proposed bypass construction may only be marginal.
e) Flood Hazard: The slope of this area is towards Ganga and all surface water bodies flow towards Ganga.
The high embankment of the proposed bypass is parallel to the river Ganga will come as a bund at the middle of
the continuous agricultural land. This will have significant effect on the drainage system of the area and will
cause water logging and flooding of the area particularly north side of the embankment unless efficient cross
drainages are planned.
7.3     Land Environment
a) Physiography: The entire project area is flat and the main carriage way will be raised, therefore, there will be
visible and significant impact on physiography of the area, which is irreversible.
b) Seismicity: The entire length of Allahabad bypass falls in Zone II with a seismic coefficient of 0.02 as per
BIS zoning map (IS:1893). Hence, the area is relatively stable. Road construction in this area will have little
impact on its overall earthquake potential since no blasting is envisaged at the construction site.

EA Process Summary of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
c) Soil: Loss of productive soil, albeit during the construction stage only, is envisaged at locations of workers'
camps, stockyards, storage godowns etc. Provision has been made in EMP to ensure that no productive areas are
used for these purposes. In any case, though it would be a direct impact, it would be reversible and low in
nature.
d) Soil Erosion: The soil in the study area is loam to sandy loam in nature, which is potential for erosion.
Erosion will be exacerbated to denuding the soil. This will however be for the duration until the compensatory
afforestation and roadside turfing have matured No soil erosion is envisaged when the road is in operation as all
the slopes and embankments of the project road shall be stabilized through sound engineering techniques.
e) Compaction of soil: Compaction of soil will occur in the pre-construction stage (particularly during site
clearance stage) due to movement of hcavy machinery and vehicles, setting up of construction camps and
stockyards. However, this is a short duration impact. Appropriate measures have been specified in the
Environmental Management Plan to minimize the area of soil compaction.
I) Contamination of Soil: Soil contamination may take place due to moving vehicles or solid waste
contamination from the labour camp set up during pre-construction stage. The sites where construction vehicles
are parked and serviced are likely to be contaminated because of leakage or spillage of fuel, lubricants, asphalt
or bitumen from construction vehiclc and hot mix plants. Refuse and solid waste from labour camps can also
contaminate the soil. Unwarranted disposal of construction spoil and debris will add to soil contamination.
Contamination of soil during construction might be a major long-term residual negative impact. This
contamination is likely to be carried over to water bodies in case of dumping being done near water body.
g) Change in Land Use: The fertile agriculture land coming within the ROW will be lost permanently and the
land use in the bypass alignment will change permanently due to construction of road. During construction
period there will be temporary land acquisition for access road, for location of crushers, hot mix plants,
construction camp materials and machinery storing yards and workers camp. The impact of temporary land
acquired for the project will extend till the end of construction period.
During the operational phase land use may change due to the ribbon development along the service road.
7.4     Construction Materials/Consumption of Natural Resources
7.4.1     Embankment filling materials
a) Earth from Borrow Pits: The borrowing of earth will be carried out in accordance to the guidelines laid out
in IRC-10-1961, no major adverse impacts are anticipated. However, the borrow area pits, if not treated
properly after the borrowing is complete, can form stagnant pools and pose health hazards. To prevent these
redevelopment of borrow areas need to be worked out.
Cartage of the borrow materials to the construction sites is of significance, as almost all such areas are
accessible through dirt tracks only and therefore, spillage and compaction of soil along these tracks will be a
significant impact. Proper protection measures need to be worked out for the minimising such impacts during
the haulage of borrows materials.
b) Fly Ash: 9.63 million cum of fly ash will be transported in closed drum truck from Unchahar to project site.
Cartage of the fly ash to the construction sites is of significance; the average distance from Unchahar to middle
of bypass is 80 km. Concrete road may not be available through out the transport route. Certain stretch of the
alignment may be accessible through dirt track and therefore, spillage and compaction of soil along these tracks
will have significant impact. Proper protection measures need to be worked out to minimise such impacts during
the haulage of fly ash. Major environmental concerns of use of fly ash in embankment are listed below:
I. contamination of groundwater and surface water due to leaching of heavy metals and ionic solutions
containing calcium, sulphate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and silicate from the fly ash
2. spillage of excess water from moist fly ash during transportation or after dumping on the embankment
may contaminate nearby surface waters or groundwater
3. if the fly ash delivered to the project site is too wet, it need to be dried by aeration and exposure to Sun
till the moisture content is acceptable for compaction. During such handling and also after placing on
embankment, if the fly ash surface is dried up completely, it will pose dust problem
4. Fly ash embankment is prone to severe erosion by runoff and high winds, if left unprotected may cause
dust as well as water pollution

EA Process Summary of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
c) Sand Borrowing from Yamuna River: Sand for construction will be procured from Yamuna riverbed near
Banda, where the sand mining is already permitted and no impacts are likely to arise. However, care would have
to be taken to prevent spillage of niaterial and damage to the haul roads during transportation.
d) Quarries: As no new quarry needs to be opened for this project, therefore, no new impacts are likely to arise
due to quarrying operations. No major impact during the haulage of materials is envisaged as all the quarries
identified have proper access roads. Crushers and vibrating screens will generate significant dust during
crushing and screening operations, which normally has impacts up to a downwind distance of 500m.
e) Water: The ground water aquifer in the project area is rich because of proximity to river Ganga. Therefore,
no significant impact on ground water is envisaged due to extraction of construction of Ground water.
7.5     Noise
Noise levels will increase significantly during construction phase due to movement of construction machinery
and vehicles, and other allied activities such as establishment of workers camps, stockyards etc. But this
increased noise impact will prevail only for a short duration during the pre construction stage. Moreover, as
these activities are not likely to be placed near settlements the impacts of increased noise will be negligible.
The prediction of noise levels2 has been made for the years 2006, 2026 and 2036 using the FHWA Transport
Noise Model. As per the predicted results, the noise levels for daytime are well within CPCB limits up to the
horizon year 2026. Nighttime noise levels exceed in the horizon years 2026 and 2036. Daytime noise levels
exceed the specified limits in the horizon years 2036.
7.6     Terrestrial Ecosystem
7.6.1 Habitat settings: Proposed bypass will not bring any major change in the habitat setting except 'dissecting
a continuous land into two halves. Both the halves will have the similar features, as originally it was a part of
single piece of land. No significant impact is envisaged on soil fertility and habitat settings due to the project.
7.6.2 Vegetation: Due to construction of the Allahabad bypass, 3298 numbers of trees have been identified to
be cut. Tree cutting from ROW will reduce the green coverage, but the effect would not be prominent because
of similar land use setup in adjoining areas. The area is basically rural, and about 80 percent of which is
agricultural land. Lot of plantations including orchards is present in this area. Therefore, ecological effect of loss
of trees would not be felt significantly. Moreover, the loss of green coverage will be compensated by the
plantation in the ratio of 1:2 (as per the tree plantation strategy of NHAI).
7.6.3 Wild life: No impact is envisaged on the fauna of this area.
7.7     Aquatic Ecosystem
No major impact has been anticipated in the aquatic ecosystem of the area. Only impact is envisaged is increase
in turbidity during construction phase due to the construction of bridge over Ganga or other streams and canals.
Precaution has been already taken and incorporated in the engineering design to minimize the impact on river
ecology.
7.8     Human Use Values
781.0 Ha of land, which is presently productive agricultural land, will be permanently converted to concrete
road. This will have significant impact on agricultural productivity of the area. 28969 numbers of people will be
affected in which 3807 number of people and 558 families will be displaced due to this proposed Allahabad
bypass project. Moreover, a number of facilities important for the residents of the area i.e., 4 schools,4 temples,
2 brick kilns, I petrol pump, I polish stations and 3 Panchayat offices, which exist on the RoW of the proposed
bypass will be permanently lost. Out of total six schools on RoW, four are getting completely affected and two
will only lose their boundary wall.
8.0     Avoidance and Mitigation Measures:
The avoidance and mitigation measures are discussed in the same order as impacts identified for each of the
environmental components. The avoidance and mitigation measures have been summarized in Table S.

1.   Air quality          I. Watcr will be sprayed on earthworks, temporary haulages and detour roads,
during and after compaction of the sub-grade at regular intervals to prevent
dust generation.
2. Vehicles delivering loose and fine materials like sand and fine aggregate shall
be covered to reduce spills on haul roads.
3.The hot mix plant will be fited with cyclone/scrubber to control emissions.
The asphalt plants, crushers and the batching plants will be sited at
4. least I kfm in the downwind direction from the nearest human settlement
5.It shall be ensured that the dust emissions from the crusher and vibrating
screen at the stone quarries are within the emission standards of CPCB. -
6. To ensure the control of exhaust gas emissions from the various construction
activities, the contractor will take up the following mitigation measures:
7. Air quality monitoring at least once a month during the construction period.
*    All construction vehicles, equipment and machinery will ensure that the
pollution emission levels conform to the SPCB norms.
*    Procure necessary consent from  state poflution control board for
location of hot mix plants.
2.   Water resources     I. All the existing surface water bodies will be retained constructing
bridges/culverts over them
2. Wells, tube-wells, and bore wells lost due to the project will be relocated.
3. Water quality monitoring of various surface water bodies have been proposed
at several locations along the alignment during operational phase. The
roadside water bodies are provided with oil and grease traps to prevent
contamination due to road surface runoff.
3.    Drainage and Flood    All cross-drainage structures have been designed to handle a 50-year peak
hazard               flood level. All the existing flowing water bodies (rivers, streams, canals
including irrigation canals) are provided with culvcrts to maintain the natural
drainage of the area. 61additional cross drainage structures are designed (at
least one culvert of varying sizes (slab/box/pipes) per kilometer) to take care
of drainage requirements of the area. For roadway drainage, the side of the
service road and in the median have provided with lined drains.
4.    Loss of productive  The land, which will be converted, to road will be lost permanently. But the
land              additional land required for borrow areas and ancillary activities will be selected,
maintained and recovered after use in such a manner that it can be restored to its
original use. Following are the suggested mitigation measures for the temporary
acquired land:
A. Borrow Areas: In the selection of borrow areas, productive agricultural areas
have been avoided as far as possible. All borrow areas will be redevelop once the
borrowing is completed. Redevelopment of used portion will be done
simultaneously.
B. Top Soil: Topsoils from all areas of cutting and areas to be permanently
covered will be stripped up to 150 mm and stored in stockpiles of 2:1 (H: V).
The stored topsoil will be utilized for:
* covering all disturbed areas including borrow areas
* top dressing of the road embankments and fill slopes
* filling up of tree pits in the median and side of the road
* in the agricultural fields of farmers acquired temporarily for ancillary
activities
5.  Soil Erosion        The preventive measures suggested to control soil erosion are as follows:
I. control soil erosion, sedimentation through use of dikes, sedimentation
chambers, basins, fiber mats, mulches, grasses, slope, drains and other
devices.
2. During construction activities on road embankment, the side slopes of all
cut and fill areas will be graded and covered with stone pitching, grass and

the excavation will have a slope not steeper than I vertical to 2 horizontal,
from the edge of the final section of the bank.
5. Along sections abutting water bodies, stone pitching as per design
specification will protect slopes.

3. At the wash down and refueling areas, "oil interceptors" shall be provided.
4. All spills and petroleum products shall be disposed off in accordance to the
UPSPCB Guidelines.
5. Fuel storage and fuelling areas will be located at least 500 m from all cross
drainage structures and significant water bodies.
7.    Borrowing of      For borrowing of earth for the project, several borrow area locations have been
Earth             identified and recommended. Certain precautionary measures have been
suggested to restrict unauthorized borrwing by the contractor:
Cultivable land
1. The borrowing shall not be carried out in cultivable lands, unless and until,
it is agreed upon by the Supervision Consultant that there is no suitable
uncultivable land in the vicinity for borrowing, or there are private land
owners willing to allow borrowing on their fields
2. The depth of borrow pits shall not exceed 45 cm
3. 150mm layer of topsoil shall be preserved in stockpiles
4. height of the stock pile will not exceed 2m and side slopes not steeper
5. than 1:2
6. the borrow areas will not be dug continuously.
7. In case borrow areas other than specified are selected, the size and shape of
borrow pits will be decided by the Supervision Consultant.
Non cultivable lands
I. depth of borrow pits will be 1.0 i from the existing ground level
2. it will not be done continuously
3. ridges of not less than 8 m width at intervals not exceeding 300 m will be
left
4. small drains will be cut through the ridges, if necessary, to facilitate
drainage
5. slopes will not be steeper than I vertical to 4 horizontal
Borrow pits on the riverside:
I. The borrow pit will be located not less than 15m from the toe of the bank
distance depending on the magnitude and duration of flood to be withstood.
Precautionary measures like the covering of vehicles will be taken to avoid
spillage during transport of borrow materials. The contractor will prepare site-
specific redevelopment plans for each borrow area location, which will be
implemented after the approval of the Supervision Consultant.
8.   Fly Ash             To minimise the adverse environmental impact of fly ash following
precautionary measures are suggeste&-
*   fly ash will be transported in covered dump trucks to the project site
and is directly dumped on the embankment. This will not be stockpiled
at project site
*   weathered fly ash will be collected from the fly ash pond to reduce the
possibility of water contamination due to leaching of heavy metals
*   fly ash surface will be graded and sloped at the end of each working
day to provide drainage and to prevent the ponding of water or the

vegetation will be grown to prevent the erosion
*   run-off from the fly ash embankment/stockpile will be collected and
discharged into proper drainage system
*   if any further handling like drying is required (as it will be transported
in wet condition) that will be restricted within RoW. During such
handling and also after placing on embankment, if she fly ash surface is
dried up completely, contractor will arrange for fiequent sprinkling of
water for dust suppression. Otherwise, surface of the fly ash will be
covered with tarpaulin or polyethylene sheets
*   the fly ash will be placed on an aggregate drainag blanket to prevent
water from rising into the fly ash by way of capillay action. Contractor
will ensure that fly ash layer is separated from the drainage blanket by
an appropriate filter fabric/sand blanket of adequar thickness over full
width of embankment as capillary cut-off.
* No fly ash will be disposed in any disposal site. Ctutractor will take
care if any residual fly ash is remain after construaiion work either this
will be retumed to the source or used in construction of embankment
elsewhere with proper construction measures.
9   Quarries            No new quarries will be opened; only licensed quarries wil be used for which
EMP already exists. Only precaution will be required to prewnt the spillage of
materials during transportation. All vehicles will be covered to avoid spillage
during transportation of quarry materials.
10.   Noise               1. The construction equipment will strictly conform to CPCB noise standards.
2. Vehicles and equipments used shall be fitted with exhaust silencers and
shall be checked regularly.
3. Noisy construction activities will be at least a distance of lOOm from the
hospitals, educational institutions etc and 150 m. from tIe nearest habitation.
4. Construction activity should be restricted between 6.0 AM - 9.0 PM near
habitations.
5. Workers shall be provided with earplugs.
6. Suitable noise barriers or double-glazing of windows will be provided to the
noise sensitive receptors.
V1.   egetation coverage  The loss of trees will be compensated by the plantation along the median and
along the side of the corridor in accordance to the NHAI trx plantation strategy.
Detail tree plantation strategy is made for the Allahabad bypass in accordance
with plantation strategy of GTRIP and TNHP to maintain the harmony in
roadside plantation along the NH-2. All local y available native pants suitable for
roadside plantation are selected.
12. Habitat              The native plants and grass species are selected for roadside plantation. Grass
Continuity          species i.e., Saccharum spontaneum, S. benghalensis, Veiveria ziznoides etc.
which are good soil binder and available in the adjacent areas will be planted on
the embankment adjacent to water bodies that will help maintaining continuity of
habitat. Moreover, continuity will be maintained along the stream or other water
bodies on which bridges and culverts are designed. As ripaian zone below these
structures will serve as the natural link between the left antl right halves, which
will also serve as natural passages of wild animals.
3.    Wild Life/ Fauna   No impact is envisaged on the existing wild fauna of the area. But as
precautionary measure it is suggested that the construction workers will be
educated to intimate the higher officer in charge-if they enconter any wild fauna
(adult, or juvenile or eggs) during construction work. The officer in-charge of
respective contractor will report to the near by divisional fbrest office and will
take appropriate steps/measures, if required in consultaton with the forest

Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
9.0     Standalone Environmental Management Plan
Standalone Environmental Management Plans have been prepared for each construction package.
The EMP specifies phase wise plan of action for mitigation/managementavoidance of the negative impacts of
the project, which also detail out measures to be taken against each issue, its time frame, implementation and
supervision responsibilities. Consolidated EMP for entire Allahabad Project has been given in Annexure I.
10.     Environmental Budget
An indicative estimate of the cost component involved in mitigation of impacts, enhancements monitoring and
evaluation of various components in pre-construction, construction and opaation period as well as institutional
strengthening of the NHAI has been worked out. A total of INR 3,9357,990 has been allocated for the
environmental management for Allahabad Bypass Project. A summary of the budget under different heads is
presented below

11.    Implementation Arrangement, Training and Reporting
11.1 EMP Implementation Arrangement
The NHAI is responsible for the implementation of the provisions made within the EMP through the PIU. The
services of a supervision consultants will be procured to assist the PIU for monitoring the environmental aspects
of the project during implementation (mainly pre-construction and construction phases). Contractor will also
have an environmental specialist. Environmental expert of the contractor will provide key inputs to the project
implementation.
The organisational chart for the implementation of EMP is presented below:

11.4   Performance Indicators
Physical, biological and environmental management components identified as of particular significance in
affecting the environment at critical locations have been suggested as Performance Indicators (PIS). The
Performance Indicators shall be evaluated under three heads as:
(a) Environmental condition indicators to determine efficacy of environmental management measures
in control of air, noise, water and soil pollution.
(b) Environmental management indicators to determine compliance with the suggested environmental
management measures.
(c) Operational performance indicators have also been devised to determine efficacy and utility of the
proposed mitigation measures.
11.5   Monitoring Plan for Environmental Conditions
For each of the environmental condition indicator, the monitoring plan specifies the parameters to be monitored;
location of the monitoring sites, frequency and duration of monitoring. The monitoring plan also specifies the
applicable standards, implementation and supervising responsibilities.
11.6   Reporting
A two level monitoring system is suggested, i) reporting on progress, ii) environmental compliance monitoring.
These reporting system will operate linearly with the contractor reporting to the Supervision Consultant, who in
turn will report to the PIU. The PIU will be responsible for preparing targets for each of the identified EMP
activities (the outline of such targets has already been prepared). All subsequent reporting by the contractor will
be monitored as per these targets set by the PIU before the contractors move on to the site.
The compliance monitoring and the progress reports on environmental components will be clubbed together and
submitted to the NHAI (through the PIU) quarterly during the implementation period. The operation stage
monitoring reports may be annual or biennial, provided the Project Environmental Completion Report shows
that the implementation was satisfactory. Otherwise, the operation stage monitoring reports will have to be
prepared as specified in the said Project Environmental Completion Report.
As part of the EMP, detailed formats for monitoring (each parameter, and at various levels) has been prepared
(these formats are attached to the individual EMPs).
12.0 Resettlement Action Plan
A Consolidated Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the proposed Allahabad bypass has been prepared for the
project. The RAP document details the action and the responsibilities to be taken by the various stakeholders for
adequate resettlement and rehabilitation of the project-affected persons as per the NHAI's R&R Policy (and the
World Bank's Policy Guidelines). The Policy provides for a framework of entitlements and prepares the basis of
categorization of the Project affected Persons (PAPs).
* A brief description of the process adopted for planning and implementation of the RAP has been elucidated
in the ensuing section.
12.1 Support Principles for Different Categories of Impacts
Both Indian and World Bank guidelines related to resettlement aim at achieving the following over-all goals:
In assonwb                          0



EA Prcess Summary of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
o Involuntary resettlement will be avoided or minimized whamver feasible, exploring all viable altemative
project designs; and
* Where displacement is unavoidable, people losing assets, livelihood or other resources will be assisted in
improving or at least regaining their former status of living at no cost to themselves.
The NHAI has prepared and adopted an R&R policy for the project. The policy is detailed, addresses all aspects
of the project-induced impacts, the resettlement and the rehabilitation needs comprehensively. The entitlements
in the project will be based on this R&R Policy.
The population distribution and social impact scenario of the project indicate that the OP 4.12 is applicable to
this project. OP 4.12 deals with involuntary resettlement, which may cause long term hardship and
impoverishment and which needs mitigation measures. The OD. 4.20 pertaining to indigenous people is not
applicable and cannot be triggered in this project, as there are omly 3 ST families in the project area.
One of the major requirements for the implementation of RAP is Land Acquisition and for this the starting point
is the National Highway Act-1956, which empowers land acquisition through a "Competent Authority"
appointed under this act and under which titleholders are awarded compensation for land, property, structures
and other assets such as crops affected/surrendered to the project.
Methodology/ system should be evolved to have a fair estimate of land requirements for the different purposes
and this should be worked out at the time of preparation of the DPR and there should not be much variation
except those necessitated by the design requirements.
As per stipulation in the act , compensation is to be paid at the market value. To determine fair market value,
replacement cost of the land is determined as per the procedure laid down in the Act. In case the replacement
cost is higher than the market value determined by the compctent authority, the difference shall be paid in the
form of assistance. The value of the houses, buildings and other immovable properties of the PAPs will be
determined for the payment of the compensation at the relevant B.S.R. without depreciation and for this circle
rates should be indexed every two years so that they are very close to the replacement value for the payment of
the compensation at circle rates.
The construction of the Allahabad bypass envisages large-scale land acquisition affecting numerous small and
medium farming families. Revenue department should update the revenue record on priority along the alignment
area, to avoid any difference in physical ownership versus revenue records and to ensure payment of fair
compensation to the genuine titleholders.
The sense of transparency should be evolved to check mal practices of revenue staff engaged in land acquisition
process. Entitlement/ compensation to be paid should be conspicuously displayed at different places. The
disbursement of compensation should be in the form of cheques to the awardees in the setting of public
meetings in the villages/settlements in full public view. The district administration, competent authority, CRRO
and representatives of NGO will be present in all such meetings for such purposes. Prior intimation of date, time
and venue for such assembly should be given to all titleholders along with village Lekhpal and Pradhan. The
action plan for land acquisition for Allahabad Bypass is provided in table 13.
12.2   Overview of Project Affected and Displaced FamiTies In the Project Area
For effective planning and implementation of resettlement and rehabilitation activities in the project area, it is
imperative to analyze and understand the socio-economic profile of the area and livelihood pattern of the project
affected families. Hence in present context, the socio-economic analysis of the project area helped in preparing a
comprehensive Resettlement Action Plan for the proposed bypass.
The details of the project-affected households reflect that of the total of 4343 households getting affected by the
project, 4257 are titleholders and 86 non-titleholders. The distribution of project affected vulnerable households
(PAVHs) indicates that there are 914 (21.4%) vulnerable households out of the total 4343 PAHs. Further
classification of PAVHs indicate that there are 52.3% SC (scheduled caste) households, 32.38% BPL (below
poverty line) households, 15.2 1% WHH (women headed households) and remaining 0.3% ST (schedules tribe).
It is also revealed that 95.7% of PAVHs are legal titleholders, whereas 4.3% are non-titleholders.
There are 560 households likely to be displaced as a result of the project implementation. They comprise 558
titleholders and 2 non-title holders. The village wise details about the PDHs in terms of loss of agriculture,
residences, commercial structures and residential cum commercial structures are provided in RAP report
Annexure 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 respectively) .

12.3      RAP Implementation Process
12.3.1   Cut-offDate
For all the purposes of the proposed Allahabad bypass, the cut-off date will be the following:
o    In the cases of land acquisition affecting the legal titleholders, the cut-off date would be the date of issuing
the notice under section 3A of the National Highway Act, 1956 (amended 1997).
*    For the non-titleholders the cut-offdate shll be the date of start of the census.
12.3.2 Coordination Between Civil Works and Resettlement
Screening and Planning: Effort has been made to reduce potential negative impacts of the project. The project
has coordinated the design process with the findings from screening and studies related to socio-econpmic
impacts and the environment, in order to minimize negative impacts and maximize benefits. This practice will
continue throughout the project implementation period.
To determine the most suitable altemative fir the bypass, various alternatives were analyzed considering
technical, economical, environmental and social aspects. The seven altemative routes woe initially considered
for the Allahabad bypass, five of them were on the northem side, one on the southem side, and another one as
an elevated road through Allahabad. All the altematives were compared with each other based on certain
parameters and route AN-4 on northern side was found technically feasible and economidlly viable. .
Implementation: During project implementation, the resettlement program will be co-ordinated with the
completion of designs and the likely timing of civil works. The project will provide adequate notification,
counseling and assistance to affected people so that they are able to move or give up their assets without undue
hardship before civil works are to start. A contract resettlement and rehabilitation officcr (CRRO) of the PIU
will be responsible for the monitoring of each activity and ensuring that the mitigation measures are actively
translated from policy to action. The CRRO will be supported by the NGOs procured for implementing the
RAP. Coordination and policy support will come from         the social / environmental cell at NHAI-corporate,
headed by the General Manager.

12.3.2   Fund Flow
The fund flow mechanism for the compensation and the assistance part ofthe budget is given below:
Compensation: The normal legal process of award and payment of compensation will be followed. In
consultation with Project Director PIU, Competent Authority makes a programme of announcement of award
and disbursement of compensation in the field area with prior intimation of date, time and venue where all
titleholders assemble along with village lekhpal and pradhan. The Disrict Administration (or the Competent
Authority), the CRRO, and representatives of the NGO will be prescat in all meetings organized for such
purposes. The compensation will be paid through cheques while assistance will be disbursed in cash and to be
deposited in joint account
Assistance: A joint bank account will be opened in a local Bank and the amount for disbursement, as assistance
other than the shifting allowance and the rental allowance, for the contrat package will be deposited to iL The
signatories of the joint account will be the Entitled Persons, the CRRO, and the (representative of the) NGO.
The amount will be withdrawn against the purchase of productive asset. In the cases of construction of building
structures, the withdrawal will be made in three installments against the pogress of completion of construction,
i.e., at the completion of work up to (a) plinth level, (b) ceiling level, and (c) at full completion of work.
123.3 Institutional Arrangement
The Environmental and the Social Development Unit (ESDU) located at the NHAI headquarters will be
responsible for overall monitoring and implementation of the RAP. The unit is presently headed by a GM and
has one Deputy General Manager looking after Environment component besides implementation of RAP. It is
now proposed to have one additional manager, independently looking aftcr R&R work, within ESDU.
The NHAI's existing capacity includes a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) at Allahabad headed by a Project
Director and two managers (technical and environment). It is proposed to have two additional CRROs-one for
each package, looking after R&R works.
Grievance Redressal Committees (GRCs) will also be formed in every district through which the bypass
traverses. The GRC at each district will comprise the District Magistrate; Project Director, PIU-NHAI; CRRO,
PIU-NHAI; a representative of the local bodies (Villages/Block Panchayats or municipalities); a representative
of the NGOs involved in implementing the RAP: and the representatives of the PAPs (at least two with one from
vulnerable category). The main objectives of GRC will be to provide a platform/mechanism to mediate conflicts
(including compensation) and reduce legal proceedings, which often results in delayed completion of the
projects. In addition to this, there will be Tehsil Dewas organized at weekly intervals for titleholders at the
respective tehsils, wherein the GRC would solve the issues pertaining to the PAPs Grievances.
123.4 Implementation Arrangement and Schedule
A time based RAP implementation schedule has been prepared keeping in view the schedule of civil works. The
project shall provide adequate advance notice to the PAPs, who will be paid their compensation prior to start of
the civil works. The implementation schedule has been prepared separatdy for the two construction packages
ABP II & ABP Ill considering the number of villages in each package and the number of PAPs.

The implementation schedule has been devised in a mamxr that the resettlement & rehabilitation of the PAPs is
completed in implementation period of the project. The village wise list of PAHs is given in Annexure 8.4. To
complete the project, NHAI has already initiated followamg activities, which would support the implementation
of RAP. Preparation of the implementation schedule takes into account the construction contractors likely to be
mobilized by Oct. 2003 so as to commence civil works by Nov. 2003. These include:

*   Initiated the process of land acquisition, which is likely to be completed by December 2003.
*   Appointment of NGOs and likely mobilization by March 2003.
To assist in the smooth implementation and monitming of R&R activities, a detailed time based RAP
implementation schedule has been prepared in a chronological order (has been provided in chapter 8 of RAP).
This schedule would facilitate EDSU, PIU, NGO, Evaluation Consultants and other stakeholders in coordinating
completion of their activities and taking corrective measures in time, so that the project could be completed as
per schedule. This would also assist PIU to complete land acquisition and initiate resettlement activities in a
planned manner, so that civil works could commence as per schedule.
12.3.5 Co-Ordination with the Line Agencies
Various govemment agencies including the Revenue Department will have an important role in the smooth
functioning of the resettlement program. The PIU will bc responsible for the over-all co-ordination of this work
with assistance from the NGOs. Efforts will be made to undertake this work in a coordinated fashion, to build
upon services and programmes already in place.
12.4   Training and Awareness Programs
The capacity building initiatives undertaken by NHAI are at the moment adequate to face the challenge of
handling resettlement issues. However, certain R&R issues require attention and further strengthening. Amongst
them, the most crucial is the issue of land acquisition followed by ensuring women's participation in the project,
Identifying the Income Generating Schemes and the pocess to be adopted for the implementation of IGS -
providing training to the PAPs, formulation of the SHGs, establishing the linkage with the existing markets
available and identifying and establishing the linkages of the PAPs with the source of credit to sustain their
commercial activities.
The following training modules are suggested, wherein the cost of training of NGOs, NHAI staff and the
beneficiaries has been included in the RAP budget.
* Training for the NGO Personnel
The NGOs will be required to upgrade their skill through training to be able to deliver the R&R components
more effectively over time. Documentation and reporting of the progress of implementation will also be done by
the NGOs, and therefore, the NGOs' staff will need to he trained for such purposes.
*   Training for the Beneficiaries of the Project
The beneficiaries are to be provided with training in vocational skill, technical know how and for starting of
production units and businesses. These training progranmes can be organized by the implementing agencies,
based on the recommendations of the NGOs and depending upon the nature of skill requirement in the areas as
desired by the eligible PAPs (choice of altemative liveilixods).
a Training for NHAI Staff
The project officials or the NGOs can implement the RAP only when they gain conceptual clarity in translating
the rehabilitation concepts in its correct perspectives. Thc RAP is to be seen as a process of development and the
implementation plan as a management tool. The 'target-fulfilling' approach would need to be changed if the
RAP is to be implemented as a 'process of developmenf.
The training plans for the NHAI, with respect to the R&R components, and covers all the target groups.

12.5    Income Restoration Plan
The Income Restoration Plan has been developed on the basis of the findings of the primary surveys and
viewing the ground realities. In order to ensure that all PAPs are able to restore their livelihood, the activity will
be entrusted to the NGO deployed in the project area, who will be responsible for developing the entire
framework for implementing income restoration / economic rehabilitation of the PAPs.
The entitlement framework used for this project, provides following entitlements for income restoration of
those, whose livelihood gets affected: (details of various provisions are provided in Me entitlement matrix).
*   All PAFs losing land will receive a transition allowance for 9 months, if residual portion of land becomes
un-viable and for 3 months if the residual portion of land is viable. They will ako be compensated for the
loss of perennial crops at market value and will receive the replacement cost, if there is any loss of-fruit
bearing trees.
*   All vulnerable families, whose land holding after acquisition is less than MEI, are entitled to alternative
economic rehabilitation support/grant and training for up-gradation of skills.
*   Subsistence allowance calculated at minimum wages per month for six months, for families losing
commercial structures, will be paid.
*   Replacement value of the immovable assets would be provided to all the families losing their residential
and commercial properties including Interested Persons.
*   As per the entitlement framework, the project-displaced families belonging to the
*   Vulnerable group are eligible for residential or commercial plots. The vulnerabEe group displaced families
are entitled to receive the plot free of cost and non-vulnerable families will purchase it.
   All PAF's, whose land after acquisition is not viable, are entitled to receive transitional allowance for a
period of 9 months to restore their livelihood. However, the PAF's are entitled to only 3 months transitional
allowance, if their land after acquisition is economically viable.
*   Additional support mechanism will be provided to families, who will lose theirprimary source of income in
the form of assistance towards income generating or vocational training option of the EP's choice. The
training includes starting a suitable production or service activity.
From the analysis of livelihood-affected HHs, it is evident that land-based econmic activities are the major
source of livelihood in the project area The census and the socio-economic survey reveals that due to land
acquisition a large number of PAHs will be losing their economic base. However, the families entitled for
training for income restoration as per the entitlement framework are vulnerable displaced titleholders and those
families whose landholding is less than MEH after acquisition, persons losing coinnercial structure/assets and
share-croppers (Table 12).

12.6    Monitoring and Evaluation
The Resettlement Action Plan contains indicators and benchmarks for achievement of the objectives under the
resettlement programme wherein Internal Monitoring and External Evaluation have been suggested in the
RAP document.
Internal and periodic monitoring will be carried out by the PIU to ensure that RAP implementing agency
complies with the deadlines fixed for the construction activities and the disbursement of the funds as
compensation and or/ assistance to the PAPs and the implementing agency. The PIU will be responsible for the
timely progress monitoring of the land acquisition. The PIU will collect information on all components related
to implementation of R&R activities from the project site with the help of the NGOs. The information will then
be screened and sent to NHAI Head Office. This exercise will help NHAI in strengthening work schedule to
achieve the targets. In addition, through intemal monitoring NHAI will be making changes in work program
whenever necessary, in case of delays or problems.
This includes development of indicators and benchmarks for achievement of the objectives under the
resettlement program, which can be categorized as follows:
a)   Process indicators, which includes project inputs, expenditures, staffdeployments, etc.;
b)  Output indicators are results in terms of numbers of affected persons compensated and resettled, incomes
restored, additional assistance provided etc; and
c)  Impact indicators related to the long-term effect of the project on people's living in the project-affected
area.
The Project Evaluation will be carried out by an extemal agency who will be engaged in carrying out the
evaluation of the implementation of the RAP. The indicators have been categorized in details in Annexure 11.2
The extemal evaluation agency shall submit two annual evaluations and one end of the project evaluation
reports to the NHAI. The report should contain all the data/information collected and their critical analysis.
The effectiveness of the project will be evaluated with respect to the following broad categories of indicators,
like Indicators of physical achievement, Indicators of financial achievement, Indicators of social development
and Indicators of Participation.
