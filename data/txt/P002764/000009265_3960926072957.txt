MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR A SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        This report on a proposed Credit to the United Republic of
Tanzania for SDR 17.9 million ($23.0 million equivalent) is submitted for
approval. The Credit would be on standard IDA terms and would help finance
rehabilitation, and maintain and maximize the capacity of the existing
network. It would also support selected and high priority investments to
alleviate critical system bottlenecks. The Government would onlend the
credit proceeds to TPTC at the IBRD rate, for 20 years including 4 years of
grace. TPTC would bear the foreign exchange risk for the period of the
onlending agreement. The African Development Bank, the Governments of
Italy and Sweden are also assisting the project with parallel-financing of
US$5 million equivalent, US$10 million equivalent and US$11 million
equivalent, respectively.
2.        Background.  Tanzania Posts and Telecommunications Corporation
(TPTC), established in 1977, is a Government-owned parastatal entity which
provides all domestic and international postal and telecommunications
services in Tanzania. The Ministry of Communications and Works (MCW) is
the regulatory authority for the sector. TPTC is administered by a Board
of Directors, whose Chairman and Director General are appointed by the
President of Tanzania; MCW appoints the other six members. In 1986, TPTC
had 173 telephone exchanges with an installed capacity of 73,000 lines and
with 54,000 direct exchange lines connected. This is equivalent to 0.2
telephones per 100 population, one of the lowest telephone densities in the
world. Satellite international telecommunications are provided by an earth
station at Dar-es-Salaam (operating at full capacity since 1983), and by
leased satellite circuits on an earth station at Nairobi.  In
Dar-es-Salaam, about 60% of telephones are connected to commercial, 30% to
government and 10% to residential subscribers. Local telephone service in
Dar-es-Salaam is poor and repairs are slow. The first project (Credit
1173-TA) has provided for limited rehabilitation and network expansion,
initial institutional support for procurement activity and training in
technical, managerial and financial disciplines. However, the full
benefits of the investments have not been realized due to the persistent
lack of foreign exchange to finance essential spare parts and maintenance.
These problems have been compounded by organizational, management and
staffing deficiencies.  A severe network deterioration has been the
result. The quality of service has deteriorated, as exemplified by the
drop in call completion rates from 40% in 1980 to 24% in 1986, and the
increase in fault repair time from four days in 1980 to 10 days in 1986.
Reflecting these problems, TPTC's financial performance was mixed during
1980-85. However, corrective actions on tariff adjustments were taken when
necessary and TPTC is currently fully compliant with the financial
covenants under the previous credit. The Government gives priority to



-2-
communications a8 a vital element in its 1986-90 Economic Recovery Program,
with emphasis on rehabilitation and maintenance of existing facilities
rather than expansion of the network.
3.        Pro 0ect objectives.  The objectives of the Second Telecommunica-
tions project are to (a) rehabilitate key parts of the telecommunications
network and maximize capacity utilization by removitig bottlenecks and
imbalances; and (b) strengthen TPTC's operational, organizational,
financial msnagement and planning capacity.
4.        Project Description.  The proposed project comprises TPTC's
1986-1990 Investment Program including: (a) rehabilitation of local cable
networks and subscriber equipment; (b) marginal expansion and replacement
of worn out or obsolete switching and transmission equipment;
(c) installation of transit exchanges and a satellite earthstation to
improve long distance and international services; (d) upgrading maintenance
facilities by introducing modern testing methods and tools; (e) upgrading
computer facilities to introduce management information systems; and
(f) strenthening TPTC's organizational structure and management systems
through technical assistance (about 240 man-months) and foreign training
(about 40 fellowsnips). The project would provide funds for
telecommunications equipment, spare parts, vehicles, training and technical
assistance. Total project cost is estimated at $60.0 million equivalent,
with a foreign expenditure component of $49.0 million (82X). Estimated
costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement, disbursement categories, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. Key project-processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations in Tanzania are in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is also attached. A Staff Appraisal Report No. 6728-TA dated May 5, 1987
is being distributed separately.
5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project is in line with the
Bank's development assistance strategy for Tanzania which gives priority to
removing bottlenecks constraining the productive sectors. Since bilateral
funding typically finances equipment, without IDA's presence, the sector
would receive inadequate assistance for improving management, strengthening
the technical and financial systems, maintenance, and manpower
development. IDA also plays an important role in aid coordination for the
sector, and has worked closely with AFDB and the Governments of Italy and
Sweden in financing arrangements based on IDA's appraisal of this project.
IDA's efforts in the sector complement the initiatives currently undertaken
by the Government (and supported by IDA's Multisector Rehabilitation
Credit) in other priotity parastatals in Tanzania.
6.        Actions hgreed.  It has been agreed, inter alia, that TPTC would:
(a) not later than October 1 each year, and based on the agreed five-year
investment program, review and agree with IDA its annual development
budget, technical assistance and training, and performance against set
targets; (b) consult with IDA before making any investments additional to
the agreed program in an aggregate amount greater than $2 million
equivalent in any financial year (disbursement of the specified IDA share
of the annual financing plan for TPTC's agreed five-year investment program



- 3 -
would be conditional upon agreement on the annual expenditure outlays and
provision of the agreed TPTC/Government local funding. If the TPTC's
contribution is reduced below the levels indicated in the agreed five-year
investment program, the IDA share of financing may be reduced pro rata);
(c) review ai.d amend its sectoral organization and structure in tandem with
improvements and innovations in technology, and promote efficiency by
contracting out certain activities to other agencies; (d) review its
manpower plan and by December 31, 1988, prepare a computerized data base
incorporating its requirements, targets and recruitment strategy;
(e) prepare a staff incentive scheme to be reviewed with IDA by January 1,
1988 and implemented by June 30, 1988; (f) submit a revised tariff policy
by January 31, 1988 allowing it to adjust its tariffs automatically, taking
into account efficiency improvements which will have been made; (g) earn a
12% rate of return on net revalued assets; (h) ensure that its net internal
cash generation for the current year would not be less than 50% of the two
year moving average of its total investment requirement for the current
year and the following year; (i) by December 31, 1987, prepare a timetable
for reducing outstanding subscriber receivables to two months of revenues
by end FY90; (j) ensure that from the end of FY87 onward, its financial
accounts reflect the revaluation of assets and liabilities; (k) recruit the
necessary technical assistance by no later than December 31, 1987; and
(1) by December 31, 1988, prepare and implement a policy for transferring
surplus revenues to the Government. Conditions of effectiveness are:
(a) signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and TPTC;
and (b) appointment of a project coordinator.
7.        Justification.  The project would help develop an essential
infrastructure, remove bottlenecks and improve productivity in other
sectors, particularly transportation and agricultural marketing. TPTC
would also generate significant revenue surpluses for the Government. The
project's rate of return is estimated at 40%.
8.        Risks.  Although the project faces no unusual risks, TPTC may
implement management improvements more slowly than anticipated. The
provision of technical assistance in line positions would minimize this
risk. The impact of this assistance would be reviewed annually with IDA,
and TPTC would be required to agree to implementation objectives for the
following year. Annual project performance reviews would identify
technical and financial problems and determine measures to resolve them.
Advanced procurement activity would minimize technical implementation
delays.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executiv- Directors approve the proposed Credit.
