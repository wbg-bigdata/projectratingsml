INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
INDIAN FARMERS FERTILISER COOPERATIVE LIMITED
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount equivalent to US$109 million to the Indian Farmers Ferti-
liser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO), with the guarantee of the Government of
India, to help finance the construction of a fertilizer plant. Amortization
would be over 16 years, including five years' grace, at an interest rate of
8% per annum. A guarantee fee of 2-1/4% per annum would be paid to the
Government, in order to make the effective interest rate to IFFCO consistent
with the Governmentes lending rate to industrial enterprises.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(402-IN, dated May 7, 1974) was distributed to the Executive Directors on
May 20, 1974. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size, diversity, and the extreme difficulty of its economic conditions.
India's economic policies and performance have their shortcomings, many of
which are attributable to the open political system, where the reconciliation
of conflicting political views tends to favor less than optimal economic
solutions; others are due to the sheer magnitude of the task facing the Govern-
ment. Governing a country divided into more than 20 states with a population
of some 580 million and over 60 languages is an extraordinary responsibility.
The country's poverty and poor natural resource endowment, supplemented by
a net transfer of external resources averaging in recent years well below
US$1 per head per annum, have imposed sharp limitations on the rate of growth.
Any judgment of India's economic performance must take these underlying cir-
cumstances into account. So, also, must account be taken of the uncertainties
imposed by the uncertain availability of water. A bad monsoon, which is in-
evitable from time to time, has a pervasive influence over the entire economy
and wipes out the results of years of effort.
4.        In the past 25 years, national income has grown at nearly 4% per
annum, which compares very favorably with the average annual growth rate of
less than 1% during the preceding 50 years. Population has also grown faster
in the past two decades than previously, but per capita income has neverthe-
less risen from a more or less stagnant level in the first half of this
century to achieve an average growth of roughly 1% a year since independence.
5.        Progress has been impressive on many fronts but disappointing on
others and has all too often fallen short of India's massive needs. The
growth of the socio-economic infrastructure (transport, education, health
services, etc.) has been spectacular, but has often been achieved at high



- 2 -
cost and has yielded results of variable quality. Many industrial, and agri-
cultural investment schemes have been highly successful, but others have taken
excessively long to be completed and have operated well below full capacity.
In some regions of the country growth ancd structural change have been rapid
and compare favorably witlh developments in many other parts of the world,
but in other regions there has been stagnation an(d possibly even decline.
Despite these improvements and although the distribution of income in India
is relatively even by comparison with many other countries, there has b2en
little impact upon the living standards of the vast masses of the urban
and rural population. The Government has become increasingly concerned
about the plight of the lower income strata which, conservatively measured,
consist of some 200 million people with incomes of less than IJS$360 per head
per year, and has initiated in recent years a varietv of programs specifically
designed to alleviate poverty.
6.        In broad terms, the structure of the economy has been slow to
change. Agriculture remains the dominant sector, accounting for some 43% of
national product in the early 1970s compared with around 49% twenty years
previously. The share of output contributed by the industrial sector has
increased only slowly and since the late 1960s has remained approximately
constant at a level of 23%. There has, however, been a shift in the com-
position of industrial production, with consumer, intermediate, and capital
goods now contributing about one-third each compared with an overwhelming
preponderance of consumer goods production 25 years ago.
7.        The economic report contained a review of the immense difficulties
confronting the Indian economy as the Fourth Plan period drew to a close.
The final year of the Plan, 1973/74, witnessed a severe deterioration in
India's terms of trade which was led by, but by no means restricted to, the
dramatic increase in oil prices. The resulting balance of payments difficul-
ties were compounded by the need for food imports following the drought of
1972/73, in order to sustain the public distribution system on which the
poorest section of society is particularly dependent. Given India's perva-
sively agricultural economy, the drought also had the effect of causing a
general slow-down in economic activity which was further aggravated by
infrastructure constraints, particularly widespread power shortages and
labor problems of Indian Railways. Food shortages and other scarcities
touched off an unprecedented inflationary spiral fueled by large budgetary
deficits which were at least partly attributable to mounting expenditures
for drought relief. The inflation in turn contributed to labor unrest while
efforts to cope with it through budgetary cuts affected, among other things,
the level of real expenditures for development programs.
8.        Thus, at the commencement of the Fifth Plan period (1974/75-1978/79)
the most urgent tasks facing policy makers were: to get agricultural pro-
duction moving again; to bring inflation under control; to reduce India's
dependence on oil imports by compressing energy consumption and by formulating
and implementing programs to develop domestic energy sources; to boost export
earnings and to tap additional sources of aid in order to sustain imports;



and, finally, to maintain a miriii'um investment program so as to avobi economic
standstill in the longer run.  Lven in the best of times, it would hiave been
extremely difficult to pursue simultaneously suchl a variety of potentially
inconsistent objectives.
9.        Events since the preparation of the last economic report provide
little encouragement. For the second time in the last three years, the weatlher
has let down India's farmers with the result that the khariff (fall) crop
recently harvested is believed to be considerably below last year's (about
60 million tons as compared with 67 million tons).  The outlool for the next
rabi (spring) crop is uncertain in view of continuing shortages of power
for irrigation pumps and possible fertilizer shortages. The reduced avail-
ability of foodgrains, the depletion of official food stocks, India's
balance of payments difficulties, the inflationary setting and frequent
changes in the Government's food procurement policy lhave led to hoarding for
both speculative and insurance purposes. Procurement for public distribution
has become extremely difficult. The public kitchens established in some of
the worst-affected areas (Bihar, Bengal, Orissa) bear evidence of the serious-
ness of the situation as well as of the Government's determination to prevent
extreme hardship.
10.       The spectre of massive food import requirements hangs over an
already very difficult balance of payments situation in the current year.
The need for six to seven million tons of foodgrains imports appears evident,
and considerably more than half this amount either lhas been delivered already
or has been purchased. There is little evidence of a major break in the
prices of other commodities imported in substantial quantities by India (e.g.
oil, fertilizers, steel, non-ferrous metals, rock phiosphate).
11.       One of the few bright spots in the balance of payments picture
has been the growth of export earnings. In 1973/74 export earnings recorded
an unprecedented increase of about 30, and there are indications of a similar
increase in the current year. While these increases - particularly that
in 1973/74 - are primarily attributable to unit value increases caused by
worldwide inflation, there is greater willingness to take advantage of export
opportunities, as illustrated most dramatically by the recent diversion of
sugar from domestic consumption to exports.
12.       Nevertheless, despite the increase in export earnings, India is
expected to run a massive trade deficit this year - probably of the order
of US$1,600 million as compared with US$795 million in 1973/74 and a negli-
gible one the previous year. ttoreover, despite the magnitude of the current
deficit, it is unlikely that India's imports, excluding foodgrains, will be
as large in volume as in 1972/73. In addition to financing a tracle deficit
of this order, India will have to meet debt service payments of about USS730
million.  These financing requirements will be partly offset through Consortium
assistance and USSR aid, whichi are together expected to reach disbursement
levels of about US$1,550 million in 1974/75 compared with about IS$J1,270 mil-
lion in 1973/74. The deferred payment arrangements for part of her oil. require-
ments that India is understood to have reached with Iran and Iraq will also



- 4 -
provide welcome relief.   Nevertheless, these various sources of financing
hardly measure up to India's current requirements.    India will have to draw
on flct foreign exchange reserves, which, at about US$1,300 million, are
c,i;:rently equivalent to less tnan tlhree months of imports. India has also
drawn US$375 million on the 1SIF in the current year.   The Government also
intends to Inake use of the IN'F oil facility, and a drawing on this facility
of aboult .TSS240 million hlas been recently approved for use in calendar year
1974.
13.       Onh the domestic front, the Government's present efforts are con-
eentrated primarily on maximizing production in key sectors through a system
of priorities in the allocation of scarce resources and through careful
;ioi.itoring of developments and nerformance.  In agriculture this entails
uovisi on of power on a priority basis for minor irrigntior and fertilizer
rrfiduction and allocation. of adequate foreign exchange for as much fertilizer
as can be iimportedl from the limited world supplies.  Similarly, efforts are
;-,ade to identify production bottlenecks in such sectors as fertilizer pro-
duction, coal mining and power generation; and special arrangements exist
for -neating expedit:ousl1  the foreign e:chiange requirements of these sectors
for such item:s as captive power units where appropriate, spares and replace-
ment parts. The railways are also tied into this system and accordl priority
to the movement of goods required by these sectors.    In the fertilizer, coal
and power sectors, senior officials are provided on a continuing basis with
detailed production figures along with explanations for production shortfalls.
Attempts are also being made to rationalize the administrative machinery of
the Government in tihese sectors, as evidenced by the October 1974 decision
to bring irrigation under the wing of the Food and Agriculture 'Ministry
and to reg.roup power generation and coal mining under an Energy M4inistry.
14.       In the short term, however, there are limits to the extent to which
India's dependence on oil imports can be reduced and production of domestic
sources of energy can be stepped up. Insofar as the compression of demand
for oil products is concerned, these limits are determined, on the one hand,
bv the relatively small proportion of oil products used for private con-
sumption (possibly one-sixth) and, on the othier hand, by the limited avail-
ability of donmestic substitutes (i.e. coal and power).   The 13 million tons
of crude oil plus 3 million tonls of product imports planned for the current
year probably represent the lower lirmit beyond which these imports can be
curbed without serious repercussions on domestic production. Had consumption
been allowed to grow in line with recent trends, the present level of crude
and product imports taken togetlher wqould probably be of the order of at least
18 million tons.
15.       A major effort is being made to use existing capacity as fully as
possible throughout the economy. To this end, despite the serious balance
of payments problem described above, the Government is pursuing a relatively
liberal policy toward imports of raw materials required by industry.     Never-
theless, it is hard to get away from the current infrastructure constraints
and particularly the shortage and unreliability of power supplies which,
though somewhat eased, continue to affect production.    Fiscal and monietary



policies, including the cutback in budgetary expenditures and limitations
on bank credit, are also restraining industrial output; and there is some
evidence that, due to rapidly rising food prices and the consequent erosion
of real purchasing power, the demand for some consumer items and industrial
projects is being affected. Given the various constraints, there is likely
to be little or no industrial growth in the current year which, in combination
with the current agricultural situation, makes it unlikely that there will
be any GNP growth either. In regard to inflation, the Government has made
impressive efforts to curb budgetary expenditures and to tap additional
sources of revenue. However, not surprisingly, in view of continuing food
shortages and other scarcities, inflation has not abated. The wholesale
price index, which in 1973/74 had recorded an increase of 29% over the pre-
vious year, has risen by a further 14"% during the first five months of this
fiscal year.
16.       In present circumstances the Draft Fifth Plan, published in late
1973, has not been finalized. In real terms investment in the current Annual
Plan is about 30% below the annual level implicit in the Draft Fifth Plan,
and even this is unlikely to be reached. To adjust to reduced resource
availability a number of investments are being postponed. Expenditures on
some of the social sectors such as education and family planning are un-
fortunately also affected. The focus once again is primarily on investments
in key sectors such as fertilizer, coal, power, and steel, and quite rightly
within these sectors the emphasis is on completing ongoing investments
before committing resources to new schemes.
17.       It is clear that to overcome her present difficulties and to resume
the interrupted process of economic development, India will require substan-
tially larger capital inflows than foreseen by the authors of the Draft Fifth
Plan. It is equally clear that as large as possible a proportion of these
requirements should be provided on concessional terms. However, even on very
optimistic assumptions regarding India's success in narrowing her resource
gap and the response of both Consortium and other donors, a gap will remain
between external financing requirements and the availability of concessional
aid.
18.       India's external public debt outstanding on March 31, 1973, stood
at US$9.9 billion. As a consequence of world-wide inflation and its effects
on India's export earnings, service payments of about US$730 million due
on this debt in 1974/75 are expected to be equivalent to about 17% of merchan-
dise exports as compared with about 26% in 1972/73.   However, substantial
additional debt will have to be incurred as a result of increases in the
prices of India's imports. In the future, therefore, the debt service ratio
is likely to rise, given the magnitude of India's requirements and the un-
avoidability of having to finance part of these on non-concessional terms.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
19.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 42 loans and 66 development
credits to India totaling US$1,229 million and US$2,963 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$655 million has been
repaid and US$1,112 million was still undisbursed as of October 31, 1974.
Annex II contains a summary statement of disbursements as of October 31,
1974, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
20.       Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in India totaling US$42.3
million, of which US$7.6 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.3 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$20.8 million, US$13.7 million
represents loans and US$7.1 million equity. A summary statement of IFC
operations as of October 31, 1974 is also included in Annex II (page 2).
21.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting
minor irrigation and other on-farm investments through agricultural credit
operations. M4ajor irrigation, marketing, and seed development are other
agricultural activities supported by the Bank Group. In recognition of the
importance of adequate fertilizer supplies for agricultural output, the Bank
Group has been active in financing the expansion of fertilizer production.
Apart from investments in fertilizer plants, the Bank Group has lent support
to the industrial sector through its sizeable assistance to development
finance institutions, in a wide range of geographically scattered medium-
and small-scale enterprises. IDA financing of industrial raw materials and
components for selected priority sectors has been instrumental in facilitating
better capacity utilization in these sectors. The Bank Group has also been
active in supporting infrastructure development for power, telecommunications,
and railways. Family planning, education, water supply development, and
related urban investments have also received Bank Group support in recent
years.
22.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities. The emphasis
of the program on agriculture, industry, power, and transport remains highly
relevant. The priority of the agricultural sector has been further enhanced
in the present world commodity situation. Thus, projects designed to foster
agricultural production through the provision of essential inputs such as
credit for on-farm investments, command area development of existing irrigation
schemes, fertilizer and seeds form an important aspect of the Bank Group's
program for the next few years. Special emphasis will be given to projects
designed to increase the productivity of small farmers and landless laborers.
Lending in support of infrastructure and industrial investments will focus
on energy-related projects. Repeater credits for power and railways have
high priority in this context, and discussions are under way with the Govern-
ment in an effort to identify and prepare projects specifically designed
to facilitate coal production and coal transport. Lending for fertilizer



- 7 -
projects, which has been an important feature in recent years, is expected
to continue to occupy a prominent place in the future program.
23.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources in
support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic reports
and of the discussions within the India Consortium. The need for readily
usable foreign exchange assistance is especially pressing at a time when
output and investment have to be adjusted to a radically different price
situation. Consequently, Bank Group lending for critical industrial raw
materials and components continues to be an essential element within the
overall program of assistance. As in the past, Bank Group assistance for
projects in India should include, as appropriate, the financing of local
expenditures. India imports relatively few capital goods because of the
capacity of the domestic capital goods industry. The import component of
projects tends to be especially low in such high-priority areas as agricul-
ture, education, and family planning. For the Bank Group to be able to make
an appropriate contribution to the financing of projects in these sectors, it
is important to cover a proportion of local expenditures.
24.       As mentioned in the foregoing discussion of the Indian economy, as
much as possible of India's external capital requirements snould be provided
on concessionary terms. Accordingly, the bulk of the Bank Group's assistance
to India has been, and should continue to be, provided from IDA. However,
the amount of IDA funds that can reasonably be allocated to India remains
small in relation to India's need for external assistance, and some Bank
lending to India is appropriate. Since disbursements on existing Bank loans
are projected to decline while repayments increase, a commitment level of about
US$100 million a year would maintain the Bank's exposure in India roughly
constant at US$500 - 550 million.
25.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion con-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1969/70 the Bank
Group accounted for 34% of total commiitinents, 13% of gross disbursements, and
12% of net disbursements, as compared with an estimated 35%, 27% and 37%,
respectively, in 1973/74, and the contribution of the Bank Group is expected
to continue growing. Whereas on March 31, 1973, the Bank Group share of
lndia's outstanding external public debt was 21%, by 1979 it is projected
to account for about 25%. Because Bank Group assistance to India is pre-
dominantly in the form of IDA credits, debt service to the Bank Group will
rise slowly. In 1973/74 about 12% of India's total debt service payments
were to the Bank Group.



PART III - THE FERTILIZER SECTOR
26.       Increased fertilizer production is an essential elemlent in India's
program to increase agricultural production.   Approximately 24, of total
development expenditure by the public sector has been devoteci to agriculture
in recent years, with priority being given to accelerating the spread of
modern technology through increasing the availability of inpuits such as
improved seeds, irrigation, credit and fertilizers. The output of foodgrains,
particularly the higph-yieldin g varieties of wheat and rice, is largely a
function of the fertilizer application rate. It is estimated that, under
present average conditions in India. the application of one ntutrient ton of
fertilizer yields an incremental production of five to seven tons of grain.
T17hus, shortfalls in the supply of fertilizer, whether imported or produced
domestically, have consequences of the utmost gravity for essential food
supplies.
27.       Consumption of fertilizers in India has been increasing at an
average annual rate of about 17% since 1953/54, when it was at a level of
113,000 nutrient tons, but it still remains very low relative to usage in
other countries. In 1973/74 it reached a level of 2.8 million tons, of which
66% was nitrogen, 22% phosphate, and 12, potash. IMore than 40% of this total
was imported. The level of imports, and therefore the increase in consumption,
would have been higher were it not for the scarcity of fertilizer on the
world market and the extremely high prices prevailing.
28.       Currently, India has an installed capacity of about 2.5 million
nutrient tons of nitrogenous and phosphiatic fertilizers, which is inadequate
to meet even the depressed level of consumption.   The gap between domestic
production and consumption is about one million tons wider because of limited
utilization of capacity in the fertilizer industry.    Domestic production of
fertilizer has grown at an average annual rate of 16% over the past two decades,
reaching 1.45 million tons in 1973/74, or slightly more than half of consump-
tion.  Projections through the end of the decade show a continuing deficit,
even assuming optimistic start-up schedules for new projects and relatively
high capacity utilization for all plants.
29.       Only about 67% of India's installed nitrogenous fertilizer capacity
was used in 1973/74, largely for reasons outside the control of the industry
itself. The largest single cause of low capacity utilization was power
shortages and fluctuations. It is estimated that power problems and shortage
of raw materials resulted in the loss of about 112,000 tons of nitrogen
production in 1973/74.   This is about 8% of installed capacity and is worth
about US$60 million at present import prices. In addition, design deficiencies
and aging equipment result in the fact that the effective capacity in several
plants is less than the rated capacity. Projects under construction suffer
from delays in commissioning, particularly because of procurement and start-
up dlifficulties, shortages of cement and steel, and delays in the supply of
equipment.  The Government has undertaken a concerted effort to overcome these
problems and bottlenecks. US$17 million was allocated for a Plant Operations



Improvement Program in Credit 481-IN of June 19, 1974; these funds are being
used to meet the foreign exchange costs of equipment, materials, and consulting
services for individual plant optimization programs.
30Q       The present intention is to create an installed capacity of about
4.9 million tons of nitrogen and 1.2 million tons of phosphate by 1978/79.
These targets are reasonable, although they are probably the maximum which
can be accomplished, given the constraints imposed by financial resources
and implementation capability. There are 28 projects under construction or
at an advanced stage of planning with a total capacity of 3.6 million tons.
When these are completed, about 60% of installed capacity will be in the
public sector and the balance in the private and cooperative sectors.
31.       With the exception of three new projects which are coal-based,
all of India's existing and planned fertilizer plants are based on petroleum
products, including naphtha and fuel oil, or domestic natural gas. In the
long rua, coal may well become the preferred feedstock for production of
nitrogenous fertilizers in India, given her sizeable coal deposits and the
impact that recent increases in petroleum prices has had on the economics
of fertilizer production. Expansion of fertilizer capacity in the near
future, however, is expected to be based on heavy fuel oil, because of const-
straints on coal production, more immediate economic utilization of additional
coal output as a substitute for petroleum products in power generation and
other industrial uses, and the desirability of taking advantage of anticipated
progress in the technology of coal-based ammonia synthesis. At current
prices, about US$30-35 is needed to pay for the fuel oil for each ton of urea,
which currently costs about US$250-350 to import and is expected to cost about
US$175 in 1978. Thus, for the next two or three years India should pursue
the rapid implementation of projects based on petroleum feedstocks which are
already at an advanced stage of preparation.
32.       The Bank Group has been actively supporting the fertilizer industry
in India for some time. IDA has made five credits, for the Fertiliser and
Chemicals, Travancore Ltd. (FACT) plant in Cochin and for the Gorakhpur,
Nangal, Trombay and Sindri Units of the Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI).
These projects have all aimed at a balanced expansion of capacity while at
the same time removing bottlenecks to the efficient utilization of existing
capacity. Work on the FCI plants is proceeding satisfactorily. The Cochin II
project, which was approved in July 1971, was envisaged as a follow-up to
Cochin I, a major ammonia/urea complex financed by a bilateral credit, which
was expected to commence operations in mid-1971. However, labor and procure-
ment difficulties and problems in the implementation of Cochin I have led
to delays in Cochin II, which is now almost two years behind schedule.
Procurement for Cochin II has, however, now been virtually completed and
substantial disbursements made. IFC has participated in two private sector
fertilizer projects: Indian Explosives Ltd. and Zuari Agro-Chemicals Ltd.,
both of which are now in operation.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       Tne proposed project was appraised in March/April 1974.   The
appraisal report (No. 591-Ia dated December 9, 1974) is being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were held in Washington
in October 1974. The Government of India was represented by Messrs. K.
balachandran and S. Venkataraman of the Ministry of Petroleum and Chemicals,
K. S. Bawa of the Department of Cooperatives, and V. N. Raiagopalan of the
Mdnistry of Finance; IFFCO was represented by J. Mehta (Chairman), Paul Pothen
(Managing Director), and B. B. Singh (Finance Director).    Attached as Annex
rIL is a loan and project summary.
34,       The proposed loan would help finance the construction of a plant
in Phulpur, Uttar Pradesh, to produce 900 metric tons per day (TPD) of ammonia
aItu 11950n TPD of urea. The project, which is expected to start commercial
proc uctiol in September 1978, would add about 230,000 tons per year (TPY) of
n.:Ltrogen to India's fertilizer capacity. It would include all necessary
off-sites such as railroad sidings, oil and coal storage and handling, ash
disposal, water ard effluent treatment, product storage and shipping, mainte-
nance shops, offices and personnel facilities.   About 170 of the 200 hectares
of land needed for the project is being provided by the Uttar Pradesh Govern-
ment, and 40 hectares of contiguous land is being provided by a public trust.
Final action necessary for the purchase of the land is expected to be com-
pleted shortly. Possession by IFFCO of the necessary land is a condition of
effectiveness.
35.       The Phulpur project would be implemented by IFFCO, a cooperative
society established in 1967 and jointly owned by the Government of India and
some 24,000 cooperative institutions representing about 20 million farmers.
Its authorized capital is Rs 1,000 million and its paid-up capital 285 million.
Although about two-thirds of the shares are held by the Government, IFFCO's
by-laws provide for the eventual transfer of the Government shares to the
cooperatives. Shareholders who contribute Rs 100,000 or more have the right
to a seat on IFFCO's Representative General Body, the general shareholder's
group, and every 200 societies with smaller shareholdings can jointly elect
one representative. During the first ten years of IFFCO's existence, the
Government appoints the Board of Directors and the principal officers;
thereafter, the principal officers and five members of the Board will be
selected by the Representative General Body, and the rest by various coop-
erative and financing institutions. An Executive Committee has been esta-
blished with adequate authority to decide matters affecting the day-to-day
operations of the society.
36.       The idea of the Indian cooperative movement engaging in the large-
scale manufacture of fertilizers was suggested in 1964 by the Cooperative
League of the USA. IFFCO is about to complete the construction of its first
two plants - one at Kalol, in Gujarat, with a final product capacity of
392,000 TPY of urea and the other at Kandla, also in Gujarat, with a capacity
of 376,000 TPY of complex fertilizers. Foreign exchange financing was



- 11 -
provided by the US, the UK, and the Netherlands. The successful implementa-
tion of these two projects indicates that IFFCO's management and technical
expertise are satisfactory. Ammonia production at Kalol began in November
1974 and the urea plant is expected to go on stream by the end of December,
but Kandla's start-up has been delayed by a shortage of imported phosphoric
acid.
37.       In view of the difficulty in mobilizing capital from a large number
of cooperative institutions, financing of the two projects was highly leveraged
and IFFCO's debt/equity ratio will be about 70/30 at the end of 1974. In
order to improve the financial structure of the society, the Government has
agreed to subordinate IFFCO's present debt and to provide about 27% of the
project financing as equity or subordinated debt (Section 2.02 of Guarantee
Agreement). This would bring the effective debt/equity ratio for IFFCO and
its Phulpur Unit to the more satisfactory level of 60/40. The Government has
also agreed that principal and interest payments on the subordinated debt will
be permitted only if IFFCO's current ratio remains at least 1.5:1; furthermore,
IFFCO has agreed to maintain a current ratio for itself after December 31,
1976, and for the Phulpur Unit after completion of the project of at least
1.5:1, to maintain a debt service coverage of at least 1.4 and not to undertake
additional investments in fixed assets in excess of US$3 million a year
without prior Bank approval (Section 3.05 of Guarantee Agreement and Section
5.05 of Loan Agreement).
38.       The principal inputs to be used in the Phulpur Unit would be heavy
fuel-oil for feedstock (up to 250,000 TPY), coal for steam and power genera-
tion (about 400,000 TPY), and power (about 15 MVA, of which about 80% will be
provided from the Unit's own generating plant). In view of the increasingly
tight supply conditions for these raw materials and utilities, IFFCO has
agreed to conclude long-term agreements for their supply prior to December 31,
1975 (Section 3.07 of Loan Agreement). Water is available from the area's
ample groundwater resources. The Government has also provided assurances that
sufficient railway tank cars (about 40 per day) and wagons (about 100 per day)
will be available for transporting fuel oil, coal, and fertilizer (Section
3.06 (b) of Guarantee Agreement).
39.       The project would be implemented with the assistance of several
engineering firms -- two foreign firms having the necessary experience in
ammonia and urea manufacture based on fuel-oil feedstock and one or more
Indian firms for design and engineering of offsites. The project would be
coordinated and managed by a Project Implementation Unit, according to an
implementation plan and schedule which have been found satisfactory. The
anticipated starting date for project construction is February 1, 1975, when
all necessary engineering contracts and financial arrangements are expected
to have been completed. All technology and equipment for the project will be
of proven design and construction -- including a fuel-oil based ammonia unit
closely resembling that of the IDA-financed Nangal project and the proposed
Sindri project -- which should help to ensure efficient plant operation.
40.       The project provides for adequate equipment to control its potentially
harmful emissions. IFFCO has agreed to comply with environmental quality
standards satisfactory to the Bank (Section 3.08 of Loan Agreement). Sulphur



- 12 -
from the heavy oil feedstock will be recovered as elemental sulphur and sold,
and carbon from the partial oxidation process will be continuously collected
and used to produce steam. Water contaminated with methanol and other
compounds will be sent to an effluent treatment unit prior to disposal.
41.       The project is estimated to cost US$220.5 million (including
US$26.3 million in interest during construction and US$42.1 million in physi-
cal and price contingencies), of which US$107.3 million is foreign exchange.
A breakdown of the estimated capital cost is included in Annex III. In addi-
tion to the proposed Bank loan, which would cover 49% of the cost, financing
would be provided by equity contributions from cooperative institutions and
State Governments (US$29.2 million) and from the Government (US$59.0 million,
including US$11.0 million in "quasi-equity" in the form of subordinated debt)
and a long-term loan from the Industrial Development Bank of India and other
financial institutions (US$23.3 million). The capital cost estimate is based
on projected December 1974 prices. Physical contingencies have been estimated
at 10%; price escalation rates have been taken at 11% during 1975 and 7.5%
annually thereafter for all equipment and foreign exchange costs and 10% and
8%, respectively, for civil works and other local currency costs.
42.       The proposed loan would be disbursed against the cost, including
price escalation, of imported equipment, materials and spare parts (US$50.4
million), the ex-factory cost of equipment and spares expected to be won by
Indian suppliers through international competitive bidding (US$16.9 million),
and the foreign exchange costs of license fees and design engineering (US$11.4
million), project management, erection and supervision (US$5.2 million), and
interest during construction (US$16.6 million). US$8.5 million would be
unallocated to meet physical contingencies on the above items. Indian
suppliers competing under international competitive bidding would be granted
a 15% preference or the current rate of import duty, whichever is less. It
is estimated about 15% of equipment contracts are likely to be won by Indian
bidders; in that case, the loan would involve local currency financing of
about US$11 million.
43.       All goods and services financed by the loan would be procured
according to Bank guidelines. Equipment and materials would be procured by
international competitive bidding except that, subject to prior approval of
the Bank, proprietary equipment essential to the process and items in limited
supply which are critical for the timely completion of the project (estimated
to have a total value of about US$8 million) may be procured by bidding from
short lists of qualified suppliers, and small items costing US$50,000 or
less (estimated to have a total value of about US$2 million) may be purchased
from manufacturers and local representatives of foreign suppliers, on the
basis of suitability, availability and price considerations following approval
by the Bank of the list of items involved. Neither the local costs nor the
foreign exchange component of about US$38 million worth of equipment and
civil works to be procured without international competitive bidding would
be financed under the proposed loan.

44.       IFFOO's properties at Kalol and Kandla have been mortgaged to five
lenders in India. Under arrangements agreed with the Government and IFFCO,
all these liens will be vacated by June 30, 1975 (Section 3.07 of Guarantee
Agreement). The Bank has agreed that IFFCO may replace the mortgages so
vacated by a lien in favor of the Government. The other lenders, who will
vacate the existing mortgages, will be given Government guarantees for their
loans to IFFCO. IFFCO may also create certain liens in favor of the Govern-
ment on the properties related to the Phulpur Unit. Arrangements will be
made to ensure that the Bank will receive a proportional share of any amounts
recoverable under these liens until its loan is fully repaid. No other liens
can be created except with the approval of the Bank (Section 5.04 of Loan
Agreement).
45.       The Indian cooperative movement participates actively in the
distribution of fertilizer and other inputs. IFFCO has pioneered in the
promotion of balanced fertilizer application and proper farming practices.
Since the two States which have the largest proportion in IFFCO's cooperative
shareholdings, the Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, are also the largest potential
consumers of fertilizers, IFFCO's marketing strategy will be largely directed
toward these two States. Supply and demand projections for nitrogenous fer-
tilizers in IFFCO's marketing area show a continuing deficit through 1983/84.
Thus, IFFCO should have no difficulty in marketing its output.
46.       Urea and other nitrogenous fertilizer prices are statutorily con-
trolled by the Government. The retail price of urea, which had been kept
within rather narrow bounds since the mid-1960s, has almost doubled within
the past twelve months. Although an important part of this increase is used
to reduce the Government's losses in subsidizing fertilizer imports, the
average ex-factory price has also increased by about 46%. This has served
to offset the increased cost of urea production resulting from the rise in
prices of petroleum feedstock and equipment.
47.       It is assumed that in the future input costs and ex-factory urea
prices will continue to increase at the same rate as each other. The O'A'-
factory price of urea at the Phulpur Unit has been projected to increase
from its present level of Rs 1,100 to Rs 1,450 per ton by 1978, and would
then be approximately in line with anticipated long-range international
prices for urea. The retail price to farmers, which consists of both the
ex-factory price and an element of price equalization between domestic
production and subsidized imports, is not expected to rise above its present
level. Assuming an ex-factory urea price of Rs 1,450 per ton and a fuel
oil price of US$75 per ton delivered at factory, the financial rate of
return is estimated at 13.9% before taxes and 10.3% after taxes. This
relatively low return is attributable to the relatively high capital costs
and long construction time -- due in turn to tight equipment supplies and
high prices and to the need for infrastructure at the project site -- and
to the high income tax rate (55%). The financial return remains adequate



- 14 -
even under moderately adverse circumstances, including a one-year delay in
cor.struction, a 10% increase in operating costs or a 10% cost overrun. The
Govern-ien.t has provided assurances that its pricing policies will continue
to vcrmit a reascnable return on invested capital (Section 3.04 of Guarantee
Atgreement).
48.       The project's economic rate of return is 16%, based on the pro-
jected 1978 world price of urea. With a one-year delay in construction and
a 10% cost overrun, sensitivity analysis shows the return would drop to
1.3%. still a satisfactory level. The gross direct annual foreign exchange
savilng would be about US$59 million, or about 55% of the foreign exchange
capital cost of the project. The project's output would help increase India's
foodgrain production by over one million tons annually, and the Phulpur Unit
%%ould provide direct employment to about 600 people (2,000 during the con-
tr!ction pnase) . As a cooperative organization, IFFCO is very conscious
ox 'L:. social, role and will assist the local community and cooperatives in
Mirany ways, maInly through training in industrial skills, marketing and
ad farming methods.
PARE V - INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and IFFCO, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between India and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of the Resolution approving the proposed loan are being dis-
tributed to tihe Executive Directors separately.
50.       Features of the Loan Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement of
special interest are referred to in paragraphs 37, 38, 44 and 47 of this
Report. In addition to these special features: (a) dissolution or disesta-
blishment of the Phulpur Unit have been added as events of suspension and
default (Sections 6.01 and 6.02 of the Loan Agreement); and (b) possession
by IFFCO of approximately 200 hectares of land suitable for construction
and operation of the project is an additional condition of effectiveness of
the Loan (Section 7.01 of Loan Agreement).
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Generally, the implementation of projects has been proceeding
reasonably well. Details on the execution of individual projects are below.
The level of disbursements was $368 million in FY74 or 83% of Bank Group
commitments in that year.   The undisbursed pipeline of $1,112 million as of
October 31,   1974, corresponds roughly to commitments over the preceding
24-month period and reflects the lead time which would be expected given the
mix of fast and slow disbursing projects in the India program.
Ln. No. 683   Eighth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$40.0 million loan of June 3, 1970; Closing Date:
September 30, 1974
Ln. No. 789   Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$60.0 million loan of October 21, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976
Ln. No. 902   Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$70.0 million loan of June b, 1973; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company.   The undisbursed balance of
US$1.2 million for Loan 683-IN as of the closing date of September 30, 1974, has
been cancelled; Loan 789-IN is fully committed; and disbursements under Loan
902-IN are ahead of schedule. An eleventh loan to ICICI is tentatively
scheduled for Board presentation in July 1575.
Ln. No. 614   Tarai Seeds; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1'74
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in the
development of seeds of high-yielding varieties.   The Corporation is working
efficiently and has developed a reputation for excellent seed quality. Seed
production is meeting targets. Implementation problems over processing plant
construction and land-leveling have been resolved although, as a result of
these delays, an extension of the closing date by two years has been necessary.
Expansion of an existing processing plant is in progress, and tenders for a
new plant are under preparation. Large-scale land-leveling demonstrations have
stimulated demand for such work and orders are to be placed shortly by con-
tractors for imported machinery.
Cr. No. 176   Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 million credit of February 9, 1970;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana Dam
on the Mahi River and the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam. The
project also includes field channel construction, land-leveling, drainage

progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

works and roads, and a program to support agricultural development.   The
project will be completed about two years behind schedule because of delays
in dam construction. The agricultural components of the project are also
behind schedule.  Some of the delays in implementation have occurred at the
start of the project before major investments have been made.  These will
not affect the economic justification of the project. Further delays have
occurred as a result of material shortages.  The Government has recently taken
action to make more material available.
Cr. No. 268   Pochampad Irrigation: US$39.0 million credit of August 23, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977
The project will assist the comprehensive agricultural development
on the right bank of the Godavari River by providing perennial irrigation to
some 100,000 ha. It includes the construction of Pochampad Dam, a concrete-
lined main canal, distributary canals, field channels, drains and roads. Until
mid-1973, overall performance on the project was satisfactory with construction
and credit disbursements progressing ahead of schedule. Acute shortages of
construction materials, especially explosives for the canal excavation, have
hampered progress. As a result, construction of the main canals is now likely
to fall more than one year behind schedule, which is likely to delay the
introduction of irrigation to over 40% of the project area. Land development
is presently haphazard and increasingly lagging behind water availability in
the project. Government is aware of the inadequacy of the credit operation
for land development and has requested IDA financing for a Command Area
Development Project, to be implemented by a Central Authority for all
farmers in need of land development.
Cr. No. 191   Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 million credit of
June 3, 1970; Closing Date: March 31, 1975
Cr. No. 203   Punjab Agricultural Credit Project; US$27.5 million credit of
June 24, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
Cr. No. 226   Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Credit Project; US$24.4 million credit

The above agricultura! credit projects tota.l US$319.9 million.
Apart from the Punjab project, which consists of mechanization equipment only,
all are sirmilar in structure, being designed to provide long- and medium-term
credit to farmers through credit institutionls for such on-farm investrments
as imported tracto-s, r.i.nGor irrigation and land-leveling.  Disbursement of
these credits started slowly.  So far as the minor irrigation components were
concerned, the main difficulties stemmed from the institutional requirements,
in particular the introduction of changes in lending criteria and lending
terms and the strengthening of institutions responsible for assessing ground-
water availabiiity. These constraints have been overcome and disbursements are
on schedule.  Tractor procurement has been delayed following the substantial
change in both the supp cLy and demand situations since the projects were
originailly apprais,ed.. Those credit;s whiich have tractor components have been
amended to permit the financing of indigenously manufactured tractors as well
as imported tractors.  Tractor procurement is now in progress on that basis.
Some funds earmarked for tractor spares and laid levelling have been reallocated
to Pinor irrigation components.
Cr. 4o. W6 Wheat Stcrage; US$5.0 m.illion credit of August 23, 1971; Closing
Date:  September 30, 1975
This credit, which provides storage facilities in India's wheat
belt, comprises construction of 10 warehouses (100,000 tons capacity) and 10
silos (200,000 tons capacity) and an all-India grain storage study.   Warehouse
construction is about 75% complete.  The Government Food Ministry has selected
a local research institute to conduct the study. Administrative problems,
substantia,. cost increases, and technical difficulties in the selection of silo
sites have hampered the execution of the silo component. A supervision mission
has recently assessed the situation and will shortly recommend appropriate action.
Cr. No. 456    Himachal Pradesh Apples Processing and Marketing; US$13 million
credit of January 22, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
This project was designed to promote the development of apple
processing and marketing in Himachal Pradesh and comprises roads, cold storage,
juice processing, and marketing facilities.   The project entity, the H.P.
Horticultural Produce Processing and Marketing Corporation (HPMC) has been
established and key senior staff recruited, including the Managing Director.
Feasibility studies have begun for cold storages and the juice concentrate
plant.   Project training is expected to begin soon.
Cr. No. 2l1    Telecommunications IV; US$7e.O million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
Cr. No. 4034   Te].ecc!mumnications V; U.Sjo80.n million credit of June 2c, 19-j73;
Cls:ing Date:  Decer;er 31, 19 9r7G
Do.h pruiects are continuations of Telecommunicati(rs ITl.  Tele-
corImuni.cations IV has been designed to support the telecommunications e.parsion
program over tole last two years cf the Fourth P]ian (1969-74).  Procurement
action for delivery- of imported goods in 19731/7L; has been largel.y complet.ed.
Production problems in local factories delayed initial disbursement by about
6-9 months. However, production has now pick:ed up and as cf October 31, 1974,
US1h.9 m~1ioflJ had been disbursed under the credit.  Telecommunications V was
declared effective on July 30, 1,973, and procurement procedures, after a slow
start, are now under way.

Cr. No. 242    Power Transmission II; US$75.0 million credit of May 3, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1975
Cr. No. 377    Power Transmission III Project; US$85.0 million ,credit of May 9,
1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1577
Power Transmission II, which is a continuation of the project
financed by Loan 416-IN, has been designed to assist in financing the purchase
of equipment and materials required to develop a power transmission program in
nine states under the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred because
of problems associated with preparing bid documents suitable for international
bidding and the analysis of the very large number of bids involved, but all
contract awards have now been made. Power Transmission III became effective
on October 10, 1973, and specification and tendering procedures are progressing.
Tenders received so far indicate substantial cost overruns.
Cr. No. 264    Cochin II Fertilizer; US$20.0 million credit of July 30, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
Cr. No. 279    Gorakhpur Fertilizer; US$10.0 million credit of January 7, 1972;
Closing Date: March 31, 1975
Cr. No. 357    Nangal Fertilizer Expansion Project; US$58.0 million credit of
February 9, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
Cr. No. 481    Trombay IV Fertilizer Expansion; US$50.0 million credit of
June 19, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Cochin Fertilizer Project is intended to help finance the
expansion of fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Cochin. The project is
now proceeding about 21 months behind schedule due, in large part, to labor
and procurement difficulties. Procurement problems have been largely overcome
and most of the equipment is either at the site or at the Cochin port. Another
factor which has contributed to the delay has been technical problems in the
commissioning of the Cochin I plant, which has required a disproportionate
amount of management attention. Credit No. 481 contains funds for a Plant
Operations Improvement Program which will be used in part to overcome these
problems; the use of these funds has been identified on a plant-by-plant basis
and procurement has been initiated. The engineering design for the Gorakhpur
project is well advanced and virtually all the equipment has been ordered.
Although delivery of some equipment may take longer than forecast during
appraisal, the project is progressing without serious difficulties, and
disbursements are expected to be complete by the March 1975 closing date.
Engineering work and procurement for the Nangal Fertilizer Project are
proceeding satisfactorily. The Trombay IV Credit was signed on June 19, 1974,
and was declared effective on August 21, 1974.
Cr. No. 448    Railways XII; US$80 million credit of December 21, 1974; Closing
Date: September 30, 1975
This project consists of new and ongoing works in the Indian Railways

disbursements are on schedule.
Cr. No. 294    Bihar Agricultural Markets; US$14.0 million credit of March 29,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Cr. No. 378    Karnataka Wholesale Agricultural Markets Project; US$8.0 million
credit of May 9, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
These projects were designed to help with ectablishmsnt of whole-
sale markets in a number of towns in Bihar and sarrataka.   Progress under the
projects has generally been satisfactory.   Markets construction in Bihar was
delayed due to legal challenges arising out of the state's aquisition of land
for market sites; however, these difficulties have been satisfactorily resolved.
Market construction in Karnataka is expected to be on schedule.
Cr. No. 312    Population; US$21.2 million credit of June 14, 1972; Closing Date:
June 30, 1975
This credit, which will help finance an experimental and research
oriented population project in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, was declared effective
on May 9, 1573. Project implementation is gaining momentum; the construction
program is well under way, and all key project staff have been appointed.
