IFFCO FERTILIZER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report deals with the appraisal of a fertilizer project in
Phulpur, Uttar Pradesh (UP) comprising a 900 tons per day (TPD) ammonia unit
and a 1,500 TPD urea plant based on heavy fuel oil for feedstock and coal for
steam and power generation. The project, which is expected to start commer-
cial production in September 1978, is sponsored by the Indian Farmers' Fer-
tiliser Cooperative Ltd. (IFFCO), owned by the Government of India and coopera-
tive institutions. Although two thirds of the shares are held by the Govern-
ment, IFFCO's by-laws provide for the eventual transfer of the Government
shares to the cooperatives. The project will add 495,000 tons per year (TPY)
urea capacity (equivalent to 228,000 tons of nitrogen) to two other plants
that IFFCO is successfully building and has almost completed. These two plants,
having a final product capacity of 392,000 TPY of urea and 376,000 TPY of com-
plex (NPK) fertilizers, are the first venture of the Indian cooperative system
into the large-scale manufacture of fertilizers. The Phulpur project is esti-
mated to cost about US$220 million, of which US$107 million is anticipated to
be in foreign exchange including nearly US$17 million in interest during con-
struction. A Bank loan of US$109 million equivalent is proposed; it would be
made to IFFCO and guaranteed by the Government.
ii.       Chemical fertilizer consumption in India grew rapidly--at an average
rate of 17% annually--in the last 20 years and reached 2.8 million tons of the
three major plant nutrients 1/ in 1973/74. With 164 million hectares, India
is the third ranking country in the world in cropped area (and the second in
irrigated land). Future increases in production of foodgrain and other crops
are expected to result not so much from enlargement of the cultivated areas as
from improved agricultural practices, including higher rates of fertilizer
application. Recent forecasts estimate N consumption at 4.3 and 6.9 million
tons by 1978/79 and 1983/84 respectively. 2/
iii.      The growth in fertilizer production in the past 20 years (16% per
year on the average) is impressive but has failed to keep pace with demand and
imports have increased almost twentyfold in spite of the fact that farmers'
demand has not been fully satisfied because of balance of payment problems and
recent scarcity and high prices of imported fertilizers. Domestic production
of fertilizer has been disappointing in recent years; production of N fertilizer
in 1973/74 (less than 1.1 million tons) was only 67% of commercial capacity
1/   1.83 million tons of nitrogen (N), 0.61 million tons of phosphoric acid
(P205) and 0.33 million tons of potash (K20).
2/   The Draft Fifth Five-Year Plan projected a 1978/79 consumption of 5.2
million tons of N.



- li -
(i.e., excluding plants mechanically complete but not yet operating comuercial-
ly). Because of uncertainty in the availability and pricing of fertilizers in
the world market, increased domestic production--through improvement in the
capacity utilization of existing plants and installation of new units--is
crucial for India's programs to increase agricultural production. The project
will help to fill, at a satisfactory economic cost, the gap between production
and demand, thus diminishing the country's costly dependence on imported ferti-
lizer and the consequent risk of interrupted supplies. Any shortfall in food
production resulting from lack of fertilizers would cost India many times the
cost of producing them locally.
iv.       The project envisages the utilization of modern but proven techno-
logy (the ammonia plant will be similar to that of the Nangal fertilizer plant
for which IDA financing was approved in January 1973) and will be executed by
IFFCO with the assistance of engineering firms which have experience in the
construction of fuel oil-based ammonia and urea plants and offsites and which
will actively participate in the procurement of equipment following Bank
guidelines. IFFCO will set up a Project Implementation Unit, and to strengthen
its capacity to manage the implementation of a project employing technology
not used today in India (the Nangal fertilizer plant will be the first major
plant based on fuel oil), IFFCO will arrange, if they or the Bank deem it
necessary, for qualified technical advisory services. The contracts with the
latter and the engineering firms will be subject to prior Bank approval.
v.        The US$109 million loan will finance equipment and spares procured
according to Bank guidelines and the foreign exchange component of the fees
for expatriate engineering, licensing and advisory services. The balance of
the project cost will be financed through long-term borrowings from the Gov-
ernment and Indian banking institutions totalling Rs 258 (US$34.3) million
and by raising IFFCO's equity by Rs 580 (US$77.2) million through contributions
from the Government (Rs 360 million) and the cooperative institutions (Rs 220
million). In view of the need to mobilize substantial resources from a large
number of cooperatives, the Government has agreed to cover any shortfall in
the cooperatives' contribution. The project will be soundly capitalized with
a debt:equity ratio of about 60:40 including some quasi equity in the form of
subordinated debt to the Govern>;snt. As loans are repaid, IFFCO's financial
position will be strengthened and reserves built up for future expansion.
vi.       Agricultural cooperatives in India, besides extending credit to
their members, share in the marketing of their crops, and are the major dis-
tributors of fertilizer and other agricultural inputs. Institutional de-
velopment, however, is uneven and the processing of credit applications and
recovery of loans must be improved. The prevailing high level of overdue
loans does not affect fertilizer manufacturers (including eventually IFFCO)
because sales are primarily financed by the banking system but corrective
measures, many of which have already been taken, must nevertheless be firmly
pursued, such as: disbursing credit largely in kind (fertilizer, seeds, etc.),
tying of crop marketing with loan repayment, rejecting credit applications
from defaulting borrowers and tightening accounting procedures at village-level
cooperatives. Operations of cooperatives located in the most important dis-
tricts in IFFCO's marketing area are rapidly improving but the effectiveness



- iii -
of the steps taken must be kept continually under review. The proposed loan
to IFFCO will reinforce the Company's capacity to strengthen cooperative in-
stitutions at the grassroots level through the training of cooperative offi-
cials for extension services on fertilizer application by individual farmers.
vii.      Based on the present net ex-factory price of Rs 1,100 (US$147) per
ton of urea in India and the expected price escalation through 1978, the
proposed plant's cash flow is projected to maintain a current ratio of at
least 1.5 to 1.0 and yield a financial rate of return of 10.3% after income
taxes or 13.9% before taxes. The present price paid by farmers for urea is
Rs 2,000 (US$267) per ton, but Rs 610 (US$81) per ton is set aside to sub-
sidize higher-priced urea imports through a Government-controlled equaliza-
tion fund. The Government has agreed to maintain fertilizer prices at levels
allowing efficient manufacturers to meet their expenses, service their debt
out of their revenues and earn a reasonable rate of return on capital employed.
viii.     On the basis of long-term international price levels for feedstock
(US$65/ton of heavy fuel oil at plant site) and urea (US$175/ton landed at
Indian port) expected at the time the plant starts commercial production, the
project's economic rate of return is 16.2%. Were production costs to increase
by 10%, the rate of return would decrease to 14.8%. A drop of US$20/ton in
the price for urea would depress the return by 3.6 percentage points. A one-
year delay in the time required for construction would lower the rate of return
to 15.0% and a 10% capital cost overrun to 14.6%. The annual foreign exchange
savings are estimated at US$59 million annually.
ix.       IFFCO has been active for three years in promotional programs
advocating balanced fertilizer application and other improved agricultural
practices. As part of these programs IFFCO has been training its own and
cooperative staff in all aspects of fertilizer application and marketing
and has sold about 300,000 tons of fertilizers reaching a large number of
cooperative members "demonstration" plots. This extensive background in
fertilizer marketing and IFFCO's experience in building two large fertil-
izer plants are expected to reduce risks to a minimum provided that imple-
mentation of the project can be carried out as planned. However, delays
in delivery of equipment and cost overruns in excess of those provided for
cannot be ruled out altogether in the tight equipment market situation existing
at present. But even a one-year delay in project completion combined with a
10% cost overrun - serious as these events would be in the attempt to get
additional fertilizer to Indian agriculture quickly and at a reasonable price
- would reduce the economic rate of return only to 13.4%.
x.        Based on the agreements reached with the Government and IFFCO as
shown at the end of the report, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of
US$109 million equivalent.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India (GOI), on behalf of Indian Farmers Fertiliser
Cooperative Ltd. (IFFCO or the Company), has requested a Bank loan of US$109
million equivalent to help in the financing of a new fertilizer plant with a
capacity of 297,000 tons per year (TPY) of ammonia and 495,000 TPY of urea,
equivalent to 227,700 TPY of nitrogen (N) nutrient 1/ at Phulpur, Uttar
Pradesh (UP). IFFCO is owned jointly by the Government and Indian cooperative
institutions and is about to complete the construction of two other fertili-
zer plants in Gujarat, one at Kalol, for the production of ammonia and urea,
and the other at Kandla, for the production of complex fertilizers (Map:
IBRD 10453RI). The Company also plans to build a phosphoric acid plant at a
later date.
1.02      IDA has extended four credits and IFC participated in two fertilizer
projects in India. A fifth fertilizer project, the Sindri Modernization Pro-
ject of the Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI), has been recently appraised
by IDA and is expected to be presented to the Executive Directors at the same
time as the IFFCO project. The Phulpur project is the first involving the
construction of a new grass-roots plant. It was first reviewed by a Bank
mission in October 1973, and after some additional preparatory work, appraised
in March/April 1974 by a mission consisting of Messrs. Tarnawiecki (Chief) and
Pratt, of the Industrial Projects Department.
II. THE IFFCO ORGANIZATION
A.   Description, Organization and Management
2.01      IFFCO was registered on November 3, 1967, under the Bombay Coop-
erative Societies Act and, subsequently, as a central society in New Delhi..
It is owned two-thirds by the Government and one-third by a great number of
Indian cooperative institutions. Its authorized capital is Rs 1,000 million
and its paid-up capital Rs 285 million. The idea of the Indian cooperative
system engaging in the large-scale manufacture of fertilizers was suggested
to the Government in 1964 by the Cooperative League of USA, which also offered
assistance in implementing it. The US Agency for International Development
(AID) studied the plan in 1966/67, recommended building an ammonia/urea plant
and a complex (NPK) fertilizer plant in Gujarat, and helped in their financing.
These are the two plants which are now nearing completion (para. 1.01).
1/ A glossary of terms used in the report is contained in Annex 1-1 and
units and conversion factors common in the petroleum and fertilizer
industries are shown in Annex 1-2.



- 2 -
2.02      The contribution of the cooperative system to IFFCO's equity now
stands at Rs 105 million. About 24,000 cooperative institutions ranging from
the national level federation to primary village cooperatives in 10 States
are shareholders in IFFCO (Annex 2-1). Shareholders who contribute Rs 100,000
or more have the right to a seat on IFFCO's Representative General Body, a
form of general shareholders assembly, and every 200 societies with smaller
shareholders can jointly elect one representative. During the first 10 years
of its existence (i.e., until November 1977), the Government appoints the
Board of Directors and the principal officers, and thereafter the Representa-
tive General Body will select 5 members of the Board. The Managing, Finance
and Marketing Directors, who are at the same time full-time officers, will be
appointed by the Board with prior approval of the Government. Another 14
members will be appointed by cooperative institutions, up to 5 by the Govern-
ment and 3 by financial institutions. An Executive Committee has been estab-
lished with adequate powers to run day-to-day operations of the Company. The
senior corporate structure is shown in Annex 2-2.
2.03      The present Managing Director, Mr. Paul Pothen, is a highly able
and experienced fertilizer industry technologist and executive. The Finance
Director, Mr. B.B. Singh, has been seconded to IFFCO from the Ministry of
Finance, and the General Manager, Mr. B. R. Singh, has an extensive background
in Indian fertilizer distribution and sales as well as in the cooperative
system. Mr. Pothen's contract expires in January 1976 and Mr. B. B. Singh's
in July 1975. Mr. Pothen's contract can be extended for two additional years
without any difficulty and the Company has agreed to consult with the Bank
on the appointment of a qualified successor to any vacancy in the position of
a fulltime Director. The eventual replacements for these men should be
selected and trained as early as possible.
B.   Plants under Construction
2.04      As mentioned previously, two IFFCO projects are being completed at
Kalol, near Ahmedabad, and about 325 km away, in Kandla, close to the Indian
Ocean where facilities for ocean-going vessels and railway connections are
available. The Kalol plant comprises a 910 tons per day (TPD) ammonia unit
and a 1,200 TPD urea unit plus storage, offsites and township. The ammonia
unit was designed and engineered by M.W. Kellogg Company (USA) in conjunction
with Kellogg (India), and uses local natural gas, to be purchased from GOI at
US$0.45 per thousand standard cubic feet (MSCF), supplemented by about 180 TPD
of naphtha. The urea unit was licensed by Stamicarbon N.V. (Holland) and
engineered by Humphreys and Glasgow Ltd. (UK) in conjunction with H. & G.
Consultants Private Ltd. (India), which also designed the offsites. It will
consume about 700 TPD of ammonia. The balance of approximately 200 TPD of
ammonia will be transported via rail to the Kandla plant for the manufacture
of complex fertilizers, with any surplus to be sold to industrial users.



2.05      The Kandla plant comprises two streams each having a design capacity
of 600 TPD diammonium phosphate (DAP). The addition of potash enables a
variety of NPK grades to be made according to need. The plant was designed
by Dorr-Oliver Inc. (USA) in conjunction with Dorr-Oliver (India) Ltd. and
their United Kingdom affiliate. Offsites were also designed by this group.
A deep-water dock and township have been built nearby.
2.06      Project organization, procurement, construction and management at
both sites has been undertaken by IFFCO staff with the assistance of Cooperar-
ative Fertilizers International (CFI), a group formed by US fertilizer co-
operatives, and other expatriate staff working in conjunction with contractors'
project teams. This arrangement (Annex 2-3) has been successful and indicates
that IFFCO's management and project team are competent. Contracts for these
plants were let in July 1971 and commercial production of ammonia at Kalol is
expected to begin in November 1974, five months behind schedule. Due to de-
layed shipment of the imported reactor, urea production at Kalol is not likely
to commence, until late 1974. Meanwhile, ammonia can be transported to Kandla
as well as to other plants subject to the availability of sufficient rail
tank-cars. While eventually IFFCO may produce its own phosphoric acid, ini-
tially it will depend on imported phosphoric acid. One shipment of 15,000
tons has already been received, but adequate supply from the world market may
be difficult during the next couple of years.
C.   Financial Evaluation of Existing Operations
2.07      Total costs of the two plants, including contingencies and initial
working capital, are currently estimated at Rs 939 million (about US$125
million), of which Kalol represents'about 72% and Kandla 28%. Sources of
funds - US, UK, Netherlands, Government of India, Industrial Development Bank
of India (IDBI) and other financial institutions - are detailed in Annex 2-1.
2.08      Financing of the two projects was highly leveraged and at the end
of 1974 IFFCO's debt/equity ratio will be about 70:30. The Government has
agreed to subordinate its existing credit of Rs 112 million (Annex 2-1) on
terms similar to those described for the Government's quasi-equity contribution
for the proposed Bank project (para. 5.05). Such a conversion would bring
the Company's debt/equity ratio to about 58:42 at the end of 1974.
2.09      IFFCO's projected financial statements without the project are shown
in Annex 2-4 and summarized in the Table next page. The projections are based
on end-of-1974 costs and prices escalated by annual inflation rates of 12%
during 1975, 8% during 1976, and 6% during 1977 and 1978; after start-up of
the project they are expressed in constant mid-1978 prices. As mentioned
before, the Kandla plant is facing difficulties in obtaining supplies of
phosphoric acid in the world market and the projected financial results are
based on the plant producing NPK at only 25% of capacity during the next two
years. IFFCO's profitability, however, as shown in Annex 2-4, will still be
satisfactory because the Kalol plant is expected to operate at 60% of capa-
city in 1975, 80% in 1976, and 90% thereafter, and the ammonia production
intended for the manufacture of NPK fertilizer can be profitably sold to
other users. The expected financial results from the two existing plants

are favorable because the Kandla and Kalol plant capital and financing costs
were largely incurred before the sharp equipment price inflation registered
during 1973 and 1974. Furthermore, the present urea ex-factory price has been
set by the Government to provide a fair return on equity on the much higher
present levels of capital and financial costs.
2.10      The Company has instituted comprehensive internal reporting pro-
cedures and has agreed to supply to the Bank quarterly production, income
and cash flow reports and audited annual reports satisfactory to the Bank.
IFFCO wilL also prepare each quarter projected cash flows for the next 12-
month period.
D.   Mortgages
2.11      IFFCO's properties at Kalol and Kandla have been mortgaged to
secure the loans received by IFFCO from the Government, IDBI and other finan-
cial institutions in India. The Government and IFFCO have agreed to vacate
the existing mortgages by June 30, 1975. These mortgages will be replaced by
a new mortgage in favor of the Government. IDBI and other financial insti-
tutions will be given Government guarantees for their loans to IFFCO.
2.12      The existing mortgages do not extend to any properties of the
proposed Phulpur Unit. In addition to the proposed Bank loan, IDBI, other
financial institutions and possibly the Government will advance loan funds
to the new plant. Under the arrangements agreed with the Government and
IFFCO, IFFCO may create certain liens on the properties of the Phulpur Unit
in favor of the Government to secure loan amounts of the Bank and IDBI
(including other financial institutions) which will be guaranteed by the
Government, and to secure any direct lending by the Government for the
Phulpur Unit. Arrangements will be made to ensure that the Bank will receive
a part of any amounts recoverable under liens on the Phulpur Unit until its
loan is fully repaid. No other liens will be allowed except with the approval
of the Bank.
III. FERTILIZER MARKET
A. Agriculture in India and the Need for Fertilizers
3.01      With a cropped area of 164 million ha (Annex 3-1), India ranks
third in the world in area of cultivated land (after the USSR and US) and
second in irrigated land (after Mainland China). In 1971, an estimated
72% of the labor force worked the land but the agricultural sector's share
in GDP (at factor cost) was only about 43%. In the decade ending 1971-72,
the growth rate for foodgrain output was 2.6% p.a. of which 0.5% can be
ascribed to cropped area increases and 2.1% to higher productivity. 1/ This
1/ However, for cereals alone (i.e., excluding pulses), the growth in
output was 3.1% annually and in yields, 2.6% p.a..



- 6 -
was largely due to increased use of fertilizers and irrigation and to the
spreading cultivation of high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of several crops,
especially wheat and rice.  During the last two years of the Fourth Five-
Year Plan (1968/69 - 73/74) production failed to increase primarily because
of the 1972/73 drought, scarcity of fertilizers, power shortages and trans-
portation difficulties.
3.02      The Draft Fifth Five-Year Plan has set a target for foodgrain
growth of 4.2% annually from 1973/74 through 1978/79, of which 3.2% would
result from increased crop yields and 1.0% would be brought about through
an increase in area under crops of 10.2 million ha. However, the latest
Bank country economic report 1/ indicates that an increase in cropped area
of 5 million ha in foodgrains and 3 million ha in other crops is more
likely. The yields of the main crops are planned to increase by from 18%
to 3S% in five years. To attain such increments increased availability of
fertilizers is indispensable but it must be complemented by proper use of
other inputs (water, seeds, pesticides and tractors), maintenance of advan-
tageous crop price/input cost ratios for most crops, and improvement of
agricultural credit procedures.
3.03      Although under controlled small-scale farm trials, incremental
yields as high as 10 tons of foodgrain per ton of plant nutrient have been
obtained, in practical terms, a ratio of only about 6 to 1 is expected
under average Indian conditions in the next few years. 2/ These are very
crude yardsticks of what actual marginal response to fertilizer application
may be, but indicate the magnitude of the foodgrain imports that would be
needed to cover shortfalls in fertilizer supplies.
B. The Role of the Cooperative Institutions
3.04      The Indian cooperative movement participates actively in agricul-
tural credits, crop marketing and fertilizer distribution, and, through
IFFCO, also in the large-scale manufacture of fertilizers. The share of
the Indian cooperative movement in agricultural credit was a meager 3% in
1952, but increased rapidly during the sixties to reach about 33% of the
total in 1969 (.Annex 3-2). In most States there is a three-tier structure
for extending short-terui eredit to individual farmers: the State-Level
"Apex" cooperative bank, tile district-level central cooperative bank and
the primary (village-level) cred.aL or multi-purpose cooperative society
(Annex 3-3). MIarketing of crops and distribution of fertilizers and other
inputs are also important activities of the cooperative system. The primary
marketing cooperatives handled crops valued at Rs 8.4 billion in 1971/72 and
about Rs 11 billion in 1973/74.
1/  "Economic Situation and Prospects of India" (402-IN), May 7, 1974.
2/ IBRD, Economic Situation and Prospects of India, Report No. 402-IN
(May 7, 1974).



3.05      However, the primary agricultural credit cooperatives face a
serious problem in the lack of sufficient well-trained full-time employees
and the large proportion of overdues: 44% of loans outstanding as of June
30, 1972. This situation can be partly justified by bad crops but the
Government and officials in the cooperative movement recognize that the
larger number of cases is due to poor management, particularly laxity in
loan recovery practices (Annex 3-2, paras. 13/14). Although the problem
diminishes in relative importance as one moves up through the tiers of
the cooperative system (Apex banks' overdues amounted to only 7% of loans
outstanding in June 1972) and it does not affect in any way the financial
position of fertilizer manufacturers (including eventually IFFCO), con-
tinued improvement is of the greatest importance and the effectiveness of
steps already taken towards this end should be kept under periodic review.
These steps include disbursement of credit only to farmers who have repaid
previous loans and training of full time cooperative officials. Fortunately,
some of the cooperatives most active in introducing needed reforms are
located in the States where IFFCO will market the largest share of its
production.
C. Supply and Demand
3.36      In India, the cooperative institutions as well as the private and
oublic sectors share in fertilizer production and distribution. One half
of the present capacity to manufacture N fertilizers--the product dealt
with in this report--is owned and operated by the public sector, mainly by
FCI and Fertilisers and Chemicals, Travancore Ltd. (FACT), 1/ 31% by private
companies and the remaining 19% by mixed enterprises. The cooperatives will
share in production only as IFFCO's two plants come shortly on stream.
Producers are allowed to market part of their straight N fertilizers 2/
and the balance goes to the Central Fertilizer Pool, a public sector
agencv, wh3ich came into existence in 1942 to import N fertilizers, a func-
tion it still performs.
3.71      The historical growth of fertilizer consumption and production
in In3ia is analyzed in Annex 3-4 and projections through 1983/84 are
saomn in Annex 3-5.  The following paragraphs summarize the major conclu-
s iOils.
3.9S      Consumption of the three major plant nutrients 3/ increased at
an average annual rate of 17.4% in the last 20 years, reaching 2.77 million
tons in 1973/74. Growth in consumption of N alone has been only slightly
1/ FCI was founded in 1961 to take over the management of three existing
public sector plants (SINDRI, Nangal and Trombay) and is the largest
fertilizer and the sixth largest industrial enterprise in India. FACT
was founded in 1947 as a mixed enterprise.
2/ The proportion varies in different States, but it has generally been
between 50% and 70% of production.
3/ Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P205) and potash (K20).



-8-
less rapid--16.1% p.a.--and the level reached in 1973/74 was 1.83 million
tons, while consumption of P205 and K20 was 0.61 and 0.33 million tons
respectively.
3.09      Starting from a low base, fertilizer production also increased
rapidly in the last two decades (by 16% per year) but failed to keep pace
with demand and imports have increased almost twenty-fold from 63,000 tons
of nutrients in 1953/54 to 1,220,000 tons in 1973/74. Production in 1973/
74 was 1.07 million tons of N and 0.39 million tons of P205. All potassic
fertilizers are imported, although some imported K20 is being incorporated
into complex fertilizers made locally. During the last few years, the pro-
nounced growth trends for consumption and production have somewhat lessened
as local plant capacity build-up was delayed, plants already completed failed
to reach expected production levels, foreign exchange for imports was scarce,
and imported fertilizers were increasingly more difficult to obtain or were
available only at rapidly increasing prices. All this has put a very heavy
burden on India's balance of payments.
3.10      Present annual installed capacity to manufacture chemical fer-
tilizers in India is 1.94 million tons of N and 0.57 million tons of P205
(Annex 3-5). Capacity utilization of the nitrogenous fertilizer plants
averaged only 67% in 1973/74, discounting figures for three plants which
had either just started normal production or had not yet overcome initial
production difficulties. - The reasons for this poor showing are many.
Some--mainly power shortages and lack of foreign exchange needed for bal-
ancing equipment and for operations--are not within the responsibility of
present plant management; others--including a good share of the responsi-
bility to keep adequate stocks of spare parts and act forcefully to avoid
delays in reaching stable commercial production--are the result of poor
planninig, bureaucratic inflexibility in day-to-day operations and some
technical shortcomings.
3.11      A great number of demand and consumption projections have been
made in the past, but actual consumption has always fallen short of pre-
dictions.  The latest detailed study was a joint GOI-IBRD report prepared
by li.B. Donde and Dorris Brown in 1971, which, on the basis of actual data
through1 1968/69 forecast N demand to range between 2.4 and 2.9 million
TPY ly 1973/74 and betwieen 4.0 and 5.2 million TPY by 1978/79.  The Draft
Fifthl Plan foresees a consumption of 5.2 million tons of N, 1.8 million
tons of P20 and 1.0 million tons of KI20 in 1978/79. Based on actual data
tLrouglh 1971/74 and recent information supplied by Government officials,
IFFCO and cooperative institutions, and taking into account possible lim-
itations in areas under irrigation, multiple cropping and fertilizer sup-
plies, probable Et consumption projections have been revised downwards (Annex
3-5).  These figures, together with past data, are summarized on the next
page.  The Governmnent is making efforts to narrow the gap between supply and
demand by increasing the output from existing plants and adding new capacity.
Plants under construction or for which financing is being arranged will have
an incremental capacity of 2.9 million tons of N and 0.7 million tons of P205.
Expected production from these plants have been included in the projections
shown below:

Under Indian agricultural conditions, an average nutrient ratio of 4:2:1
for N:P205:K20 is considered desirable. At present this ratio is much
higher in N, namely 5.5:1.8:1, but for the future a gradual improvement is
foreseen. It is clear from the above that India's problem is not one of
a market unable to absorb domestic production, but of ability to supply
an ever-increasing demand.
D.  IFFCO's MIarket Area
3.12      Since the two States which have the largest proportion in IFFCO's
cooperative shareholdings, the Punjab and UP (each with 25%), are also the
largest potential consumers of fertilizers, IFFCO's marketing strategy will
be largely directed towards these two States. IFFCO should, in principle,
supply fertilizers to its cooperative members approximately in proportion
to their equity contribution. However, initially IFFCO plans to sell its
products in predetermined areas of seven States out of the ten with shares
in IFFCO: Punjab, UP, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and
Maharashtra (Map: IBRD 11227). The following analysis of supply and
demand in IFFCO's marlceting area is limited to N fertilizers because



- 10 -
the gap between production and consumption of P 0 is expected to be pro-
portionately wider than that for N in the near Suiure and therefore marketing
of phosphate fertilizer would not present great difficulties. More details
are given in Annex 3-6.

/1   Capacity and production figures refer to the seven states in which
IFFCO's market area extends.
It can be seen that there will be not only an overall supply deficit in
IFFCO's marketing area, but that such deficit is particularly pronounced
in the two States in which the Company's nitrogen fertilizer plants are
going to be located (U.P. and Gujarat). Based on present plans the def-
icit in the area will still persist in 1983/84. At that time probable
consumption there is expected to have increased to about 3.6 million tons
of N as against maximum production of about 3.3 million tons.
E. IFFCO's Marketing Efforts
3.13      IFFCO has pioneered in the promotion of balanced fertilizer
application, suitable farming practices (including proper timing of fertil-
izer application) and prior estimation of adequate dosages according to
soil test results, crops planted, availability of water and other culti-
vation conditions. This promotion has been carried out by IFFCO through-
out ten States by means of "seeding" programs, in the course of which it
has sold in the last three years more than 300,000 tons of fertilizer
through a great number of sales points (some 4,632 at the end of 1972/73).



- 11 -
During these programs IFFCO has sought the cooperation of farmers willing
to buy fertilizers in prescribed quantities 1/ and follow recommended farm-
ing practices in "demonstration" plots.
3.14      To reach effectively as many farmers as possible, IFFCO has
recognized that personnel at the sales points--whether run by the coopera-
tive system, private dealers or public agencies--must be accessible to
IFFCO as well as to the farmers. Therefore the Company has a training
program for staff in credit cooperatives and cooperative banks. This in
turn requires an active in-house training effort for the about 160 em-
ployees in IFFCO's Marketing Division. Since 1970, the Company has had
more than 30 training programs for salesmen, agronomists and marketing
managers. In summary, therefore, IFFCO appears well prepared for the
marketing of its output, and while the private and public sector plants
in its marketing area will offer healthy competition, there is no danger
of supply surpluses within the area.
F. Prices
3.15      Urea and other straight nitrogenous fertilizer prices are sta-
tutorily controlled by the Government. Phosphatic and complex fertilizer
prices are not subject to this control, but all phosphatic fertilizer man-
ufacturers abide by the prices recommended by the Fertilizer Association
of India (FAI), which includes all the major Indian fertilizer manufac-
turers. The retail price for urea, which had been kept within rather
narrow bounds since the mid-sixties has experienced two important in-
creases within the last 12 months as shown below. The Government has
agreed that no actions will be taken precluding efficient fertilizer man-
ufacturers from obtaining revenues enabling them to meet expenses, ser-
vice debt and earn a reasonable return on invested capital. This policy
has been confirmed by the Government during negotiations.

3.16      Part of the increase approved in May 1974 will compensate the manu-
facturers for higher feedstock costs and part will be used to subsidize im-
ports, so as to minimize the Government's losses in importing fertilizer for
which prices have been repidly increasing since last year (Annex 3-7). The
structure of the present urea pricing system as applied to the Phulpur plant
is as follows:
India - Structure of Urea Price
(in Rs/MT)
Price to farmer                                2,000
Deposited with GOI for price equalization        610

Less freight                                      44
Less excise tax                                  166
Net average Phulpur ex-factory price           1,100
Although detailed analyses are not yet available, preliminary indications are
that the benefit/cost ratios justifying generally recommended fertilizer
dosages have not been affected negatively by the recent changes in the prices
of fertilizers and most crops.
IV. THE PHULPUR PROJECT
A.   Project Location
4.01      Bearing in mind that markets and shareholders for the project will
be largely concentrated ia the Punjab and UP, an intensive search for a
suitable location was made in these States by IFFCO. A site close to Phulpur
and near Allahabad (Map: IBRD 11228) was selected and the choice appears to
be an excellent one. A broad-gauge railroad runs by the northern side of
the site and is part of the Allahabad to Jaunpur line. A meter-gauge rail-
road and also the Grand Trunk Road which both connect Allahabad with Varanasi
and other important cities are 15 km to the south. The site's southern
boundary is the Allahabad-Shahganj road. Thus, ability to bring in heavy
equipment, feedstock (heavy fuel oil), coal and labor, as well as to trans-
port the bagged (or bulk) urea is reasonably assured. Furthermore, many of
the marketing areas in northern UP and neighboring States are accessible only
by meter-gauge track. Therefore a substantial amount of urea will be moved
by the meter-gauge network, thus reducing costs of trans-shipment and the
incidence of damaged bags and-material losses. Also, the substantial addi-
tional rail freight load can be shared between the two rail systems.



- 13 -
4.02      The project's external power requirements are not expected to ex-
ceed 3 MVA, or about 20% of needs. Nevertheless, the site is near a 33 KV,
10 MVA power line, which will be enlarged to provide secure emergency supplies
as well as construction needs. The area has good ground water sources and
the proximity of lakes plus the Ganges river provides supplementary supplies
if needed. The topography allows natural drainage and except for heavy equip-
ment no piling is believed necessary. The area is not in a seismic zone and
its meteorological data are given in Annex 4-1. Arrangements have been made
to purchase the required 200 ha or so for the plant site, mostly consisting
of barren rural land. A condition of effectiveness of the Loan is that IFFCO
takes possession of this area. Telephone and telegraph services exist at
Phulpur and telex and airline facilities at Allahabad. Ample labor is avail-
able in the surrounding towns and villages.
B.   Project Scope
4.03      As no major natural gas reserves have yet been found in India and
long-term additional naphtha supplies at prices low enough for fertilizer
production are unlikely to be available, the Government is encouraging the
use of heavy fuel oil as a feedstock for ammonia production, plus coal for
the generation of steam and power. The first plant in India using these
fuels is already under construction at Nangal (FCI) and more installations
of this type are either ready for construction or planned (Sindri, Trombay V,
Delhi Cloth Mills, Bathinda). The proposed Phulpur ammonia unit will closely
resemble the Nangal plant, both as to scope and design.
4.04      IFFCO plans to convert all of the ammonia to be produced at Phulpur
in its 900 TPD (297,000 TPY) ammonia unit into prilled urea, as none will be
needed for other purposes and ample by-product carbon dioxide will be avail-
able from the gas-producing section. The ammonia will be fed to a 1,500 TPD
(495,000 TPY) urea unit, which will add an equivalent of 228,000 TPY of N to
India's fertilizer capacity. At first all of the output will be packed in
plastic lined jute bags to be purchased in the country but, if opportune,
some urea may be bulk-shipped and other types of packaging may be used in the
future. The project will include all necessary offsites such as railroad
sidings, oil and coal storage and handling, ash disposal, water and effluent
treatment, cooling towers, product storage and shipping, maintenance shops,
offices and personnel facilities. The envisaged plant layout is shown in
Annex 4-2.
C.   Feedstocks and Other Needs
4.05      lieavy fuel oil will be brought from existing domestic refineries
(primarily the one at Barauni, some 200 km away), the planned one at Mathura,
in UP south of Delhi (at a distance of about 500 km), or be imported; annual
consumption will be of up to 250,000 tons. Representative chemical and physi-
cal specifications and price data are given in Annex 4-3. The project's annual
coal requirements of about 400,000 tons will be moved by rail from mines in
Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, over a mean distance of some 400 km. Main speci-
fications and typical price data for coal, power and water are shown in



- 14 -
Annex 4-4 and requirements of raw materials, utilities and other needs in
Annex 4-5. Methanol needed for gas purification and chemicals for water
treatment are available from Indian producers, as are jute bags and plastic
liners.
4.06      IFFCO has agreed to enter, by December 31, 1975 into long-term con-
tracts for the provision of the required supplies of heavy fuel-oil, coal and
power. The Government has assured the Bank that arrangements will be made
for the adequate supply of all materials required to operate the project at
full capacity, and promised to send letters, not later than the end of the
present year, to the supplying agencies (Barauni refinery, the UP State
Electricity Board and coal mines). The Government has also agreed to take
all steps necessary to ensure that a sufficient number of railway cars are
available for the transportation of raw materials and products.
D.   Technology
4.07      For ammonia plants using heavy fuel oil feedstocks, experienced
licensors for the fuel oil partial oxidation process are Shell (Holland) and
Texaco (USA). Additionally, purification of the snythesis gas produced from
heavy fuel oil is most efficiently achieved by absorption type processes.
For this project, sulfur and carbon dioxide removal together with carbon
monoxide conversion using the technology offered by Lurgi (F. R. Germany) is
proposed.
4.08      Processes for air separation, nitrogen wash, ammonia and urea syn-
theses are more widely available. Accordingly, invitations on an international
basis are being sent to several major engineering firms who have appropriate
experience in building large ammonia and urea plants in conjunction with the
above licensed technologies. Evaluations and selections will be made on the
basis of technical competence as well as optimum capital and discounted operat-
ing costs, technical preferences, completion times and successful experience.
4.09      The ammonia plant will be a single-train installation using three
partial oxidation units and one air-separation unit. The urea plant will
be of single-train design, using one prill tower. All technology and equip-
ment for these plants as well as for ancillary units and offsites will be of
proven design and construction. The proposed processes are described in
more detail in Annex 4-5 and a material flowsheet is shown in Annex 4-6.
E.   Ecology
4.10      IFFCO has agreed to take all measures necessary to ensure that the
ammonia and urea plants plus their offsites will be designed and operated
according to environmental and safety standards approved by the Bank. About
7,000 TPY of sulfur will be released from the heavy oil feedstock; this will
be recovered as elemental sulfur and sold. Carbon produced in the partial
oxidation units will be continuously collected and used along with coal to
produce steam. Process water contaminated with methanol and other compounds
from the gas purification process as well as by urea plant wash-down water,



- 15 -
will be sent to an effluent-treatment unit prior to disposal. Urea dust from
the prilling tower will be reduced to very low proportions by suitable arres-
tors, to minimize product loss as well as air pollution. Coal ash, amounting
to some .400 TPD will be disposed of in local ravines and some may possibly
be used locally to produce building materials. More details on environmental
protection are given in Annex 4-7.
F.   Employment, Training and Social Aspects
4.11      The project will provide employment for some 600 people, as shown
in Annex 4-8. Many of these will be drawn from the town of Phulpur and
nearby villages. Senior new production and maintenance staff will be given
training in the IFFCO ammonia/urea plant at Kalol and elsewhere, prior to
start-up. They will be supplemented by experienced Kalol people during plant
commissioning and initial production stages. New technicians will be given
training on the site during construction and start-up by IFFCO and contractors'
personnel. The Company has already established an extensive training program
for its personnel at Kandla and Kalol.
4.12      The project will provide other benefits besides an annual addition
of about 230,000 tons of N to India's fertilizer production. It will be a
boon to the Phulpur area by creating many new direct and indirect jobs.
Being a cooperative, IFFCO is very conscious of its social role. It
has in the past, and will continue, to assist local communities and coopera-
tives in many ways and mainly through training in industrial skills, marketing
and improved farming methods. Constructing the project will employ for about
four years some 2,000 skilled and unskilled people drawn from the local area
and other parts of India. In addition, an estimated US$40 million worth of
equipment made by Indian manufacturers is likely to be purchased, provided
delivery times permit it.
G.   Project Execution and Operation
4.13      IFFCO's plants at Kalol and Kandla have been constructed under the
overall management of the Company's project group. Close adherence to
schedules in these projects indicates the IFFCO project team has proven
competent, with the assistance of a few experienced expatriates and in con-
junction with major engineering firms, to manage the construction of a large
fertilizer plant (para. 2.06).
4.14      IFFCO proposes to undertake the Phulpur project with the assistance
of engineering firms, of which two would be foreign having the necessary
experience in urea and in ammonia based on fuel oil feedstock (para. 4.08)
and the others would be Indian firms in charge of design and engineering for
offsites. The engineering firms would be coordinated and managed by a Project
Implementation Unit within IFFCO (Annex 4-9), to be staffed essentially with
the Kalol and Kandla project groups after the start-up of these plants. How-
ever, availability of this personnel could be delayed and, more importantly,
they will have experience in a gas and naphtha-based ammonia plant, but not



- 16 -
in the more complex technology used in fuel oil-based plants. IFFCO has
therefore agreed to engage the services of qualified technical advisors as
soon as IFFCO or the Bank deem such services necessary for the timely and
efficient execution of the project.
4.15      The starting date for the construction of the Phulpur project is
January 1, 1975, when all necessary financial agreements are expected to have
been reached. However, in view of the high costs of any delays in the pre-
sent tight market for fertilizer plant equipment, some advanced contracting
for engineering services and process licensing, and placing orders for some
longlead items of equipment are envisaged. Under these conditions, start-up
by August 1978 is anticipated. This timing will be reviewed with the engin-
eering firms scheduled to be selected in November 1974, who, with IFFCO, will
develop detailed critical path networks covering all aspects of the project.
A preliminary overall schedule is shown in Annex 4-10. To ensure that sched-
ules can be fulfilled, the Government has agreed to process and issue promptly
all import licenses, make available the foreign exchange and allocate locally
produced materials as needed for the execution of the project.
4.16      The selected engineering firms will agree to furnish IFFCO with
complete design and purchasing data within specified periods. Failure to
meet these deadlines will subject the firms to penalty payments. Plant per-
formance guarantees in terms of capacity, product quality, and feedstock
and utility requirements will be obtained from each process licensor and
engineering firm. Inability to meet these guarantees will trigger penalties,
unless effective corrections are made in the field without cost to IFFCO.
It is planned to use experienced Indian contractors to undertake civil
engineering design and construction, under the overall supervision and coordi-
nation of the IFFCO Project Implementation Unit. Plant erection will also
be undertaken by Indian contractors under the supervision of the firms chosen
to supply process and design engineering.  Requirements for the movement of
some heavy equipment are described in Annex 4-11.
4.17      Project operation during commissioning and initial production will
be undertaken by trained Indian staff under the supervision of IFFCO senior
personnel on loan from the Kalol plant working in conjunction with special-
ists from the ammonia and urea plant licensors and engineers. Thereafter,
should it not be possible to build up production as now envisaged or maintain
it, IFFCO has agreed to secure the outside expertise needed to overcome such
operational difficulties. When full-scale production has been attained, plant
operations and management will be integrated within the IFFCO corporate
structure as shown in Annex 4-12.

V. CAPITAL COST ESTIMATE AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Capital Costs
5.01      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$220.5 (Rs 1,655)
million of wlhich US$107.3 (Rs 805) million is foreign exchange. The estimate
is summarized below and shown in detail in Annex 5-1. The estimate is based
on present prices, whicli have been arrived at in consultation withi general
contractors currently building similar factories in India and elsewhere.
Physical contingencies have been estimated at about 10% of the base estimated
project cost. Provisions for price escalation are based on the end-of-1974
cost estimate including phlysical contingencies and projected price escalation
rates of 11'a during 1975 and 7.5%a annually thereafter for equipment and
foreign exchange costs and 10% and 8% respectively for civil works and other
local currency costs. Derivation of the escalation factors is shown in
Annex 5-2.

5.02      The initial working capital is estimated at about US$13.0 (Rs 98)
million, all in local currency (Annex 5-3). The interest during construction
for the project has been estimated at US$26.3 (Rs 197) million in Annex 5-4
and is based on the disbursement schedule shown in Annex 5-5 and a 10-1/4,
interest rate on all loans, i.e. those from the Bank and Industrial Develop-
ment Bank of India (IDBI) as well as the subordinated loan (quasi-equity)
from the Government.
B.   Financing Plan
5.03      The proposed financing plan for the project is as follows:

5.04      The Bank has stressed its support of maintaining the participation
of the cooperative institutions in IFFCO's equity as high as possible. The
Bank has therefore agreed to permit the Government's equity contribution to
be reduced by an amount equal to the Company's internal resources that--al-
though not counted upon in the above financing plan--could be made available
by IFFCO during project implementation provided that all the financial covenants
agreed upon (para. 6.09) are kept. However, since, on the other hand, the
collection of funds from a large number of cooperatives towards their equity
contribution may not proceed in step with the project's requirements, a backup
guarantee has been obtained from the Government to make promptly available to
IFFCO any difference between the expected and the actual equity contribution
made by cooperative institutions.
5.05      The proposed IBRD loan to IFFCO will be guaranteed by the Govern-
ment and is assumed to be for 16 years (starting December 1974) including



- 19 -
5 years of grace at an assumed annual interest rate of 8% plus a 2-1/4%
guarantee fee payable to the Government. The other long-term loans (from
the Government and IDBI) are assumed to be made to IFFCO at 10-1/4% interest
rate and for a term of 15 years including a 5 year grace period, except that
the subordinated loan from the Government will only be repaid -- both as
regards interest and principal -- to the extent that after such payments the
Company can meet a minimum current ratio test, as discussed further below
(paras 6.04 and 6.10). The prompt availability of these loans has been con-
firmed during negotiations. Under these assumptions and considering the
subordinated debt as quasi-equity, the project will be financed 60% by debt
and 40% by equity.
5.06      Should there be any cost overrun on the project and IFFCO be unable
to provide the necessary funds when needed and in a form satisfactory to the
Bank, it will be the responsibility of the Government to make any shortfall
available to IFFCO whether in local or foreign currency.
C.   Procurement and Disbursement
5.07      International competitive bidding procedures in accordance with
Bank Guidelines will be used for equipment and materials estimated to cost
about US$66 million. Proprietary equipment essential to the process and
items in limited supply, which are critical to the timely completion of the
project and which are estimated to cost about US$8 million, may be procured
following bidding from restricted lists of qualified suppliers, with prior
approval of the Bank.  Small items, costing less than US$50,000 equivalent,
with a total estimated cost of about US$2 million, may be purchased from
manufacturers and local representatives of foreign suppliers on the basis
of suitability, availability and price considerations following approval by
the Bank of the list of items involved. A preference of 15% or the customs
duty, whichever is lower, will be allowed to Indian manufacturers for the
purDose of evaluating international competitive bids. Bid evaluation will
be IFFCO's responsibility with the assistance, as required, from the engineering
firms to be contracted (para 4.08). The short-lists of prequalified suppliers
for long-lead items as well as thieir names of engineering firms (para 4.08
and 4.14) and the terms of their contracts will be subject to prior Bank
approval. To expedite deliveries in a tight equipment supply position,
IFFCO will send its own procurement officers to the consultants' or to
potential suppliers' main offices.
5.08      Of the total estimated cost of about US$10n  million for equipment and
materials, it is estimated that, following Bank guidelines, about US$61 million
will be imported and about US$15 million would be won through international com-'
petitive bidding by local suppliers. The balance of about US$25 million would
be procured locally and not financed from the proceeds of the Bank loan.
D.   Allocation and Disbursement of IBRD Loan
5.09      The proceeds of the IBRD loan will cover the estimated cost of
internationally bid equipment and spares, including the estimated value of

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Analysis of the Project
6.01      The financial analysis of the project is based on a projection
extending from the expected start of commercial operations, in September
1978, to the end of 1990. with the plant depreciated over the same period
of abou-t 12 years on a straight line basis (Annex 6-1) and production build-
ing up from 60% capacity utilization through December 1979 to 90% in 1981.
Operating costs and urea sales have been based on estimated end-of-1974
prices escalated through mid-1978 assuming annual domestic inflation rates
of 12% during 1975, 8% during 1976 and 6% afterwards. 1/  As noted earlier,
the Government controls ex-factory and retail prices for urea as well as
the prices for coal and heavy fuel oil. The appraisal assumes that, in line
with a recent general policy decision, confirmed during negotiations, the
Government will allow prices for urea to rise with feedstock, coal and other
costs, leaving prices in real terms unchanged, and leading to 1978 ex-factory
prices of Rs 1,450 (US$193) per ton of urea and Rs 561 (US$75) per ton of
heavy fuel oil.
1/   These rates which yield a compound factor of 1.32 for the period
considered, are consistent with country economic projections.

6.03      The long-term debt service schedule for the project is shown in
Annex 6-3. The project's forecast financial statements through 1990 and
the major assumptions used are contained in Annex 6-4. A summary of the
initial five years (1978-1982) is shown on the following page.
6.04       Forecast financial statements show that, if the project performs
as expected, the results will be satisfactory.  Considering subordinated
debt as equity, debt service coverage 1/ would be at least 1.7, the current
ratio 1.5:1.0 or higher, and the debt:equity ratio, which is projected to be
61:39 at the end of 1978, would rapidly improve thereafter. In fact, the
project would generate enough cash to enable repayment of tile subordinated
debt in 10 years as shown in Annex 6-3, while at the same time maintaining a
total debt service coverage 2/ of not iess than 1.6 (except for the first
few nonths of operation) and meeting all other financial covenants. There-
fore, the financial forecasts indicate that all debt service including that
on subordinated debt can be met by the project.
6.05       The breakeven charts for the project are shown in Annex 6-5.  Except
for the initial months of operations less than 64% and 53% capacity utiliza-
tion are required for the plant to breakeven on a profit and a cash basis
respectively.

B.   Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
6.06      For purposes of calculating the financial rate of return of the
project, capital costs are converted to constant 1978 rupees (Annexes 6-6
and 6-7) and the cost and benefit streams are shown in Annex 6-8. The return
is 10.3%, after taxes or 13.9%1' before taxes. Several factors contribute to
this relatively low return: high capital costs reflecting the sharp price
escalations recently experienced and expected during project implementation
as wzell as the absence of existing infrastructure at the project site; the
need to lengthen the construction period on account of tight equipment
supplies: and tile high income tax rate of 55%, which depresses the after
tax rate of return by about 3.6 percentage points.
6.07      Sensitivitv tests are shonm in Annex 6-9 and summarized below for
the base case ex-factory price of Rs 1,450 (US$193) per ton of urea in 1978
prices, corresponding to a 1974 price of Rs 1,100 per ton (para 3.16).  The
rate of return is also shown for ex-factory prices 10% above and below the
base case price (As 1,595 and 1,305 per ton respectively).  'l'hese prices
are in line wit,] estinated long-term economic prices (para 7.02) and con-
siderably below current world prices.

C.   Consolidated Forecasts for IFFCO
6.08      As mentioned before, the financial forecasts for the project are
more than adequate.  The Bank loan, lhowever, will be made to IFFCO and not
to the Pnulpur Project Unit. IFFCO's existing plants are expected to show
very satisfactory profitability and liquidity by the time the Phulpur plant
begins operations. Therefore, the consolidated income and cash flow pro-
jections for the existing and the new facilities--shown in detail in Annex 6-10
and summarized below--are also very favorable. Debt service coverage (exclud-
ing subordinated debt) will be 2.2 or better and total debt service coverage
(including subordinated debt), at least 1.9.  Since all financial covenants
can be met, the consolidated financial forecasts include annual payments on
both the existing and the new subordinated debt to the Government beginning
in 1977 and 1980 respectively and both are expected to be fully repaid by the
end of 1989.

D.   Financial Covenants
6.09      The estimated consolidated financial position of IFFCO by the time
the project commences commercial operation appears satisfactory. To ensure
that the project, and IFFCO in general, will operate in a financially satis-
factory manner, the following covenants have been agreed upon by IFF0O:
(a)  The project will be operated as a separate profit center
with its own income, cashflow and balance sheet accounts
for control purposes;
(b)  The project entity will maintain a current ratio of at
least 1.5:1.0 and IFFCO will maintain for itself a current
ratio of not less than 1.1:1.0 through December 31, 1976,
and of not less than 1.5:1.0 afterwards;
(c)  Additional investments in fixed assets in excess of US$3
million per year will be subject to prior Bank approval;
(d)  IFFCO will take all necessary actions not to exceed a debt:
equity ratio of 60:40 including the subordinated debt as
equity;
(e)  IFFCO will not incur any additional debt, if by so doing
it could not maintain a debt service coverage of at least
1.4 in any of the succeeding fiscal years;
(f)  No dividend distribution nor debt service payments for
interest, principal or both on the subordinated debt will
be paid by IFFCO unless such payments are covered by current
earnings and subject to maintaining a current ratio of at
least 1.5 after such payments; and
(g)  Completion date for the project will be understood to
mean the date on which the facilities included in the
project have been tested and proven to be satisfactory in
accordance with sound engineering procedures and practices
and have maintained daily production averaging 80% of full
capacity for a period of at least 60 consecutive days.
E.   Major Risks
6.10      The project capital cost estimate includes US$28 million for price
escalation. This provision should be adequate but in the present strong
sellers' market and under unprecedented inflation pressure in India, a price
escalation beyond that provided for cannot be ruled out. The project is
based on a conservative time schedule and the capital cost estimate provides
for project management assistance, which, combined with IFFCO's project
implementation experience, should reduce risks in the project execution and
operation. However, unexpected delays in equipment deliveries from heavily
booked suppliers and inadequate fuel oil and coal supplies could also affect



- 26 -
the project.  On the other hand, the financial position of IFFCO as a whole
is protected by the cash flow of its two existing plants which are now
mechanically complete and are expected to start production in a few weeks.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   World Fertilizer Prices
7.01      During the late 1960's, world fertilizer prices were low because
there was excess supply and investments in fertilizer plants were modest.
Consequently, when demand grew rapidly during 1970-1973, it was not matched
with increased supply and prices have increased sharply, partly due to
scarcity and partly due to increases in hydrocarbon and phosphate rock prices,
the major raw materials for fertilizer production. Freight charges, which
also constitute a major portion of imported fertilizer costs, have also in-
creased. The present worldwide fertilizer shortage and high prices, compounded
by India's continuing foreign exchange scarcity, have made it difficult for
the country to rely on imports to a major extent to meet the growing domestic
demand.
B.   Economic Rate of Return
7.02      The capital costs, production costs and the ex-factory prices of
urea are all expressed in terms of constant 1978 rupees in the economic
analysis. Capital costs are converted to constant 1978 rupees in Annex 6-6.
Except for fuel oil prices, the economic cost of all other production inputs
are based on their financial costs, adjusted for taxes as shown in Annex 7-1.
The economic prices of urea and of fuel oil are derived in Annex 7-2 based on
a recent Bank report 1/ which estimates the fob (Middle East) price of urea
in 1978 at US$145 per ton, bagged. Ocean freight cost and port handling
charges of US$30 per ton and internal freight and handling costs of US$10
per ton are added to the fob price to arrive at the ex-factory economic
price of US$185 per ton. The economic analysis assumes that the 1978-1990
economic price of urea will remain at the 1978 level in terms of constant
1978 dollars. The economic price of fuel oil during the period 1978-1990
is estimated at US$65 per ton, equivalent to an fob price of US$10.9 per
barrel of crude oil, both in constant 1978 dollars, as calculated in Annex
7-2. The economic cost and benefit streams are shown in Annex 7-3.
7.03      The economic rate of return for the project is 16.2%.  Sensitivity
tests (Annex 7-4) are summarized below for the base economic price of US$185
per ton of urea and prices above (US$205) and below (US$165) this base.
The economic return is higher than the financial return mainly due to the
elimination of duties and income taxes (55%).

/1   Capacity utilization:  Initial 16 months - 50%; Year 3 - 60%
Year 4 - 70%; Year 5 - 80%; 90% thereafter.
7.04      The above table indicates that the rate of return is sensitive to
the economic price of urea. A US$20 change in the economic price of urea
causes an opposite change of about 3.4 percentage points in the rate of return.
A 10% cost overrun reduces the return by 1.4-1.8 percentage points, while a
10% variation in the production costs (equivalent to a 24.2% change in the
fuel oil price if all the other production costs are unchanged) yields an
opposite variation of 1.4 percentage points in the rate of return for the
case in which the economic price of urea is assumed to be US$185/ton. Thus,
except for a drastic reduction in the economic price of urea -- which is
unlikely -- the economic rate of return is satisfactory even under moderately
adverse conditions.
C.   Domestic Fertilizer Supply and Food Production
7.05      The project would increase the domestic fertilizer capacity by
495,000 TPY of urea or 228,000 TPY of plant nutrient. Based on a 90%
capacity utilization, the project's output could help increase foodgrain
production in the country by about 1.1 million TPY.
D.   Direct Foreign Exchange Savings
7.06      The project will make it possible for India to avoid importing urea
worth about US$76 million annually. After deducting the foreign exchange
component of the economic production costs, including all fuel oil (Annex
7-1), the gross annual direct foreign exchange savings, based on 90% capacity
utilization, is about US$59.5 million (in 1978 dollars) or about 50% of the
estimated foreign exchange cost (in 1978 dollars) of the project including
interest during construction.
E.   Other Benefits
7.07      The project's market area presently gets a large proportion of
its fertilizer supply from distant factories and, hence considerable cross-
country transport is required. These freight services would be reduced,



- 28 -
thus making the fertilizers more easily available to IFFCO's cooperative
members in addition to contributing to lower transport costs.

ANNEX ]L-1
INDIA - IFFCO FERTILIZER PROJECT
GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THE REPORT
1.        Acgua Ammonia:  Solution of ammonia in water.  Solubility of ammo-
nia in water depends greatly on temperature. At O°C (32°F), solubility is about
900  grams   per liter and only 7.4 g/lt at 1000C (2120F).  Acqua ammonia is
also used as fertilizer by dissolving anhydrous ammonia in irrigation water.
2.        Ammonia or Anhydrous Ammonia:  A compound of nitrogen and hydrogen
(NH3) obtained by synthesis c nitrogen and hydrogen. It is a gas at normal
atmospheric temperature and pressure. It can be liquefied at -33°C (-28°F)
at atmospheric pressure but it can also be liquefied at ordinary temperatures
by application of pressureL For instance at 60°F (15.5°C) a pressure of 107.6
lbs per sq. in. (7.3 kg/cm ) or about 7 atmospheres would be required. Ammonia
is applied as a fertilizer because of its high nutrient content (82% N) but it
requires special expensive equipment for storage, transportation and application
and soils having high temperatures may result in prohibitive losses.
It has no application in India at the present time.
3.        Ammonium Carbamate:  An intermediate product--NH2-CO2-NH2--formed by
reaction of ammonia and carbon dioxide during the synthesis of urea.
4.        Ammonium Chloride:  NH4Cl is obtained as a co-product in the manu-
facture of sodium carbonate and is used as a fertilizer for some crops and
types of soil.
5.        Ammonia Feedstocks are the sources of hydrogen used for ammonia
production. Except for the minor use of hydrogen produced by electrolysing
water, the principal feedstocks are hydrocarbons such as natural gas, naphtha,
heavy fuel oil and coal.
6.        Ammonium Nitrate (AN) or chemically NH4NO3 is produced by reacting
ammonia with nitric acid. Nitric acid (HNO3), in turn, is made from ammonia
ANi ontains 33.5% nitrogen, half in the ammonium form and half in the nitrate form,
and is very hygroscopic. It also is a commercial explosive. In many countries,
a diluent--e.g. limestone--is added to lower the analysis and negate the explo-
sive properties as well as to minimize the hygroscopic properties. Mixed with
small amounts of fuel oil it is known as ANFO explosives used in open pit mining.
7.        Ammonium Sulphate (AS):  Reaction product of ammonia and sulfuric
acid (NH4)2 SO4. It should contain not less than 20.5% N.
8.        Bagged Fertilizer:  Solid fertilizers delivered to the user in bags.
Net weight of the bagged fertilizer is commonly 100 lbs, 50 kg and 100 kg.
/  Fertilizer grade.



ANNEX 1-1
Page 2
Smaller bags are available in some countries for use in lawns, gardens, etc.
Bags are usually made of jute, polyethylene, jute lined with polyethylene,
woven polypropylene and multiple-ply paper.
9.        Bajra:  Millets.
10.       Biuret:  Carbamylurea--NH2CONH2CONH2H20--is an impurity contained
in small amounts in synthetic urea. It is generally kept to a low level
because of its damaging effects on maturing seeds and plant leaves. IFFCO's
urea will contain less than 1% biuret.
11.       Bulk Fertilizer:  Solid or liquid fertilizer sold loosely in tankers,
ship holds, train wagons, trucks or large containers. Anhydrous ammonia is
sometimes transported in refrigerated barges or railroad tanks.
12.       Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) or nitro-lime is a granulated mixture
of calcium nitrate and calcium carbonate, generally containing 25% N.
13.       Chemical Fertilizers:  Manufactured chemical compounds suitable as
fertilizers should be high enough in nutrient content; stable to avoid hazards
and handling problems; water soluble and available to plant root systems. It
is the common practice to report the nutrient content of materials in terms of
percentages of N (nitrogen), P205 (phosphorus pentoxide)l/ and K20 (potassium
oxide)2/. Commercially available materials meeting these requirements to a
large degree are:
Primary Fertilizer Materials
% of N                            % of P205                     % of K20
Nutrient                           Nutrient                      Nutrient
Urea                46%   Triple Superphosphate         46%  Potassium Chloride    61%
Ammonium Nitrate   34%   Single Superphosphate          18%  Potassium Sulfate        54%
Ammonium Sulfate   21%   Diammonium Phosphate            46%
Diammonium Phos-
phate             18%
Because of the high nutrient content of urea, diammonium phosphate and potassium
chloride (KC1), they are some of the most popular fertilizer materials in the
world today.
1/ Normally but incorrectly referred to as phosphoric acid.
2/ Or potash.



ANNEX 1-1
Page 3
14.       Complex or NPK Fertilizers:  All three primary nutrients (N, P205,
K20) are frequently applied to the soil at the same time in ratios varying
with the nutrient requirements of different crops. Complex fertilizers con-
tain at least two chemically combined nutrients. To facilitate handling, the
several required chemicals are usually agglomerated into uniform granules for
distribution. The analysis of each nutrient is given as a ratio to describe
the NPK product. Thus 15-15-15 complex fertilizer contains 15% each of N,
P205, and K20; and 12-24-12 complex fertilizer contains 12% N, 24% P205 and
12% K20.
15.       Crop Yield;  Output of crop in kg or tons per ha. or lbs/acre.
16.       Crore:  10 million.
17.       Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) or chemically (NH4) 2HP04,is produced
by reacting NH3 with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) followed by granulation and drying.
18.       Dosage: Intensity of fertilizer application generally measured in kg/ha
or lbs/acre (nutrient content).
19.       Fertilizer:  The vehicle through which plant nutrients--with the ex-
ception of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen--are added to the soil. It is usual to
distinguish between natural fertilizers (such as compost) and manufactured or
chemical fertilizers. Very often when the term fertilizer is used alone it
refers to the latter.
20.       Godown:  Warehouse.
21.       Granular Fertilizer:  Fertilizer in a granular form, as distinct
from powdered fertilizer which has a tendency to 'bridge' in hoppers and gene-
rally to make bagging and application more difficult.
22.       HYV:  High Yielding Variety.
23.       Jowar:  Sorghum.
24.       Kharif: Season extending from May to October, with sowing in May to
July and harvest in September/October (occasionally continued through November).
25.       Lakh:  100,000.
26.       Linter:  Cotton fibre after ginning.
27.       Mixed Fertilizer:  A fertilizer made by the physical mixing or
blending of two or more fertilizers and generally containing more than one
plant nutrient.
28.       Monsoon:  Heavy rainfall in June/September (generally earlier in the
South and later in the North).



ANNEX 1-1
Page 4
29.       Paddy:  Rice grain before milling.
30.       Partial Oxidation is a method of producing hydrogen from hydrocarbon
fuels of almost any type by a non-catalytic reaction with oxygen followed by
removal of the by-product, carbon monoxide.
31.       Plant Nutrients:  Essential to plant growth are some 17 elements,
six in large and the remainder in small or micro quantities. Carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium comprise the first six; the others
of lesser significance include calcium, magnesium, sulfur, silicon, zinc, iron,
aluminum, manganese, boron, sodium, and copper. Chlorine and cobalt are also
thought essential. Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are readily available from
the atmosphere and water. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium--three main nutrients--
and the other elements are drawn from the soil systems.  Unless supplemented by
regular additions of materials containing the three main nutrients, soil becomes
depleted of fertility by repeated cropping. Use of natural organic materials
such asaiimal and vegetable wastes can be utilized but the scale and intensity
of modern agriculture have far exceeded the availability of natural 'fertilizers'.
Consequently, the majority of the world's primary plant nutrient needs are now
supplied in the form of manufactured or 'chemical' fertilizers. To an increasing
degree, secondary nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and micro nu-
trients such as boron, zinc, copper and manganese are also added to soils along
with the primary nutrients in ratios prescribed by agronomists according to
specific crop and soil needs.
32.    Phosphate Rock:  Rock containing phosphates mainly of calcium in generally
complex forms. Some deposits contain the phosphates as nodules scattered in
sterile gangue. It is used to produce phosphoric acid (H3PO4) as well as super-
phosphates.
33.    Prilled Fertilizer:  Fertilizer in spheroidal particles generally between
1 and 4 mm in diameter.
34.    Rabi:  Season from middle of October to middle of April, with sowing
taking place in October/December and harvesting in February/April (occasionally
extended to May).
35.    Single Superphosphate:  A product obtained by treating phosphate rock
with sulfuric acid and consisting of a mixture of monocalcium phosphate
CaH4(PO4)2, dicalcium phosphate CaHPO4, tricalcium phosphate Ca3(PO4)2, calcium
sulphate and other impurities. Tricalcium phosphate is totally insoluble and
is not included in the P205 content of the superphosphate (16% to 18%).
36.    Triple Superphosphate:  Obtained by reaction of phosphate rock and
phosphoric acid. Since it contains no calcium sulphate, its P205 content
(about 46%) is much higher than in single superphosphate.



ANNEX 1-1
Page 5
37.    Urea is known chemically as carbamide or NH2CONH2-- the normal amide
of carbonic acid; this compound contains about 46% N, all in the ammonium
form. It is considerably less hygroscopic than ammonium nitrate and it is
the most widely used straight nitrogen fertilizer today.
38.     Urea Synthesis:  Urea is made by reacting ammonia with carbon dioxide.
Since both of the materials are produced during the ammonia synthesis, urea
production is usually undertaken alongside an ammonia plant. Unfortunately,
the corresponding acid of carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) does not form stable
ammonium salts as do nitric, sulfuric or phosphoric acids. Therefore, simple
neutralization as used in making ammonium nitrate and sulfate fertilizers is
not possible. Instead, ammonia and carbon dioxide are combined under heat
and pressure to make ammonium carbonate which, although unstable, can be
dehydrated under pressure to form urea, a stable compound. Again, unfortunately,
the overall reaction is reversible and even at 300 atmospheres pressure and
200°C, the conversion to urea in a single pass through the reactor is under
70%. This introduces several complications: high pressure must be used to
maximize conversion; unconverted reactants must be separated and recycled;
increased corrosion under the high temperatures and pressures used must be
overcome, and urea decomposition into undesirable products must be minimized.
In recent years, several engineering and producing companies have developed
ways of surmounting these problems, and large plants capable of producing a
thousand tons per day, or more, of urea to rigid chemical and physical speci-
fications have now been operating successfully for long periods throughout
the world.
39.    Vanaspati: Vegetable shortening.
40.    Zaid Kharif:  Season from August to January.
41.    Zaid Rabi:  From beginning of February to May.

Density
Petroleum and gas axe often sold by volume but material balances
require calculation by weight. Specific gravities are the ratios of the weight
of the substance to the weight of the same volume of water, both measured
generally at either 0OC or 600F. Densities (weights per unit volume) are generally
given in metric or US units. A specific gravity of 1 is equivalent to a density
of 1 MT/m3 or 62.43 lbs/cu.ft.  In the case of gases,densities are usually in
Kg/m3. Since the volume of gases change considerably with temperature and pressure,
they must be specified. Normal conditions are 0°C and 1 atmosphere (1.033 Kg/cm2)
pressure. Standard conditions are 60°F (15.50C) and 1 atmosphere (14.7 lbs/square
inch). The density of air is 1.293 Kg/Nm3 (0.0808 lbs/cu.ft. under normal

ANNEX 2-3
INDIA - IFFCO FERTILIZER PROJECT
SUMMARY OF IFFCO-CFI AGREEMENT
1.        The Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Ltd. (IFFCO) and Coopera-
tive Fertilizers International (CFI) with headquarters in the US entered into
an agreement for technical assistance in connection with the construction and
operation of the Kandla and Kalol fertilizer plants on July 10, 1968, which
was complemented by a letter of understanding on January 27, 1969. The follow-
ing are the main terms of the agreement.
2.        CFI undertook to contribute US$1 million as a grant to assist in
carrying out the Kandla project, disbursable in annual tranches of $100,000
from September 1967 through August 1977.
3.        Deposits of Rs 200,000 in an Indian bank and of US$100,000 in a
US bank were made by IFFCO to constitute imprest accounts. These accounts
were to be increased or decreased quarterly by IFFCO according to estimated
quarterly disbursements presented by CFI.
4.        IFFCO was to pay for CFI expenses related to the project in excess
of the sums contributed by CFI, such expenses to be paid in the currencies in
which they were incurred.
5.        CFI's contribution was to be applied against the cost of maintaining
its US office, its president's salary and other salaries and expenses necessarv
to support the project.
6.        Up to 39 positions in India were to be filled by CFI expatriates at
the plant township with annual basic salaries (applicable to calendar year
1968/69)ranging from $26,000-34,000 for the operations manager and $14,000-
20,000 for the plant superintendents and chief engineer to $9,000-12,000 for
the shift supervisors. Indian income tax on the salaries of expatriate personnel
was to be waived in application of the Income Tax Act of 1961 or paid by IFFCO
either directly or from the rupee imprest account. US social security, work-
men's compensation and any other payroll taxes payable by the employer in the
US or the State of Illinois were to be considered a cost. The salaries were
to be adjusted in future calendar years by the escalation or de-escalation
factor applicable to the Chemical Industry in the US (the agreement and letter
of understanding do not specify the source of the indexes to be used). A 25%
overseas premium, a 10% payment in-lieu of insurance and retirement programs
and a 10% housing and utilities allowance (or a lower sum for suitable
furnished housing and utilities if they could be found) was to be added to the
base salaries. Other benefits included merit increases every two years,
education allowances for children in grades 1-12, home leave every two years,
vacation in India, cost of transportation including household goods, etc.
7.        Job descriptions for the positions to be filled in India by CFI
were attached to the letter of January 27, 1969.

Weighted average 1974 price = Rs 2,200 per ton.
Approximately 0.0264 tons of urea and 0.149 tons of ammonia are trans-
ferred to Kandla from Kalol per ton of NPK produced in Kandla. The
estimated production cost of urea and ammonia, in 1974 prices and
assuming 90% capacity utilization is Rs 640 and Rs 750 per ton, respect-
ively. These transfer prices are not included in the variable production
costs for NPK shown below nor are they included as part of the sales
revenues for the Kalol plant.
j Excess ammonia production not required for urea manufacture is about
0.158 tons of ammonia per ton of urea produced. Most of this ammonia
is transferred to Kandla for NPK production, and the rest sold to
industrial users.

ANNEX 3-1
INDIA - IFFCO FERTILIZER PROJECT
AGRICULTURE IN INDIA AND THE NEED FaR PLANT NUTRIENTS
1.          Sown area in 1969/70, the last year for which information is
available, was 139 million ha of which about 30 million ha was irrigated.
Irrigation was especially important in the Punjab, Tamil Nadu, U.P. and
A.P. Because of multiple cropping in some regions -- and especially in
the States of Punjab, Haryana, U.P., Bihar, Orissa and Kerala -- total
cropped area was 16b million ha (Table 1), of which about 8% was under high
yielding varieties (HYVs). The Punjab is the leading State using these
varieties.
2.          In area, the most important crops in India are rice, wheat,
jowar, bajra, gram and other pulses (leguminous crops), groundnut and other
oilseeds, cotton and sugarcane. A breakdown of crop areas by States is
shown in Table 2.
3.          The yields of the main Indian crops (actual for 1961/62 and
1971/72, estimated for 1973/74 and planned for 1978/79) are shown in Table
3. For the five main foodgrain crops the average yield has increased by
26.7% (2.h% annually), but the yield of other cereals and pulses remained
practically stationary. The growth rate for all foodgrains was 2.1%/year.
There is ample margin for improving average yields in India as compared to
those obtained ir other countries. For example, those for rice, wheat,
maize, millet, augarcane and cotton are all below the world's average (Table
1) and except for wheat in recent years, also below the averages for Asia.
These figures do not take into account accomplishments in specific areas,
such as the growth in average wheat yields in the Punjab (which reached
2,h13 kg/ha in 1971/72), well above the world average of 1,628 kg/ha.
4,.         The Fifth Five-Year Plan 197L-1979 forecasts an increase of 22.8%
(4.2%/yr) in foodgrain output from 114 to ThO million MT1/.  Since the in-
crease in area is expected to be only 6.4% (l.o%/yr), the rise in output
would be largely based on increased productivity, the average yield being
projected to grow from 901 to 1,053 kg/ha (3.2%/yr). This would be substantially
higher rate of improvement than the 2.2%/yr rate registered in 12 years from
1961/62 to 1973/7h. This growth is expected to be specially marked in the
yield of rice (3.h%/yr) in spite of having been only 1.4%/yr in the decade
from 1961/62 through 1971/72.
5.          The area increase projected in the Fifth Plan is largely based on
increased cropping intensity as well as on new irrigation protects and gro8s
irrigated area is expected to rise by 11.2 million ha as compared to 7.0    2/
million ha in the Fourth Plan. According to the latest country Bank Report,-
the Draft Fifth Plan assumptions, however, seem optimistic and 7 to 8 million
ha is given as a figure more likely to be attained by 1978/79. In what
1/ But actual 1973/7h output is estimated at about 104 to 108 million MT.

ANNEX 3-1
Page 2
follows crop production and fertilizer consumption forecaots are based on
the Economic Report's estimates of cropped area increases of 5 million ha
in food grains and 3 million ha in other crops, i.e., 77% and 68%
respectively of the Fifth Plan'B figures. Estimated 1973/74 foodgrain crop
has also been scaled down from the Fifth Plan base of 114 to about l0o
million MT.
6.          During the Fourth Plan, area under HYVs grew from 9.2 to 25.0
million ha and it has been estimated that by 1971/72 more than 30% (33
million MT) of foodgrain was from HYVa. However, yield increases are
dependent not only on the introduction of HYVs, but also on the appropriate
management of water supplies, use of fertilizers and plant protection
agents (insecticides, herbicides, etc.), time and form of application of
fertilizers and other inputs, use of tractors, availability of fuel and
electric power, avoidance of losses during harvesting and collection of
crops, etc. UNIDO has pointed out that use of pesticides in India and
Africa in 1963 was considerably lower than in other countries and regions
and that yields were also lower.1/ Thus use of pesticides in that year
was 0.15 kg/ha in India, 1.5 kg/ha in the US, and 10.8 kgAha in Japan.
Corresponding average crop yields were 820, 2,600 and 5,h80 kg/ha
respectively. More recent figures on pesticide consumption in various
countries are shown in Table 5.
7.          All the nutrients, except carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, 'wich
are largely removed from the air and water, are drawn from the soil._   A
calculation of the weight of nutrients contained in harvests is not,
however, a good indication of the amount of fertilizer needed in a given
cultivated field. Considerable amounts of nutrients may be lost through
erosion, leaching and denitrification. On the other hand, nutrients are
also supplied by manure, unharvested portions of crops and dissolved in
rainfall. Meaningful recomendations on dosages can be made only on the
basis of the chemical and physical structure of the soil, crop requirements,
forms of cultivation, weather patterns, use of neighboring land, etc.and
crop/input price relationships. However, actual average dosages are
generally well below the optimum.

INDIA - IFFCGC FERTILIZER PROJECT
THE AGRICULTURAL COCPERATIVE iYSTEI4 IN INDIA
A.   Introduction
1.        Tne coonerative movement in India began in 1,904, when the Cooperative
Credit Societies Act was enacted.  However, almost half a century later, the
Rural Credit SurveJ' of 1S52 showed that credits extended through cooperatives
accounted for only 3-;6 oe the funds borrowed by Indian farmers.
2.        Under the Constitution, cooperati,e societies are broadly considered
to be subject to control by the State Government (and eligible for State pro-
motion).  The  ational Government, however, has actively promoted the cooperative
movement through direct budgetary support (increasing from Rs 54  nillion in the
First Five-Year Plan to Rs 2,580 million in the Fourth Five-Year Plan')  not
including indirect financing through Departmental Budgets (such as by the Reserve
Bank of India for their initial equity participation in cooperative credit
institutions, etc.). To deal with cooperatives whose activities extend over
more than one State, the Union enacted the Multi-Unit Cooperative Societies Act
in 1 )l`2.  The National Cooperative Development Corporation was set up by the
GovernmeLit of India in 1963 as a successor to the National Cooperative Develop-
ment and Warehousing Board which had been established in 1956.
3.        Historically, short and meditm-term credit has been the basic acti-iy-
of the cooperative movement in India.  But, it has extended its field of action
to other aspects of the agricultural sector: granting long-term credits for lana
imDrovement; aiding crop storage and marketing; purchasing of seed, fe^tilizers
and pesticides; servicing and repairing of tractors and other agricultural
equipment; processing crops (malnly by cooperative siugar and rice mills, cotton
ginneries, and oil extraction plants, etc.); constructing irrigation works and
promoting rural electrification; and, cooperative farming.  The total number oi
cooneratives in the agriculturql sector was estimated at 330_1,00 in 1969 w-ith
5 million members.  Their total equity was Rs 6.7 ,billion and tr.ey had is  6.2.
Oiio in working caoital.  The relationships between the different cooperanive
units in the agricultural sector are snown in Annex 3_3.
0.        In India about 456' of ON? has its origin in the agricultural sector
and 80' of her population is rural.  With about iib million operao4ve lanl-
holdings having an area of less th-.an 5 acres (2 ha) each ('able 1).  Distribu-
tion of inputs required for the application of modern farming methods ano
marketing the crops are formidable tasks, and the failure or success cf the
agricultural cooperatives has a special significance.
1/  Rs L,230 million have been allocated to the promoition and develcOpment
oft the cooperative system in the Fifth Five-Year Plan, of whichn ds 2bc
million would be supplied by the State Governments.

B.   Agricultural Credit
Institutional Sources of Agricultural Credit
5.        The institutional sources of financing for agricultural activities
(commercial banks, agricultural credit cooperatives, the Agricultural Refinance
Corporation etc.) have increased their share of total agricultural financing
from 7.3% in 1952, when an all India Rural Credit Survey was carried out, to an
estimated 39% in 19691/ but they are still overshadowed by non-institutional
sources: money lenders, family loans, traders, big landholders, etc.
Commercial Banks
6.        The State Bank of India (SBI), 14 commercial banks nationalized in
1969 and some non-nationalized commercial banks have rapidly increased their
operations in the agricultural sector, total number of loans in the year ending
December 1971 having reached 1.2 million, for Rs 3,955 million, of which
Rs 2,633 million were in direct loans to agriculture, and the balance in
indirect loans mainly to electrify well pumps, buy fertilizers and finance other
agricultural inputs. In 1969, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) started a program,
the "Lead Bank Scheme", according to which districts are allotted to one of the
commercial banks, the "lead" bank, which is responsible for surveying the district's
agricultural potential, implementing progressive development plans and coordinat-
ing the provision of credits for the supply of farm inputs and services. By
March 1972, 336 districts had been allotted and the surveys of 260 had been
completed and as a result, about 3,000 villages had been "adopted" by commercial
banks, which are supposed to meet the  credit needs of farmers as
well as of persons engaged in other activities.  The State Bank of India has
also instituted an Intensive Center Scheme designed--in consultation with the
State Governments--to develop some backward areas. In these areas, the SBI will
establish agricultural development branches. Up to March 1974, 150 such branches
had been set up.
The Agricultural Re-Finance Corporation
7.        The Agricultural Re-Finance Corporation (ARC) was founded in 1963
primarily to refinance promotion and development loans extended by institutions
which are shareholders of ARC: commercial banks, State cooperative banks and
central development banks. Exceptionally it can also finance other institutions.
Through 1972, the ARC has approved 788 operations (related mainly to small
irrigation projects, horticulture and land development and/or reclamati-on)
involving a total financing of Rs 3,917 million (Rs 1,365 million outstanding).!
The ARC has helped commercial banks to identify agricultural developrnlent plans
for centers allotted to them as "lead banks" and prepare the corresponding reports.
/ Most of this--33%--was in credits extended by cooperatives
(from: "Availability and Disbursements of Cooperative Credit for
Fertilizers", paper presented by Mr K. S. Bawa at FAI on April 16, 1974L).
/ IDA Credits have also been channelled through ARC for on-lending
to individual borrowers.



ANNEX 3-2

Agro-Industries Corporations have been formed with equal equity participation
by the Central and State Governments in 11 states (among them Punjab and UP)
to finance through medium and long-term credits the rent-purchase of agri-
cultural equipment (mainly tractors, pumps and power cultivators) and other
undertakings to modernize farming. The UP Agro-Industry Corporation has also
undertaken distribution of fertilizers.
8.        As a result of recommendations of the All India Rural Credit Review
Committee, the GOI established two schemes: the Small Farmers Development
Agency (SFDA) and the Agency for the Development of Marginal Farmers and Agri-
cultural Labor (MFAL) to ensure that credit under liberal conditions is avail-
able to small and marginal farmers and to agricultural labor. These schemes
are under implementation in a small number of districts (the SFDA in 46 and the
MFAL in 41 districts as of March 1973). They are expected to extend considerab:Ly
their reach during the Draft Fifth Five-Year Plan (by 1978/79 they are planned
to cover 160 districts).
Fertilizer Credit
9.        Loans to dealers and cooperatives for the procurement, storage and
distribution of fertilizers are known as "commercial credits", while those to
farmers for the purchase of fertilizers are known as "production credits".
Until 1966, the GOI had supplied pool fertilizers to the State Governments on
18-month terms and at low interest rates. At present only 60 days of interest-
free credit is allowed. The RBI refinanced during three years commercial bank
credits to agriculture at 4-1/2% annual interest rate and did not consider loans
outstanding in their sector in the calculation of the banks' reserve require-
ments. At present, these facilities have been withdrawn. The rate on the
commercial banks' loans for fertilizers is now 10-11% per annum and the margin
(without collateral) is 20-25%. The Credit Guarantee Corporation qf India
insures repayment of credits extended by small fertilizer dealersi/ to farmers.
The maximum liability is 75% of the amount lost in each transaction or Rs 75,000,
whichever is lower.
10.       Production credits are extended mainly by Cooperatives, commercial
banks and directly by State Governments (t'Taqavi"l loans). The present policy
is to slowly phase out the latter.  Farmers who are not members of cooperatives
are being encouraged to become members and some State Governments have provided
loans to individuals to enable them to buy their share in some types of
cooperative societies. Commercial banks have extended commercial credits to
fertilizer dealers covering up to 80% of the farmers' IOUs" endorsed to the bank.
However, collateral security and/or third party guarantees are also required by the
Banks.
Fifth Five-Year Plan
11.       The Draft Fifth Five-Year Plan  covering  the
period from 1974/75 to 1978/79 envisages that total institutional agricultural
credits during this period will amount to Rs 41,000 million. Cooperatives are
expected to channel more than three quarters of this amount:
j With a turnover o-f less than Rs 0.5 million.

C.  Agricultural Credit Cooperatives
Primary Credit Cooperatives
12.       The primary Cooperative Credit Societies (or, in some cases, Primary
Multi-Purpose Cooperative Societies) at the village level form the backbone of
the cooperative system in India, channelling the bulk of short and medium-term
financing extended by cooperative societies. Loans authorized by the credit
cooperatives amounted to Rs 6,014 million in 1971/72 compared to Rs 2,027 million
in 1960/61 (Table 2). The All India Rural Debt and Investment Survey of 1961/62
disclosed that farmers holding each more than 10 ha.of land and having assets
over Rs 20,000 had received, on the average, credits per ha. amounting to double
those extended to farmers holding between one and two ha. (and assets between
Rs 2,500 and 5,000) and four times the credits received by farmers in the lowest
rung of the land-holding ladder.
13.       The Draft Fifth Five-Year Plan recognizes that "overdues constitute
the most formidable problem facing the cooperative credit institutionsl. Over-
due loans have increased rapidly since the middle sixties, both in absolute
volume and in relationship to volume of operations. The present dangerously
high level is undoubtedly partly due to farmerst inability to pay after being
struck by floods and droughts, but it is gen irally admitted that slackness in
recovery of loans has also been widespread.1  Disbursement of credits largely
in kind and linkage of credit with marketing of produce are the most important
measures to curtail the overdues problem. The Working Group on Cooperation has
suggested among others the following guidelines for improved liquidity of the
cooperative credit system:
a) Giving first priority in allocating credits to farmers who
have repaid their previous loans from crop sale proceeds.
b) Recovering credits outstanding through marketing cooperatives
in those cases where purchase of inputs is made through them.
c) Using 40;0 to 50s of proceeds from crop sales made through Union
or State Government agencies to repay cooperative credits to farmers.
14.       Other weaknesses observed in the operation of primary credit
cooperatives are:
1/ National Cooperative Union of India, Cooperation in Independent
India, page 26.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 
a) Cumbersome procedures for processing of loans and delays in
disbursing same.1/
b) Regional imbalances, four States (Gujarat, Punjab, IMaharashtra
and Tamil Nadu) accounting for over 60% of all the short and
medium-term credits extended by the cooperatives.
c) Insufficient storage space in many cooperative societies.
d) Lack of professional management, full-time employees and proper
accounting systems.
e) Predominance of borrowers in the management of cooperatives or
large borrowings and high level of overdue loans in the hands
of cooperative directors.
f) Interference by political figures with cooperatives credit
policies or recovery of loans.
g) Inexistent or, at best, marginal incentives for most members
to operate through their cooperatives.
h) Low priority given to fertilizer procurement, storage and
financing and delays in decisions concerning them.
i) Inadequate training for cooperative staff.
j) Excessive reliance on collateral and not enough on past
performance by the borrowers../
15.       A large number of primary cooperatives are not viable and many have
been inactive for years.2   Action is being taken to strengthen the primary
cooperative societies. Coercive measures against defaulting farmers is pursued
in some cases, while in others, short-term loans which remain unpaid due to
uncontrollable factors are being transformed into medium-term loans. The merging
of existing units, the extension of the area of operation of some, and the
liquidation of inactive ones, has permitted to reduce the number of primary
cooperatives by about 25% from 212,000 in 1960/61 to 159,000 in 1971/72, and
it is estimated to have dropped further through June 1974 to 155,000.
j It has been estimated that only 36% of cooperative members received
cooperative credits in 1971/72.
j For instance, the Draft Fifth Five-Year Plan states that "for small and
marginal farmers.... the share capital required to be held by them will
be reduced and will be allowed to pay the reduced amount... in convenient
installments". However, a little later, the same document says that "he
(the borrower) may be asked to provide collateral tangible security in the
form of gold or silver ornaments (frequently a bride's only possession)
sufficient to cover the loan with the prescribed margin".
3/ According to a study by the RBI, approximately 21,000 societies were
dormant and 63,000 had operated at a loss in 1971/72.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 6
The total number of members has, at the same time, grown considerably, reaching
about 35 million at present, and the average number of members per cooperative
has also increased as shown in Table 2. The size of the average loan authorized
per member has increased from Rs 119 in 1960/61 to an estimated Rs 250 per
member by March 1974./ Taking into account the loss of purchasing power,
however, the average loans outstanding per cooperative member has, in fact,
decreased by 13% in real terms.3/
Central Cooperative Banks
16.       Short and medium-term credit to the primary credit cooperatives is
extended mainly through central cooperative banks or its branches.  The number
of these banks was 505 in 1960/61 and had been cut down to 342 in 1971/72 with
a total share capital of Rs 1,568 million (of which 31% is owned by State
Governments and the balance by cooperative societies).  The banks had deposits
of Rs 5,029 million (as of June 1972) and had extended loans amounting to
as 11,095 million ('Table 3).  The bulk of other operating funds is raised
through borrowing from the State Cooperative/"lApex" Banks. Some of the Central
Cooperative Banks are financially and institutionally weak and loans overdue
have increased from 12% of loans outstanding in 1961 to 36% in 1972. A Govern-
ment of India program is trying to rehabilitate 54 of these banks and RBI is
providing funds to strengthen their equity structure.
Apex Banks
17.       On June 30, 1972, there were 25 Apex or State Cooperative Banks with
a share capital of Rs 456 million (about one third provided by State Governments
and the balance by Central Cooperative Banks and other State and regional
cooperati-ve societies). Total financing supplied by the Apex Banks amounted to
nearly Rs 10,000 million in 1971/72 (Table 4). Share capital and reserves were
supplemented by deposits (mainly from the Central Cooperative Banks) and borrcw-
ings from RBI. Loans overdue amount to a relatively acceptable 7% of total
loans outstanding.
Land Development Banks
18.       Long-term credit to farmers is channelled mainly through the Land
Development Banks. In some States there is a two-tier system with one State
Land Development Bank at the too and several Primary Land Development Banks
at the relending level, while in other States--among them Gujarat and UP--
loans are extended to individuals through branches of the State Land Develop-
ment Bank. The Land Development Banks finance their operations mainly by
issuing debentuires placed with RBI, SBI, Commercial Banks, State Cooperative
Banks, Life Insurance Corporations and the State Governments. Some operations
are refinanced through ARC. Total loans outstanding with individual farmers
were As 7,082 million on June 30, 1972, and 8,973 million in March 197's.
1/ GOT Draft Fifth Five-Year Plan.
2/ No detailed information on the number of borrowers is available,
but it is estimated that this number has decreased by about one third,
and therefore the average loan per borrower has probably increased in
real terms.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 7
Overdue loans on June 30, 1971 amounted to Rs 111 million,less than 2% of
total loans outstanding (Table 5).J/ Although more recent figures are not
available, it is thought that the proportion has increased after that year.
Cooperative Credit in IFFCO's Market Area
19.       Share capital of Apex Banks in the seven States comprising IFFCO's
market areai amounted to 64% of the total for India (Table 6). The propor-
tion for loans outstanding, which stood at 68% in 1970/71 dropped to 605% in
1973/74 and is expected to drop further through the implementation of the
current Five-Year Plan as a consequence of efforts to strengthen the coopera-
tive movement in States lagging behind, but even by 1978/79, the seven States
in IFFCO's area are projected to account for more than 62% of total loans out-
standing. Loans overdue in the seven States (2.8%) are considerably lower
than the average for India (6.7%) but the figure for UP is higher (Table 6).
20.       In the case of Central Cooperative Banks, the share of the seven
States in the share capital and the total loans outstanding stand at 65% and
53% respectively. The relatively lower figure for the latter differs con-
siderably from the share of loans authorized by the Banks in those States
(70% of the total for India), which may indicate difficulties in disbursement
of the loans. The level of overdue loans (41.6%) is higher than the average
for India. This situation is particularly worrisome in Punjab and Maharashtra,
where overdue loans amount to more than 5O% of the outstanding loans (Table 7).
21.       In 1972, the Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperatives in the seven
States comprising IFFCO's market area had 68% of the total share capital ~ald
had extended 67% of the loans outstanding for all of India. The latter figure
was expected to drop to 62% by the end of the current Five-Year Plan (1979).
The loans overdue in these seven States amounted to 44h% of the loans outstanc.
in 1972, the same as the overall Indian average (Table 8).  Specially high wele
the overdue levels for Rajasthan, UP, Haryana and Punjab, which were all abov_
50$ in the same year.
22.       Ordinary long-term loans extended by Land Development Banks in the
seven States mentioned above amounted to Rs 669 million in 1971/72 or 55% of
India's total (Table 9).  The Fifth Five-Year Plan anticipates this sun will
increase to Rs 795 million by 1979 (and slightly lesser proportion--53%--of
the total for India--Rs 1,500 million).
D.  Agricultural Marketing Cooperatives
Primary Marketing Cooperatives
23.       The kingpin of the marketing and input supply activities in the
cooperative movement is the Primary Marketing Society. As of June 1972, ther e
j   But 23% of estimated demand.

ANNEX 3-2
Page 8
were 3,2h0 Primary Marketing Societies, of which 2,675 were general purpose
societies covering a given territory (generally at marketing points) and the
rest were cooperative societies for the marketing of special commodities
(mainly cotton, sugarcane, tobacco, fruit and vegetables, etc.). Members of
the Primary Marketing Societies are 133,000 Primary Agricultural Credit
Societies, 8,400 other cooperative societies and 2,570,000 individual farmers.
State Governments also participate in the capital of 2,546 marketing societies.
In 1971, the GOI approved a scheme to strengthen 400 selected marketing coopera-
tives and State Governments with the help of the National Cooperative Develop-
ment Corp. (NCDC), have helped others. In 1U72/73, 25 weak operatives in West
Bengal were liquidated.
24.       The value of agricultural products handled by the cooperatives in
1971/72 was Rs 8,437 million, 30% higher than in the previous year (Table 10)
and it is estimated to have reached Rs 10,915 million in 1973/74. The main
nroducts marketed by the cooperative societies are food grains and sugarcane.
Four States--Punjab, Maharashtra, UP and Gujarat--are by far, more active in
this field than all the others, accounting for about three quarters of the
total value marketed by the cooperative in all of India (Table 11). This share
is expected to be reduced but by 1978/79, the Draft Fifth Five-Year Plan fore-
sees it will still be about two thirds of the total.
25.       At the end of June 1971, 2,371 marketing cooperatives (73% of the
total) had managerial personnel of their own and many cooperatives
had managers on loan from other organizations. The NCDC, through the State
Governments,is subsidizing the cost of training key personnel for marketing and
processing cooperatives, as well as the establishment of Technical and Prom  ioWJi
Personnel fools at the Apex Cooperative Societies. Lack of managerial capacity,
however, is still an important constraint in the ePfectiveness of the cooperative
marketing system and allied activities, including their role in the distributic
of fertilizers.
District Marketing Cooperative Societies
26.       As of June 1972 there were 362 district marketing societies of which
148 were general purpose marketing cooperatives and the rest special purpose
cooperatives (such as sugarcane supply societies feeding cooperative sugar mills).
Less than 20% of the district marketing societies were engaged in actual crop
marketing operations; the others confined their activities to distribution of
agricultural inputs and consumer goods. NCDC has been trying to divert district
or regional cooperatives from direct marketing functions which it deems are the
province of primary marketing cooperatives. On June 30, 1972, total equity in
district marketing cooperatives was is 208 million; share capital was only Rs 76
million, of which about one third was contributed by the State Governments.
Apex Marketing Cooperative Federations
27.       The 21 general purpose State or Apex Marketing Cooperative Federations
had on June 30, 1971 a membership of 2,100 primary marketing cooperatives, 1,360
primary agricultural credit cooperatives and 2,037 other cooperative societies.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 9
Total equity of the Apex Marketing Cooperative Federations was at that time
Rs 300 million; share capital was Rs 158 million, of which public sector
contributions amounted to Rs 141 million. There were also six special
commodity State Federations: 2 for fruits, 2 for vegetables and other commo-
dities, one for sugarcane (UP), and one for cotton.
Cooperative Distribution of Inputs
28.       In 1971/72, the number of cooperative retail depots in operation
was more than 38,000 and 53% of them were located in the seven States comprising
IFFCO1s market area (Table 12). The retail value of fertilizers distributed by
the cooperatives amounted to Rs 3,220 million in 1972/73, 12% higher than in the
previous year and 29% higher than in 1970/71. Total value of other agricultura:l
inputs (seeds, pesticides and agricultural implements) amounted to Rs 770 million
in 1971/72 (Table 13). NCDC's policy in the purchase and distribution of
fertilizers and other inputs is to assign to the State Cooperative Federationsj/
the role of wholesalers, to the primary marketing cooperatives that of sub-
wholesalers, and leaving the retail sale of fertilizers mainly to the primary
agricultural credit societies.  At present, about 50,000 primary credit coopera-
tives are engaged in the sale of fertilizers handling approximately one half of
the fertilizers sold by the cooperative system to individual farmer members
(Table 14).
E.   Cooperative Processing of Farm Products
Cooperative Processing Units
29.       Processing units in the cooperative movement fall into one of two
categories: units established as parts of regular marketing cooperatives and
units based on independent processing cooperatives. The latter group includes
542 large units such as sugar mills, oil solvent extraction plants and cotton
spinning mills. Small units, such as rice mills, oil presses and jute baling
units, and medium-sized units such as ginneries and cotton presses
are generally associated to marketing cooperatives. In March 1973
there were about 1,250 of these units. The most important processing coopera-
tives are in rice milling, manufacture of sugar, cotton spinning and vegetable
oil extraction (Table 15).
Sugar Milling
30.       Sugar milling is one activity in which cooperative processing has
become widespread, their sugarcane crushing capacity accounting for 48.5% of
the total capacity in India. The volume of cane crushed in cooperative mills
in 1972/73 was 12.5 million tons and sugar production was 1,262,000 tons
(about 38% of the country's total).
1/ In two States (Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra) there are two district level
marketing cooperative federations also acting as wholesalers.

1/ October 1971/September 1972 season figure.
31.       Membership in the cooperative sugar mills in 1973 was 653,ooo, 89%
of which were sugarcane growers. Total equity as of June 1972 was Rs 1,582
million, as h9L million having been contributed by members and the balance by
the State Governments. The Industrial Finance Corporation (and to a lesser
degree the Life Insurance Corporation) have provided the bulk of the long-term
funding needed by the sugar cooperatives; their loans outstanding with IFC and
LIC amounted to Rs 416 and 63 million respectively on March 31, 1973. Loans
for working capital have been supplied mainly by SBI and the Apex Cooperative
Banks. Only five cooperatives have defaulted, and two are thought to be in
serious difficulties because of inadequate cane supplies. The largest share of
cooperative sugar processing capacity is located in Maharashtra.
Cotton Marketing, Ginning and Spinning
32.       Agricultural marketing cooperatives purchased as 2,432 million of
seed cotton in 1972/73. This figure is considerably above the previous year's
one of Rs 980 million because the Government of Maharashtra introduced a mo.o-
poly system and appointed the Apex Iiarketing Federation as exclusive ageit.
Purchases by the Federation amounted to Rs 1,335 million in 1972/73.  Ths C.+c
Corporation of India also entered the cotton market purchasing mostly through
marketing cooperatives,387,030 bales of cotton valued at Rs 447 million. How-
ever, the cooperative system as a whole purchased only a modest fraction of the
total crop estimated at over 15 million bales of seed cotton in 1972/73.
33.       By March 1973, there were 235 cooperative cotton ginning and pressing
units of which 208 were operational.  Most belonged to Marketing Cooperatives
or Federations but some were organized as separate cooperatives. During 1971/72
the cooperatives ginned 3,190,000 quintals of seed cotton and pressed 860,000
bales, an increase in volume of more than 10% over operations in the previous
year. Most of the cotton ginneries are in Gujarat (e2) and Maharashtra (74).
34.       Spinning mills are organized as separate cooperatives.  Besides
spinning mills belonging to weavers, cooperatives there were 21 cooperative
spinning mills by the end of the 1972/73 fiscal year.  1L of the mills are
located in Maharashtra.  The members of these cooperatives were individual

cotton growers (123,000) and Primary Credit Cooperatives (12,622). Total share
capital as of March 1972 was Rs 137 million of which Rs 88 million was contri-
buted by State Governments. Licensed mills had a total number of about 400,000
spindles (most had 12,000 spindle units each).  INCDC, with the approval of GOI,
has embarked on a program to expand existing installations to a minimum 25,000-
spindle size.
Rice Milling
35.       Although there were 745 organized rice mills by March 1973, of which
690 were installed, there are difficulties arising mainly from management
deficiencies and lack of working capital. During the 1972/73 season, 52 rice
mills were discontinued and only 6 pilot modern mills were organized. NCDC
requested the State Governments to obtain operating figures from rice mills in
their respective States. Answers from only 278 mills were received, and they
were discouraging   14% of the mills answering the survey were not operating
because of lack of paddy, 23% operated at below 20% capacity and 13% at between
25% and 50% capacity. The main reason given for the situation was the establish-
ment of levies on the rice-millers to supply the State Governments. These levies
ranged between 50% and 90% of the paddy crop in the main rice producing States.
The cooperatives did not feel they could risk buying paddy at higher prices in
the open market and later being forced to sell milled rice to the State Govern-
ments at prices below cost. NCDC has taken up this problem with the Goits
Department of Food and the Agriculture Prices Commission. Some measures were
suggested. One would allow mill cooperatives to export rice milled from free
market paddy to deficit States on a cooperative-to-cooperative basis. In Andhra
Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, the Marketing Federations were appointed by the State
Governments as their agents to collect rice from the cooperatives and distribute
it directly to retailers, so that the distribution margins could be used to off-
set the mills' losses. The effect of these measures during 1972/73 is difficult
to assess because of the general short out-turn of rice due to droughts. Another
handicap for the rice mills was lack of financing to purchase paddy. To overcome
partially this problem, NCDC authorized working capital credits of about Rs 10
million to five State Governments earmarked for margin financing of crop
purchases by cooperatives.
36.       During the 1972/73 year, the modernization of 54 mills was scheduled.
However, some doubts on whether modern parboiling and drying processes
can compete with conventional methods have been voiced.  NCDC appointed a
commission to study this problem and recommend measures to improve the situation
of modern mills. The results of the study have not yet been published.

F.   Other Cooperative Activities
Fertilizer Production and Mixing
37.        There were 18 granular fertilizer mixirg plants owned by cooperabives
by the end of 1972/73, with an investment estimated at Rs 40 million, and a
total capacity of about 750,000 tons annually.  For other units being- Plannei,
a minimurm investment of Rs 5 million each has been decided upon by NCDC, of'
which 20-30/a would be put up by the cooperatives and the balance advanced by
N4CDC. The Maharashtra Cooperative Fertilisers and Whemicals Ltd., is planning
to establish a 200 ton/day ammonia plant and plants for the production of
ammonium chloride and soda ash using naphtha and common salt as raw materials.
This project is sponsored by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank, and the
GOI issued a letter of intent, but there are no great probabilities of its
bein- carried out. The Indian Farmers fertiliser Cooperative Ltd. was founded
on November 3, 1967, by the cooperatives of ton States, sponsored by NCDC and
the National Federation of Marketing Cooperatives and actively supported by the
Department of Cooperatives in the Ministry of Agriculture.
Farming
38.        There is a coo-oerative farming movement comprising two types of
organizations: collective farming societies, in which l.and is owned corrmonly,
and joint farming societies in which coonerative members retain ownershin of
their plots, but share in the work expenses and crops. As of -§une 157C0, there
were 5,199 joint farming societies with 123,000 members and 3,520 collective
farming societies with 118,000 members. The area covered by the farming
cooperatives was 287,000 ha under Joint farming and 186,000 h.a under collec-
tive farming. Many of the cooperative farming societies are weak or dormant.
iural Electrification
3°.       There are five rural electrification coopDeratives-one each in the
States ot' Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, fKaharashtra and UP--covering 468
villages and enrolling 33,721 members as of September 30, 1973.  These coopera-
tives sumply electric power to 2n,500 pumps and 32,930 other outlets.
40.      zStorage for farm oroducts and inouts is  supplied by the Food Coroora-
+-on of India, the Agricultural CGOreratives. the Central and State Warenouse
Corooration and directly  by some State 3over'nment.s.  Storage capac_ty in
co~o-erat-ive-o{red "godowns" grew from  -. ! _i lion tons in 1961 to 2.6 million
in 197,0) and an estilated 3.8 million tons -  1 '4.  T-is capacitv  is expected
to almost double by the end of the Fifth Five-Year Plan:

Approximately 70-80g of present and projected capacity in cooperative units is
used and will be required to store fertilizers.  More than 57% of the estimated
1974 capacity is located in the seven States comprising IFFCO's market area.
41.       About 25,000 Primary Credi.t and 1,500 Marketing Cooneratives have
also entered the retail distribution of some consumer items, such as matches,
kerosene, sugar, salt, vanaspati, tea, cotton cloth, etc. In 1971/72, the
value of goods thus sold was Rs 1,800 million.
42.       A fairly new field for the cooperative movement is the installation
and operation of cold storage units.  18 new units were organized in 1Q72/73
(of which 13 were located in UP) bringing the total number of units organized
in the country to 128 (48 of them in UP). Total capacity actually installed
was 115,650 tons more than one half located in UP and Punjab (Table 15).

ANNEX 3-
INDIA - IFFCO FERTILIZER PROJECT
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE FERTILIZER MARKET
A. Consumption
1.          Consumption of nitrogenous fertilizers in India has grown in the
last 20 years at a rate of 16.1% annually (Table 1) which is higher than the
worldwide trend, which was 10.h% annually. The speed at which Indian con-
sumption of phosphatic and potasBic fertilizers has increased in the same
period is even higher (Table 2) and the average for the 3 major nutrients was 17.3%.
2.          A decade ago, approximately one half of the total nitrogen con-
sumption was as ammonium sulphate. The trend towards higher nutrient-content
and complex fertilizers which was characteristic of the situation throughout
most of the world also swept India and at present 64% of the nitrogen content
of fertilizers distributed in India (Table 3) is as urea and 14% as various
fertilizers containing both N and P: diammonium phosphate (DAP), complex
fertilizers (NPK) and nitrophosphates (NP). The same trend is applicable to
phosphatic fertilizers (Table 4). Although the volume of superphosphate
distributed in India haa increased by 54% from 1962/63 through 1972/73, con-
umption of phosphatic fertilizers other than superphosphate was insignificant
in 1962/63, while in the last year only 2h% of the phosphoric acid content was
distributed as superphosphate and most of the balance was as DAP and NP.
3.          The distribution of N consumption by States is shown in Table 5.
The largest consuIers in descending order are the States of UP, Punjab, Tamil
Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and "ysore. Rapid growth of con-
sumption in the last 5 years has been registered in Madhya Pradesh, Orissa,
Haaryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat, while there was a small drop in Andhra
Pradesh. As for phosphatic and potassic fertilizer consumption, the six
highest consumers are the same States as for N, although in different order
(Table 6).
4.          Leaving aside Pondicherry and Delhi, which have very small areaa,
intensity of fertilization (Table 7) is highest in the States of Punjab (59
kg/ha), and Tamil Nadu (h5 kg/ha), followed by Kerala, UP, and Andhra Pradesh
(all more than 20 kg/ha). In Assam and Rajasthan, on the other hand, average
chemical fertilizer dosages are less than 5 kg/ha. Even in the same State, there
are great variations in different districts (Annex 3-6). Average dosages and per
capita consumption of fertilizers in several countries is shown in Table 8.
India's intensity of fertilization (kg/ha of arable lands) is higher than the
average for all developing countries but lower than for Aaia and only about
one third the world average. Because of the high population pressure on
cultivated land, India's position is even more disadvantaged if measured by
per capita consumption of fertilizers. Although comparisons of this type
should not be made without consideration of types of crops grown, extent of
irrigation and agricultural practices, the Table does indicate that there is
undoubtedly a case for increasing use of fertilizers in India.

B.   Production
5.        In the 10-year period from 1953/54 to 1973/74, the average rate
of growth of domestic production of nitrogenous fertilizers fell behind the
growth in consumption (Table 1). Estimated figures for 1974/75, show an
increase of more than 20% over those for the previous year. Growth of
phosphatic fertilizer production practically parallels that of nitrogenous
fertilizers, both having increased about 13-fold in the 15-year period from
1957/58 to 1972/73 (Table 2). Basic potassic fertilizers are not produced
in India; although complex NPK fertilizers are manufactured domestically
(Table 9), they are all made from imported potassium salts.
6.        Until 1958/59, the only nitrogenous fertilizer produced in India
was ammonium sulphate!/. In 1959/60, production of ammonium sulphate nitrate,
ammonium chloride and urea was begun and a year later, calcium ammonium
nitrate (Table 10).  At present (1972/73), 62% of the N content in the Indian
fertilizer output is in the form of urea, and that of ammonium sulphate has
dropped to only 10.8%. A similar change has occured with phosphatic fertilizers
(Table 11).
7.        Production of nitrogen fertilizers by States is shown in Table 12.
Only four States--Rajasthan, Assam, Orissa and Gujarat--produce more nitrogen
in fertilizers than they consume. Of the others, many are small consumers,
but four--UP, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Mysore--have annual deficits of over
100,000 tons of N, and four others of more than 50,000 tons: Madhya Pradesh,
Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. UP, Punjab, and Mysore also have sub-
stantial deficits in P205 (Table 15), while Maharashtra and Delhi have had
surpluses in 1972/73.
C.   Imports and Distribution
8.        The Central Fertilizer Pool ('Pool') came into existence in 1942
as a public sector agency charged with the importation of fertilizers to
give support to the Grow More Food campaign instituted in response to a
famine in Bengal. By 1974, when the first relatively large factory (owned
by FACT) began operations, the Pool also undertook the allocation of locally
made nitrogenous fertilizers to the State governments. After 1966, domestic
producers were allowed to market part of their products or appoint agencies
of their choice. Statewise distribution of fertilizers is mainly controlled
by the State governments and entrusted to cooperatives, manufacturers,
agencies, private dealers and, in some cases, to Agro-Industries Corporations
(which in turn may have a choice of dealers of their own or work through
private dealers). Some States have also developed their own distributorships,
for instance the Agriculture Supply Organization in UP or have used other
organizations such as the Food Corp of India. However, the Fifth Five-Year
Plan envisages that cooperatives will progressively increase their share in
fertilizer marketing and FCI has agreed to sell 50% of its output through the
State governments for distribution through cooperatives and other public
sector agencies.

ANNEX 3-5
INDIA - IFFCO FERTILIZER PROJECT
FERTILIZER MARET PROJECTIONS
A.  Consumption
1.        There are several systems that can be used to forecast future
fertilizer demand and consumption. The first step is to differentiate between
requirements and actual consumption forecasts. Unfortunately procedures for
requirement calculations are not yet generally available; estimates based on
physical depletion of nutrients from the soil may be correct for small plots
under controlled conditions--and even in these cases they leave many factors
undefined--while calculations based on economically or financially optimum
dosages for each crop are misleading generally resulting in forecasts that are
too high when compared with actual results. These optimum dosage levels must
be tempered by consideration of the element of risk (the farmer may well forego
the expectation of a higher return on his money in view of the potential loss
of all or most of his investment due to weather conditions), the lack of finan-
cing for fertilizers and other inputs, the physical lack or scarcity of
fertilizers when they are needed or general lack of education of individual
farmers.
2.        One system frequently followed by market forecasters is to estimate
future consumption on the basis of trend lines (generally on a semi-logarithmic
scale, that is at a constant compounded growth rate) which are either automati-
cally extrapolated at the same rate, or at modified rates to take into account
varying conditions. This system has the defect of giving excessively high pro-
jections when applied to historical data for new products which begin at
extremely low levels of consumption. The generally observed fact of maturity
observed in the S-shaped long-term trend lines of many growth phenomena can be
introduced into the calculation by observing whether the annual growth rate is
accelerating or not during the period covered by actual data; unfortunately
determination of the inflection point in many cases is not precise. Another
widely used system is based on recommended dosages for areas under each crop.
This method should be the most accurate short-term but experience shows that
farmers do not apply fertilizer at the rates recommended and therefore an
element of subjective evaluation enters the calculation of effective as
compared to recommended dosages. A comparison of food and fertilizer require-
ment projections. However, relationships between volume of crops and use of
fertilizer are not well defined; they vary considerably not only from country
to country but from region to region and even in small areas within one country.
Furthermore, it does not take into account genetic improvements, use of herbi-
cides and other pesticides, avoidance of losses after harvesting, etc.
3.        Various forecasting systems have been used in India but actual figures
have never matched and have always been lower than predicted consumption. The
Donde-Brown study is the most recent in-depth analysis; it was primarily based
on district-by-district regression equations for the period 1959-1969. The
technique used, as described by the authors, involved making some assumptions on
various factors:



ANNEX 3-5
Page 2
"Projections were based on a close examination of the
factors that influenced changes in sales during the 10 years
up to 1968/69. During this period, demand was influenced
most by the cultivatorls pervious experience from the use of
fertilizers (the learning process) and the area irrigated and
planted to selected crops known to have consumed most of this
material. These factors explained 70 to 90 percent of the
changes in demand. Other factors, not measurable with the
available data and assumed to be important, included the avail-
ability and use of agricultural credit, market and transport
facilities and promotional efforts.
The above factors were used to project demand for N plus
P205 for each district after making appropriate assumptions
regarding changes in their growth rates. Inherent in these
assumptions were the investments needed and time required to
expand irrigation resources, develop and adopt new technologies,
increase the availability of agricultural power and expand the
agricultural input and commodity marketing systems. It was
assumed that cost/benefit relationships would be about the same
as observed during 1967 to 1969. In some districts assumptions
included improvements in agricultural credit and transportation
resources.2/:t

1. A probable projection of actual consumption (and not demand which would
be higher)    of  4.31 million tons of N has been reachedl/        which would
imply an average rate of growth of 15.8% annually from the present level
(using a 3-year average centered on 1972/73 to avoid the below-the-trend
figure for 1973/74). For the next five years consumption has been projected
to increase at a more moderate rate of 10% annually to reach a level of 6.95
million tons of N by 1983/84.
6.        A very serious balance of payments situation could have a farther
limiting effect on fertilizer consumption. A "low" projection is shown in
Table 1, below which foodgrain production would increase at a lower rate than
population, forcing imports to rise considerably above the present level.
Even this nlowt projection, however, implies an average annual growth of 13.8%
in N consumption, which is not far from the 14.2% rate attained in the previous
five years, when the full impact of rising petroleum and fertilizer prices had
not yet been felt.
7.        The proportion of the three main nutrients has been tilted in favor
of nitrogen, both by the faster response obtained with this nutrient and also
by the fertilizer distribution system. The ratio of N:P205:K, which used to
be about 10:1.3:1 in 1953/54 is now 5.5:1.8:1, still higher in N than the ratio
of 4:2:1 generally considered desirable under Indian agricultural conditions.
For 1978/79, the Fifth Five-Year Plan calls for a ratio of about 5:2.3:1, which
may not be realized in five years. The following projections are based on a
5.5:2:1 ratio for 1978/79 and 5:2:1 for 1983/840
j/ This estimate has been corroborated in general by IFFCO's agricultural
advisersas well as by officials of the GOI and the cooperative system.

jf  Three-year averages have been used to smooth out the relatively low
values registered in 1973/74 as a consequence of delays in foreign
exchange allocations, the rapid rise in fertilizer prices and the
scarcity of foreign and domestic supplies.
B.   Production
8.        Actual capacity of existing nitrogenous fertilizer plants is shown
in Table 2. Utilization of capacity has generally been low. For 1973/74 it
was only 55%, but if the FCI's Durgapur and Cochin I plants and Zuari Agrols
Goa plant--which are only being tested or have just begun commercial produc-
tion--are excluded from the 1973/74 figures, capacity utilization rises to
67%. Furthermore, fertilizer plants were hit last fiscal year by disruptions
in operation outside their control, mainly power failures and shortage of raw
materials, which have been estimated to have resulted in a loss of production
of about 112,000 tons of N or approximately 8% of the installed capacity. An
additional loss in output of about 45,000 tons may be ascribed to obsolete
equipment in old plants (mainly FCIls Sindri) and about 28,000 tons to labor
problems. This does not justify delays in implementation of some projects
(Cochin I, Durgapur) and losses in production arising from defective design or
operation and shutdowns for modifications (Neyveli, Baroda).
9.        Plants now under construction or ready for financing have a total
capacity of 3.08 million tons of N (2.91 million tons after deducting capacity
being retired elsewhere). 38% of this capacity is based on fuel oil as feed-
stock. Considering the dates of commissioning of these plants and the diffi-
culties in production that may be faced by some of them, probable incremental
output from these plants is expected to be about 1.88 million tons by 1978/79
and 2.49 million tons by 1983/84 (Table 3). Eight other plants have also been
approved in principle by GOI or are under consideration for financing. Their
total capacity is 1.91 million tons annually distributed as shown below, but
no more than one or two of these plants is expected to be commissioned by 1978/79:

1,910,000
Still other plants are mentioned as being under consideration but no rapid
implementation of them can be seen. None are expected to be onstream by
1978/79 and no more than about 0.55 million ton capacity by 1983/84:

1,050,000
10.       Instalied annual capacity of phosphatic fertilizer plants is 0.57
million tons (Table 4). Average capacity utilization in 1972/73 was 56%
but some plants (DCM, Trombay and Corormandel) have attained much higher rates
of utilization. One plant--Zuari Agro's Goa plant--has been included in the
total capacity but had not yet begun production. This branch of the fertilizer
industry also has a large proportion (30%) of very small superphosphate plants,
for which fixed capital-related costs are not very important and which show an
average capacity utilization rate of only 42%. Approximately o.66 million
tons of new capacity is expected to be added in 8 projects under construction
or ready for financing, while there are other projects which may be built
(but probably after 1978/79) which could further increase P205 capacity by
some 1.02 million tons annually.
11.       Production projections for 1978/79 and 1983/84 (Table 5) indicate
that the main problem in India is not that the market may not absorb the
output of existing plants and those likely to be put in operation in the next
10 years, but that supply--from both dcmestic sources and imports (limited in
turn by high prices and availability in the world market)--will not be able
to meet demand.

No attempt has been made to combine "probable" consumption and "low" production projections
because to a considerable degree consumption will depend on the availability of domestically
made fertilizers.  Therefore, "probable" consumption projections are matched with "probable"
production projections and "low" consumption projections with "low" production projections.
The gaps are wider for the "low-low" than for the "high-high" projections.

ANNEX 3-6
INDIA - IFFCO FERTILIZER PROJECT
IFFCOIS MARKET ARE
1.        IFFCO will eventually market its products throughout the ten States
holding shares in it.  For some years, however, the output from the Kandla,
Kalol and Phulpur plants will be sold in 111 districts in seven States. Urea
produced at Phulpur will be sold mainly in UP, Haryana and the Punjab with
smaller amounts also going to Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Urea produced at
Kalol will be sold in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and the Punjab, while
NPK from Kandla will be distributed throughout all of IFFCO's marketing area.
2.        A detailed up-to-date geographical breakdown of consumption data is
not available. Figures for 1970/71, although lower than more recent consump-
tion levels, are indicative of consumption patterns (Table 1). N consumption
in the districts comprising IFFCO's market area is about 75% of that for the
seven States.
3.        Projected N consumption and production figures for 1978/79 and
expected gap between demand and domestic supplies originating in the seven
States comprising IFFCO's marketing area are shown in Table 2. These figures
show that for this area, as for all of India, the problem is not one of a
market incapable to absorb production but of meeting ever-growing demand.
4.        Potential for considerable increase in consumption in IFFOO's
marketing areas, as well as throughout India, is shown by the great variation
in fertilizer application rates and yields in various districts. Some examples,
from districts in UP and the Punjab, are shown below:

1/  The seven States listed in the first column.
2/ Based on full production in the seven States but linked to consumption in IFFCO's fertilizer area
3/ Based on "low" production and "low" consumption figures which result in a "high" gap
4/  No final decisions have yet been taken on these plants and there is no way to allocate them geographically.
One of them could possibly be DCM in Rajasthan, but it would probably not be producing commercially until after 1978/79.

REPRESENTATIVE DATA FOR COAL AND OTHER UTILITIES TO
BE USED IN THE PROJECT

Madhya Pradesh are typically:
Calorific Value        -        8,500 Btu/lb

INDIA - IFFCO FERTILIZER PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED PROCESSES TO BE USED IN THE PROJECT
A. Ammonia Manufacture
1.          The ammonia plant will be designed to use heavy fuel oil aa the
source of hydrogen and will include the following principal sections:
Partial Oxidation ("P.O.11).
H drogen Sulfide (H S) and Carbon Dioxide (C02) Removal.
Shift Conversion (or carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide,
between H2S and CO2 removal in the Rectisol gas puri-
fication unit).
Sulfur Recovery (as elemental S).
Nitrogen Wash.
Air-Separation.
Ammonia Gas Compression Synthesis and Storage.
These unit operations are briefly described below:
Partial Oxidation
2.          Fuel oil and other heavy hydrocarbons cannot be reacted or
"reformed" with atean via a nickel-based catalyst to produce hydrogen and
carbon monoxide, as is done on a wide scale with natural gas and light
naphthas. This is because deposits of carbon rapidly form on the catalyst
and stop the process. Instead, heavy hydrocarbons are "partially oxidized"
non-catalytically with steam and oxygen at medium or hi h pressures and
high temperatures to form hydrogen and carbon monoxide (plus some carbon
and other products) according to the general reaction:
2CnHX  + nO2  =  2nCO  + mN2
3.          Only two P.O. processes - those of Shell and Texaco - have been
adopted on a large commercial scale.  It is IFFCO's
intention to use as closely as possible the technology employed in the
successful German P.O. plants (Veba Chemie) and which will be used in the
FCI Nangal Project. These installations incorporated Shell medium-pressure
P.O. gasification.
4.          In the Shell process, heavy fuel oil plus some recycled carbon
is indirectly heated to 2600C with medium-pressure steam and pumped into the
gasifier units along with live steam and oxygen. Operating pressure in
these vessels is about 57 atmospheres (about 840 lbs per square inch) and
the tenperature attained is approximately 1,h400°C It is planned to use
three gasifiers at Phulpur plus one on standby. The fuel oil reacts to form
hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) plus som  carbon dioxide (C02),



ANNEX 4-5
Page 2
methane (CH4), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbonyl sulfide (COS) and free
carbon (C). About 3 percent of the carbon in the feedstock in converted to
free carbon (soot), which is recovered and burnt as fuel. Heat liberated
in the gasifiers is partly recovered in a specially-designed waste heat
boiler and the exit gas is further cooled to 2000C in a feed-water heater
(economiser). Carbon plus water-soluble gaseous impurities are washed out
in a scrubbing unit and the cleaned gas passes the next section for removal
of carbon oxides and sulfur compounds. Carbon-containing scrubber water is
mixed with fuel oil in a pelletizer which produces large granules of carbon.
These migrate to the fuel-oil phase and this suspension is pumped back to
the P.O. units. (Alternatively, the carbon granules can be screened out and
transported to a separate steam-raising system for use as fuel, according to
circuustances. Thia method will probably be used at Phulpur).
Hydrogen Purification
5.          It is also proposed to employ the same process ("Rectisol") for
removing sulfur compounds and carbon oxides as was chosen for the Veba Chemie
and Nangal plants. This is based on the preferential solubilities of these
gases in methanol at low temperatures. Raw gas after carbon removal is
cooled by refrigeration to about minus 300C and sulfur compounds are reduced
to 3 parts per million (ppm) by washing with a lean solution of C02 in
methanol inside a tall tower. Liquor from the base of the tower is "flashed"
(i.e. quickly depressurized) to produce a gas rich in H28 which is sent to a
sulfur recovery unit. Liquor from the top of the tower is flashed to yield
hydrogen and CO which are sent to a conversion unit wherein CO is converted
or "shifted" catalytically to C02.
6.          Hydrogen and C02 from the shift conversion section are cooled by
liquid nitrogen (N2) and the C02 is absorbed by chilled methanol recovered
from the sulfur removal section to yield hydrogen containing about 10 ppm of
C02. This gas atream is sent to the nitrogen-wash section. The rich
solution from the C02 absorber is flashed at 11 atmospheres, which releases
dissolved, unconverted CO and hydrogen. These are recycled to the raw gas
stream entering the H2S absorption section. The C02 rich methanol is
further depressurized to 2.2 atmoapheres. This releases high-purity C02
which is compressed and used for urea synthesis and the methanol is recycled
to the various Rectisol process stages.
Ancillary Operations
7.          Associated with the proposed Rectisol gas purification process
will be several ancillary operations. Sulfur recovery will be undertaken by
a modified Claus unit wherein one-third of the H2S released from the
Rectisol plant is burnt with air to yield sulfur dioxide (SO2) which is
catalytically combined with the remainder of the H2S to yield elemental S
for sale. Conversion of CO to CO will be effected by heating gas from the
sulfur removal section of the Rectisol unit up to 2200C and humidifying with
hot water before passing over a suitable catalyat at about o00oC in the



ANNEX 4
Page 3
Shift Conversion Section. This reduces the CO content to 3% (volume basis)
after which the gas is dehumidified, cooled to 750C and recycled to the C02
absorption section of the Rectisol unit. Final synthesis gas purification
and preparation will be undertaken by a nitrogen wash unit in which gas from
the Rec isol C02 absorber at minus 55°C is washed with liquid nitrogen to
remove twith the aid of an adjoining molecular sieve unit) the remaining
amounts of carbon oxides, argon, methane and other impurities. Sufficient
nitrogen will be added to the pure hydrogen to give the desired synthesis
molar gas ratio of N2:3H2. After absorbing impurities., the remaining liquid
nitrogen will be vaporized to form a gas mixture of low calorific value
which will be used to strip impurities from the carbon wash water, before
being burnt in a steam superheater, thereby simultaneously destroying
pollutants and increasing fuel economy.
Air Fractionation and Separation
8,.         Also closely associated with P.O. synthesis gas (syngas) pre-
paration is air fractionation whereby gaseous or liquid oxygen for partial
oxidation and liquid nitrogen for hydrogen purification and syngas needs are
obtained from air. (Fractionation plants are obtainable from several inter-
national manufacturers and an award will be made on the basis of lowest
evaluated price and discounted operating costs, plus technical suitability
and delivery time). Typically in such plants, filtered air is turbo-
compressed and cooled against cold impure N2, produced in a downstream
section. The air then passes to a set of reversing heat exchangers in which
streams of pure N2 and impure N2 flow in a fixed direction and input air,
oxygen and more impure N2 pass through the exchangers in directions that are
periodically reversed. Cooling induced by indirect contact with cold N2
causes water vapor and G02 in the incoming air to solidify and deposit in
the heat exchangers. During the reversing period, these sublime into the
streams of impure oxygen and nitrogen and eventually leave the system.
9.          Compressed air, freed from water and C02, leaves the cold end of
the reversing exchangers and is fed into a medium-pressure fractionating
column, wherein the rising air stream becomes poorer in 02 and liquifies at
the top of the column to produce a "poor liquid" with a high N2 content.
Reflux liquid flowing down the column becomes richer in 02 and produces a
liquid containing about 40% 02 at the base. A vaporizer supplies the medium
pressure column with the cold needed at the upper section to condense
nitrogen and also the heat required in the lower section of a low-pressure
column to vaporize liquid oxygen. The liquid 02 is circulated by pumps
through a filter between the bottom and top of the vaporizer. Nitrogen con-
densing in the upper section of the medium pressure column is used as a
reflux in both the medium and low pressure columns.
10.         Liquid from the bottom of the medium pressure column after
filtration and subcooling is expanded and introduced in the middle section
of the low pressure column. This is located at the top of the vaporizer and
provides the final separation. It is heated at its base by condensation of
gases at the top of the medium pressure column and cooled at its top by
liquid N2 coming from the medium pressure column. The cold balance of the



ANNEX 4-5
Page 4
unit is supplied by expanding some of the pure N2 in an expansion turbine
which also supplies cold necessary for starting up the unit. Oxygen of 98%
purity (the balance being moisture and carbon dioxide) plus pure nitrogen
containing not more than 20 ppm oxygen and 100 ppm argon are finally
produced. When required, argon can be separated from the N2 in an additional
unit.
Synthesis Gas Compression, Ammonia Synthesis and Storage
11.         Pure syngas containing nitrogen and hydrogen in the molecular
proportions of 1:3 is conpresaed in a multi-stage centrifugal coapressor at
220 to 25G atmospheres and joins a recirculating gas stream in the synthesis
loop. This stream passes through a converter containing beds of promoted
iron oxide catalyst which causes a portion of fresh syngas to react and form
amonia during each cycle through the converter.  Temperature in the con-
verter is controlled by removing reaction heat via "quenching" with the
relatively cool incoming gas stream (or by raising low-pressure steam).
Reaction gases leave the converter at about 340°C and exchange heat in a
boiler feed-water heater. Finally, the gas stream is water cooled and
reifrigereted to minus 60C, at which temperature liquid amonia separates in
a catch-pot and is depressurized. Flashed gases are recycled back to the
entry of the syngas compressor at about 43 atmospheres. Loop refrigeration
ia undertaken by the absorption-refrigeration principle. Ilquid aimonia in
depressurized in two stages and pumped to an atmospheric pressure, low
temperature storage tank. Most flash-gas from these stages is compressed
to about 3 atmospheres and absorbed in the refrigeration system. Residual
flash gas is burnt to avoid pollution.
B. Urea Manufacture
12.         Urea synthesis from the reaction of ammonia and carbon dioxide
under pressure takes place in two steps. The first is an exothermic re-
action in which ammonium carbamate is rapidly formed.
2NH3  + C02          NH2 COONH4  + Heat
In the second step, carbamate is converted to urea and water in
the same pressure converter vessel:
NH2 COCKH4    -__   CO (NH2)2   + H20
The urea solution is separated from unconverted amonia, carbon dioxide,
carbamate and minor by-products and evaporated to a 99.8% solution which is
sprayed into a tall prilling tower.  The droplets solidify into hard spheres
which are collected at the base of the tower, cooled (and coated with suit-
able materials to reduce sticking, if required) and aent to storage.



ANNEX h4
Page 5
13.         Large scale urea process technology is limited to a few inter-
national licensors and their approved engineering contractors. All are
based on the above synthesis reactions but differ in the way urea is
separated from other components. In the older "total recycle" process,
all unconverted reactant8 are recycled back to the converter after step-
wise separation. In the newer "stripping processes", urea is separated
from unconverted reactants and co-products by stripping the liquor leaving
the converter with incoming amaonia (or C02). This appreciably reduces
capital and operating costs compared to older methods. C02 stripping is
now used world-wide in many large plants and ammonia stripping is also
being adopted for large-scale production (e.g. 1,000 tpd upward). While
it has been decided to instanl a stripping process at Phulpur, the final
selections of licensor and engineering firm have not yet been made. These
will be tendered on an international basis and offers will be evaluated in
terms of optimum capital and discounted operating costs, technical pre-
ferences, completion times and successful experience.
14.         In the reaction section of the carbon dioxide stripping pro-
cess, C02 plus a small quantity of air to reduce corrosion is compressed
to 145 atmospheres and fed to a steam-heated high-pressure heat exchanger-
"stripper" wherein it contacts liquor leaving the converter and removes
carbamate by decomposing it to NH and C02. These gases pass to a
condenser wherein carbaumte is relorued and is recycled to the converter.
Reaction heat is used to generate low-pressure steam for use within the
plant. Simultaneously, liquid annmonia from the atmospheric-pressure
storage tank is pumped to the urea plant, heated and compressed. Part is
sent to the converter and part joins the C02 and reformed carbamate
recycled to the converter. In this vessel, conversion of carbamate to
urea is achieved by ensuring plug-flow of the reactants downwards to the
bottom nossle and maintaining a residence time of about one hour.
Reaction temperature and pressure are about 1800C and 140 atmospheres
respectively. Reaction liquor flows by gravity from the converter to the
stripper vessel and then to the recovery section. Inert gases leaves the
top of the converter and are scrubbed in a high-pressure absorber by
dilute carbamate solution before being vented to atmosphere.
15.         In the recovery section, minor quantities of unconverted C02
and NH3 plus nome carbamate are recovered from the urea solution leaving
the stripper. This liquor is depressurized to 3 atmospheres and fed to a
heated separation/rectifier column wherein it is contacted by a
NH3/C02/H20 gaA mixture passing up the column. Carbamate is decomposed
into NH and C02 . The urea solution is further let down to 0.45 atmos-
pheres Into a flash tank separator and flows to a urea solution tank.
Gases from this separator are condensed under vacuum and the condensate
flows to an ammonia-water tank for eventual use or recovery. Gases from
the rectifier are fed to a low pressure carbamate condenser and the
resulting solution is cooled before being sent back to the high pressure
carbamate condenser. Urea solution from the storage tank is evaporated
in two stages working at 0.4 and 0.03 atmospheres respectively. Molten



ANNEX 4-5
Page 6
urea from the second stage containing only 0.2% water is pumped to a
rotating perforated bucket at the top of a tall prill tower. This breaks
the melt into droplets which solidify into sAall spheres (0.1 to 0.3 m
diameter) as required. These are continuously recovered by mechanical
means at the base of the tower, and are sometimes cooled and coated with
suitable agents to reduce sticking, prior to storage, bagging and shipping.
16.         Steam requirements for urea plant operation are frequently
obtained from the C02 compressor turbine at 26 atmospheres or so. This
exhaust is passed to a saturator designed to provide steam at 23 atmos-
pheres for use in the C02 stripper. High-pressure condensate is flashed
in another saturator to provide steam at 9 atmospheres which is used for
the second-stage urea aolution evaporator and various plant services.
Additional steam at 4.5 atmospheres is produced for use in recirculation
heaters, the first stage evaporator and for ammonia desorption and
recovery. In this way, maximum use of heat and energy is achieved;
however, in some cases, there may still be some 4.5 atmospheres steam
available for use outside the urea plant.
17.         Urea processes based on anmonia stripping operate in a similar
manner except that the reaction liquor leaving the converter is stripped
with anmonia instead of C02.
C. Offaites (Excluding Storage and Materials Handling)
Water Supplies and Treatment
18.         Raw water will be drawn from local canals, rivers and on-site
wella. Total requirements will be about 10 million gallons per day,
equivalent to about 1,500 cubic meters per hour. Uhtreated raw water will
be required for ash disposal, plant wash-down and some cooling. A minor
part will be chlorinated for drinking purposes. Process water will be
obtained by primary chemical treatment of raw water with lime and other
reagents for use in process units as cooling tower make-up and feed to the
boiler water-conditioning unit. Boiler feed-water needs will be about 200
cubic meters per hour or 1 million gallons per day. To provide for con-
tingencies, the daily treatment needs will be increased by 50% and 24 hour
process water storage will be provided. Water will be degassed after
primary treatment and treated in ion-exchange units to remove iron, silica
and other harmful components. Feed water for the high-pressure, waste heat
and primary boilers will be demineralized to give an analysis of 0.005 ppm
(max) silicon as Si02; copper plus iron and nickel not more than 0.01 ppm;
and a pH of 7.0 approximately. Total hardness will not exceed 0.01 ppm and
maximum conductivity will be 0.3 micromhos at 200C.
Cooling Towers
19.         To save pumping, water treatment and processing costs, cooling
water will be recycled to the optimnm limit.  It will be cooled by circu-
lating warm water down induced-draft towers of the cross-flow type. In



AMNEX 4i-5
Page 7
this design, roof fans draw in ambient air through side louvres, counter-
current to the water tricklirgover internal baffles and discharge it to
atmosphere at velocities high enough to prevent settling and possible
intake of the moisture-laden warm vapor. The air-cooling range will be
approximtely from 420C down to 320C.
Steam Generation
20.         In addition to the removal of harxful salts in boiler feed
water (bfw), dissolved oxygen mist be eliminated by mechanical and also
chemical means such an the addition of hydrozine, phosphates and morpholine/
ammonia, prior to ateam raising. Otherwise, severe corrosion would.occur in
boiler,drums, tubes, puaps and pipelines. Appropriate facilities will be
installed to minimize corrosion, scaling, pitting and related failures.  In
addition to the production of high-pressure steam in the P.O. units of the
anmonia plant, coal plus small amounts of carbon pellets from theP.O. unit
will be used to raise more h.p. steam at 105 atmospheres (1,550 lbs per
square inch) and 5100C in three boilers, each having a capacity of 160.tons
per hour (one being on light load or standby). These will supply turbines
driving the ammonia synthesis compressor, air and other gas compressors, the
urea C02 compressor and power-recovery turbines and electrical generators.
After optimum recovery of sensible heat and fly ash, flue gases will be dis-
charged via a tall stack to the ataosphere. Fly ash and boiler grate clinker
will be collected in a bunker by a wet system and hauled away to local dis-
posal areas. Ash and clinker production will amount to some 400 tons per day.
To minimize coal needs, economiiers will be installed in all steam systeme to
raise boiler feedwater temperatures as high as possible.
Plant and Instrument Air
21.         A motor-driven air compressor will supply compressed air for
plant use via a cooler, oil cleaner and receiver. Instrument air will be
furnished by an oil-free compressor and dried to minus 400C dew point to
ensure a trouble-free sipply. An ample reserve tank plus a separate back-up
instrumentation system with its own clean air source will be provided to
accommodate emergency shut-downs and sudden failures.
Power Supplies and Distribution
22.         Provisions for obtaining up to 3 megawatts of power from the
State Electricity Board will be made via a feeder line from the 132 KV grid.
This voltage will be stepped down in a plant sub-station to 3.3 KV and
distributed to unit sub-stations which will provide 410, 250 and lower
voltage supplies for various plant needs. A 3.3 KV power plant within the
factory with a generating capacity of 12 KW will meet most of the load and
all critical drives will be supplied from this source via a similar step-
down netweok. Non-critical needs in excess of internal generating capacity
will operate on power furnished by the State-owned public utility.

D. Storage, Handling and Other Facilities
Oil
23.         Heavy fuel-oil tankers with provisions for steam heating will
be received via broad-gauge railroad and pumped to one of two 12,000 ton
storage tanks via a manifold system permitting 44 tankers to be unloaded
simltaneousl]y. In this way, unit trains carrying 1,100 tons each can
shuttle between the refineries and the Phulpur plant, with only a few
hours stoppage for discharging their loads. When filled, the two tanks
will provide storage for about 30 days of operation at plant design
capacity.
Coal ,
24.         Daily requirements are about 1,200 tons, or one train load per
day. Coal will be received via braod gauge railroad and discharged via
wagon tippler and conveyors to an open stockpile. Retrieval will be by
clamshell cranes and conveyors feeding the coal crushers which will die-
chalrge to conveyors supplying the boiler-house bunkers. The coal yard
will hold at least one month's supply (about h0,000 tons).
Amonia
25.         Liquid, chilled amonia will be delivered from the Synthesis
loop in the ammonia plant to a refrigerated storage vessel holding 5,000
tons, or some 5 days production. It will be maintained at minus 3300 by
a boil-off and amall liquefaction system. No sales of ammonia are envis-
aged and all will be pumped to the urea plant at minus 330C and 22
atmospheres. The storage tank will be insulated to minimize evaporation
and rollover hazards. To prevent ground water freezing and disturbing
foundations, the tank will be mounted on foamed glass blocks and a soil
temperature of 40C maintained by steam and electric heaters. The tank
and its contents will be fully instrumented for safe control and operation.
Uresa
26.         A 30,000 ton bulk product storage building with a parabolic
roof is planned. This will hold nearly three weeks production which is
considered sufficient as many IFFCO cooperatives have a large combined
bagged storage capacity readily accessible by road and rail. Furthermore,
recent experience in most large Indian fertilizer plants indicates
atorage capacities over 10,000 tons are unnecessary because of continual
heavy offtakes. Urea prill will be conveyed from the prilling section
to a screening unit and elevated to a tripping conveyor in the silo roof.
Reclaiming will be undertaken by a mobile scraper machine which will load
the product on to a conveyor leading to the bagging plant. Eight bagging
lines will be installed, each including an automatic weigher/bagger, slat
conveyor, stitching machine and discharge chutes leading to road and rail
loading platforms.



ANNEX 4-5
Page 9
Rail Facilities
27.         A broad-gauge railroad siding of nine tracks will be installed
with straight lengths of 600 meters to accomodate unit trains of 40 to 50
wagons.  It will be provided with diesel ahunters and other facilities to
speed turnarounds and loading.
Non-Plant Facilities
28.         These will include offices, cafeterias, change rooms, workshops,
garageo, fire fighting and first aid provisions, laboratory, stores, weigh-
bridges, time office, security center and boundary fences.  Construction of
about 400 houses as well as a hostel and training school near the plant Is
being considered.
Land
29.         Steps have been taken to acquire a 280 ha site.  It is estimated
the plant, township and miscellaneous offaites such as water and effluent
treatment, coal yard and test faru will require 100, 40 and 60 ha.
respectively, leaving 80 ha for expansion purposes such as adding a coal-
based feedstock unit.

INDIA - IFFCO FERTILIZER PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY CONDITIONS
A. Environmental
1.        Principal wastes from the ammonia plant will be:
Surplus Carbon Dioxide:
2.        This gas, mixed with nitrogen, is harmless and will be vented
to atmosphere.
Fractionation Air:
3.        This contains water vapor and carbon dioxide.  It is harmless
and will be released to atmosphere.
'rrocianiC Acid (HCN) Gas Stripper:
4.:,      HCN gas will be burnt to harmless water vapor, carbon dioxide
and nitrogen which will be released via a stack to the atmosphere.
Carbon-Oil Slurry:
5.        This slurry from the partial oxidation units contains 97% of
the heating value of fuel oil and will be burnt to help raise steam in
the coal fired boilers.
Methanol-Water:
6.        A small quantity (about 3 cubic meters per hour) of weak methanol
will be discharged from the Rectisol unit. This will be piped to the main
effluent treatment unit and dispersed by dilution.
Carbon-Scrubbing Water:
7.        This will be discharged from the HCN stripper.  It will contain
some vanadium and other impurities present in the fuel oil and will be
piped to the effluent-treatment unit.
Syngas Gas Purification:
8.        Apart from the methanol operating in the closed-circuit Rectisol
system, the only other purification agent used will be harmless liquid
and gaseous nitrogen.
Sulfur Compounds:
9.        These will be removed from the P.O. gas stream by the Rectisol
unit and converted to elemental S. Only traces will remain unconverted
and these will be burnt before discharge to atmosphere.



ANNEx 4-7
Page 2
10.       Effluents from the Urea plant will be mostly wash-down waters
which may contain several hundred parts per million of urea and ammonia.
These will be sewered to the effluent-treatment unit. The escape of urea
dust from prilling, handling and bagging operations will be minimized by
dust filters and good plant design, for economic as well as ecological
considerations.
11.       Effluents from plant offsites include:
Boiler Stack Cases:
12.       Like any coal-fired installation, these will include carbon
dioxide, and small amounts of soot and fly ash will be held to a minimum
by good plant design, dust catchers and skilled stoking. Fly ash and
grate clinker will be handled in a wet system to eliminate dust and will
be disposed of in local low-lying barren areas.  Dust from the coal
storage and handling sections will be minimized by use of water sprays.
Water Treatment Wastes
13.       Lime sludge and waste streams from process water and boiler feed
water treatment units containing ammonium salts, chlorides and sulfates
will be piped to the effluent treatment plant.
18.       Collected wastes in the effluent treatment plant will be given
appropriate chemical and biological treatment to conform to Indian IS-2490
regulations before being discharged to the plant storm water sewer. No
difficulty is anticipated in meeting these limits which are:
Total suspended solids               100 ppm
pH                                   5.5 to 6.9
Biological oxygen demand             30
Phenols                              1 ppm
15.       Sanitary wastes from the plant and housing colony will be
handled and treated in a separate system by conventional means.
B. Safety
16.       The plant will include all possible precautions against explosion,
fire and other operating hazards. As examples, process units and equip-
ment will be designed on "fail-safe" principles and will be provided with
back-up emergency instrumentation. Operators will be thoroughly trained
in other plants and on simulators in emergency shut-down and restart
procedures. All hazardous flanges and other danger spots will be shrouded.
Large tanks containing fuels or dangerous chemicals will be surrounded by
safety dykes.  Machine guards, walkways, ladders, etc. will follow, when

appropriate, US or European standards. Emergency showers and first aid
equipment will be provided.  IEFCO will promote good housekeeping and
safety by frequent drills and prizes.  Accordingly, it is anticipated
that the Phulpur plant's accident frequency will be of a very low
order.

INDIA - IFFCO FERTILIZER PROJECT
TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING OF LARGE EQUIPMENT
IFFCO has constructed a special road vehicle to carry loads of up to
250 tons, which has been used to move the Kalol converters and other heavy
vessels from the port to the site. Large mobile cranes have also been hired
for Kalol and these will be retained or purchased for the Phulpur project,
if possible. (A heavy lift mobile crane will also be required after the
project is built, to help undertake maintenance work and this will have to be
purchased). A preliminary study has shown the movement of overdimensional
consignments such as ammonia and urea converters, tall scrubbing columns, etc..,
from Bombay or Calcutta via the broad gauge railroad may be possible without
major problems and costs. The overdimensional consignments include the following:

INDIA - IFFCO FERTILIZER PROJECT
PROJECTED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FCR THE PROJECT AL(NE
Assumptions
1.          The subordinated debt or quasi-equity also carries 10i% annual
interest rate. It is paid in 20 equal semi-annual principal payments starting
January, 1980. Interest payments are also made semi-annually at the same time
principal payments are due.
2.          The operating cash level is determined by a quick ratio of 1.2 or a
current ratio of 1.5, whichever test indicates a higher amount. Should both
tests indicate an amount less than Rs 4.71 million (Annex 5-3), Rs 4.71 million
is used as the operating cash level.  4ny cash in excess of the operating require-
ment for each year is accumulated either in Cash Available for Dividends or in the
account Cash Available for Investment. The annual dividend payments are limited
to a maximum of 7% of annual net income by the laws regulating cooperatives.
Any cumulative surplus cash not needed for operating purposes or not available,
for dividend payments is recorded in the account Cash Available for Investment.
Since the financial covenants specify that the debt service on the subordinated
debt will be paid only out of current earnings, funds from the account Cash
Available for Investment can not be used for interest or principal payments on
the subordinated debt.
3.          The current assets (except cash) and the accounts payable are taken
from Annex 5-3.
4.          Operating costs are taken from Annex 6-2.
5.          Debt serTice payments are taken from Annex 6-3.

ANNEX 7-2
INDIA - IFFCO FERTILIZER PROJECT
ESTIMATED PRICES FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Urea Prices
Urea produced by the project will substitute for fertilizer that
would otherwise be imported. The economic benefits to the country are there-
fore primarily measured in terms of the estimated world market price for urea
when the project commences commercial operation in 1978. The most recent Bank
forecast!! for the price of urea in that year is US$145 per ton, bagged, fob
Middle East in 1978 dollars. Since supply and demand are thought to be fairly
well balanced in that year, this 1978 price is assumed to be the long-term
basis for economic pricing. The economic price of urea, at factory site, is
derived as follows:
1978 Cost|P':r Ton of Urea in Current Dollars
FOB Price, Bagged                                        145
Ocean Freight                                             25
CIF Price                                             170
Local Port Handling                                        5
Inland Freight to Factory                                 10
Economic Price, ex-factory                            185
B.   Heavy Fuel Oil
The economic price for heavy fuel oil is derived from crude oil
prices. The Bank forecasts that the fob (OPEC countries) price for crude oil
will range between US$9.90 and US$11.90 per barrel, or an average of US$10.90
in 1978. The economic price of fuel oil is estimated to be 65% of the CIF
crude oil price on a weight basis (i.e. 7.3 barrels of crude oil per ton and
6.7 barrels of fuel oil per ton). The economic price, at factory site, is
derived as follows:
