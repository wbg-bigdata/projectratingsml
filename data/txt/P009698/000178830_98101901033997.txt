PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA - IFFCO FERTILIZER PROJECT
(LOAN 1079-IN)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The IFFCO Fertilizer Project consisted of a grass root 900 tpd/
1500 tpd ammonia/urea complex to increase the supply of nitrogenous
fertilizers for the northern part of India. It was decided to build this
complex at Phulpur, near Allahabad, to benefit from good access to the
railroad network. The plant was to be based on fuel oil, with a design
closely resembling that of the already completed Nangal plant.
2.        The start-up of the project implementation was delayed by 17
months because, soon after appraisal, the Government decided to switch the
plant feedstock from fuel oil to naphtha (para 3.02). After this initial
delay the Project was implemented expeditiously and was mechanically
completed in March 1980, 18 months behind the appraisal schedule.
Commissioning tests could however not be started before March 1981 because
of the non-availability of feedstock which resulted from political
disturbances in the oil-producing state of Assam (para 3.15). The plant
was promptly put into commercial operation once naphtha became available
(para 3.15), and over the first 10 months of operation, it ran at an
average of 80% capacity utilization (para 4.02). These construction,
start-up and initial production performances are excellent.
3.       In spite of the delays, the Project's actual installed cost
exceeded appraisal estimates only by 10%, basically because (i) the
naphtha-based plant finally built is simpler and inherently cheaper than
the fuel-oil-based one envisaged at appraisal (para 3.17); (ii) a large
portion of the project cost was incurred in rupees which depreciated by 20%
vis-a-vis the US$ since project appraisal (para 3.17); and (iii) the
overall performance of IFFCO consultants and suppliers was satisfactory
(para 8.01). This, in turn, resulted from IFFCO's good organizational
arrangements and close attention to the coordination, control and
monitoring of project activities (para 8.01).
4.        The Project economic rate of return is lower than envisaged at
appraisal, because it is now based on expensive naphtha, whereas it was
appraised on the basis of (relatively) cheap fuel oil. Since 1975 when the
Indian Government decided to switch feedstock, the price differential
between naphtha and fuel oil has more than quadrupled and is expected to
remain at current levels for the foreseeable future (para 6.02). The
project return is still appropriate at 11.3% since, due to transport costs,
naphtha's opportunity value at Phulphur is relatively low whereas urea's is
high (para 6.03). Also, with the coming on stream of the Mathura refinery,
feedstock supplies for Phulpur are likely to be more secure for naphtha
than for fuel oil (para 6.03).
5.        The report concludes (para 8.03) that the Project's   very
successful early operation indicates that it is mostly likely to meet its
objectives and help India provide fertilizer to the farmers of its Northern
Region at economically competitive prices. The experience with this
project also proves that with adequate planning, training and management,
as provided by IFFCO, India can quickly achieve and maintain high capacity
utilization rates in modern, complex fertilizer plants."






PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA - IFFCO FERTILIZER PROJECT
(LOAN 1079-IN)
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India gives high priority to the development of
the fertilizer sector to help increase local agricultural production. The
Bank Group has been involved in the development of this sector since 1967
when IFC financed a urea project in Kanpur, which was implemented by Indian
Explosives Ltd. (a subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK).
Since then the Bank Group has financed a total of 11 projects in this
sector, three by IFC, cne by IBRD and seven by IDA. Annex 1 lists these
projects. The most recent Bank Group operation has been an IDA Credit of
$400 million approved in March 1981 for the Hazira Fertilizer Complex based
on India's West Coast offshore gas fields. The IFFCO project was the
eighth project in the fertilizer sector financed by the Bank Group and up
to now the only one by IBRD. The Bank support of this sector has resulted
in significant economic benefits for India and has helped to bring about
important policy and institutional changes as discussed below. The Bank
expects to remain active in this sector and is currently discussing the
possibility of financing a fertilizer distribution project. In addition,
another large gas-based fertilizer project is under consideration for
future Bank/IDA lending.
1.02      During the 15 years of Bank involvement in the sector, India has
become the fourth largest fertilizer producer in the world after the USSR,
the USA and China. Fertilizer consumption has also grown rapidly, however,
and India must still rely on large fertilizer imports to meet its demand.
The table below shows the growth of India's fertilizer production and
consumption over the last 15 years.
India - Fertilizer Production and Consumption
(in '000 nutrient tons)
Average Growth
1965/66       1980/81       Rate (% p.a.)
Production:
Nitrogen                238          2,164            15.9
Phosphate               119            842            13.9
Consumption:
Nitrogen                575          3,678            13.2
Phosphate               133          1,214            15.9



During this period, India followed the evolution of the industrialized
countries' technology and it built fertilizer plants of increasing sizes.
It also changed the product mix of the fertilizer it manufactures, with
most new capacity now producing high nutrient fertilizers. It changed the
feedstock pattern for ammonia production, and it now emphasizes using newly
discovered West Coast natural gas. Also, and this shall be discussed later
in this report, overall project management and implementation performance
has improved significantly with local companies now playing a larger role
in project engineering, equipment supply and implementation management.
1.03      Another major development in the industry has been the
introduction of a price retention formula under which fertilizer prices are
set at levels that provide a 12% after tax return on net worth at 80%
capacity operation. This pricing policy has allowed the companies, as the
Bank Group discussed with GOI, to generate sufficient funds to meet their
financial obligations, meet a portion of their investment requirements and
also earn a reasonable return at efficient operation. It also rewards high
capacity utilization rates, which the industry has had perennial
difficulties to achieve.
1.04      The last fifteen years also witnessed the emergence of the
cooperative sector as a major fertilizer producer in India. The Indian
Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative Ltd. (IFFCO) started its Kandla and Kalol
plants in 1975. It started the Phulpur plant i-. 1981, and is now the
largest single producer of fertilizers in India, contributing 11% of the
country's total nitrogenous fertilizer production and 23% of total
phosphate fertilizer production in 1980/81. IFFCO's ammonia/urea plants at
Kalol and NPK plant at Kandla have consistently achieved high capacity
utilization rates, reaching 93% and 125%, respectively, in 1980/81. With
IFFCO's Phulpur plant now reaching full production, with KRIBHCO (IFFCO's
sister cooperative society) currently implementing the IDA supported 4,400
tpd urea fertilizer complex at Hazira, and with more than 27,000
cooperative institutions having now contributed about Rs 360 million to
IFFCO's equity, the cooperative system appears well endowed to continue to
play an important role in India's fertilizer sector.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A.   Project Preparation and Appraisal, Loan Approval and Effectiveness
2.01      In 1973, IFFCO and the Government of India decided to build a
grass root ammonia/urea complex to increase the supply of nitrogenous
fertilizers for the northern part of the country, particularly for the
state of Uttar Pradesh which had 25% of IFFCO's cooperative shareholding.
It was decided that, to benefit from excellent access to the railroad
network, this complex would be located at Phulpur, near Allahabad, on the
southern side of a major broad-gauge railroad and only 15 km north of the
Allahabad/Vanarasi meter gauge railroad and Grand Trunk Road. It was also



- 3 -
decided that the complex would use heavy fuel oil for feedstock, and that
its design would closely resemble that of the already decided upon fuel oil
based Nangal plant. This heavy fuel oil was to be brought to Phulpur from
the Barauni refinery (some 200 km away) or from the then-planned Mathura
refinery (some 500 km away).
2.02      The Government of India requested Bank Group assistance to
finance this project, and an identification mission visited India in
October 1973. As there were no major issues outstanding neither with the
project scope and location, nor with IFFCO's implementation capabilities
(it was in the final stages of the successful implementation of the Kalol
and Kandla projects), the Phulpur project was appraised in March/April
1974. A post appraisal mission followed in August 1974. The major issue
that concerned the Bank during negotiations was that IFFCO's assets at
Kalol and Kandla had been mortgaged to secure the loan received by IFFCO
from the Indian financing institutions, and that liens were also to be
created on IFFCO's properties at Phulpur to obtain further loans from
them. This issue was promptly resolved when the financial institutions
agreed to accept Government guarantees in place of the liens, and the
liens, if any, were to be limited to what IFFCO may provide the Government,
to obtain the guarantees.
2.03      On January 7, 1975, the Board approved an IBRD loan of US$109
million to IFFCO. This loan had a maturity of 15 years, including 4 years
of grace, at an interest rate of 8% plus a 2.25% fee to the Government.
The loan became effective on April 8, 1975.
B.   Project Description and Objectives
2.04      The Project consisted of a 900 tpd partial oxidation fuel oil
based ammonia plant to feed a 1,500 tpd urea plant. Steam and power were
to be generated from coal. The Project included all necessary offsites
such as railroad sidings, fuel oil and coal storage and handling
facilities, water and effluent treatment plants, cooling towers, product
storage and shipping facilities, maintenance shops, and offices and
personnel facilities. The main raw materials to be used by the Project
were (a) 250,000 tpa of fuel oil, and (b) 400,000 tpa of coal. A small
amount of power (5 MW) was to be drawn from the state power grid.
III. PROJECT 'IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.   Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      The IFFCO Phulpur fertilizer project was mechanically completed
in March 1980, 18 months behind schedule. The delay was mainly due to the
Government's decision to change the project feedstock from heavy fuel oil
to naphtha, which postponed the project zero date by about 17 months.
Because of feedstock unavailability, the plant's start-up was further



- 4 -
delayed by 10 months. It was put in commercial operation on March 28,
1981. Since then it has run remarkably well, achieving an average of 80%
capacity utilization for the first 10 months of operation, and producing
329,632 tons of urea by January 1982. This high capacity utilization
exceeds apraisal estimates (50% utilization in the first year, and 802% in
the second year of operation) and partly offsets the economic penalty of
delays in project completion. This is an excellent result for a naphtha-
based urea plant in any developing country, and it reflects favorably on
IFFCO's ability to achieve rapidly design production levels; it also proves
that given adequate planning, training and management, India can indeed
overcome a major remaining weakness in its otherwise impressive performance
in the fertilizer sector, e.g. difficulties in quickly achieving and
maintaining high capacity utilization rates. Between April 1981 and
February 1982, IFFC0 marketed 356,420 tons of Phulpur's urea in the
northern states of India.
B.   Project Scope
3.02      As described above, there has been a major change from the
original project scope with regard to the main process unit: In 1975, the
feedstock for the ammonia plant was changed from fuel oil to naphtha. This
necessitated adopting the steam reforming process and profoundly changing
the design of the ammonia plant. The capacities of the steam generation
plant and of other offsite facilities were consequently modified. Also,
the capacity of the urea plant was increased from the original 1,500 tpd to
1,550 tpd. Finally, an additional effluent treatment plant was built to
help the plant meet regulations concerning disposal of chromate containing
water.
3.03      The Government's 1975 decision to switch feedstock from fuel oil
to naphtha was a shift from its then prevailing policy of allocating fuel
oil or coal for fertilizer production. This decision was based on the
projected petroleum products supply/demand balances for the northern part
of the country. Forecasts then indicated that, with the commissioning of
the 6 million tpa Mathura refinery in Uttar Pradesh and with the continued
operation of the Barauni refinery, there would be a surplus of naphtha of
about 630 thousand tpa in the region while fuel oil would continue to be in
deficit and would have to be imported. In the Government's view, the fact
that surplus naphtha was locally available while fuel oil would need to be
imported over long distances more than compensated for the price
differentials that favored using fuel oil. At the time, the Bank conducted
economic analyses of the two alternatives. It concluded that, although a
naphtha-based plant would cost about 15% less than a fuel-oil-based one, a
fuel-oil-based plant would be slightly more attractive economically because
long-term forecasts placed fuel oil economic price about US$30 per torn
below naphtha price. As the expected difference in rate of returns was
only 2 percentage points (22% vs. 20%), the Bank concluded then that the
deciding factor was feedstock availability and it accepted that the
feedstock be changed to naphtha.



3.04      This switch in feedstock has had major impacts on all aspects of
project implementation. Schedule, capital cost, economic return and
project operating performance have all been affected. The different
impacts are discussed in the following paragraphs.
C.   Project Management
3.05      The project was primarily executed by consultants specializing in
ammonia plant, urea plant, power plant and other offsites implementation.
The project execution was under the overall responsibility of the general
project manager, who reported to IFFCO's managing director. The general
project manager, an IFFCO senior executive, was fully responsible for the
project budget and implementation schedule. He was assisted by project
engineers who had the responsibility of day-to-day coordination for
different aspects of project execution. Annex 2 describes the organization
of this Project Unit.
3.06      M. W. Kellogg (USA) was entrusted the design of the ammonia
plant, and Snamprogetti (Italy) that of the urea plant. Development
Consultant Private Ltd. (India) was selected to execute the detailed
engineering for the power plant and offsites. Engineers India Ltd. carried
out part of the ammonia and urea plants detailed engineering, and
Fertilizer (Planning and Development) India Ltd. provided some field
supervisory engineers to support Kellogg and Snamprogetti construction
engineers.
3.07      Although IFFCO did not provide for sufficient corporate and
project staff during the early stages of project implementation (it was
starting up the Kandla and the Kalol plants, and admittedly work was at a
standstill since the Government had not decided yet on which feedstock the
project would be based), the overall performances of IFFCO's Project Unit
and of the consultants have been excellent. This has been the major reason
for the project's rapid execution, with mechanical completion occurring
only 46 months after the effective zero date (compared to the appraisal
estimate of 45 months). This was due both to the fact that IFFCO's
managing director, the general project manager and engineers of the project
units were well qualified and experienced, and to the fact that IFFCO set
up appropriate relationships with the consultants for its staff to monitor
closely project implementation and take on-the-spot decisions when
required. These relationships placed great emphasis on close communica-
tions between IFFCO staff and their counterpart. For instance in the
initial stages of project implementation, IFFCO assigned some staff to the
consultants offices to monitor design and procurement activities. During
the construction period its project engineers were also in close direct
contact with the consultants resident construction managers. IFFCO also
involved actively at a sufficiently early stage its operating and
maintenance supervisory personnel for inspection checks, for site
construction, follow-up with site contractors and precommissioning
activities. This resulted in (i) IFFCO's active involvement and control of
the project execution; (ii) freeing the managing director of day-to-day
detailed project monitoring; and (iii) on-the-job training for IFFCO's
middle management and junior staff who were to run the plant. Annex 2 also
describes these relationships.



- 6 -
3.08      This sound organizational structure and the active involvement of
IFFCO staff in project execution undoubtedly helped the company quickly to
diagnose and solve equipment problems during pre-commissioning test runs.
This allowed for a speedy plant commissioning and commercial operation
start-up, once naphtha became available.
D.   Employment and Training
3.09      To implement the Project, IFFC0 took advantage of its pool of
managers, supervisors and senior operators from its Kalol and Kandla
plants. For junior operators and technicians, it recruited 228 young
engineers, science graduates and qualified craftsmen, who underwent a
comprehensive two-year specialized training program, at IFFCO's Kalol plant
using elaborate training materials prepared by senior supervisory
personnel. These trainees were in particular given on-the-job training in
the Kalol plant. In all, the Project now employs 1090 permanent staff,
about 320 more than was envisaged at appraisal. For training, as described
above (para 3.07), IFFCO gave considerable attention to involving its staff
with the engineering firms' work. Also, as a large ongoing industrial
company, IFFC0 has well established training policies and personnel
development programs. It offers training assistance to other companies.
E.   Use and Performance-of Consultants
3.10      The Project did experience some delays in engineering carried out
by all consultants, which delayed procurement of bulk materials. Also,
some materials procured to inadequate specifications, required replacement
after it had already been applied, which delayed the mechanical completion
by about 2 months. Finally, IFFCO staff feel that the expediting carried
out by the consultants was not satisfactory and that some of the delays
experienced at the suppliers shops could have been avoided. There were
also deficiencies in ordering bulk material for piping and insulation,
which resulted in issue of large numbers of purchase orders at a late stage
of project construction. IFFCO had to depute two of its personnel to
expedite these critical items for project completion and to arrange for
their air freighting.
F.   Performance of Contractors and Suppliers
3.11      Workmanship.   The overall quality of service rendered by the
various contractors and suppliers, both indigenous and foreign, was
satisfactory. IFFCO feels that the main reason for this has been the
judicious selection of vendors based strictly on successful previous
execution of similar job elsewhere. IFFCO did, however, face some
construction delays due to problems in vendors supplies. In particular,
(i) the superheater coil for the primary reformer convection zone in the
ammonia plant was wrongly shaped; (ii) the separators of the air compressor
in the ammonia plant were wrongly sized; (iii) the C02 compressor inlet
passage was too small and the compressor could not deliver the specified
gas pressure and flow; and (iv) the ammonia vaporizer of the inert gas
plant was improperly designed. Although most of the necessary design and
equipment changes were performed expeditiously, IFFCO lost about 3 months
to modify the superheater coil.



3.12      Schedule of ])elivery.  Most of the major equipment ordered
outside India were supplied within 2 or 3 months of their promised
delivery. However, the bulk piping and instrument materials ordered
outside India were late, at times by as much as 6 months. Most of the
major equipment ordered in India were delayed by 6 to 12 months from
contractual delivery dates. These items were not the sole contributors to
further delays. IFFCO had major problems in this respect with the
structural steel contractor who completed the structural steel work 17
months behind commitment because of lack of manpower, inadequate shop
quality control and deficient planning. IFFCO also encountered delivery
problems for vessels ordered in India because of strikes at the suppliers
shop. In total, late deliveries of equipment and material delayed project
contractual mechanical completion by about 7 months, including a one-month
delay due to congestion at Bombay port and 2 months, due to structural
steel contractor's delays.
G. Procurement
3.13      At project appraisal, it was anticipated that of a total
estimated cost of about US$130 million for equipment and materials, US$55
million would be purchased under local procurement procedures (and not be
financed with the proceeds of the Bank loan), while for the remaining US$75
million which was to be financed by the Bank it was expected that about
US$55 million would be imported and about US$20 million would be won
through international competitive bidding by local suppliers. In total,
the equipment procured under ICB was expected to total US$65 million,
proprietary equipment were to total US$8 million and small items directly
procured were to total US$2 million. The actual cost of the equipment was
US$114.8 million--7% higher than the appraisal estimates, with US$32.1
million in direct import and US$82.7 million purchased locally. The
indirect foreign exchange component of the equipment purchased locally
represented about US$29 million, bringing the total foreign exchange cost
of the equipment to US$61 million. The actual share of Bank-financed
equipment and supplies was only 64% against the 75% estimated at
appraisal. Only about 60% of the Bank-financed items were procured from
suppliers outside India (Annex 3). As a result, about 72% of the project
equipment and supplies were procured from India suppliers. As explained
above, this large share of local suppliers did delay project mechanical
completion by about 7 months, when measured against contractual
arrangements.
H. Implementation Schedule
3.14      As shown in Annex 4, the Project was mechanically completed in
March 1980, 18 months behind the appraisal schedule. As mentioned, this
was mainly due to the 17 months delay in project zero date which is
attributable to the feedstock switch to naphtha (paras 3.01 and 3.03). The
contracts IFFCO entered into with the engineering firms after that switch
called for the project to be mechanically completed in March 1979, 34
months after zero date. This appears to have been an over-optimistic
schedule--it allowed for 11 months less than the corresponding appraisal
estimate. The Project was in fact, mechanically completed 46 months after
zero date, only one month more than estimated at appraisal. As explained
above, 5 of these 12 months of contractual delays are due to slow plant



-8 -
erection because of faulty material and equipment!/ (paras 3.10 and 3.11)
and 7 are due to late delivery of vessels and material purchased from
Indian/foreign suppliers (para 3.13).
3.15      Although the plant was mechanically completed in March 1980,
commissioning tests could not be started before March 1981 because of the
non-availability of feedstock, which resulted from political disturbances
in the oil-producing state of Assam. IFFCO managed to secure enough
naphtha for intermittent pre-commissioning tests during July-October 1980.
These tests revealed some equipment and material deficiencies which IFFCO
promptly corrected. When naphtha became finally available in March 1981,
commissioning tests were completed without major difficulties and the plant
was declared in commercial production on March 28, 1981, after 25 days of
continuous operations. This is perhaps the best start-up performance of
any major fertilizer plants in India in recent years.
I. Capital Costs, Financing and Disbursements
3.16      Annex 5 presents (i) the capital costs estimates at the time of
project appraisal; (ii) the revised estimates after the feedstock was
switched to naphtha and the contracts were signed with the consultants; and
(iii) the actual costs. A summary table is presented on the following
page:

3.17      In spite of the 30 months delay in start-up of commercial
operations, the Project cost increased by only 12% in current US$.     This is
mainly due to the fact that (i) naphtha-based ammonia plants are inherently
simpler and cheaper than fuel-oil-based ones; and (ii) a significantly
larger proportion of the project total cost was incurred in rupees than was
estimated at appraisal (71% vs. 59%) and the rupee depreciated by 20%

vis-a-vis the dollar since project appraisal (as shown in Annex 5, the cost
overrun expressed in current Rupees reaches 34%). The following table

a/   These delays increased interest during construction charges, project
management fees and preoperating expenses.
3.18      When compared with the original cost estimates revised after the
feedstock was changed, the Project shows a cost overrun of 32%. This is
mainly due to overruns in (i) civil works (46%); (ii) project management
and preoperating expenses and interest during construction (130%--resulting
from the delays in plant commissioning); and (iii) working capital
(260%--working capital requirements in the revised estimate were grossly
underestimated). Compared with the original revised estimate, cost
overruns in equipment, licenses and engineering, and erection only totalled
5%.
3.19      The total project cost of US$246.6 million includes about US$101
million in foreign exchange (US$70 million in direct import and US$31
million in foreign exchange costs). This cost has been financed with
equity provided by the Government (US$34.7 million), the cooperatives
(US$25.9 million) and IFFCO's own resources (US$41.0 million), and with
loans provided by the,Bank (US$109.0 million) and by Indian Financing
Institutions (US$36.1 million). The increase in project cost has been



-  11  -
financed through internal cash generation and additional borrowings from
Indian financing institutions. It must be noted that, due to the
rupee/US$ exchange rate fluctuations since appraisal, the Government equity
contribution to the project expressed in rupees is only 13% below appraisal
estimate (vs. 28% below when expressed in US$). Also, actual cooperatives
contributions expressed in rupees exceed the appraisal estimate (Rs 233
millions vs. Rs 219 million). Finally the project debt:equity ratio of
59:41 is more favorable than the 65:35 estimated at appraisal.
3.20      IFFCO experienced problems with the Bank disbursement
procedures. Since it could not directly obtain foreign exchange to pay the
suppliers and since the suppliers were unwilling to ship equipment without
a payment guarantee, IFFCO relied heavily on procedures V and VI (opening
of Letters of Credit with commercial banks in the supplier's country) for
paying foreign suppliers of Bank-financed equipment. Not only did IFFCO
find that it took a substantial time to open Letters of Credit (sometimes
up to 5 months), but it found these Letters of Credits very difficult to
amend, even for minor reasons. IFFCO found these difficulties particularly
bothersome during the last phase of the project construction period, as it
sometimes had to wait 12 weeks for urgently needed material to be shipped
when it knew such material was ready for dispatch on the day of order. To
overcome this inconvenience, IFFCO suggested that, for borrowers who cannot
directly obtain foreign exchange for payments overseas, the Bank should
establish a small revolving fund amounting to 2 or 3% of the loan amount
for small direct payments to material or small-equipment suppliers at the
end of the construction period.
3.21      All of the US$109 million Bank loan have been utilized.    The
table below summarizes the Bank funds category-wise allocation envisaged at
appraisal and the actual. utilization:

-  12  -
As shown in Annex 6, the loan disbursement pattern assumed at appraisal
proved to be optimistic. It was expected that disbursements would begin
during the first quarter of 1975, whereas, because the project zero date
slipped 17 months, they actually began in the second quarter of 1976.
Also, they proceeded at a rate slower than that assumed at appraisal: the
loan was fully disbursed in 21 quarters (5.25 years) as compared with the
appraisal estimate of 15 quarters (3.75 years). The loan was fully
disbursed by May 4, 1981.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Commissioning and Start-up
4.01      As described above (para 3.15), project commercial start-up was
delayed because naphtha was unavailable until March 1981, 12 months after
mechanical completion. Between July and September 1980, IFFCO managed to
secure some naphtha and began test runs. These revealed some equipment and
material problems with both the ammonia and urea plants, which IFFCO
quickly solved. The plants were started up immediately after receipt of
naphtha, and the guarantee test runs were performed without difficulties.
The plant was declared in commercial production on March 28, 1981.
B. Buildup of Production
4.02      Annex 7 details the buildup of production at Phulpur through
January 1982. It shows that, over the first 10 months of operation, the
plant ran at an average capacity utilization of 80%. This is a remarkable
achievement. IFFCO has already identified some equipment design
modifications it intends to implement during the next scheduled maintenance
stops. It believes that these first modifications will allow the plant to
run at 90% average capacity utilization. Given its already mentioned
excellent record with the Kalol and Kandla plants, IFFCO thus appears
likely to achieve design production levels without difficulties.
C. Market Growth
4.03      Up to the end of February 1982, IFFCO has marketed 356,420 tons
of the urea produced at Phulpur. Annex 8 presents the statewise
distribution of this urea. As discussed above (para 2.01), Uttar Pradesh's
village cooperatives, the state where the project is located, own a 'Large
proportion of IFFCO cooperative shareholdings, and as planned, the majority
of the project output is marketed in that state. Given the large demand
for urea in the states surrounding the plant, IFFCO does not anticipate any
difficulties in marketing the project output.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Financial Rate of Return
5.01      The financial rate of return for the Project is estimated at
12.3%, as compared to the appraisal estimate of 13.9%. The Project thus
shows an acceptable financial rate of return, in spite of the fact that (i)
capital costs have increased in rupees by more than 30% over appraisal
estimates; and (ii) the Project is using expensive naphtha (costing Rs 1978
per ton) whereas it was appraised on fuel oil (then estimated to cost Rs
288 per ton in 1978 terms). The major reason for this is that the
Government now sets ex-factory fertilizer prices with a retention price
formula which guarantees the fertilizer plants a 28.4%2/ before tax return
on net worth at 80% capacity utilization. Accordingly, increases in
capital costs and raw material prices are compensated for by higher
ex-factory prices. Annex 9 presents the project operating costs at 90%
capacity utilization, and Annex 10 the yearly financial costs and revenue
streams.
B. Financial Results
5.02      As part of the project agreement, IFFCO was to (i) maintain a
debt:equity ratio at less than 60:40; (ii) maintain a current ratio of at
least 1.1 during project: implementation and 1.5 after project completion;
and (iii) not incur additional debt if its debt service ratio were to fall
below 1.4. All these convenants have been complied with.
5.03      Annex 11 summarizes IFFCO corporate financial results.   They show
that since19735,7when the Kalol and Kandla plants started commercial
operations, IFFCO has had good financial performances. In 1980/81, its
assets totalled Rs 4,481 million (US$498 million). Its net profits stood
at Rs 185 million (US$20 million), which represented 7% of sales and 9% of
total equity. In that year also, IFFCO long-term debt:equity ratio stood
at a comfortable 45:55 and thus shows an overall good financial health.
VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
A. Economic Rate of Return
6.01      The economic rate of return is estimated at 11.3%, 4.9 points
below the appraisal estimate of;16.2%. Annex 12 details all input/output
price assumptions on which this new return is based. The economic value of
all traded items has been based on forecasts of international prices, after
2/   This guaranteed return has recently been changed to 27.5%.   This does
not substantially change the analysis and conclusions presented in
this report.



- 14 -
allowing for transportation and handling costs. All non-tradeable items
have been priced at their financial prices after adjusting for duties and
taxes.
6.02      The major reason for this lower economic rate of return is that
the project is now based on expensive naphtha, whereas it was appraised on
the basis of (relatively) cheap fuel oil. In 1975 when the Indian
Government decided to switch feedstock, the price differential between
naphtha and fuel oil was expected to stay at the US$30-35 per ton level
which had been experienced up to that point. Based on this forecast, the
Bank economic analysis showed that, were naphtha to be used instead of fuel
oil, the return would drop only by about 2%. Since naphtha was more likely
to be available than fuel oil (naphtha was projected in surplus while fuel
oil was forcast to be imported) the Bank did not object to this feedstock
switch. International prices of naphtha are now about US$125/ton higher
than those of fuel oil, and this price differential is expected to remain
at this level for the foreseable future.
6.03      With the coming on stream of the Mathura refinery, naphtha will
indeed be in surplus in India's Northern Region, while fuel oil will be in
deficit.  Because of the long distance between the Mathura refinery and the
Kandla port from which this naphtha would need to be exported, and because
only small vessels can use that port, the rail transport and shipping costs
to export naphtha from Mathura would be high. The opportunity value of
naphtha at Phulpur is therefore relatively low (US$262/ton as shown in
Annex 12). Conversely, and also because of high transport costs, urea has
a high opportunity value in the project market areas. These two factors
explain why this naphtha-based urea project shows a still acceptable 11.3%
economic rate of return.
B. Environmental Aspects
6.04      The Project has been constructed in conformity with the
environmental norms agreed at appraisal. As mentioned above (para 3.02),
IFFCO has built an additional treatment plant for the project to meet
regulations for disposal of chromate containing water. IFFCO continuously
monitors the plant's effluents to ensure that all environmental regulations
are met.
C. Transfer of Technology
6.05      The project has been implemented with substantial involvement of
Indian industrial companies. Indian engineering firms carried out part of
the detailed engineering for the ammonia and urea plants. Offsites design
and erection was also performed by an Indian firm. A large portion of the
project equipment was procured from Indian suppliers. Also, IFFCO's



-  15  -
engineers effectively absorbed the technology transferred to them and they
are now to help KRIBHCO--IFFCO's sister cooperative society--implement the
IDA supported Hazira urea complex.
VII. BANK ROLE
7.01      During the various phases of the project, the Bank has worked
closely with the Government and with IFFCO. The Bank's relationship with
IFFCO throughout project preparation and implementation was excellent.
IFFCO greatly facilitated this by providing an adequate team of competent
professionals who quickly learned Bank procedures for procurement and
disbursement. During appraisal, the Bank helped IFFCO to formulate the
organizational arrangements for project implementation and urged it to
staff adequately senior corporate positions which were vacant at the time.
The Bank has also worked closely with the Government to ensure that IFFCO's
highly competent Managing Director would not retire before project
completion. Finally, the Bank ICB procedures helped IFFCO obtain equipment
at competitive prices, which lowered the project cost.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS FOR SIMILAR PROJECTS
8.01      Except for the 17-month zero date delay due to the Government's
decision to switch feedstock and for the 12-month delay in commissioning
due to unavailability of feedstock, the Project was executed promptly and
successfully; it was mechanically completed 46 months after the revised
zero date (project construction thus took only one month more than
estimated at appraisal) and it ran at an average of 80% capacity
utilization for the first ten months of operation (30 percentage points
more than estimated at appraisal). The Project's actual installed cost did
surpass appraisal estimates by 10%, while overruns in total financing
required reached 12% because the 30-month delay in start of commercial
production increased interest charges during construction. This relatively
good capital cost performance is mainly due to the fact that (i) the
naphtha-based plant finally built is simpler and inherently cheaper than
the fuel-oil-based one envisaged at apparaisal; (ii) a large portion of the
project cost was incurred in rupees which depreciated by 20% vis-a-vis the
US$ since project appraisal; and (iii) the overall performance of IFFCO's
consultants and suppliers was adequate. This in turn resulted from IFFCO's
close attention to the coordination, control and monitoring of the project
activities. The project was also implemented successfully because IFFCO
staff were well experienced and competent and because IFFCO's senior
management set up appropriate organizational arrangements under which



- 16 -
IFFCO's project unit controlled and was actively involved in all aspects of
project execution.
8.02      In spite of the initial 17 months delay, the Bank involvement in
this Project was not premature. There were no indications at appraisal
that the project feedstock would be changed. Also, the early Bank
participation facilitated the setting up of good implementation
arrangements. The decision of the Bank not to object to the change in
feedstock appears to have been appropriate as (i) feedstock supplies are
likely to be more secure for naphtha than for fuel oil (it is indeed in
surplus in the Northern Region of India while fuel oil is in deficit); and
(ii) the project economic rate of return is still appropriate at 11.3%
since, due to transport costs, naphtha's opportunity value at Phulpur is
relatively low while urea's is high. This Project has shown that
procedures V and VI (opening of Letters of Credit) for withdrawal of Bank
funds can be cumbersome and that, for borrowers who cannot directly obtain
foreign exchange, the Bank should consider allocating 2-3% of its loan in a
revolving fund for small direct payments for materials and small equipment
urgently required at the end of the project construction period.
8.03      In summary, although it was started 17 months behind schedule and
although it could not be commissioned for 12 months after mechanical
completion, the IFFCO Fertilizer Project has been well implemented. Its
very successful early operation indicates that it is mostly likely to meet
its objectives and help India provide fertilizer to the farmers of its
Northern Region at an economically competitive price. The experience with
this Project also proves that with adequate planning, training and
management, as provided by IFFCO, India can indeed quickly achieve and
maintain high capacity utilization rates in modern, complex fertilizer
plants.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
I. ASSUMPTIONS
A. Economic Value of Naphtha at Phulpur
1.   IFFCO's phulpur ammonia/urea plant is to obtain its naphtha from
the Mathura refinery. With this refinery coming on stream in late 1982,
India's Northern Region will have a surplus of naphtha for the foreseeable
future. Surplus naptha from Mathura must be exported from the Kandla port,
and the economic value of naphtha at Phulpur is to be derived from
corresponding export receipts as shown below:

1/ Crude density 0.88 kg/i.
2/ Naptha/Crude oil price ratio of 1.25 for exports from Bombay, as per
the India Refineries Rationalization Project SAR (Report No. 3645-IN,
dated March 1, 1982).
3/ Kandla is a shallow water port which can only accomodate small general
purpose vessels (17,000 tons carrying capacity). Also, it is a very
crowded port with long waiting times and high demurrage charges.
4/ Rail transport costs as per railways tariffs.

C. Economic Value of Urea at Phulpur
3.   The project's urea is sold primarily in the northern regions of
India surrounding the plant. Its economic value is thus derived from
import costs by adding domestic economic distribution freight to Phulpur,
as shown below:

COMMENTS ON PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT ON INDIA
IFFCO FERTILISER PROJECT (LOAN 1079-IN) THE WORLD BANK
PAGE 2 - PARA 1.04:
In the last sentence of this para, the figure relating to
cooperative institutions be changed to 27,000 instead of 28,000
and the amount of IFFCO's equity of Ru. 145 million mentioned may
be changed to Rs. 360 million without any change in the description.
These changes could bei incorporated into the report.
PAGE 3 - PARA 2.03:
The fee payable to Government of India on the loan over and above
the interest of 8% may please be read as 2.25% and not 2.5% indicated
in the report.
PAGE 3 - PARA 2.04:
In the last but one line, the quantities of raw materials to be
used in the project are mentioned as tpd against fuel oil and coal
which may please be changed to tpa.
PAGE 4 - PARA 3.02:
In the third line from the bottom, kindly delete the statement
"a gain of 3% in process efficiency".
PAGE 5 - PARA 3.07t
The latter part of the para may be slightly elaborated as indicated
below from 1Tth line.
"During the conatruction.........Construction Managers" appearing in the
17th line of this paragraph.
"IFFCO also involved actively at a sufficiently early stage its
operating and maintenance supervisory personnel for inspection ch cks
for site constwuctiont follow-up with the site contractors and all
pre-commissioning activitiees.
PAGE 6 - PARA 3.09:
Slight elaboration of this para is suggested as mentioned belows
"For junior operators and technicians, it recruited 228 young
engineers, science graduates and qualified craftsman, whom they submitted
to comprehensive two years epecialised training programmes, at IFFCO's
Kalol Plant using elaborate training materials prepared by senior
supervisory personnel. These trainees, after completion of class room
training were given on the job training in various sections of operations
of the Kalol Unit6nd finally, they were also given the opportunity for
independently operating the Ursa Plant.   In all, the Projact...........**"

ANNEX 13
- 34 -                     Page 3 of 6
PAGE 6 - PARA 3.10:
It is suggested that this para may please be modified to read
as under:-
"The Project did experience delay due to some delay in Engineering
carried out by all consultants which delayed procurement of bulk
materials. Also some materials procured through inadequate specifications
required replacement after it had already been applied which delayed
mechanical completion by about two months. Finally, IFFCO staff felt
that the expediting carried out by the consultants was not satisfactory
and that some of the delays experienced at the supplier's shops could
have been avoided. There were also deficiencies in ordering of bulk
materials for piping and insulation etc., resulting in issuing large
number of purchase orders at a sufficiently late stage.   IFFCO had to
depute two of its personnel to USA for expediting these critical items
for project completion and arranging for their air freightAmg".
PAGE 6 - PARA 3.11:
In seventh line from top, the word "connection" is to be corrected
to wconvection".
PAGE 7 - PARA 3.12:
The pars has been modified end may please be read as unders
Most of the major equipment ordered outside India were suppliid
within 2 or 3 months of their promised delivery. However, the bulk
piping and instrument materials ordered outside India were late, at times
by as much as 6 months. Most of the major equipment ordered in India
were delayed by 6 to 12 months from contractual delivery dates. As a
result of the delays explained earlier (pare 3.10 bad 3.11), these items
were not on the critical path contributing to further delays.   IFFCO had
major problems in this respect with the structural steel contractor who
completed the structural steal work 17 months behind commitment because
of lack of manpower, inadequate shop quality control and deficient
planning.  IFFCO also encountered delivery problems for vessels ordered
in India because of strikes at the suppliers shoo. In total, lats
deliveries of equipment and material particularly in bulk piping and
fittings, etc., of foreign supplies delayed the project contractual,
mechanical completion date by about seven months which also covers a
delay of about a month due to congestion at Bombay Port and two months
on account of delays by structural stesel contractor.
PAGE 7 - PARA 3.13:
The last sentence at the end of para reading aes explained above,
this large share of local supplies did delay project mechanical
zompletion by about seven months when measured against contractual
arrangeT.,0tsO is not relevant since the value of the equipment involved
:ompared to the Indian fabrication capacity is not much. On the other
hand, it brings out the fa,t that the Indian industry has successfiully
been able to procure orders for a significant value of the requirements
of the fertiliser plant.

ANNEX 13
- 35 -                    Page 4 of 6
PAGE 7 & 8 - PARA 3.141
The last sentence should be read as under with corrections:
*As explained above, 5 of these 12 months of contractual delays
are due to slow plant erection because of faulty material and
equipment2(Para 3.10 and 3.11) and 7 are due to late delivery of
vessels and material purchased from Indian/Foreign supplie rs
(Para 3.12)
PAGE 9 - PARA 3.16:
The data preseinted is at variance with the project costs being
used by IFFCO, presumably due to a difference in the system of presen-
tation of the data on the project. We heve separately commented on
the same presented in more detail subsequently in Annexure S. Any
changes as a result of our comments therein would also call for
incorporation in the table under this para as well.
PAGE 9 and 10 - PARAS 3.17. 3.18 and 3.19:
The figures appearing in the above paras may undergo a change if
any modification is made in the project cost as a result of our comments.
PAGE 13 - PARA S0_:
The return on net worth guaranteed by the Government before tax
at present is 27.5%, which may vary depending on the tax on profits.
PAGE 15 - PARA 7.01 s
The last but one sentence may be read as unders
"The Bank has also worked closely with the Government to ensure
that IFFCO's highly competent Managing Director would not retire before
Project Completion."

In the orgenisation chart, kindly replace Purchase Manager by
Superintendent Purchase and Stores Section by Superintendent Stores.

approved capital cost by the Government is Rs. 163.5 million as
against a figure of Rs. 134.0 million shown in the completion
report prepared by the World Bank.
ii)   We presume that Project Management charges considered by the
World Bank includes Insurance charges amounting to Rs. 10.5
million.
iii)  Pro-operating cost as suggested above is worked out as unders

(a)  Cost towards operating expenses               163.0

iv)   In the approved capital cost of Phulpur Project the workw.ng
capital has been shown as Rs. 34.0 million as against Rs. 122.9
million considered by the World Bank.
This may also please be'noted that there is variance in Foreign
and Local allocations shown by the World Bank and the Capital cost
approved by the Government of India for most of the items, though
the final figures itomwise remaining unchanged.
