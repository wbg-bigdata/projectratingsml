MENORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVEWPNENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED WAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$284.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 20 years, including five
years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would help
finance an Industrial Restructuring Project.  Belgium and the Netherlands
would provide US$6.2 million equivalent as grants.
2.       Bckgroun.  The Indonesian industrial sector 1/ has, in the last
decade, grown in size and importance, making steadily increasing contributions
to GDP and employment growth. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the
sector grew by more than 12% p.a., while real GDP increased by about 7% p.a.
This growth was based mainly on rising oil revenues and the ensuing expansion
in domestic demand, as well as on public lnvestment in import-substituting
industries, with export growth playing a minor role. This inward-looking
policy regime led to a high-cost and inefficient industrial economy. In
response to a deteriorating external ernironment and to foster the development
of a dynamic, competitive and efficient non-oil economy, the Government of
Indonesia in 1983 initiated a series of policy reforms, aimed at:
(a) liberalizing industrial and trade regulations and the incentives regime;
(b) improving the efficiency of the financial sector; and (c) establishing the
institutional framework required to support non-oil export growth. The
combination of a significant exchange rate devaluation, a reduction of trade
barriers, and the relaxation of industrial regulations led to an increase in
employment and growth, as the sector became increasingly oriented towards
exports. These measures have led manufacturing to grow by 6% p.a. in 1984-87
and non-oil exports to increase by 13% p.a. in 1982-86. However, to achieve
the Government's projected growth in manufacturing exports of about 10% p.a.
in real terms between 1986/87 and 1990/91, Indonesian manufacturing would need
to continue improving its international competitiveness and efficiency
supported by further trade, industrial, regulatory and financial policy
reforms.
3.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Until recently, Bank financial
support for Indonesia's industrial sector mainly involved industrial
development finance operations together with a few direct loans for major
projects. That approach was necessary due to wide-spread economic
distortions, stemming from the proliferation of regulations affecting
virtually all aspects of trade and industry. The Government's reform
initiatives have prompted the Bank to provide additional, and more directed,
support to industry. This includes support for trade policy and industrial
deregulation through two Trade Policy Adjustment Loans, policy dialogue on
further reforms, studies of industrial regulation and the financial sector,
financial assistance for exporters as well as support for export policies and
export infrastructure through two Export Development Projects, and technical
and financial assistance for small and medium industrial enterprises. A

natural gas production and oil refining.

private sector development loan is under preparation. The proposed project,
the first in a planned series of industrial restructuring operations, would be
an integral part of this new strategy. The Bank's experience in other
countries, where significant policy-induced changes in the incentive framework
have resulted in distress for individual enterprises, points to the need for
complementary actions to promote rapid and efficient adjustment to the new
policy regime through support to enterprise restructuring. The proposed
project has therefore been designed to recognize such a need and assist
enterprises, through the provision of technical advice and credit, to
transform themselves into efficient competitors in an increasingly market-
oriented economy. The project deals with three subsectors that are expected
to play an increasing role in the industrial economy as the reform process
proceeds and further distortions are reduced. The Government, in a letter of
policy intent addressed to the Bank, has confirmed its commitment to the
further removal of policy distortions remaining in these subsectors. The
project would contribute to the improvement of environmental conditions
concomitant with industrial development. The project would also complement
other ongoing operations designed to support the development of industrial
enterprises, in particular the Second Export Development Project (Loan
2979-I4D) and the Small and Medium Industrial Enterprise Project, which is
being presented to the Executive Directors concurrently with this project.
4.       Project Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are
threefold: (a) to assist existing industrial enterprises in three selected
subsectors--engineering, pulp and paper, and textiles--to undertake viable,
environmentally sound, restructuring investments; (b) to strengthen
institutional capabilities and technical services assisting the three
subsectors; and (c) to evaluate the restructuring potential of other
industrial subsectors. The restructuring investments would help enterprises
to adjust to policy reform through such activities as rehabilitation,
modernization, rationalization of product mix, improvements to product
quality, balancing of production line, upgrading of technology, strengthening
of organizational and managerial capabilities, and expansion of existing
operations.
5.       Project DescriDtion.  The proposed project would include:  (a) An
Investment Component to provide financial assistance, through twelve PFIs, for
restructuring projects, including environmental actions, in eligible
enterprises subject to agreed selection criteria; (b) a Technical Assistance
Comonent to: (i) strengthen the domestic capacity to deliver operational,
technical and managerial help to enterprises; and (ii) improve the capability
of the participating financial institutions to evaluate the technical,
environmental, financial and economic aspects of restructuring proposals; and
(c) a Studies Comnonent for preparation of a second restructuring project.
6.       For the Investment Component, the Government will on-lend the
proceeds of the loan to twelve PFIs 2_ for a period of 15 years, including
three years of grace, at a variable interest rate determined on a six-month

basis and equal to the weighted average cost of interest-bearing rupiah
customer deposits (currently about 13.6% p.a.), subject to a floor of the
Bank's rate plus 1.75%. The Bank loan would be channeled by the Ministry of
Finance: directly to the state commercial banks and BAPINDO; and indirectly
through Bank Indonesia to the private commercial banks, PDFCI and UPPINDO.
The Government would bear the direct foreign exchantge risk on the Bank loan,
receiving compensation for this risk from the spread (currently about 6% p.a.)
between the Bank's rate and the on-lending rate to the PFIs. The PFIs would
on-lend funds at prevailing market rates. A subproject free limit of
US$1.5 million is proposed for the PFIs. However, the fitst two subloans by
each PFI will be subject to the Bank's prior review and approval regardless of
subloan size. Individual subloans would be at least US$250,000 and would not
exceed US$10.0 million. However, pipeline evaluation shows a demand for
subloans in excess of the proposed funding ceiling. Given the restructuring
significance of these subprojects, a maximum of three subprojects above the
subloan ceiling (preferably one in each subsector) will be consideved for
financing under the loan. These subprojects will be appraised jointly by the
Bank and the proponent PFI. The PFIs will utilize their own funds to finance
subproject costs unmet by the proposed Bank loan proceeds or by sponsors'
equity. For the Technical Assistance Component, the Government will pass on
the proceeds of the loan as follows: (a) for institutional strengthening and
technical services, as a grant to the Ministry of Industry (MOI). The MOI's
Agency for Industrial Research and Development (BPPI) will be respon&ible for
implementing and monitoring these activities; and (b) for training of PFI's
staffs, as a grant through Bank Indonesia to the Indonesian Banking
Development Institute (LPPI), which will implement this activity. For the
Studies Component, the Government will pass on the proceeds of the loan as a
grant to MOI.
7.       The total project cost and financing required is estimated to be
US$506.1 million, including identifiable taxes and duties of US$1.1 million.
Foreign exchange requirements are estimated at US$289.2 million (57% of total
cost). The proposed Bank loan of US$284.0 million equivalent (56% of
financing requirements) would cover the following: (a) US$265.0 million of
the investment component cost; (b) US$3.5 million of the equipment and
materials cost of the institutional strengthening and technical services
activities; (c) US$0.5 million of the training cost for PFI staff;
(d) US$13.0 million of consultants costs; and (e) US$2.0 million of studies'
costs. Finance for the Technical Assistance Component would also be provided
as grants by bilateral donors: Belgium and the Netherlands, for
US$4.5 million and US$1.7 million equivalent, respectively. Part of the
technical services and training costs would be recovered from the respective
beneficiaries. Retroactive financing for up to US$26.5 million will be
provided to the PFIs, for subloans approved after September 26, 1988. For
each PFI, this provision will be limited to 10% of its respective subsidiary
loan allocation. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Disbursement details are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key
processing steps and the status of Bank Group operations are in Schedules C
and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7558-IND, dated March
31, 1989, is being distributed separately.

8.      Agreements Reached. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
from the Government and the PFFI regarding: (a) eligibility criteria for
PFIs' initial and continued participation in the project; (b) criteria for
enterprise and subproject selection, including assessment of the subproject's
environmental impact; (c) loan amounts to be allocated to the PFIs and related
lending terms; (d) financial terms and conditions of subloans; (e) a mid-term
review of project technical services activities to determine the feasibility
of continuing these services after project completion; and (f) cost recovery
arrangements for technical services and training provided under the project.
9.       Conditions of disbursement would be:  (a) for investment subloans
that (i) all PFIs had complied with the financial eligiblity criteria;
(ii) all PFIs had finalized a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with NOF or an
On-lending Agreement with BI, as appropriate, on terms and conditions
acceptable to the World Bank; and (iii) all subloans had complied with the
eligibility criteria; (b) for consultant services that the consultants to be
financed out of the proceeds of the Belgium and the Netherlands grants had
been retained; and (c) for training of PFIs' staff that the Financial
Arrangement between BI and LPPI had been finalized.
10.      Conditions of loan effectiveness would be the signing of Subsidiary
Loan Agreements between MOF and BI, and between MOF and at least three State-
owned commercial banks, on terms and conditions acceptable to the World Bank.
U1.      Benefits and Risks. The principal benefit will be improved
subsectoral performance through the facilitation of enterprise restructuring.
Specifically, the project should lead to: improved capacity utilization,
increased cost competitiveness, improved product quality, greater dispersion
of technology, improved production and marketing strategies, increased
domestic value-added and greater foreign exchange savings and earnings. By
establishing specific environmental criteria that must be met for any
subproject, the project will contribute to reducing adverse environmental
effects. By strengthening the credit delivery system, the project will help
to ensure high-quality appraisal of investment proposals. By providing
technical assistance, the project will strengthen existing technical
institutions and services supporting the subsectors. A possible risk is that
the demand for both technical assistance and credit may not develop to the
extent anticipated; however, demand far exceeding project estimates was
confirmed during appraisal through interviews with PFIs, enterprises,
subsector associations and government agencies.
12.     Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
