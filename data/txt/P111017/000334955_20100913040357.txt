I   1       INTRODUCTION

    1.1     Project background

    (1)      The Padma MUltipurpose Bridge Project (PMBP) is designed to remove the last major physical
    barrier in the road connection between Dhaka and the Southwest region of Bangladesh, where about
    one quarter of the population of Bangladesh is living. Currently there is a rather unreliable ferry
    connection over the Padma River, with limited capacity and long waiting times. Ferry services are
    sometimes interrupted for days during fog and high floods. A number of these ferryboats are obsolete
    and often overloaded and frequent accidents happen, some of them resulting in considerable loss of
    life. Through the construction of the Padma Bridge the unreliable and unsafe ferry connection will be
    replaced by a reliable and safe fixed river crossing. The bridge will shorten the distance from the
    Southwest to Dhaka by 100 km and travelling time will considerably be reduced. When completed
    there will be a reliable highway connection between Dhaka and the landport of Banapole, the seaport
    of Mongla and the district capitals of Khulna and Barisal, see Figure 1.1, Location of the project. More
    details are shown in Figure 2.1 Project area details. By inclusion of a provision for a railway crossing
    the Padma Bridge will offer the possibility to construct a new ralway connection between Dhaka and
    the Southwest. Padma bridge will also include river crossings for m~ior utility connections to the
    Southwest including gas and communication lines.

    (2)      The proposed 6.15 km long bridge will form an integral part of the realisation of the
    transnational Asian Highway network (Asian Highway no I), which construction programme was
    ratified by the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) in 2004. In the Road Master plan for Bangladesh,
    prepared in 2007, the development of this highway (also called National Highway no 8) the Padma
    Bridge and two other missing links are indicated as high priority projects. The highway is of national
    importance since it forms the link between Dhaka and the Southwest and two major ports ofthe
    country. GOB has approved this Master plan, earmarked the Project as a national priority project for
    early implementation. By completing this project the way is opened for accelerated socio-economic
    development of the Southwest region, which is currently a rather isolated and underdeveloped area
    separated from the rest of the country. The incidence of poverty in the southwest region is higher than
    in the rest of the country. The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of the SW region (Khulna and Barisal
    divisions) is only 17.4 % as compared to 38 % in the Dhaka division. The Padma Bridge will help to
    stimulate economic activity in the S W region by providing a reliable and rapid transport connection.

    (3)      The project area is located at 35 km distance southwest of Dhaka. The bridge will be
    constructed between a site near the small town of Mawa, situated at the North side of the river and
    Janjira, a village on the South side of the Padma River. Components ofthe project such as approach
    roads and bridge-end-facilities will affect an area of six km inland on the Mawa side and four km
    inland at the Janjira side, whereas bridge and river training works may affect a river of 15 km length
    upstream and seven km length downstream. The project area includes sections located in three
    separate administrative districts: Munshiganj district on the Mawa side (North bank) and Shariatpur
    and Madaripur districts on the Janjira Side (South bank). Upazillas on the North bank are Lauhajong
    and Sreenagar and the South bank Janjira and Shibchar.


    1.2     Previous studies

    (4)      Since the late nineties several studies have been carried out to investigate the possibilities of
    constructing a bridge over the Padma River. In 2000 a pre-feasibility report was prepared by the
    Government of Bangladesh, which concluded that the construction of a bridge over the Padma River
    was the most viable solution for connecting Dhaka with the Southwest of the country. The alternative
    was to modernize the existing ferry connections; this was abandoned due to a number of technical and
    economic reasons. The pre-feasibility study concentrated on two potential locations for the bridge: 0)
    the present site near the Mawa-Janjira ferry and (ii) an alternative site near Paturia - Goalundo. A first
    Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) was carried out for these two options.

(5)     Based on a request from GOB, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) conducted
a feasibility study during 2002-2004. This study investigated four possible locations for the bridge and
concluded that the most feasible bridge site is at the Mawa-Janjira point. After evaluation this
selection was approved by GOB. The final feasibility study (March 2005) included, among others, a
preliminary technical design and an economic and financial evaluation. As the feasibility study found
that the Padma Bridge is economically viable, the GOB moved ahead for implementation and
accordingly the GOB requested BBA to prepare an updated EIA and EMP during 2006 on basis of the
guidelines for preparing an EIA from GOB and JICA.

(6)      The Asian Development Bank (ADB) also conducted a feasibility study with a preliminary
engineering design, including an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and resettlement plan in
2006-2007. This study (ADB PPTA, May 2007) was prepared on basis of the ADB Guidelines for
environmental assessments and amongst others also reviewed and analyzed the existing relevant
legislation of Bangladesh. The above mentioned studies formed the basis for the decision of GOB to
proceed with phase two ofthe project: the detailed engineering design and implementation of the
Padma Bridge.

(7)     Early 2009 the GOB commissioned MAUNSELLIAECOM in association with nbc, SMEC
and ACE to prepare the detailed engineering design of the bridge itself and of the approach roads with
small bridges and culverts, of the river training works and of the service areas and associated
structures, and of the required resettlement sites. The prospective Co-financiers, including the World
Bank, the Asian Development Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency and the Islamic
Development Bank reviewed the various reports and concluded that a detailed EIA report had to be
prepared on basis of the detailed design which would be in full compliance with the harmonized
safeguard requirements of GOB and the Co-financiers.


1.3     Project components

(8)     The bridge will be a 6.15 km long fixed crossing double deck steel bridge over the River
Padma with a four-lane divided motorway and provisions for a railway line and for utility crossings
such as a gas pipeline and communication lines. The components of the project consist of:
 A 6.15 km long two-level steel truss main bridge with a four -lane divided highway on the upper
  deck and a provision for a single track railway on the lower deck;
 Bridge end facilities (BEF) that include toll plazas on both sides of the river totalling 22.3 ha and
  service areas (27 ha at the Mawa side and 63.7 ha at the Janjira side) for various functions such as
  emergency services, construction management and, particularly on the Janjira side tourism in the
  post-construction period;
 Transition structures that include road and railway viaducts from the bridge to the approach roads.
  The road viaduct in Mawa is 2.0 km long, while the Janjira road viaduct is about 1.9 km. The length
  of the rail viaduct is 2.8km in Mawa and 2.9km in Janjira
 The approach roads to the bridge consist of2.3 km four -lane divided highway on the Mawa side
  and 12.8 km on the Janjira side. They include six bridges (30 270 m) over local waterways, seven
  local road underpasses, 14 drainage culverts and 11 junctions.
 Future provision of railway on the lower deck of the bridge;
 Four resettlement sites (two on the Mawa side: RS02: Jasaldia with area 13.96ha and RS03:
  Kumarbhog with area 15.46 ha and two on the Janjira side: RS:4: Paschim Naodoba with area
  19.95ha and RS05: Bakborerkandi with area 18.45 ha) for relocation and resettlement of households
  and business enterprises, including the required supporting infrastructure and services, such as
  schools, mosques, clinics, markets, utilities etc.; and
 River training works, including 2.0 km of river bank protection on the Mawa side along North bank
  near Mawa and 12.5 km bank protection on the Janjira side and along the South bank.

The main components of the project are shown in Figure 2.1 and chapter 2.

1.4     Environmental Impact Assessment.

(9)     The project will have considerable environmental and social impacts. This Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) describes the most significant environmental impacts ofthe bridge and
associated works on the physical, natural, cultural and socio-economic environment, including the
mitigation or compensation measures and an Environmental Management Plan (EMP).

(10)     The Padma River combines the outflow of two of the longest rivers in the world: the Ganges
and the Brahmaputra. Taking into consideration that the bridge and associated works are for a large
part situated in the active floodplain of the Padma River, the environmental impacts of the project are
considerable. The project area is densely populated, but simultaneously also part of a very dynamic
environment consisting of moving river channels, sandbanks and cultivated temporary wetlands,
known as chars. The environmental assessment addresses the impacts on the physical, the biological
and the human environment and identifies mitigating measures. The EIA has been prepared to ensure
that the PMBP is environmentally sound and sustainable and in compliance with the agreed
harmonized safeguard requirements of the Co-financers and GOB.

(II) The project involves a considerable land acquisition and resettlement effort. It is anticipated
that more than 76,000 persons will be affected, either by losing land, losing structures or loss of
business or employment. For that reason a separate Social Assessment has been prepared, including a
Social Action Plan, which incorporates the results of the socio-economic surveys, the programme for
land acquisition and compensation, including an agreed framework for resettlement, resettlement
action plans for the various components ofthe project and a programme for livelihood restoration.

(12) This EIA study has been based upon a Terms of Reference agreed by all parties to the project,
taking into consideration the Harmonized Safeguard Measures ofthe Co-financers World Bank (WB),
Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JlCA), Islamic
Development Bank (IDB) and GOB. Also the results of previous environmental studies implemented
during the JlCA-financed feasibility study (2005), the subsequent Bangladesh Bridge Authority study
(2006) and the ADB project preparation study (2007) were incorporated, including the findings of a
number of additional studies requested in the TOR of this Environmental Assessment (EA). Potential
mitigating measures are described and included in an Environmental Management Plan, including
implementation schedules, budgets, responsibilities, institutional requirements and a monitoring plan.

(13) The approach selected was based on participation and consultation of stakeholders. Also
experiences from a previous and a very comparable project. the construction of the Jamuna Bridge
completed in 1998, have been incorporated in the plan.


1.5     The EIA team

(14) The Environmental Impact Assessment was prepared by team of consultants, including one
BBA advisor Dr. Prasad Modak during early stages, three international consultants Dr Masud Karim
(Lead Environmental Specialist), Dr Venkata Nukala (Environmental Specialist) and Mr M. Winsby
(Ecologist) and seven national consultants Dr Md Nazim Uddin (Environmental Engineer), Ahmed Al

Ashok Das (Ecologist),Mr Shabuddin (Fisheries Expert), Malik Fida Khan and Nandon Mukharjee
(Climate Change Specialist), and Md M. Hossain Sarker (GIS) and reviewed by one advisor Dr.
Prasad Modak, and two independent environmental consultants Mr Reitse Koopmans and Mr Hans
van Zon. During the studies and presentations comments were received from an independent Panel of
Experts including an international environmentalist Dr Erik Helland Hansen, the national advisor on
environment Prof. Feroz Ahmed, the national advisor on climate change Dr Ainun Nishat and the
international sociologist Dr Masahide Horita.

II   2        PROJECT DESCRIPTION

     2.1      Development objective.

     (15) The main development objective of the project is to establish a permanent road crossing,
     including a provision for a future railway crossing over the Padma River, replacing the existing
     unreliable and unsafe ferries. This would remove an important obstacle in the development of National
     Highway 8 (Asian Highway no 1) that will connect Dhaka with the Southwest region of Bangladesh.
     Together with a provision for a future railway link connecting Dhaka (Narayanganj) with Khulna in
     the Southwest this would open the way for an accelerated economic development of this rather
     isolated region of Bangladesh. The project will include a bridge across the Padma River, approach
     viaducts for road and railway, major river training works, approach roads and embankments and
     bridge end facilities. The total project area of about 250 km2 and the individual project components are
     indicated in Figure 2.1. Components of the project such as approach roads and bridge-end-facilities
     will affect an area of six km Northwards on the Mawa side and four km Southwards at the Janjira side,
     whereas bridge and river training works may affect an area 15 km upstream and seven km downstream
     in and along the river, measured from the proposed bridge site.

(16) The main bridge will be 6.15 km long and will comprise of a two level steel truss bridge with a
concrete deck carrying a four-lane divided highway on top. The width of the bridge will be 22.5 m.
The lower level of the steel truss will have a provision for a single railway track and utility crossings
such as a high pressure gas pipeline and an optical fibre telecommunication cable. The bridge will
consist of 41 spans of 150 m length each. The substructure will consist of 42 concrete piers, each
resting on a pile cap on top of eight piles driven to a depth of 103 m into the riverbed. The
navigational clearance of the bridge is about 18.3 m from the Standard High Water Level (SHWL)
which is sufficient for the largest types of inland vessels.


2.3     River training works.

(17) Substantial River Training Works (RTW) are required to protect the project infrastructure
against erosion by the river. The north bank of the Padma is relatively high and stable. Here only about
two km of revetment will be constructed to reinforce the current embankment and to protect the
landing site of the bridge. The situation along the south bank is more complex. This part of the project
is situated in the active flood plain and subject to very dynamic processes. The area near the landing
site at Janjira is currently affected by strong bank erosion, whereas the South channel is being silted up
requiring frequent dredging to keep it open and accessible for the ferries. However this situation could
easily change in coming years. Study of river dynamics revealed that more erosion could be expected
along the southern side of the river. Especially the southern approach road which runs not far from the
South channel embankment has to be protected. After extensive geotechnical and hydro-
morphological model studies it was decided to establish a continuous 12.53 km long revetment works
at Janjira side and about 2km at Mawa Side to protect the bridge including approaches BEF, RS etc.
(at various levels) to protect the present embankment, with a possibility for extension.

(I 8)    The RTW along the embankments are partly constructed on land and mostly in the submerged
parts of the bank revetment. A gully up to depth of -25m (type 1,2 and 3) and to -15m (type 4 and 5)
below PWD will be dredged into the riverbed in front of the embankment. The slope of 1:6 along the
side of the bank revetment will be protected with rock riprap or several layers of geobags placed on a
geotextile filter. The upper slope has a wave protection of concrete blocks underlain by a geo-textile
filter. On the bottom of the gully a layer of2-3 m of rocks (average weight 100 kg) will be deposited
with a width of30-45 m the so called "falling apron". The falling apron protects the slope against
scour and further erosion as is shown in Figure 2.2 and Figure 2.3. At the riverside of the gully a 1:5
slope is dredged into the riverbed. The total width of the strip of riverbe dire vetment, which has to be
dredged, is between 402 and 235 m depending of the type ofRTW and the depth of the riverbed.


2.4     Approach roads and transition structures.

(l9) The approach road on the relatively high Mawa side will be about 2.3 km long. Along the
south bank there will be a 12.8 km long road which will be raised above maximum flood leveL The
width of the approach roads on both sides of the river will be 23.6 m. They will consist of two lanes on
both sides with a lane width of3.65 m and two meter of hard shoulders. The road is designed with a
four meter central median with a 30 cm up-stand to prevent vehicles from crossing this central reserve.
Along the road there is sufficient space on both sides for a service road and for plantation of trees.

(20) The approach road on the South side crosses a number of small streams and natural gullies
draining the area. Since this part of the floodplain is inundated annually by one or more meters of
floodwater a number of structures is required to restore and maintain the natural drainage pattern of
the area, including outfalls to the South channel. In total there will be six bridges (between 30 m and
270 m long) and 14 drainage culverts. Also there will be seven underpasses oflocal roads. Other local
roads will be connected to service roads that run parallel to the main highway.

(21) Approach viaducts will be constructed to connect the approach road with the main bridge,
while people and vehicles and goods can underpass the road. On the Mawa side there is a length of
approximately 1.0 Ian of road viaducts, whereas on the Janjira side the length is around 0.95 Ian with a
maximum slope of 4%. The span of the road viaduct is 30 m. The viaducts for the railway have a total
length of3.96 Ian and have a slope of maximum 0.5%

2.5     Bridge end facilities.

(22) The bridge end facilities consist of toll plaza's and service areas on both sides of the river. The
required areas will be filled with 3-5 m dredged material to raise the level sufficiently above maximum
flood level. The toll plazas in Mawa and Janjira side will be identical, but the Janjira toll gate is
considered to be a spare facility for the time being. Both sites have ancillary facilities and a
weighbridge. The site in Janjira will be further developed to be an emergency response station,
including trauma facilities to ensure proper handling of traffic accidents and as a stand-by in case of
any other emergencies or accidents on the bridge. The service area on the north bank will occupy
about 27 ha whereas on the south bank a larger area of almost 64 ha will be needed. Each service area
will have offices for consultants and BBA, a laboratory, housing for engineers and sports areas and
associated facilities during construction. Both service areas will be designed to accommodate a police
station, a restaurant, food courts, shops and kiosks, a mosque, a visitor centre and an observation
tower, sufficient parking space for visitors and staff, project offices, staff accommodation and housing,
club house and entertainment facilities and a medical clinic.


2.6     Construction yards

(23) Two construction yards, one in Mawa and the other in Janjira are proposed for providing
contractors with the necessary lands for carrying out construction works and storage of construction
materials. In Mawa a newly emerged Charland (81 ha) to the south of the Main bridge approach is
selected. This area will be filled with dredge material up to maximum flood level and will be protected
by so-called "temporary RTW". The Janjira construction yard will include a harbour and will be used
as the "staging area" for materials and equipments for the construction of the main bridge. The
requisition (temporary lease) of some 78 ha of land is needed along the river embankment. Both
construction yards will be filled with dredged material to raise the level of the surface sufficiently
above maximum flood level.


2.7     Utility crossings

(24) There will be provision for a 30-inch diameter high pressure main pipeline for natural gas on
the bridge in the lower deck. There is also a provision foreseen for laying an optical fibre cable at the
side of the bridge at the first level of the superstructure. There will be a walkway for bridge
maintenance which can also be used for train evacuation in case of emergency. The project will also
finance the construction of platforms for a 400-kv double circuit line about 1-2 km downstream of the
bridge. 6 platforms will be constructed on foundations similar to piers but with lighter design load to
accommodate transmission towers with landing platforms and ladders.


2.8     Land acquisition and resettlement.

(25) The implementation of the proj ect will require the acquisition of 1,144 ha of land. Almost half
of the land to be acquired is needed for the construction of river training works. An area of about 159
ha is needed for the development of construction yards, but half of it is already government land (char
at Mawa). The land used for the CY which is partly agricultural land will be leased for a period of six
years and then returned to the owners as non-agricultural reclaimed land and suitable for residential or
commercial use. Land acquisition for the project will affect at least 13,501 households, estimated at
some 73,329 persons. It has been estimated that in 63% of the cases farmland alone will have to be
acquired (partial or entire farms). In 34% of the cases structures, such as houses and commercial
structures, will have to be acquired. Other households will be indirectly affected through loss of
employment (e.g. ferries and associated commercial establishments, fisheries) and income.
Households that lose their homes andlor commercial structures will be able to resettle in one of the
four resettlement sites, two on each river bank, totalling about 68 ha. The sites have been carefully
selected and land acquisition and demarcation of areas is well underway. Resettlement plans have been
developed in a participatory approach with the affected households.

3.3     Relevant national policies

(35)    During recent years a number of national policy documents have been prepared and where
accepted by GOB. These policy initiatives, strategies and plans all emphasize consideration of the
environment and natural resources in order to achieve sustainable development. A summary ofthe
major relevant policy documents prepared is given in Table 3.2. It is relevant to mention that GOB has
prepared a National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction showing its strong commitment to
achieving the Millennium Development Goals as defined by the UN. While the Government has made
important strides towards achieving these targets, this report highlights a number of sources of
environmental degradation that merit greater emphasis, not only to bring Bangladesh closer to
achieving its targets but also to contribute to the removal of environmental constraints to poverty-
reducing growth.

3.4     Environmental Impact Assessment

3.4.1 Categories ofprojects
(36)     Under the Environmental Conservation Rules (1997) a classification system was established
for development projects and industries on basis of the location, the size and the severity of potential
pollution. There are four categories of projects: green, orange A, orange B and red with respectively
no, minor, medium and severe environmental impacts. For the red category of projects a full EIA is
required. All regional and national highway, railway and bridge projects of over 100 m length fall in
the red category. The orange B category includes feeder and district roads and bridges under 100 m
length.

(37)   The PMBP with a length of more than six km clearly falls under the red category of projects.
The Environmental Impacts Assessment should include the prediction, evaluation and mitigation of
environmental impacts and an Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The approval of the EIA and
EMP is required before submitting an application for an Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC).
The procedure is shown in Figure 3.1.

3.4.2 Present status
(38) Conditional approval was received from the Department of Environment on June 13, 2007
following submission by BBA of the EIA Report of the ADB PPTA feasibility study (2007). The
following conditions applied:
 Project Proponent may undertake activities for land development and infrastructural development of
  the project with taking consideration of the ECR 1997;
 Limit conditions for discharges to air and water according to Environment Conservation Rules,
  1997, Annex I & II;
 The ambient noise levels shall conform to the standards prescribed under Noise Pollution (Control)
  Rules, 2006;
 Proper environmental monitoring and recording should be maintained. Monitoring parameters are:
  water flow, water quality, air quality, the surrounding areas for spread of invasive species, the
  changes in aquatic habitats before, during and after construction, fish catches during and after
  construction;
 Environmental monitoring reports shall be made available to head quarters and divisional office of
  DOE on a quarterly basis during the whole period of the project;
 The Project authority must notify DOE soonest of incidents causing or threatening material harm to
  the environment;
 Before detailed design of the project further studies should be carried out on the extent of bank
  erosion under project conditions, especially of the South bank; appropriate measures should be
  taken with respect to construction of a guide bund as well as necessary modifications in the
  resettlement and compensation plans; and
 Project Proponent shall apply for an Environmental Clearance Certificate, without which proponent
  shall not start operation of the project.

3.4.3 Environmental Clearance Certificate
(39)    The ECC is issued by the Department of Environment (DOE), the technical arm of the
Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF). DOE has approved the TOR of this study and provided
a number of additional conditions and suggestions to be incorporated in the study. Public participation
or consultation is not a condition in the ECR 1997 and or EIA Guidelines. However, DOE prefers the
proponent to engage in public participation.

3.5     International treaties

(40)    Bangladesh has signed most international treaties, conventions and protocols on environment,
pollution control, bio-diversity conservation and climate change, including the Ramsar Convention,
the Bonn Convention on migratory birds, the Rio de Janeiro Convention on biodiversity conservation
and the Kyoto protocol on climate change. An overview of the relevant international treaties and
conventions signed by GOB is shown in Table 3.3.

3.6     World Bank environmental policies

OPIBPIGP 4.01 - Environmental Assessment
(41)    The World Bank requires an Environmental Assessment (EA) for all projects proposed for
Bank financing, in order to ensure that these projects are environmentally sound and sustainable. The
PMBP was classified as Category A, because of the scope of the expected impacts from construction
and operation, the impacts ofland acquisition on about 13,500 households and the resettlement of
about 4,975 households (26,690 persons), the impacts expected on fisheries and Hilsha migration. An
EIA and EMP were prepared by the projects Design Consultants and the they were reviewed by an
independent consultant.

OPIBP 4.04 - Natural Habitats
(42)    There are no designated conservation areas or nature reserves in the project area. However, OP
4.04 applies, since a part of the area consists of semi-natural charlands in the active
GangeslBrahmaputra flood plain, with typical flood plain habitats and breeding grounds which could
be affected by the project. During the EIA preparation several consultations were held with national
specialists and representatives of the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in order to
plan potential mitigation measures to reduce adverse impacts of the project on riverine habitats and
wetlands, as defined by the Policy.

OP 11.03 - Physical and Cultural Resources
(43)    This policy is triggered for any project that requires an EIA. The project involves large scale
earth moving and dredging up to 30 m deep along both embankments of the Padma River. According
to the Department of Archaeology there are no designated antiquities or monuments in the project
area. However there is always the possibility of chance-finds during earth movements and construction
works. The policy requires a proper management plan for unexpected chance finds during
implementation.

OP 4.12 -Involuntary Resettlement
(44)     It is estimated that about 1,039 ha of land have to be acquired for project works and another
146 ha temporary leased for a period of 6 years. A total of more than 74,000 people will be affected as
a result of different project components. Resettlement is required for about 26,690 people. Separate
social studies have been carried out and a Resettlement Framework and three Resettlement Action
Plans (RAP) have been prepared in close consultation with the affected groups and other stakeholders.
These plans aim at minimizing resettlement and offering adequate compensation or settlement
alternatives in conformity with World Bank policies and Bangladeshi law.

BP 17.50 - Public Disclosure ofInformation
(45)     There are disclosure requirements at every part of the project preparation and implementation
process. Consultation with affected groups and local community has taken place during scoping and
preparation of draft EJA and EMP and will continue throughout project implementation, as necessary.
The Borrower makes the draft EIA and any separate EA report available in country in a local language
and at a public place accessible to project-affected groups and local community prior to appraisal.

Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines
(46)    The EHS Guidelines are safeguard policies with guidelines for environment, health and safety
for development of industrial projects. They contain performance levels and measures that are
considered to be achievable in new facilities at reasonable costs by existing technology.


3.7     Asian Development Bank Policies

ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009)
(47)    The operational policies of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) include operational policies
that seek to avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse environmental and social impacts, including
protecting the rights of those likely to be affected or marginalized by the development process.

Three Safeguard Policies
(48)     ADB's safeguard policy framework consists ofthree operational policies on: (i) the
Environment, (ii) Indigenous Peoples and (iii) Involuntary Resettlement. All three safeguard policies
involve a structured process of impact assessment, planning, and mitigation to address the adverse
effects of projects throughout the project cycle. The safeguard policies require that impacts are
identified and assessed early in the project cycle; plans to avoid, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for
the potential adverse impacts are developed and implemented; and affected people are informed and
consulted during project preparation and implementation.

Basic principle
(50)    A basic principle of the three existing safeguard policies is that implementation of the
provisions of the policies is the responsibility ofthe borrower/client. Borrowers/clients are required to
undertake social and environmental assessments, carry out consultations with affected people and
communities, prepare and implement safeguard plans, monitor the implementation of these plans, and
prepare and submit monitoring reports

Category A project
(51)    The PMBP is classified as category A project, which are projects with a potential for
significant adverse environmental impacts. An EIA and a Summary EA are therefore required to
address significant impacts. After preparation of the ETA the full draft EIA will be disclosed on the
ADB web site for a period of at least 120 days before Board consideration. The final EIA will also be
disclosed on the website upon approval of the document, as well as possible updates during project
implementation and monitoring reports.


3.8     Japan International Cooperation Agency policy

Guidelines JICAlJBIC
(52)   The JICA guidelines for loan aid (Japan Bank for International Cooperation Guidelines for
Confirmation of Environmental and Social Considerations, April 2002) apply for this project.
The guidelines are based on the following principles:

  A wide range of environmental and social impacts should be addressed;
  Measures for environmental and social consideration should be applied from an early stage until
   the monitoring stage;
  During the entire process accountability and transparency should be ensured;
  Stakeholders opinions should play an eminent role in the decision-making process regarding
   environmental and social considerations;
  Information on environmental and social issues should be disclosed in consultation with the
   project proponent;
  The capacity of organizations involved in environmental and social operations should be
   enhanced; and
  Promptness in implementation.


Category A project.
(53) The PMBP project is classified as Category A, as it is likely to have significant environmental
and social impacts. The borrower must submit EIA reports. For projects that will result in large-scale
involuntary resettlement, basic resettlement plans must be submitted.


3.9     Islamic Development Bank

(54) The EIA Guidelines of the Islamic Development Bank are reported to be under preparation and
are yet to be published. Hence, no reference could be made to these guidelines.

  3.10    Harmonized safeguard policies.

  (55)   In view of the different requirements of the potential co-financers of the PMBP a harmonized
  environmental safeguard framework was developed for conducting the EIA study. This framework
  was used to prepare the TOR for the current EIA. The TOR has been reviewed and approved by the
  BBA, DOE and by the potential Co-financiers ofthe project. The harmonized safeguard policies have
  been summarized in Annex A.

4       ANALYSES OF ALTERNATIVES

4.1     Without project scenario.

(55) The without project scenario is not acceptable since this will severely constrain the potential
for socio-economic development in the entire Southwest region where about one quarter of the
Bangladesh population lives. Relative isolation of this part ofthe country because of absence of a
good communication infrastructure, in the form of adequate road and railway connections with the rest
of the country, will further deprive the region of the potential for increased production, provision of
goods and services, relocation and generation of new economic activities and employment. A
stagnating regional economy will affect incomes and increase the number of people living below the
poverty line, especially in the major urban centres such as Khulna and Barisal. Opportunities for more
export through Mongla seaport and Benapole land port will be reduced because of high transport cost.
Current risky and unreliable ferry services will remain in service, often resulting in long waiting times
for trucks (ten hours and more) and cars (two hours). Noise, oil pollution and hindrance of commercial
navigation caused by the fleet of ferries, launches and speedboats crossing the river on daily basis will
continue.


4.2     With project scenarios

4.2.1   Comparison offour different sites of the bridge
(56)    During the Feasibility study (FS), JICA, 2005 four different locations for the bridge were
studied and compared. Out of two preferred options the Mawa- Janjira site was finally selected as the
best option, mainly based on factors such as travel time and distance to Mongla seaport and cost of
associated works. Environmental and social impacts (more or less comparable in the two options)
were also taken into account in this evaluation. Out of three possible types of bridge a bridge with a
180 m span concrete extra-dosed girder superstructure was recommended. The length of the bridge (in
2005) was estimated at 5.6 km. The recommended alternative combined a railway and a road on the
concrete upper deck, comparable with the Jamuna Bridge.

4.2.2   Alternatives in bridge design
(57)     In the detailed design phase four possible bridge design options were studied, including three
options with a bridge superstructure consisting of two levels (road on upper deck and railway below),
including a two-level steel truss bridge. After comparison with the proposed option the one-level .
concrete bridge from the feasibility study it was concluded that concrete bridges are generally more
expensive as compared to a steel truss bridge. Another major advantage of the last is that the
construction of a steel truss is relatively easy and does not need a long time to construct. Thus, finally
a detailed evaluation was made between the single level concrete extra-dosed bridge and the double
level steel truss bridge on basis of the following factors: technical robustness, constructability,
maintenance, cost, social aspects, environmental impacts and proven previous use. In October 2009 a
decision was taken to go ahead with the design of the steel truss bridge, mainly on basis of the factor
construction time, which is only three years, while the concrete bridge would take double this time.
Environmental impacts on river hydrology and aquatic life in the selected option are also lower in
view of the restricted construction time and lower number of piers required. The present bridge design
is based on a bridge length of 6.15 km, since considerable bank erosion has recently taken place on the
unprotected original landing site on the Southern side, near Janjira. Various options for the electricity
line with the Bridge structure were also explored. It was concluded that the costs of the solid insulated
cable supported within the bridge structure would be excessively more than 3 times the suspension
tower cost. The option of constructing the 6 platforms J-2km downstream has been chosen.


4.2.3   Alternative transition structures
(58)    Two options were studied to separate road and railway alignments in order to minimise the
length ofthe viaduct structures. In the first option the four-lane road from the bridge is divided into
two carriageways of which one passes under the railway viaduct. In the second option the whole road
passes over the top of the railway viaduct. The first option has been selected in view oflower cost,


                                                   25
better aesthetics and some technical advantages. The preferred option requires about seven ha more
land acquisition.


4.2.4   Alternatives in design of River Training Works
(59)     The purpose of the river training works is to protect the river bank from erosion so that bridge,
approach roads and railways can remain functional also during high floods. For the relative stable
North bank the risk of erosion is rather low and therefore the design principals of the feasibility study
with some minor modifications have been followed. However the South bank near Janjira is very
vulnerable and susceptible for bank erosion. Since the feasibility study, an area of 500 m deep inland
has been eroded away and from satellite observations in subsequent years this process could be
followed. The optimal type of river training works to be applied has been subject of detailed
hydrological and model studies and consultation of experts. Periodicities in the behaviour of the river
have been established and the most vulnerable points subject to bank erosion and scour were
identified. Also physical and numerical hydraulic model studies were applied to determine the effect
of various options of bank protection.

(60)     Initially there were two major options: alternative one consists of a revetment on the bank of
the Southside channel. This alternative consists of a 12 km continuous revetment bund along the south
bank for protection of all project components on this side of the river. A section of six km of this
revetment near to the bridge would be raised above flood level to prevent overtopping or outflanking
from floodplain flows. The revetment will be constructed in front of the present embankment.
Alternative two consists of a guide bund to protect the landing site of the bridge and two hard points
on the bank of the South side channel to protect the approach road, which is only situated a few km
inland and runs parallel to the bank of the South channel. This alternative was later optimized by
shifting the two hard points across the channel on the charland. This alternative 'two-modified' was
believed to give a better hydraulic performance and would not require the purchase of so much land on
the populated channel bank, where also two ferry ghats are located.

(61)    A detailed comparison however revealed that alternative one will sufficiently prevent bank
erosion of the major project components and has considerable less environmental impacts on river
ecology and charlands. It requires less dredging, but it needs 190 ha of land on the floodplain. It will
not touch any charland. The South channel will remain open which is a sincere wish of the population
on the chars.

(62)     Alternative two-modified requires 52 ha of floodplain and 197 ha of charland. The South
channel will be closed in this alternative. A detailed comparison of these two alternatives concluded
that alternative one is the preferred option.

5.1          The physical environment

5.1.1        Topography

(63)     The project area is situated in the flood plain of the Padma River about 60 Ian downstream of
the confluence of two of Asia's longest rivers the Ganges and the Brahmaputra River. The Ganges
catchment area is around one million lan2 of which only 5% lies in Bangladesh and the Brahmaputra is
about 600,000 lan2 of which 12% lies in the country. The flood plain of the Padma River consist of an
active part where dynamic accretion and erosion processes dominate and somewhat more elevated
slightly older parts which have been formed during the last century. A typical cross-section through
the river valley is shown in figure 5.1.

(64)    The left bank river levee on the Mawa side of the Padma River is silted up to elevations of
around 6.7-7.7 mPWD, which is slightly above max flood level (7.5 m PWD). The right bank or south
side near Janjira shows a pattern of ridges and depressions with elevations between 3.6 and 7.7
mPWD.


5.1.2        Climate.

(65)         The project area has a typical monsoon climate with three main seasons: summer (from March
to May), monsoon (from June to October) and winter (from November to February). Summers are
warm and humid with average monthly temperatures around 28" C, with occasionally moderate to
heavy rainfall. The monsoon period is wet and humid with 80% of total annual rainfall. Winters are
generally cool with low humidity and hardly any rainfall.

(66)     The project area is situated between the two meteorological stations of Dhaka and Madaripur,
both at approximately 40 Ian distance. The first station usually receives more rain with an annual
variation measured over four years between 1,991 and 2,885 mm. The second station receives less
rainfall with 1,501-2,061 mm/year. In figure 5.2 and 5.3 the monthly rainfall distribution for these two
stations is shown.

(67)    Most rain falls in the period May to October with a peak in July (301-753 mm) and a second
one in September. August is often somewhat drier.

(68)    December and January are the coldest months with an average monthly temperature of 18캜,
while April to September are relatively hot months with an average monthly temperature between 28
and 30 C. The maximum daily temperatures recorded are 39캜 for Dhaka and 40 캜 for Madaripur.
The minimum daily temperature in Dhaka is 10캜 and in Madaripur 9캜. During the year the
humidity is high with daily maxima between 95 and 100%.

(69) The wind blows mainly from two directions: during winter there is often a light wind blowing
from the north or northwest. From March to May violent thunderstorms produce winds from the
northwest up to 50 kmlhour. During intense storms in early summer and monsoon season southerly
winds dominate. Exceptional high wind speeds have been recorded in Madaripur during intense storms
(up to 120 kmlhr).

the Lower Ganges/Brahmaputra River flood plain, which is characterized by a relatively stable and
elevated river levee with medium textured soils, which have been silted up to slightly above annual
flood level. At some distance of the river lower lying backswamp deposits (elevation +2.5 to 4.5m)
with clay soils can be found, even with some peat deposits in the lowest parts. The area is densely
populated with most occupation and trees on the high river levee and rice cultivation in the lower lying
areas.

(71)    The South bank near Janjira is located on a North- South oriented meander belt complex,
consisting of parallel sandy ridges and lower lying depressions which are N-S oriented and often with
some form of natural drain or small stream flowing towards the main channel. Homestead
development and trees are found on the higher ridges and on the embankment of the channel
(elevation +5 to 5.5 m). In the lower depressions, which are treeless areas (elevation +3.5 to 4.5m),
different crops are grown in winter and mainly rice in summer. There is also livestock holding in the
area and a number of fish ponds. Towards the Eastern part ofthis area the elevation increases near to
the bridge over the Arial Khan.

(72)     The third unit consists of char Janajat, which is a complex of aggregated chars. A char is a
tract of land surrounded by water, which emerges as a result of hydro-morphological dynamics of a
river. Chars can appear and disappear through accretion and erosion processes. Some chars become
stable once vegetation develops and other chars are attached after the channels separating them have
silted up. Char Janajat is formed during the last 20 years by the braiding and meandering Padma River.
The area consists of mainly vegetated and often cultivated charlands, which are slightly raised above
the average river level (elevation + 2.5 to 4m). About 34% of the charland is cultivated.

5.1.4 Soils
(73)     Soils in the area are of alluvial origin. The river levees have well drained medium textured
greyish-brown soils (mainly loam or silt loams) on top of stratified fine sandy and silty deposits. These
soils are non-saline and non-alkaline and calcareous with around 10% free lime. They can be classified
as Eutric Fluvisols. These soils usually have good physical and chemical properties and have a pH
which varies between 7.5 and 8.0. They are moderately fertile and suitable for a broad range of crops.
At some distance of the river, more land inward, often finer textured grey coloured material has been
deposited in the lower basins and depressions. These soils can be characterized as Calcic Gleysoils,
with humic topsoil and greyish coloured subsoil with typical iron mottling. Groundwater tables often
can be found within 0.20-0.75 m, depending of the season. These soils are very suitable for rice
cultivation. The soils of the charlands consist mainly of very fine sand or silt loam, often stratified.
Outside the monsoon season groundwater tables in the chars can be found near to the surface or at
shallow depth.

5.1.5 Land use
(74) Both embankments of the Padrna River can be characterized as rural areas with agriculture
being the most dominant land use. However on the North (Mawa) side there is more urban and
commercial influence. Distance from Mawa to Dhaka is only 1-1.5 hour by car. The presence of the
capital is reflected in the lower share ofagricultumlland as compared to the other side of the river. On

                                                                       29
the North side of the river only 65% of the land is occupied by farms, whereas more than 86% of the
land on the South side is farmland. Residential development on the North bank is considerably higher
(31 %) than on the South bank (12%). Land use on the chars is completely different. Most people are
fishermen and about 34% ofthe charlands is used for agriculture. A considerable area (43%) is
classified as fallow land (bare, semi-natural grassland, or wetlands covered with sedges and reeds)
partly used for grazing cattle. About 3% of the charlands are occupied by housing and settlements.

(75)    The land use distribution has been mapped with the help of Landsat satellite imagery taken in
1999,2005 and 2009 and in different periods of the year: February, April and November; see figure
5.4. From the imagery it can be seen that most of the area south of the river is cropped during
November and February with winter crops, whereas in April most of the area is fallow. The
development of char Janajat and the silting up of the South Channel towards Kathalbari can be clearly
seen in this sequence of images.

5.1.6    Padma River
(76)    The Padma River is the confluence of two of world longest rivers, the Ganges (2,700 km) and
the Brahmaputra (2,900 km). The rivers have their sources in the gletchers of the Himalaya Mountain
Range and both are draining a huge catchment area in the Indian Plains. The flow of the Padma River
is thus determined by the combined discharges of these two rivers and their respective tributaries.
There is a huge difference in the flow of both rivers during the monsoon and in the dry season. The
dry season flow of the Ganges is usually only about 10% of the monsoon flow, whereas for the
Brahmaputra this might be about 20% ofthe flow during monsoon. The width of the Padma at the
Project site varied in the past from two to six km.

(77)    The behaviour of the riverat Mawa is rather unpredictable and varies between braiding,
straight and meandering in cycles of about 20 years. There were periods that the river flowed as a
single thread, but there were also periods in the past that multiple channels occurred. Historically the
main channel can be located anywhere. Atthe present time it runs near to the North bank, but it is
expected to move towards the South channel. Maximum discharge ofthe Padma River at Mawa
                                                  3
measured during the 1998 flood was 115,711 m /sec. The once in 100 year flood has been estimated at
           3
148,000 m /sec. The average water level slope of the Padma is about five cmlkm.

5.1. 7   The Arial Khan
(78)    The Arial Khan is a distributary of the Padma River that takes off about 15 km upstream from
the proposed bridge alignment. This river has a wet season flow between 2,500 and 4,500 m3/sec. The
Arial Khan acts as a large spill channel of the Padma River. It has a length of 120 km before it
discharges into the Bay of Bengal. The river is a meandering one and has a recent history of bank
movement and formation of meandering loops with occasional natural cuts in those loops. The river is
a very important source of fresh water for agriculture and fish culture in the surrounding areas. It plays
also an important role in the river morphology of the Padma River and the associated development of
char Janajat.

5.1.8    Other sUrface waters
(79) The South channel is a relatively short river channel, which is located near Janjira, separating
the Southern bank ofPadma River and Char Janajat. The channel has been silted up, but is kept open
(by dredging) to facilitate the ferries and other vessels to reach the ferry ghats at Kathalbari and
Kawrakandi and Naodoba village on the South side of the river.

(80) Other surface waters in the area include the Naodoba River: a small tributary with a width of
about 80 m and an average depth of five m. There are a number ofkhals: drainage channels which run
South-North and cross the proposed alignment of the approach road. On the charlands there are beels
(natural depressions) and a number ofbaors (oxbow lakes). Within the project area there are more than
700 fish ponds, see table 5.3. These fish ponds vary considerably in size between 150 m 2 and 3,000
m2  Many of them are surrounded by homesteads trees.

5.1.9 Bank erosion
(81)    The width of the Padma River near the proposed site of the bridge is changing due to major
bank erosion taking place along the South embankment. The embankment near Janjira is rather low
and was subjected to heavy erosion during the last few years. This is the reason that the present design
of the bridge is much longer (6.15 km) than was anticipated during the feasibility study in 2005 (5.6
km). Structural measures through river training works are necessary here to reinforce and protect the
embankment. The North bank is rather stable and there is hardly any erosion by the river.

5.1.10 Floods
(82)     A large part of the project area is inundated during the annual floods. In normal years there is
little impact from the floods, because people have learnt to live with them and have built their houses
on the highest places. Most agricultural land, especially the rice areas are flooded and this is
considered to be beneficial, since fertile silt and clay are deposited in the flood plains at some distance
of the main river. Only when these floods come early and many kharif crops are still on the field a lot
of damage can be done to crops and food supply. Exceptional high floods (1987,1988, 1998, and
2004) often cause large damage to property and losses of food stocks. Generally, the people living on
both embankments of the river are better prepared against floods, since main roads and other
infrastructure and housing are raised above maximum flood level. However the charland communities
are very vulnerable and people here are affected most during exceptional floods, which can inundate
their charlands with 1.5 m of water or more.


5.2      The natural environment

5.2.1 ~cosystefJnS
(83)    The deltaic plains in which the project is situated enjoy a number of ecological zones, each
with their associated flora and fauna. The variability is mainly determined by hydrological conditions
(seasonal variations in water levels and seasonal connections between river and floodplain) and soil
composition. The zone in which the project is located is the 'Ganges Floodplain'. This zone is
characterized by the main Ganges (Padma) river system, surrounded by a landscape of ridges, basins
and old channels. During the monsoon seasons the river is constantly shifting within the floodplain,
therewith eroding embankments and depositing new charlands, often quickly colonized by vegetation.
Ganges river sediments differ from those of the other main rivers in Bangladesh by a high lime
content; this and the specific flood patterns determine to a large extent the biodiversity of the Ganges
Floodplain~


(84)   Typical ecosystems in the project area are partly natural and partly manmade. The natural
systems are:
     The river Padma and its tributaries. Major rivers generally include rich ecosystems with high
      biodiversity. Deeper areas are the biotope for a variety of fish, mammals, reptiles and
      invertebrates, whereas shallow areas and floodplains, often richly vegetated, are indispensable
      breeding and nursing biotopes for many riverine and some marine species of fish and crustaceans.
      Moreover, rivers act as ecological corridors and transport ways for organisms and seeds.
     Charlands within the main river course. Dynamic fluvial processes of alternating erosion and
      sedimentation caused by periodic flooding, create deposition of large masses of silt between land
      and water (and partly within the main water course proper). These newly accreted semi-terrestrial
      islands are locally called 'chars'. They stabilize over time and are subjected to ecological
      succession, creating high biological productivity and biodiversity. This, in tum, attracts large


                                                    32
    numbers of migrating birds; the Padma area is part of the main Eastern Trans-indian migratory
    route and probably also of the Andaman Islands route.

(85) Manmade ecosystems are located on the older lands (colonized earlier charlands). They
comprise:
   Homesteads and settlements. Homesteads and human settlements in and around the project site
    bear rather diverse plant communities, consisting of a combination of cultivated plants and wild
    shrubs and herbs. This vegetation contributes to household requirements for food, fodder,
    medicines, and fuel, and it also provides feed and shelter for a range of wildlife species.
   Agricultural fields. The major type ofterrestrial ecosystem is agriculture-based. The main crop is
    paddy, with its usual range of wild plants (weeds). In spite of its relatively low biodiversity, the
    crop-weed association provides an important source of feed and shelter for wildlife.
   Tree ecosystems. Real forest ecosystems are not found in the project area, but rather closed
    canopies of evergreen trees are encountered, especially around ponds. All roadsides are planted
    with trees as well; these rows of trees have regularly been shown to act as wildlife (bird) corridors
    in the heavily-populated landscape of Bangladesh.
   Permanent and seasonal wetlands. Permanent wetlands include canals, perennial water bodies
    and ponds. A large portion of the agricultural fields is inundated in the rainy season; they are
    considered temporary wetlands. These are arbitrarily considered man-made, whereas the natural
    charland wetlands are considered part of the charlands themselves. All wetlands contain free
    floating, submerged, and emergent plants, creating an important habitat for a range of animals.

5.2.2 Biodiversity.
5.2.2.1 General
(86) The mixture of ecosystems results in relatively high biodiversity in the project area and its
direct surroundings. In the highly populated Bangladeshi floodplains, where virtually every piece of
land is used for human activities, biodiversity might seem less important than in undisturbed areas, but
the opposite is the case. Representing the transition zone between Indo-China, the Himalayas and the
rest of the Indian subcontinent, Bangladesh once was rich in wildlife species. Its tropical moist forests
were botanically amongst the richest in the Indian subcontinent, and they supported the greatest faunal
diversity. The population size of most ofthe species has declined drastically, but the remaining plant
and animal diversity is still high and for its survivallargeIy dependent on sharing their habitat with
humans. Especially the river systems and their direct surroundings, including the present project area,
are biodiversity hotspots, not only as a habitat for water-dwelling organisms, but also as a refuge for
terrestrial flora and fauna and as an ecological corridor between relatively less disturbed areas.

(87) The great biodiversity of the project site is demonstrated in Table 5.4, in which the biota
encountered during a limited number of field observations are compared with country data. The
information is collected from field observations made during five wildlife surveys in the project area
only: on 21122 July 2009,8/9 September 2009,20/21 November 2009, 13/14/15 January 2010 and
25/26 March 2010; fish data from catch statistics during spring tides and from enquiries, and
remaining data from accidental sightings and older reports. The Table shows that 380 vertebrates
(approximately one quarter of the Bangladeshi species) are found in the project area; the survival
status of 53 of them is in a critical stage (IUCN Red List). The role of the area for migrating birds
(winter visitors) is clear by the observation of24 species. The actual biodiversity situation will be
substantially more divers.

(88)    Invertebrates were not sampled in a structured manner, nor are data bases available. From most
groups of insects some species were observed, and various crustaceans and molluscs were observed in
the river. In addition, the plant survey identified 21 rare species.

5.2.2.2 The river ecosystem

Significance
(89) The ecological significance of the river and its tributaries is threefold:
   Habitat for numerous species of vertebrates and invertebrates. Most ofthose are found all
    over the river and floodplains systems in the country; for them the project area is not a critical
    biotope. For a number of endangered species, however, the area might have special value. Various
    fish breeding and nursing grounds are located close to the area.
   Corridor for migratory species, including fish (to and from breeding and nursing grounds) and
    birds (using the river as migration guidance). For numerous non-migratory species the river
    systems provide an opportunity for survival of fragmented or isolated communities. The corridor
    function of rivers for plant seeds and spores is important as well. The PMBP project area crosses
    main migration routes.
   Production of harvestable organisms, mainly fish and crustaceans. The river project area
    (some 1,000 ha) is fished throughout the year by professional and temporary fishermen with a
    variety of gear. The reconnaissance catch assessment survey (25 sites) and enquiries amongst
    fisher folk during the present EIA process showed that 2,700 fishermen obtained combined annual
    yields of approximately 800,000 kg. The large number of temporary fishermen (virtually every
    family needs to fish for survival) will add substantially to this yield.

Species
a. Mammals.
(90) For a few species the project area might be of special importance, namely the highly
threatened Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica) and the Otter species (Lutra lutra and Lutra
perspicillata). Presence of the Otters in the project area was confirmed by observations. Lists of
species are presented in Annex B.

(91) The population of the Ganges River Dolphin is decreasing day by day, mainly as a
consequence of human activities, Many individual dolphins suffocate after getting entangled in fishing
nets, whereas the population as a whole suffers from construction of dams: local migrations are
prevented and potentially breeding populations of animals are separated. Young are born year-round in
this species, but a significant birth peak takes place in December and January, at the beginning ofthe
dry season, and from May to July. Any disturbance (especially acoustic) during this period affects
reproduction success and thus species survival. The project area, both river and channels, is known for
the occurrence of dolphins; during the present opportunistic field survey 33 times dolphins were
sighted. Ganges River dolphins prefer river stretches where convergent streams create eddy counter-
currents in the mainstream flow and, to a lesser extent, 'marginal habitats' where sharp upstream
bends create a similar but smaller counter-current. In the Ganges river system, high concentrations of
dolphins were recorded at the confluences of the Padma with smaller streams and mid-channel islands
scattered throughout the river course, the places where their food organisms (fish, crustaceans) are
abound. Next to acoustic disturbance, the project will create an increase of river turbidity, both by
dredging and by planned erosion oflarge masses of deposited silt. The direct effect on dolphins is not
clear.

                                                  35
b. Birds.
(92)    In the river ecosystem, nearly all groups of oriental birds are represented by one or more
species. In addition, a large number of migratory birds is found here during the winter.

(93)    Birds of prey survive well in the area. Common species include kites, eagles and falcons. The
Brown Fish Owl (Ketupa zeylonensis) is listed in the mCN Red Data Book whereas the Barn Owl
(Tyto alba) and the Grey-headed Fish Eagle (Ichthyophaga ichthyaetus) are listed by the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES). These and all other
observed bird species are listed in Annex B.

c. Reptiles and Amphibians.
(94)    Within the river ecosystem the amphibian and reptilian populations are moderate and not in
abundance. For a few species the project area is expected to be of special importance, namely the
endangered and Padma-specific Brown Roofed Turtle (Pangshura smithii), the Ganges Softshell
Turtle (Aspideteres gangeticus), and the vulnerable Spotted Flapshell Turtle (Lissemys punctata). The
Brown Roofed Turtle is confined to large rivers; it is reported to mainly inhabit the Padma River. The
presence of the nearly extinct Gangetic Gharial (Gavialis gangetic us) was confirmed by one
observation. Lists of species are shown in Annex B.

d. Fish.
(95)     Catch assessment surveys were carried out in the project area during five days in 2009/20 10
(21-22/07,08/09,21/11, 14/01 and 25/03) in pre-selected sites in the Padma River and the connected
canals (bridge site, and five and ten km upstream and downstream of the bridge site). Although
professional fishing occurs throughout the year, there are two distinctive peaks in the lower part of the
Padma: during the pre-monsoon season (April-July) and in the post-monsoon season (October-
December). Both peaks are captured in the sampling scheme. The samples were collected during
spring tide, i.e. New moon phase or Full moon phase (Zoe) of the lunar month. For the sampling only
common local gear was used, resulting in somewhat biased samples. It is expected, however, that the
combination of this field sampling, enquiries amongst fishermen and literature data provide a
relatively complete picture of the occurrence offish species, their breeding grounds and migratory
patterns. An important literature source was the extensive catch assessment in the Padma River in
2001, carried out by the Department of Fisheries. The results are shown in Figure 5.6. Since sampling
took place over the whole length of the river, the contributions of Hilsa, major carps and shrimps are
relatively low, since they are not evenly distributed in the river system. The anadromous Hilsa catches
were more concentrated in the Lower Padma (743 ton, versus 315 ton from the Upper Padma). For
carps and catfish the opposite was found: main yields were collected from the Upper Padma Since
2001 no major studies were carried out; fisheries experts expect that present species composition will
be more or less comparable, since main circumstances in the river environmental did not change much
and since commonly used gear is rather non-selective.

(96) The PMBP fisheries surveys revealed 86 fish species, including floodplain resident species.
Earlier DOF work identified 158 species. The dominant order found was Cypriniformes. A
consolidated fish species list is presented in Annex B.

(97) Based upon the mCN Red List, species of conservation significance in the Padma River are
shown in Table 5.5.

(98) Some species of fish remain confined to the riverine waters, some species migrate from the
flood plain to the river mostly for breeding, and others migrate to the upper reaches during monsoon
season. The major migratory fish of the Padma is Hilsa (Tenualosa ilisha); Hilsa migrates up-river
from the estuary and the Bay of Bengal to spawn. Hilsa adults migrate upstream through the project
construction site during March-May. Catfishes and major carps migrate up and down within the river
during the same period. They are less prominent in the lower Padma, but highly regarded. Small
shrimps are available throughout the river, whereas the lower Upper Padma yields some 70,000 kg of
big shrimp annually. All these commercially important species, as well as most others, are dependent
on shallow areas (underwater meadows) for spawning and nursing. It is expected that increased
turbidity caused by the project will decrease the value of the downstream breeding areas, whereas
noise and increased human activities will decrease the accessibility to upstream areas for anadromous
migratory species.

(99)     Hilsa is not only the main anadromous migratory, but this species also presents the largest
single component of the Bangladesh inland fisheries. In the Padma section of the delta it is by far the
most dominant species (up to 45%) in the catch. Traditionally, Hilsa fishing takes place from mid-June
till mid-August (returning adults), followed by a second peak (young fish) from mid-September till
mid-October. During the rest of the year fishermen focus on other species (other gear).

(100) Bangladesh inland and coastal fisheries represent a safety net for the economic and nutritional
needs of many rural poor. According to the World Bank Country Environmental Analyses (2006) four
out of five rural Bangladeshis, amounting to as many as 85 million people, are dependent to some
extent on aquatic resources. More than 2,700 full-time fishermen were identified on the banks of the
project area and it is expected that at least 30,000 people or more fish on a part-time basis.

(101) The pattern of fishing at the project site is found similar to that in the lower part of the Padma:
a major peak in the pre-monsoon season (April-July) and a second peak in the post-monsoon season
(October-December).The overall catch per fisher is declining, mainly due to the growth in the
population of full-time fishers, supplemented by large numbers of part-time fishers. Inland fisheries,
which include for a large part Hilsa fishing already suffers an estimated loss ofUS$ 42 million per
year (World Bank, Country Environmental Analyses, 2006). As more people become landless, fishing
becomes increasingly the only option and more people start fishing without the traditional "code of
conduct" As a result, more and more egg-bearing females and very young Hilsa are found on the local
markets. The significance of Hilsa fishing is massive, both in economic terms and in protein value:
Hilsa produces 80% of the protein needs of the rural population. The increase in fishing effort and the
decreased recruitment has put a substantial stress on Hilsa popUlations. Any additional negative effect
on recruitment is considered disastrous.

(102) In the Padma several main fish breeding grounds are found. Janjira is considered one of the
most important breeding grounds for carps, catfishes and Hilsa, but a number of smaller spawning and
nursing grounds are found to the SE (Nada) and NW of the project site.

e. Invertebrates.
(103) A detailed survey of invertebrates and other lower organism in the study area (as in the
remainder of the country) is lacking. Still the aquatic invertebrates are important, especially as fish
food organisms (benthos and plankton) and for maintaining good water quality. Various bottom snails
clean away decaying organic matter whereas bivalves filter micro-organisms from the water. As a
result, the invertebrate communities are valuable indicators of water quality. The larger crustaceans
(Macrobrachium rosenbergii, M malcolmsonei and Cancer sp.) are commercially fished throughout
the year.

f. Plants.
(l04) The river itself does not provide a biotope for many plant species, except in shallow parts and
along the embankments. The relevance of this vegetation will be discussed under the charland
ecosystem.

5.2.2.3 The charlands ecosystem

Significance
(lOS) Charlands are newly accreted lands from river (or sea) deposits. The Padma main channel is
constantly shifting within its active floodplain, eroding and depositing large areas of new charland in
each flooding season. If new charlands do not erode quickly, they are colonized by pioneer vegetation
(especially Crotolaria retusa, Phragmites karka, Saccharum spontaneum and Ipomoea sp.). Dense
growth of these tall grasses starts anchoring the loose deposits and accelerates further silt deposition.
Subsequently, either natural succession (by other grasses, bushes and finally trees) or human activities
result in development of habitable land.

(106)   In the direct surroundings of the project site three main charlands are situated (see Figure 5.5):




                                                    38
 The extended and partly inhabited charland complex northwest of the intended bridge, consisting of
  Char Janajat Purba Kash, Munshir Char, Char Magur Khanda Nepal Char and Vabir Char. The total
  area is commonly called "Char Janajat"; its consolidated size approximates 60,000 ha;
 The young charland complex directly under the bridge demarcation, consisting of Char Tarapasa on
  the western side of the alignment and Majhir Char stretching out to the east; the combined size
  approximates 9,000 ha, and
 The charland complex east of the project site, consisting of the young Chandra Bari Char and Char
  Lauhajang and the more developed Char Korhati. Approximately 7,000 ha of this complex lay
  within the project area.

(107) The ecological significance ofthese charlands is considerable:
   Habitat. Young, vegetated charlands form a major habitat for the Bangladeshi vertebrate fauna:
    mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians. The areas are relatively free from noise and other
    disturbances, whereas the mixed vegetation and the large number of water bodies support a rich
    hunting, feeding and roosting habitat. A range of waterfowl, both local and migratory, are directly
    or ecologically dependent on charland ecosystems. Char Janajat is an important habitat for
    mammals, birds and reptiles, Majhir Char (under the planned bridge alignment) is a major staging
    ground for migratory birds, and Chandra Bari Char is considered a bird's paradise. Especially the
    reed lands (wetlands) on Char Janajat are considered biodiversity hotspots.
   Reproduction area. This represents the foremost ecological significance of charlands and their
    submerged extensions (wetlands and shallow riverine areas). Aquatic reptiles (among which the
    endangered turtles and, most probably, the Gharial) lay their eggs in the sandy beaches, mostly
    between December and February. For many riverine and marine fish and crustacean species the
    shallow submerged parts of the charlands are indispensable breeding and nursing grounds; the
    field surveys for the project showed that big carp and catfish species actually do breed near the
    bridge site.
   Settlement and livelihood. Given the shortage ofland in Bangladesh, stabilized charlands are
    quickly occupied by farmers and fishermen, profiting from the natural richness of these new and
    fertile lands. For the poorest segment of the population fish (and a range of other products) from
    the charland wetlands are a significant condition for survival. These wetland-dwelling people are
    increasingly vulnerable to threats to the wetland resources.

Species
(108) All species are included in the lists of Annex B.
a.Mammals.
(109) The charlands provide the typical biotope for the endangered Jungle Cat (Felis chaus) and the
critically endangered Indian Crested Porcupine (Hystrix indica). On all charlands, and especially on
Char Janajat, jackals, jungle cats, mongoose, bandicoots, shrews, squirrels, and bats are observed
regularly. Large numbers of footprints of the Jungle Cat and the Fishing Cat (Felix viverrina) were
seen in the project area. Also the endangered Large Indian Civet (Viverra zibetha) and a few
vulnerable species were actually observed. Since the submerged areas of the chars are particularly
favourable microhabitats for fishes, and since fish is the main food for dolphins, the chars and sand
banks in the middle of the rivers, like Majhir Char, are important feeding biotopes for the dolphins.

b. Birds.
(110) The project site and its surroundings are important bird areas within the Ganges-Brahmaputra-
Meghna Delta, both for resident and migratory birds: more than 100 of Bangladesh' 628 bird species
were sited here. Especially the reed lands on the chars support feeding and roosting places for wild
birds. Majhir Char (under the planned bridge alignment) is considered a major staging ground for
migratory birds: during the field observations for this EIA 44 species of winter visitors were observed
here.

c. Reptiles and Amphibians.
(111) Thirteen amphibian species (of which two are endangered and three are vulnerable) were
observed during the field survey, but most probably many more are present in the favourable charland
habitat. The charlands provide important habitats or oviposition areas for the species observed.


                                                  39
 (112) Among the reptiles are six turtle species, including the common Indian Roofed Turtle
 (Pangshura tectum) and Median Roofed Turtle (Pangshura tentoria), but also the very rare Brown
 Roofed Turtle (Pangshura smithii), the endangered Ganges Softshell Turtle (Aspideteres gangeticus).
 and the vulnerable Spotted Flapshell Turtle (Lissemys punctata). Other reptiles observed on the
 charlands are the Bengal Monitor (Varanus bengalensis) and the Yellow Monitor (Varanus
jlavescens), both categorized as endangered in the IUCN Red List. Ten species of snakes were found,
of which three are 'redlisted': Common Krait (Bungarus caeruleus), Spectacled Cobra (Naja naja) and
Monocled Cobra (Naja kaouthia). All three are aquatic to semi-terrestrial, and usually found nearby
water bodies.

d. Fish.
(113) Charlands usually show a number of pools and creeks. Since the project's fish observations
were limited to commercial catches, these small waters were not sampled. However, all waters contain
fish species, often typically adapted to the changing circumstances of charlands. The submerged
riverside areas of the charlands are very important breeding and nursing biotopes for many kinds of
fishes, including all commercially important species.

(114) The fate of Bangladesh's capture fisheries is inextricably tied to the condition of its wetlands,
including those in the project area. The capture fisheries yields are declining because of a number of
developments, but especially because of the loss of wetland habitat. The IUCN Red Data Book of
2000 indicates that already almost 30% of the fish species for which data are available were in some
danger of extinction during that year, and that 54 inland species (out of a total of 266) are endangered.
Since then the situation is expected to have worsened.

e. Invertebrates.
(115) No detailed information was collected and no published data on the specific importance of
charlands for invertebrates were available. All common groups of insects were encountered. As for
fish, the submerged riverside areas of the charlands provide important breeding places for freshwater
shrimps and nursing biotopes for their larvae and postlarvae. The flooded areas are also important
living areas for various species of crabs and molluscs.

f. Plants.
(116) An attempt was made to assess the various vegetation types within the project area, using
satellite imagery and reconnaissance field visits. Species diversity in the charlands proved to be
comparatively low, with most species belonging to the Cyperaceae or Gramineae families.


5.2.2.4 The terrestrial ecosystems
(117) The terrestrial ecosystems include homesteads and settlements, agricultural fields, and areas
under plantation.

Significance
(118) Being man-made, the significance of these ecosystems is mainly the provision ofliving
opportunities to the rural population. However, they also support some floral and faunal biodiversity,
albeit that most species are common and found allover the country. The additional ecological
significance is the corridor function (the relatively continuous availability of the habitats secure
geographical distribution of species) and the availability of trees, supporting fauna elements that
otherwise would not be found in the area. Most trees are found around the homesteads and along
roads.

Species
(119) All species are included in the lists of Annex B.
a. Mammals.
(120) Common mammals that were found within the area are Mole Rat (Bandicota bengalensis),
Bandicot Rat (Bandicota indica), House Shrew (Suncus murinus), Field Mouse (Mus booduga), House
Mouse (Mus musculus), House Rat (Rattus rattus), Small Indian Mongoose (Herpestes


                                                   40
autopunctatus), and Golden Jackal (Canis aureus). Trees (and some higher buildings) provide a
habitat for flying mammals, such as the Short-nosed Fruit Bat (Cynopterus sphinx) and the Indian
Pipistrelle (Pipistrellus coromandra). None of those is considered endangered or rare.

b. Birds.
(121) A total of about 92 terrestrial bird species were observed within the project area. Most of them
are common, but one is listed in the IUCN Red Data Book: the Brown Fish Owl (Ketupa zeylonensis).
In addition, two species are listed in the list of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES): the Barn Owl (Tyto alba) and the Grey-headed Fish Eagle
(lchthyophaga ichthyaetus). Both were not observed, but reported from the area. One rather rare bird,
considered endemic to the Indian Sub-continent, was observed: the Black Breasted Weaver (Ploceus
benghalensis). Birds of prey survive well in the area. Common birds of prey are Brahminy Kite
(Haliastur indus), Black-winged Kite (Elan us caeruleus), Crested Serpent Eagle (Spilomus cheela)
and Common Kestrel (Falco tinnuculus).

c. Reptiles and Amphibians.
(122) During the survey many lizards and skinks were observed. Among the lizards Brook's House
 Gecko (Hemidactylus brookii), the Common House Gecko (Hemidactylusfrenatus) and the Common
Garden Lizard (CaZotes versicolor) were found most frequently. These reptiles prefer places around or
within human habitation. Keeled Grass Skinks (Mabouya carinata) were found in all terrestrial
habitats. The endangered Bengal Monitor (Varanus bengalensis) and Yellow Monitor (Varanus
flavescens) were observed as well.

d. Invertebrates.
(123) No detailed surveys were carried out. The insect and spider fauna of the project area is not
considered different from that in the rest of the country. The aphids (Hemiptera) are of major
economic importance for the direct damage they cause to crops and for viral diseases they transmit. Of
the Hymenoptera various species of bees and wasps were observed. Of the Coleoptera the Scarab
Dung Beetle was common, as were the ladybirds. Different types of firefly were observed as well. Of
the Diptera all common house and stable flies were seen, as well as the flesh flies and horse flies.
Sand flies appeared to be common, both indoors and in the fields. All common mosquito genera
(Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes) were present as well. None of the observed species is considered rare
or endangered.

e. Plants.
(124) The agricultural fields show a difference between the right bank of the Padma River, where
spices (onion, cumin seeds, wheat,<rcoriander, garlic, wheat, mustard) and jute are the most important
crops, and the left bank, where predominantly two crops are grown: HYV of Boro and potato. On both
sides dhaincha (Sesbania rostrata) is grown as green manure. On the right bank about 73% of the net
cropping area is covered by double cropping, 16% by triple cropping and 1% by a single crop,
resulting in an average cropping intensity of 205%. On the left bank single cropping is prominent in
about 70%, whereas the rest of the areas has double cropping. Here, the average cropping intensity is
about 130%.

(125) As far as other plants are concerned, an attempt was made to assess the various vegetation
types with satellite imagery and reconnaissance field visits. Standardized transects were established.
The following observations were the result:

(126) Homestead vegetation is well developed and shows high diversity of locally cultivated plants
and wild shrubs and herbs: 71 homestead species of 49 families were listed (see Annex C). In general,
the vegetation contributes effectively to providing food, fodder, medicines, fuel and other household
requirements. Commonly planted tree species are the leguminous Albizia saman for timber and
fuelwood, the palm Areca catechu for fruit and timber, Manga (Mangifera indica) for fruit and timber,
Mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni) for timber and medicines, Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) for
fruit, timber and fuel wood, and Banana (Musa sp.) for fruit. Homesteads near wetlands use trees like
Trewia nudiflora for timber and fuel wood, and Crataeva nurvala and Barringtonia acutangula for
fuelwood. Among the shrubs Ficus hispida is most common.


                                                   41
(127) Homestead vegetation supports good shelter for many wildlife species. The crop field
vegetation is less diverse but also this is a source of food and shelter for wildlife. Main paddy field
weeds were Altemanthera sessilis, Amaranthus spinosus, Cynodon dactylon, Polygonum sp., and
Oxalis comiculata. Along roads and around crop fields 27 species from 16 plant families were
recorded; highest numbers of species were found in Amaranthaceae, Gramineae, Cyperaceae, and
Euphorbiaceae families.


5.2.2.5 The wetland ecosystems

Significance
(128) Temporary wetlands are flooded agricultural lands during the monsoon periods. Their
ecological significance is more or less comparable to that of the submerged areas around the chars:
they are important breeding and, especially, nursing biotopes for fish and crustacean species, among
which the commercially important Hilsa, major carps, catfishes and Macrobrachium shrimps. Their
ecological significance and species occurrence was discussed in the charland section above.

(129) Permanent wetlands are the rivers (discussed above) ponds, depressions (beels) and channels.
Their ecological significance is:
   Production, especially offish (aquaculture). Village ponds are also used for all kinds of other,
    production-related activities, such as jute retting, and for social activities such as washing.
   Habitat. Permanent water bodies are the habitat for plant communities that favour stagnant waters
    and for the animals associated with them. In general the biodiversity is high, but universal.

Species
(130) All species are included in the lists of Annex B.
a. Mammals.
(131) No mammal species are specific for the permanent wetlands, although the endangered Otter
(Lutra lutra) is reported from the project area.

b. Birds.
(132) A total of 65 aquatic bird species was observed in the wetlands of the project area. They
included water fowl (ducks and goose) and fish-eating birds (herons and kingfishers), both resident
and migratory. Several of the observed species are listed in the IUeN Red Data Book, including River
Lapwing (Vanellus duvaucelii) and Comb Duck (Sarkidiomis melanotos). The threatened Black-
headed Ibis (Threskiomis melanocephalus) was seen flying over the area. For the kingfishers small
pond fish is the main food, and presence of ponds, therefore, determines their occurrence in the area.
The famous Ruddy Shelduck (Tadomaferruginea), appearing in so many Bengali stories and poems
for its profound monogamy, is also regularly observed here.

c. Reptiles and Amphibians.
(133) No specific species were recorded from permanent water bodies. Both endangered Monitor
species are regular visitors of ponds.

d. Fish.
(134) The permanent water bodies house a variety of small fish species; they were not surveyed, but
the species composition is expected equal to that in ponds all over the country. In addition, ponds are
stocked with consumption fish in different combinations and in different stocking densities. None of
them is ecologically bound to the permanent wetlands in the project area.

e. Invertebrates.
(135) No data are available, it is expected that the common species complex, associated with the
dominant plant coverage, will be present.




                                                    42
f. Plants.
(136) The botanical surveys identified 42 wetland plant species (22 families), of which two are rare.
In permanent wetlands virtually all plants are considered weeds, but the same species have high
ecological value in the temporary or semi-permanent wetlands (e.g. river boundaries of charlands).
Free floating plants are observed throughout the project area, including Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia
crassipes), Water Lettuce (Pistia stratiotes), water ferns (Saivinia cucullata, and Azolla sp.) and
duckweeds (Lemna spp.). Dominant rooted floating plants are Water Lilly (Nymphaea nouchali), and
Water Gentian (Nymphoides indicum). A range of submerged and creeping species is found as welL


5.3      Socio-economic conditions

5.3.1    General
(137) The three project districts have a strong rural character. In 2001, 88-89% of the population was
living in rural areas and only 11-12 % in rural centres. During the last decades this is changing and at
present the rate of urbanization is high. Many people in the area have migrated to urban centres, such
as Shatiatpur, Maduripur, Munshiganj and Dhaka. According to a survey under households affected by
the project (see table 5.6) most people in Mawa work in trade, business or services (66%) and only a
minority (5%) in agriculture. At the Janjira site the picture is totally different: about 50% ofthe
workforce is active in agriculture, whereas only 25% has employment in trade, business or services.

(138) Income levels of affected households are shown in table 5.7. Average incomes at the Mawa
side ofthe river are substantially higher than at the Janjira side. At least 33% of the households have a
per capita income lower than BOT 20,000, indicating that poverty rates in the area are high, with most
ofthe hard core poor living on the Janjira side of the river.

are very poor and live mainly of agriculture and fishing.

5.3.2 Agriculture
(140) Agriculture is the most important economic activity in the area. Farm sizes are small 1 ha)
and despite of a good productivity of the soils farm incomes are low. Only a small part of the farms is
irrigated by tube wells. High yielding varieties of rice are grown in Mawa on 83% ofthe land, which
are the low lying areas, whereas potato is successfully grown on the somewhat higher and better
drained soils. Overall cropping intensity at the Mawa side is 130%. At the Janjira side the cropping
intensity is much higher with 205%. ~bout 73% of the area is double cropped and on 16% of the land
three crops are cultivated. However, crops grown during monsoon are often affected by early floods or
by insect attacks and suffer considerable losses. At the Janjira side rice is grown on 41 % of the
farmland, next to a range of other crops, such as jute, sugarcane, onion, pulses, mustard, chilli, onion,
groundnut, wheat and others, see table 5.8.

(141) Livestock is integrated in the farming systems, especially on the Janjira side. Most farmers
own one or more cows for milk production and some young cattle, next to goats and poultry (chicken,
ducks, and geese). Livestock holding is especially important on the charlands, because of the
availability oflarge areas suitable for grazing.

5.3.3 Fisheries
(142) Less than 2% of the households indicate that they depend on fishing only, but virtually all
households fish for their own protein food, a condition to survival for the Bangladeshi rural poor. A
significant part of the economy is generated through marketing offish: about 9,000 people are directly
dependant on the fish market and trade. Probably a substantial part of the catch on the Mawa whole
sale fish market originates from the char people, unofficially fishing in the waters of char Janajat and
some of the other upstream chars.

5.3.4 Ferries
(143) There are three ferry ghats located in the Project area: at the Mawa side, and at Kathalbari and
Kewrakandi on the Janjira side. At least 11 larger ferries, 50 launches, 220 speedboats and 1,100
mechanized boats are involved in the daily traffic between the two embankments (mostly on a 24-
hours basis). The number of daily river crossings by ferries between Mawa and Kewrakandi is
estimated at 65 by ferries, 98 by launches and 370 by speedboats. About 20,000 people are directly or
indirectly dependent on the different economic activities in and around the ferry ghats.

     5.3.5       Health services
     (144) Health facilities in the project area are not sufficient. In Munshiganj district (Mawa side) there
     is one doctor for 8,700 people and one hospital bed per 13,000 people. On the Janjira side the situation
     is even worse with one doctor for around 13,200 people in both districts (Madaripur and Shariatpur).
     In these districts there is one hospital bed available per 11,000 people.

     (145) Furthermore, the existing health services are poorly developed. Especially in emergency
     situations people have to travel long distances to get proper medical care. The char inhabitants have to
     travel by boat to Katahlbari to buy medicine or to Mawa town to visit a health facility. Since men are
     more mobile, they have easier access to health care than women. Many people go to quacks and
     medicine shops for minor medical treatment.

     (146) Common diseases are diarrhoea, anaemia, skin diseases, deficiency diseases, eye diseases, ear
     diseases, and water borne diseases due to malnutrition and lack of hygiene. More details on the public
     health situation in the project area are presented the Public Health Action Plan.

     5.3.6       Access to Education
     (147) Good educational institutions are located in the capitals and main urban centres of the three
     districts in the project area. People living in or nearby these centres have easy access to these schools.
     Rural students have to travel long distances either on foot or on motorized vehicles to attend. The
     schools in the rural areas are faced with many problems; often there are insufficient or unqualified
     teachers. Student attendance is not regular and sometimes even teachers are absent.

     (148) In table 5.9 an overview is given of available institutes with the number of teachers and
     students. Shibchar has the highest number of educational institutes, followed by Lauhajong and
     Janjira. There is a relatively high focus on religious education on the South side ofthe Padma River.
     There are many madrasses in Janjira and in Shibchar (both South side) as compared to Lauhajong on
     the North side. This is not unexpected, since this type of education usually attracts students from very
     poor families.

     (149) A 2006 sample survey of 390 households in the project districts indicated that about 10% male
     students and 7% female students never attended school. Another 32% male and 20% female students
     drop out during the secondary level of school due to various reasons of which poverty was the main
     one. Literacy rate on the Mawa side is estimated at 68% and on the Janjira side at 64%.

     5.3.7       Water supply and sanitation
     (150) Most people in the project area (about 90%) use groundwater from tube wells for drinking and
     the rest use surface water from rivers and ponds for the supply of potable water. Water from shallow
     aquifers at Mawa usually contains high concentrations of arsenic, but water from tube wells deeper
     than 90 m are not contaminated with arsenic. At Janjira side, water drawn from both the deep and
     shallow aquifers are arsenic-free.

     (151) Most sanitary facilities in the project area have sanitary latrines (89%), while 11 % use hanging
     toilets. In recent years sanitary latrines are increasingly popular, also on the Janjira side.

     5.3.8       Roads and communications
     (152) The construction of Highway 8 between Dhaka and Mawa has improved the connections
     between the project area and the capital considerably. From Mawa, people can reach the city in one

                                                               45
hour by bus. Within the project area there is a network of paved and earthen roads on upazilla level.
The earthen roads are suitable for rickshaws and rickshaw-vans. During recent years people have
much better access to paved roads than in earlier days.

(153) A questionnaire among 407 households in 2007 revealed that 82 % of the people in Mawa
travel to their work on foot against 49 % on the more rural Janjira side. People in Janjira still use ox-
carts and increasingly tractor drawn carts for transportation. About 11 % of the people in Mawa use
rickshaws or vans to go to their work and 5 percent use buses. In Janjira about 18 % travel by
rickshaw or van, about 8 % use bus and another 9 percent use auto-tempos. About 14 % of the
population on the Janjira side travel by boat to their work at the other side of the river.

(154) There are suitable postal and telecommunication facilities available in Mawa, including post
and telegraph offices and telephone service shops. A large number of people use cellular phones. At
the Janjira side there are hardly any postal and telecommunication facilities available. Post and
telegraph offices and telephone service shops are situated at distances of about three krn and ten km
respectively.

5.3.9   Access to energy
(155) To obtain an adequate supply of fuel for cooking is a major concern for the rural people in
Bangladesh. For cooking the majority of the people in the project area use different sources of energy,
including natural gas, electricity (few), fire wood, dried cow-dung, jute stalks, crop residues, dry
leaves and branches of trees. Only some better-off families use gas cylinders in their kitchen. Most
people in Mawa buy fuel (88%) and the remaining 12 % collect fuel from own or free sources. The
picture is reverse in Janjira, where 82 % of the households get fuel from own sources or they collect
firewood from nature. Only 18% buy their fuel.

(156) Electricity is available and used for lighting and running electrical appliances. In Mawa 73%
of the households use electricity. No households were reported to use electricity for pumping irrigation
water and only 3% use electricity for small commercial cottage industries. In Janjira only 23% use
electricity in their residences; about ten percent of the families cannot afford using electricity, while
67% in Janjira are not connected at all because of absence of a supply network. Only 2% use
electricity for irrigation and another 3% for commercial purposes.

5.3.10 Physical and cultural resources
(157) There are no designated historical, archaeological or cultural resources within the project area.
However, Lauhajang on the North bank has a rich cultural and historical heritage with some beautiful
mosques and tall minarets. The Idrakpur fort, the earliest Muslim architecture, is a popular tourist
place in this district. These monuments will not be affected by the project.

(158) Within the affected area there are a number of religious places and schools that will have to be
relocated in the resettlement sites or in neighbouring areas. These include one private elementary
school and one madrasa, 12 temporary mosques, one mazar (shrine of holy Sufi), 11 private clubs or
societies, and two family graves and two public mosques (Jamey mosque). Among the structures
affected two structures were identified as Physical and Cultural Resource (PCR): the Kumarbogh
Jamey Mosque and the shrine of holy Sufi Gaus Mastan, which is visited regularly by local Muslims.

(159) The Kumarbogh Jamey mosque, a registered wa/ifproperty, lies to the east ofthe main
approach to the bridge in Mawa and consists of two structures. It is the largest mosque within the
affected land, with dimensions of 23 x 15 m, two stories and a characteristic minaret tower. The
mosque can accommodate up to 700 to 800 devotees.


5.4     QuaJity of the environment

5.4.1   Air quality
(160) The major sources of air pollution in the project area are ferry traffic, vehicular traffic and dust
and emissions from brick fields. At the three ferry ghats waiting trucks, busses and cars lead and


                                                    46
heavy traffic congestions result in extensive exhaust emissions. Also emissions from the numerous,
often poorly maintained ferries, launches and speedboats crossing the river contribute to air pollution.
Air quality measurements have been carried out by the Bangladesh University of Engineering and
Technology (BUET) in eight locations (four on North bank and four on South bank). Air quality
measurements were made near to the ferry ghats, where high emissions could be expected and near to
the resettlement sites where low emissions were expected. The data collected did not always confirm
the expectations and it was concluded that especially the measurements of fine dust emissions were
not reliable. Moreover, different sampling durations made comparison with the national standards
difficult. Is important to use standard methodology in repetition ofthese measurements in future, and
to compare the data with the standards set in the ECR of 1997.

5.4.2        Noise
(161) The major sources of noise in the project area are the ferry ghats and the traffic on road and
river. Vibration also occurs at ferry ghats during uploading and offloading of heavy vehicles. Noise
levels were measured at ten sites in the project area by BUET in July and November 2009. The
measurements were made at a distance of ten m from the road and the sampling period of each
measurement was 15 minutes. Highest noise levels of 77 dBA were recorded at the Mawa roundabout
during the day and 73 dBA during the night at the approach road in Sikderkandi village (July 2009).
The standard for noise level set by the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Rules of 1997 is 60
dBA for commercial and mixed areas. All measured levels were above this standard.

(162) The noise level in July 2009 showed in some rural areas also values higher than anticipated.
Discussions with BUET revealed that noise monitoring was carried out sometimes during
thunderstorms or community activities not representing normal situations. Therefore, one more
sampling campaign was carried out in November 2009 to monitor the ambient noise level. During this
sampling, four sets of 15 min each of noise records were monitored for day time and for night time:
over 24 hours there were eight sets of data records. Data were presented in the Report of the
Environmental Quality baseline monitoring report (EAP Volume 3). In November 2009 the highest
noise levels were recorded at the Ferry Ghat in Mawa of73 dBA at day time and 69 dBA during night,
again well above the Bangladesh standards.

5.4.3 Surface water quality
(163) Surface water quality of the Padma River, the Naodoba Channel and other surface streams and
ponds was measured in July 2009. The results are shown in table 5.10. When these data are compared
to irrigation water standards (see table 5.11) they are satisfactory, with the exception of the high
amounts of total and faecal coliforms in the samples (maximum allowable concentrations are 100 and
orespectively). The samples were taken in the monsoon period, when part of the area was flooded and
water was contaminated with liquid and solid wastes, including human excreta from the residential
areas. Without boiling this water is definitely unsafe for use as drinking water.

       (164) Surface water from the Padma River has also been tested during the dry period in November
       2009. Also here some samples show high concentrations of total coliform; even higher than the
       standard for irrigation water. The drinking water standard is higher; the water is unsuitable for
       drinking.

       5.4.4      Groundwater quality
       (165) Most people in the project area use groundwater from tube wells for drinking (90%) and the
       rest use surface water from the river and ponds. Groundwater at the Mawa side is not always safe,
       especially from the more shallow tubewells as can be seen from table 5.12.

       (166) Groundwater samples were collected in July 2009 from a number of hand tubewells for water
       quality analysis. The results of these samples were compared with the DOE standards for drinking
       water. Groundwater from shallow tubewells (RS I, RS2 and RS3) shows concentrations of arsenic that
       are higher than tolerable amounts. Groundwater from deep tubewells (below 100 m) on the left bank
       has arsenic values below the national standards and can be considered safe. It appeared that
       groundwater from both shallow and deep wells has a relatively high natural content of iron and
       manganese, higher than the national drinking water standards. The WHO drinking water standards for
       iron and manganese are 0.3 and 0.5 mg/l respectively. The amounts encountered may cause slight
       health problems, but they will certainly cause inconvenience (bad taste, laundry stains). Moreover,
       they will give some problems of clogging and flocculation of iron and manganese oxides in pipes.

Ammonia nitrogen concentrations in groundwater are very high in some of the samples, mainly due to
the seepage of fertilizers from agricultural lands. In most wells the amount of faecal coliform is too
high as well.

(167) Analytical results from samples of groundwater from the same sites in the dry period
(November 2009) are shown in table 5.13. These confirm that As, Mn, Fe, NH3-N, and faecal
coliform concentrations at some locations exceed the drinking water standards of Bangladesh.

(168) It is concluded that water from shallow aquifers is not suitable for the supply of safe drinking
water. Groundwater from deep aquifers below 100 m depth is often of better quality. Groundwater
from deep tubewells (below 91 m) at Mawa Side (RS2-1, CYI) has arsenic values below the national
standards and could be considered safe. Iron, manganese and NH3-N are also below the maximum
tolerable limits for deep groundwater. Ammonia seems not to be a problem in deeper tubewells,
provided that they are well installed and no leakage occurs from the shallow aquifer.

5.4.5   Riverbed sediment quality
(169) Significant dredging of riverbed materials (mainly sand) will be required during construction.
The total quantity of dredged material from the RTW alone is estimated at around 44 million m3  Part
ofthe dredged material will be used for earth filling of the approach roads, RTW, the service areas and
other areas. Samples of riverbed materials were collected during July 2009 from various locations
along the Padma River to identifY the possible presence of heavy metals. The results of these tests are
given in table 5.14.

(170) From the results it can be concluded that there are no significant quantities of heavy metals in
the sediments, with the exception of the relatively high content of mercury (Hg) in two samples: one
taken one km upstream from the bridge along the Mawa river bank and the other at the Mawa Bridge
Landing Site.

       (171) Considering the importance of these data, another 11 samples of river bed materials (four
       samples from the river bank at Mawa side, five samples from river bank at Janjira side and two
       samples from the mid of the river along the proposed bridge alignment) have been collected in
       December 2009 and tested in the Analytical Laboratories in Singapore. The samples have been taken
       from the top layer (l m) of river sediments. The concentrations of heavy metals and harmful organics
       (especially multi-residue pesticides such as carbamates, pyrthethoids, organo-chlorines, organo-
       phosphates and organo-nitrogen) were analyzed. The results ofthese tests are given in table 5.15. The
       results indicate that there are no harmful concentrations in any of the surface sediment samples
       present. This is not surprising since these sediments consist mainly of silty fine sand with a very low
       clay and organic matter content. Contents from deeper layers were not tested.

6         SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS AND THEIR MITIGATION

6.1       Project area and Influence area.

(172) The project area ofPMBP, including components of the project such as approach roads and
bridge-end-facilities, covers an area stretching six km inland from the Padma River on the Mawa
(North) side and four km inland at the lanjira (South) side. Bridge and river training works may affect
an area 15 km upstream and seven km downstream. The project influence area is much larger due to
increased traffic volumes and comprises (i) the corridor of the Trans Asian Highway 1 from Tamabil-
Sylhet-Sorail-Kanchpur-Dhaka-Mawa-Bhatiapara-Norail-lessore-Benapole, (ii) the corridor of the
Trans Asian Railway network and the railway missing link from Gendaria to Mawa through the bridge
to Bhanga-Kashiani-Narail-lessore-Benapole, while (iii) river training works and bridge may have
additional impacts on the natural erosion and accretion processes in the active flood plain and
especially on development of chars up and downstream of the bridge.

6.2      Positive impacts

(173) The Padma Bridge is expected to have a number of positive impacts on the Bangladesh society
as a whole. The most important of those will be the establishment of an easy, safe and reliable
communication link between the banks ofPadma River. Road and railway connections with the
Southwest will improve considerably and this will have an accelerating effect on both local and
regional socio-economic development.
(174) An additional positive impact is that river crossing utility infrastructure will facilitate
connection of the Southwest to gas, electricity and communication networks in the rest of the country
and it will avoid expensive alternative constructions. In the project area new employment and business
opportunities will be created and the improved connectivity will enhance access to health care and to
educational and recreational facilities. Air and noise pollution will be reduced and traffic congestion
and long waiting times for ferries will disappear.


6.3      Environmental and social impacts

(175) The proposed bridge and its associated constructions will influence a range of aquatic and
terrestrial ecosystems and their inhabitants: humans, animals and plants, since the project activities
traverse embankments, river areas, mudflats and charlands. The significance of the impacts on these
ecosystems depends primarily on the duration and timing of the activities. Major impacts are expected
to be the result of the following general project activities:

     Changes in land use;
     Dredging;
     Piling; and
     River training works.

(176) Types, levels and potential mitigations of impacts of these activities are described hereunder,
as far as relevant, for three project phases: Pre-construction, Construction, and Operation and
Maintenance.


6.4      Impacts during pre-construction stage

6.4.1    Social impacts
(177)    One ofthe major negative impacts ofthe project is caused by the acquisition of land needed
for the project and the subsequent displacement and resettlement of its current inhabitants. The social
impacts will be briefly indicated here. For details reference is made to the Social Assessment
document.




                                                    51
(178) The land to be acquired for the project totals 1,144 ha of mainly farmland and residential area,
while another 78 ha, required for the construction yards at Janjira side, will be leased from the owners
for a period of six years. A breakdown of the land acquisition for the project is given in table 6.1.

(179) The 994 ha of land to be acquired will affect 8,526 households, who will lose agricultural land,
whereas 4,975 households are losing structures, such as housing, commercial establishments and
others. An estimated 2,882 people are indirectly affected since they are losing employment, wages or
other sources of income. Thus an estimated total of 13,501 households or some 73,329 persons will be
directly affected by the project. A summary of these project impacts is given in table 6.2.

                       Table 6.2 - Summary of affected households and persons

        Subtotal                                                      13,501              73,329
        Economic impacts:
        Loss of employment, wages and income                                               2,882
        Total                                                        13,501               76,211

(180) Changes in land use lead to adverse impacts on the assets and livelihood resources of the
communities. About 9,250 of the affected households lose more than 10% of their income due to land
acquisition or dislocation of houses and commercial buildings.
(181) The social impacts have been addressed in a Social Action Plan. It consists of a Resettlement
Policy Framework that provides an overall policy and guidelines for resettlement and three
Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) for (i) the Resettlement Sites, (ii) the Main Bridge, Approach Roads
and Bridge-End Facilities and (iii) the River Training Works. Apart from these plans a number of
plans and programmes is designed, including an Income and Livelihood Restoration Programme, a
Gender Action Plan aimed at women and vulnerable groups, a Public Health Action Plan and a
Charland Monitoring and Management Framework. These plans were prepared using results of a
census survey, field visits, and a participatory approach through numerous meetings and focus group
discussions with the affected communities. The mitigation of the social impacts will not be discussed
here, but reference is made to the Social Action Plan (11 volumes) and the Social Assessment of the
project.
    o     Full compensation should be provided with respect to titles to land andfull restoration should
          be provided of livelihoods of affected persons losing their land, resources, housing, business
          or employment. Households physically displaced and affected economically will receive due
          compensation, relocation assistance and allowances in accordance with the project
          Resettlement Policy Framework.
    o     A separate environmental assessment was carried out for the Resettlement Sites. A stand-
          alone report is available for the same. It has resulted in the inclusion of environmental


                                                    52
         management measures into the contracts for resettlement sites - leveling, site development of
         common infrastructure, etc. The checklist for the contractors working on this site requires
         periodic monitoring of items from the construction stage EMP. This follows regular inputs
         from the environmental specialist in the site design and provision offacilities such as solid
         waste management. A Community Environmental Management Plan has been prepared for the
         post-construction stage to involve the residents ofthese sites in the use, supervision,
         monitoring, and managements of environmental services.

(182) The construction ofabout 15 km of bank revetment along the river banks will require the
clearing of vegetation and dwellings on and near the river embankments. There will be a complete
destruction of the existing natural and social infrastructure on these embankments that will be replaced
by a revetment bund consisting of artificial materials and a buffer area of 150 m on the land side. An
estimated 5,000 people, representing the poorest segment of society, are presently living on the
embankments and a substantially larger number is dependent on regular riverine fisheries activities
along the embankments. The fish they catch is an essential commodity for survival. Continuation of
traditional fishing will partly be possible (cast nets), but the use of set nets will be prevented by the
artificial substrate. Moving of the fisheries activities to other areas is unrealistic, since all riverine
stretches are fully occupied (customary law). Moreover, there are no means of transportation.
     o   Full compensation should be provided to the people living and fishing on the embankments
         where RTW will be constructed, either in money or in replacement gear. As far as RTW on
         the Janjira side are concerned (some 12.5 km), replacement gear may consist of poles and nets
         for brushpark fisheries and floating ponds (cages). At the Mawa side the river is too deep for
         this gear; here the (more limited) fisheries activities along the two km ofRTW could continue
         if people are provided with hook-and-line.

6.4.2    Environmental impacts
(183) Large quantities ofmaterials are harvested from elsewhere, including rock from India, sand
and gravel from Sylhet.
     o   Harvesting and transportation oflarge quantities of materials from elsewhere should be
         cleared by the relevant environmental authorities. Project impacts in other countries or areas
         belong to the responsibility of the project authority; acquisition of clearance should be
         included in contractor's contracts.

(184) Removal ofvegetation around the bridge, connecting roads, construction yards, and other
service points has a significant impact on terrestrial flora and its dependent fauna. All vegetation and
trees in the road and railway alignments, right-of-ways and on other project sites will be removed,
before infertile fine sandy dredged material is used to raise the level of these areas with an average
2-4 m to reach an elevation which corresponds with the maximum flood level (once in 100 year flood).
The terrestrial ecosystem structure of these areas will be changed permanently. Given the long history
of human settlement in these areas, there is a high probability that most plant and animal species are
rather common and used to disturbances. Course herb and shrub vegetation will return quickly in and
around new settlements and roads. The main wildlife habitat in the existing vegetation is encountered
in trees (fruit bats, birds, tree frogs, bees); as long as trees are replaced the clearing will result in
temporary loss of these wildlife elements in the area proper. In addition, construction of road, railway
and service areas will inhibit the free movement of terrestrial fauna in the area, since they form major
physical barriers. According to RAP 1,2 and 3 a total of201,273 trees (excluding bamboo and
banana) is estimated to be cut during clearance of the 250 km2 of project land. Total numbers of
banana and bamboo trees are estimated as 359,549. This will include:
    Some 17,700 trees (including banana and bamboo) of a number of species will be cleared from
     resettlement sites;
    Some 80,000 trees of a number of species will be cleared from the planned new road, transition
     structures and toll plaza another 4,900 from the service areas; and
'.   Some 107,000 trees of a number of species will be cleared from the RTW alignment.

(185) To compensate the loss of 201,273 trees a tree plantation and green belt development plan has
been drafted, which includes the planting of 405,461 trees. In addition, 719,098 bamboo and banana

                                                   53
saplings will be distributed to the people of the host villages. The share of bamboo and banana will be
60:40. Owners of trees will get compensation under the RAPs and are also allowed to fell their own
trees and take the wood free of cost to be used for timber or fuel wood. In all areas the fertile topsoil
(0.5 m) will be removed and stockpiled for later reuse, since tree planting in deposited silt (filling
material) will not be very successful. Trees will be planted in strips along road and railway alignments
to mitigate noise, to form green belts around construction yards and resettlement sites, and along side
slopes and at selected locations behind the guide bunds of river training works. Young saplings wll be
distributed to settlers to plant suitable trees around the houses as homestead garden. The following
measures are identified to compensate negative impacts as much as possible and to increase replanting
success:
    o   Maintaining comparable tree diversify. Replanting programmes should include a range of tree
        species, in order to compensate for the loss of sources of timber, fuel wood, fruit, fodder and
        medicines.
    o   Only trees with a girth of 10 cm or more (3-5 years old) should be planted. Replanting of
        larger trees would be better, but the availability is doubtful. Replanting of trees of3-5 years
        old will still result in loss of the use of tree products for another 3-5 years. Partial use of new
        quickly-fruiting varieties may be considered, but those (low) trees produce smaller quantities
        than traditional trees and they do not provide fuel wood.
    o   Use of compost in tree planting holes will have to be compulsory in order to increase planting
        success.
    o   Early establishment ofa tree nursery. It is not expected that existing tree nurseries will have
        some 400,000 trees (plus yearly replacements as planned in the Community Environmental
        Management Plan) of adequate size in stock. Since compensation trees should at least be three
        years old, a nursery survey and tree ordering will have to be carried out in 2010. If the survey
        dictates so, additional nursery establishment might become an urgent activity for the early pre-
        construction phase.
    o   Regular maintenance of all newly planted trees. Watering and weeding will have to take place
        during the dry season; without watering replanting will be meaningless.
    o   Planning, setting up ofnurseries, planting and maintenance. It is recommended to attract a
        qualified NGO to manage, organize and supervise treeplanting activities in cooperation with
        the Forestry department. Women affected by the project and other vulnerable groups should
        be employed in these activities, within the framework of the Income and Livelihood
        Restoration Plan.

(186) Removal of trees will result in shortage offuel wood (Janjira side). Replanted trees will
require at least five years before fuel wood harvesting may start slowly.
    o   Resettled households should be fully compensated for loss offuel wood during five years after
        tree replanting, and in a decreasing manner during further five years. Costs are included in the
        compensation package.
    o   Compensation to tree owners for the loss ofother products, in order to overcome the period
        between felling of productive trees and equal production by new trees. Costs are included in
        the compensation package.

(187) Loss of agricultural lands. An estimated 640 ha of agricultural land will be lost in the project
area. This loss will impact 8,525 farmer families, who will receive compensation in cash. It is not
considered realistic to expect that the loss of production can be covered by boosting the production in
the remaining neighbouring areas of the project. The land used for construction yards will be returned
to the owners (at present mainly GOB) after completion of the project, but this land is unsuitable for
agricultural production due to deposition of dredged material. This land could be used for urban or
industrial development in stead.
    o   Those affected by the project will receive cash compensation for land and other assets at full
        replacement cost as per market price at the time of dispossession. Besides this, the households
        are eligible for additional support in the Income and Livelihood Restoration Plan to ensure
        minimum disruption of their lives and livelihoods during the project construction period and
        afterwards.



                                                   54
    o   Agricultural Development Programme. Farmers losing (part of) their agricuituralland can also
        participate in a programme aimed at increasing productivity by diversification of crops,
        introduction of improved varieties and inputs, and micro-credit. Under the programme a
        number of agricultural extension workers will assist and train farmers in close cooperation
        with the Department of Agricultural Extension. It is proposed to hire a qualified NGO or a
        institution like the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute for designing and implementing
        such a programme. The area set aside for this (less than five ha) will only be able to help a
        small number of affected farmers.

(\88) Loss ofhomestead flora and fauna. The changes in land use affecting an estimated 1,144 ha of
land will also affect the common flora and fauna associated with the homestead and field crops
concerned. As a result of the intensive agricultural land use, the structural complexity and diversity of
homestead and settlement veget~tion provides a significant microhabitat for local fauna species. Most
species, however, are common to very common and will find new habitat in the surrounding
undisturbed crop areas as well as in the new settlements. A few rare species are found; they are able to
resist anthropogenic influences because of their high mobility. Also these species will easily find new
habitat elsewhere; the project activities will not decrease their occurrence in Bangladesh.
    oRe-use of top soil from old settlements in the new settlements will guarantee quick restoration
      of the homestead flora and fauna.

(189) Decreasing quality of crop lands. Both filling of areas and transport of dredged material will
result in increased sand contents with low fertility in the surrounding agricultural lands adjacent to the
filled areas through run-off, erosion and waste. Potential harmful substances might leak from the new
soils during monsoon.
    o   Compacting offilled areas and turfplanting after compaction.
    o   AnalysiS of contents ofpollutants in fill material (especially heavy metal ions).

(190) Loss ofponds. An estimated 12 ha offish ponds, mainly temporary ones on government land,
but used by local fishermen will be lost due to project activities. Pond flora and fauna are widespread
in Bangladesh; pond demolition is not expected to result in measurable impacts. But ponds are also
used for the production of carps and catfish for household use. With a common production level of
2,000 kglha, some 24,000 kg of fish will be lost yearly. In addition, food fish production from 724 ha
of floodplain (at lest 150,000 kg) will be lost The average consumption is in the order of 20
kg/capita/year, resulting in a loss offood fish for some 9,000 persons per annum. The following
mitigation measures are identified, although not effective during the first few years:
    o   Provision of an equal pond area in the resettlement areas. The planned 1.45 ha pond
        (Community Environmental Management Plan) is sufficient to compensate for the loss of 1.5
        ha of from homestead or village areas.
    o   Establishment of a protected char area and offish (reproduction) sanctuaries in the river
        proper. Temporary ponds on the char and the fish sanctuary are expected to compensate
        sufficiently for the loss of the approximately 10.5 ha of temporary floodplain ponds lost
        because of land filling activities.

(19l) Pollution through solid waste and sewage from field camps and construction yards.
    o   Suitable and adequate waste disposal and processingfacilities need to be in place.

(192) Construction ofyards on charlands with high biodiversity. Especially Reedlands on Char
Janajat and Char Chandra Bari are important wildlife areas, which should not be subject of any project
building activity.
    o   Construction ofyards should be restricted to old lands and developed charlands. Use of
        Janajat and Char Chandra Bari for vegetation clearance and construction yards is ecologically
        unacceptable. Barring these two main charlands for yard construction also excludes their use
        for transportation activities and for replacement of ferry ghats.

6.5       Impacts during construction stage

6.5.1     Construction-related impacts
(193) In a project of this magnitude and complexity there are many impacts and risks which
potentially could affect air, soil, and water quality, and which could cause hindrance (noise, dust,
traffic) or pose safety hazards (health and safety). The majority of these impacts are less significant
and could be avoided, prevented or mitigated by contractors adopting good operational practices and
environmental management guidelines (use of internationally acceptable standards) and by permanent
monitoring and inspection. Most impacts could be prevented or mitigated by including an
Environmental Code of Practices and Environmental Management Guidelines in the contract
documents (see Annex C). The less significant impacts are not further discussed here. Other
construction-related impacts are:
(194) Interjerence with river transportation. The main type of river transportation that will be
negatively influenced by project construction is the movement of ferries.
      o   Provision of a safe alternative ferry route is planned. Care will have to be 'taken that this
          alternative route remains at a distance of the main wildlife area (Reedlands) of Char Janajat.

(195) Transport of materials over land and river. Large quantities of concrete, steel and rock, and
other building materials will be transported both on water and by road during mobilization and
construction. These transports will cause traffic congestions and hindrance on roads and during
navigation in the river. Also associated safety hazards have to be considered. Especially local roads
are not designed for carrying heavy traffic and this may result in considerable damage to local roads.
      o   Prevention and mitigation can be achieved by constructing temporary bypass roads in order to
          maintain uninterrupted traffic flows to ferries and urban centres.
      o   Damaged roads should be repaired.
      o   Movement ofvessels, barges and dredgers will be restricted to designated areas to reduce
          risks of collisions and accidents.

(196) Increased activity in the project area (movement of people and equipment, building and
construction activities) is likely to disturb faunal populations, especially birds, reducing the quality of
habitat for wildlife.
      o   No effective mitigation; night-time activities should be kept to a minimum.

(197) Requirement ofbricks for building activities. Building of new houses, mosques, health centres
and schools require large number of bricks. Further buildings are required for project activities, such
as offices, toll plazas. Brick production in Bangladesh is environmentally very damaging: good quality
arable land is turned unusable, non-renewable natural resources are extracted extensively (clay, wood)
and the firing process results in heavy air pollution. For mitigation purposes, an alternative is
recommended:
      o   Use ofhollow cement blocks in stead of traditional bricks for all relevant project construction
          activities. Hollow bricks are available in Bangladesh and promoted by Holcim Cement.
          Building size ofthe blocks is 4.5 times that of bricks; the (small-scale) production cost
          amounts to 15 takalblock. The production process is clean; simple production units are on the
          market for approximately 12,500 taka and can be handled by local traders (one person
          produces 200 blocks per day). It is proposed that BBA and local administration undertake a
          pilot project in using hollow cement bricks in some of the public buildings to be constructed in
          the Resettlement Sites. Using this environmentally-friendly building material in the Padma
          Bridge project could help boosting its use in Bangladesh.

6.5.2     Dredging impacts
(198) Dredging works will be carried out during the dry season, when currents are not strong, along
river banks up to a depth of -25 m PWD to remove the riverbed sediments for construction ofRTW. In
addition, dredging will be carried out in the shallow riverbeds along the bridge alignment to provide
adequate depths for the barges carrying cranes and other heavy construction equipment for the main
bridge substructure and superstructure works. This includes dredging of some vegetated charlands.

                                                    56
Dredging is also required for smooth ferry operations during construction. Further, additional dredging
may be required to source borrow material for filling up of some ofthe project sites, which will be
developed prior to RTW. In order to decrease impacts to a minimum a Dredging Material
Management Plan (DMMP) is made, in which care is taken to address all negative impacts specified
below. The following impacts are foreseen:
(199) Turbidity of surface water around cutterheads. The project authorities expect that this will
remain localized and temporary, since turbidity plumes in strong currents subside within a few hours.
Normally turbidity is not considered a major problem during the monsoon seasons, since the
additional amount of turbidity is calculated to be in the order of3.2% of the "normal" annual sediment
transport of the Padma. However, virtually all dredging will be carried out during dry seasons, when
currents are not strong and silt quantities will add substantially to the Padma's sediment transport. The
resulting turbidity will reduce light penetration into the water body, which will negatively influence
the production of plankton, the main source of food for a large number of aquatic organisms, and it
will hamper the functioning of fish gills, especially in fry. The following mitigation measures are
required and should be part and parcel of the Dredging Material Management Plan:
    o   Contractor must use anti-turbidity valves;
    o   Cutterhead turbidity must be monitored constantly during dredging. Typical TSS values
        measured in the project area during the dry season range from 5-50 mg/I upstream and 72-98
        mg/l downstream, with peaks levels at the construction site of 179 mg/l, probably caused by
        heavy boat traffic. Commonly used values for acceptable surface water TSS levels are 50-60
        mg/I. If cutterhead turbidity exceeds 200 mg/I for longer than 2 hours there will be an
        unacceptable high risk of damage to fish gills; and dredging schedules will have to be adapted
        or silt curtains will have to be used.

(200) Water quality deterioration during dredging. Water quality deterioration during dredging (high
turbidity) will affect aquatic fauna and to some extent also the use of river water (bathing/ washing) by
the population. With the silt, the amount of total dissolved solids will increase. It is unclear what the
effect will be, since the chemical quality (dissolvable compounds) is generally not known. Limited
data were collected on chemical quality (heavy metal ions) in the top 1 m of the river bed sediment.
Since virtually all dredged material is of a rather sandy nature, the ion adsorption is low, which might
result in an increase of heavy metal levels in the surface water. Therefore the following will have to be
included in the Dredging Material Management Plan:
    o   TDS levels must be monitored during dredging. Measurements during the dry season showed
        Padma water values of 112-150 mg/1. The commonly used standard for surface water is a
        maximum of 1,000 mg/l IDS, which is not expected to be reached. If, however, during
        dredging the TDS level clearly exceeds (doubles) the earlier measured values the heavy metal
        content of the water must be monitored as well.
    o   The presence oftoxic substances in surface water downstream of the dredging operations will
        have to be monitored constantly. Dredging, especially deep dredging for RTW, will expose
        deep, unoxidized layers, which might mobilize toxic substances like hydrogen sulphide,
        methane, hydrocarbons, pesticides and heavy metals. Genuine standards for surface water
        should not be exceeded.

(20 I ) Charland dredging will result in loss ofwildlife habitat. Dredging of charlands and submerged
embankments will result in loss of wildlife habitat and aquatic fauna will be forced out of their
preferred habitat. It is estimated that about 1267 ha of acquatic habitat of which 485 ha is in Padma
River and about 767 ha of floodplains will be lost due to RTW and associated works. Dredging of
parts of charlands will be carried out in order to create gullies for barge and ferry manoeuvring.
Dredging activities in the charlands will severely disturb wildlife.'All chars around the project site are
important wildlife areas, especially those where reed associations have established (large areas on
Char Janajat; patches on Char Majhir and Chandra Bari Char). The chars are known as resting and
staging grounds for migratory birds. For aquatic reptiles the charland sandy embankments are
important nesting and oviposition places, especially for the threatened or endangered river dwelling
freshwater turtles present in the project area. Similarly snakes and other reptile species may face
similar consequences from the project activities. The submerged parts of the chars are main breeding
and nursing biotopes for numerous fish and crustacean species, as well as feeding grounds for

                                                   57
dolphins. The species reported from these chars include a relatively large number of endangered
mammals, birds (both resident and migratory), reptiles and amphibians, and therefore the chars have
high conservation significance within the wider area.
    o   Main mitigating will be compensation for the loss of wildlife habitat by the establishment ofa
        1,200 ha protected wetland area (600 ha char and 600 ha river) or sanctuary for charland
        wildlife (the first in the country). Protection of a riverine wetland is fully in line with the
        WB's Water Resources Assistance Strategy for Bangladesh, and also with GOB's Declaration
        of Ecologically Critical Areas (Environmental Conservation Act, 1995), the National Water
        Policy (1999) and the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2004). Establishment
        of a Char Reserve (or Sanctuary or Protected Area, including a Fisheries Sanctuary) will have
        a positive effect on the country's natural resources and continuation of the wetland's
        environmental services to the poor segment of the population. The area must acquire official
        governmental status. The protected char and river area will contain a core zone and a buffer
        zone, both clearly demarcated. Human activities in the area will be restricted, but people
        presently dwelling in the area will continue to find a local living: the protected area will be
        managed and maintained by the local community (income from tourism and otherwise).
        Rangers (most probably in cooperation with the Forestry Department) will be trained to
        monitor and guard the area. Any tree removal from the reserve will be prohibited in order to
        compensate as much as possible for loss of nesting opportunities elsewhere.
        The reed lands and annex submerged areas of Janajat Char are excellently suitable for such
        compensation measure, since the human habitation is relatively low and the biodiversity is
        very high. However, other areas might be equally suitable, including newly established areas
        (dredge material disposal; no acquisition costs and no habitation), as long as some protection
        against erosion is in place. PMBP consultants should commence site selection, and involve a
        professional biodiversity-oriented organization like IUCN in final decisions. IUCN could also
        be involved in ecological zoning, design of ecotourism facilities (nature trails, watch hides),
        preparation of protected area management programmes, and for training of rangers and
        guards.
    o   The environmental quality of the remaining chars should remain high by minimizing the
        release of oil, oil wastes or any other substances harmful to plants or animals. These chars will
        temporary be lost for biodiversity conservation, but later repopulation from the protected char
        area is expected.
    o   Further compensation for the loss of habitat will be obtained by improving the local and
        national knowledge on charlands and their biodiversity. This will also enhance future
        protection. In stead of a Jamuna-type of wildlife museum, a full-fledged Charland Visitor
        Centre would be established. A suitable location would be (close to) Mawa, from where
        tourists and day-trippers from Dhaka can travel per (electric) boat to the protected char area on
        char Janajat or elsewhere in order to make a guided walk in the nature reserve and watch the
        reed lands with its fauna. For this purpose an educative wildlife observation tract will be
        designed and created in the conservation area. In the Visitor Centre itself, information
        (brochures, exhibits, souvenirs) will be available, showing aspects of the Padma bridge
        project, of the compensation measures to maintain the area's ecological values, and of
        charland development and biodiversity. Experience elsewhere has shown the positive effects
        of this provision of educative information, especially among school children.
        The Mawa site is preferred for the Visitor Centre, since large numbers of schoolchildren are
        expected; their visits might well be limited if they have to pay toll. The PMBP construction
        yard on the Mawa side (state land) will be used by bridge authorities after bridge construction,
        but they need less than half of the area. The Visitor Centre could be constructed (or -existing
        building could be converted) on the other half.
        For design of the Centre, its exhibits and educational materials and for training of staff a
        professional organization with experience in eeo-tourism development will have to be
        involved.

(202) River dredging will force aquatic fauna away from their preferred habitat. Dredging for river
training works and other PMBP activities will generate more than 44 million m 3 of dredged material.

                                                   58
The various project sites (roads, service areas, construction yards, railway stations, toll plazas and the
river training works themselves) will require some 20.2 million m3 of dredged material for filling.
Since most of the filling will take place before the main river training work dredging most of the
material will be required from other areas, mainly from the river itself. Depending on exact locations
and timing of river dredging, the impact will be significant: the Dredging Material Management Plan
(DMMP) will have to indicate the details. Part ofthe impact will be temporary (two seasons); most
aquatic species are likely to return after the completion of the work. Many benthic invertebrates
(crabs, mollusks, worms) are not able to actively and quickly move away from dredging activities and
will be killed. Further destabilization and upturning of mudflat sediment may result in damage to those
benthic populations. Sediment organisms play an important role in the aquatic food web and in cycling
of energy, but the damage to mudflat invertebrates by river dredging is not considered significant,
since it will be localized and since the invertebrate species concerned are common and they have a
high regenerating capacity. More important is the damage to the breeding and nursing biotope of
fishes and the feeding area for dolphins; this impact and suitable mitigation were largely discussed in
earlier sections (submerged parts of charlands), but the following mitigations should be added and be
part of the DMMP:
    o   Dredgingforfilling material should avoid the charlands and their submerged extensions as
        much as possible. Dredging of parts of Janajat Char and Chandra Bari Char, both biodiversity
        hotspots will have to be excluded.
    o   The proposed charland protected area should extend into the river as a fish sanctuary, in order
        to safeguard breeding, nursing and fishing areas for aquatic fauna. Also the aquatic part of the
        conservation area should be well demarcated and guarded; it is expected that this measure will
        have a positive effect on fish and dolphin populations that far exceeds the compensation for
        dredging.

(203)   Deep dredging in the main gully during March-May will interfere with Hilsa migration. There
is quite some confusion regarding the migration patterns of Hilsa, but the present status of science
confirms that all subspecies of this commercially and dietary important fish migrate from seawater to
freshwater for breeding. Various Hilsa breeding grounds are situated upstream of the project site. The
Dredging Material Management Plan should include the following mitigating measure:
    o   Dredging for the RTW on the Mawa side (two km) should be suspended during the main Hilsa
        migration period (March to May). On the Janjira side dredging may continue.

(204)   Dredging may damage unknown sites and objects of cultural or heritage importance. It should
be realized that the Ganges and Brahmaputra delta also have been densely populated during medieval
times and before. Objects and sites of archaeological value might have been covered over centuries by
river sediments and could be exposed during dredging. A recent case of a suddenly emerging medieval
temple from the Ganges River, just before merging with Brahmaputra has shown that such events are
even likely.
    o   Chance-finds procedures should be included in the contract documents for the dredging
        contractor.

(205)   Disposal ofdredged material on charlands will severely impact flora and fauna. There is
shortage of dredged material in the early project phases (for filling of sites) and there will be more
than 25 million m3 excess dredged material in later phases, mainly resulting from the river training
works. It was proposed to stockpile this dredged material during the dry (dredging) season on two
charlands, the Majhir char and char Tarapasa. The stockpiling will result in raising the level of the
chars by (at least) some 3.2 m; all this dredged material is expected to erode into the river during the
subsequent monsoons, when river silt content and turbidity are high already. The selected stockpile
areas are considered 'not in use'. As far as human use is concerned this might be correct, but as was
stated already earli쩼 the charlands, and especially their submerged parts, play an important role in
river ecology and in production of the commercially important food fish for the Bangladesh
population. During the monsoon the newly vegetated areas add to the submerged parts (the plants
provide stabilization of those mudflats), and it is exactly there that fish eggs are deposited, where
young fish (fry and fingerlings) find their feed, and where fish eaters, including dolphins and otters,
find their prey. By uplifting of the surface of the chars the monsoon will not be able to transfer them

                                                    59
into the usual wetland areas, and as a consequence the charlands are lost for fish reproduction and
dolphin feeding.
(206) There are additional impacts from stockpiling of dredged material because of increased river
transportation by dredgers and by pumping of dredged material (oil, noise, vibration). Levels and
impacts are unclear. It is also not clear what the relation is between stockpiling on Majhir Char and the
need for new gullies for barges and ferries through the same char.
    o   Adaptation of the DMMP is not easy, especially since no clear picture is available of how
        much dredged material will be available when and where and what type of dredging
        equipment will be used. In Bangladesh a continuous demand for filling material exists and the
        possibilities to bring supply and demand together have not been investigated fully. This might
        result in a considerable quantity of dredged material for which no other option exists than
        temporary or permanent stockpiling (land reclamation). So far only an outline ofthe DMMP
        has been prepared. It is essential to work out a more detailed plan together with the dredging
        contractor, during contract negotiations.
    o   Part of the dredged material might be used for creation of a new, artificial char with low
        elevation, if a location can be identified where such char may be reasonably expected to
        possess a life time of 10+ years. Such an artificial area, if protected from human immigration,
        could well develop in a biodiversity-rich char in 3-4 years time and would meet the demands
        for a compensatory char protected area. Small damage will be compensated by the proposed
        Nature reserve andfish sanctuary.

(207) Water quality will deteriorate during dredging. Aspects of water quality deterioration were
discussed earlier, and the proposed mitigation activities will also be required:

(208) Monitoring is required oftotal soluble solids (TSS) and total dissolved solids (TDS), followed
by dredging adaptations in order to keep them under acceptable levels. This includes monitoring
during monsoon periods in case substantial silt stockpiling on chars takes place.

6.5.3 Piling impacts
(209) Piling takes place during the construction phase only. Impacts will therefore mainly have a
temporary character, but effects are significant and lasting. The following impacts are foreseen:
(210) Disturbance offish migration route by vibrations. The anadromous Hilsa fish migrates
upstream for feeding and breeding during March-May. Young fish and returning adults will migrate
back to the sea throughout the year, but with a distinct peak during the winter months. Although Hilsa
migrates mainly through deeper parts of the river, also vibrations from piling in shallow stretches will
be transmitted through the river water and disturb migration. For most commercially important species
(Hilsa, carps, catfish) migration is indispensable to reach the breeding areas close to or upstream of the
project site. Vibrations caused by piling will chase fish away from the wider area, resulting in loss of
recruitment. Although these disturbances will take place during two years only, the effect on
especially Hilsa will be long-lasting: interruption of its migration from the sea to the upstream
breeding areas will result in the absence of two year-classes born upstream of the project site, and
those year-classes will subsequently not use the same migration route when they are adult. This will
virtually eliminate the breeding opportunities for this important food fish in the traditional Padma
breeding areas upstream of the project site. This is especially important since Hilsa recruitment is
already suffering from the stress of overfishing.
(211) Also downstream migration, especially of Hilsa during winter, will be negatively influenced
by vibrations, but the seawards thrive is probably strong enough to overcome the disturbance.
Moreover, interruption of downstream migration has no direct negative effect on recruitment.
    o   In order to safeguard fish migration, piling in water should be discontinued during March to
        May in deeper areas of the river. After extensive discussions with the project authorities it was
        decided that this mitigation measure is achievable with a depth limitation of seven meter. A
        shallower limitation would create unacceptable technical and financial problems.
    o   Piling on land, on Majhir char and in water shallower than seven meter might in principle
        continue during March-May, provided that vibration measurements and Hilsa observations


                                                   60
        indicate uninterrupted migration. If monitoring results point at severe interruption of Hilsa
        migration the acceptable piling depth will be decreased.

(212)   Noise pollution from piling disturbs behaviour ofaquatic fauna. There has been much
scientific debate over sound levels causing problems for dolphins and fish. Typically, fish detect
sounds of frequencies up to 2,000 Hz and will thus be able to hear underwater noise generated by
piling. The sideline organs of fish are extremely sensitive for vibrations. All fish is expected to move
away from the area during piling activities, which will create low yields for the 2,700 full-time
fishermen and the scores of temporary fishermen traditionally active in the area.
(213) Dolphins have very sensitive acoustic organs, and thus are sensitive to noise and vibration.
Ganges River Dolphins are present within the project site; they are likely to avoid the area during the
construction period and especially during the main calving period (mainly May-July). Both dolphins
and fish use sounds for communication; strong vibrations might well disturb their common behaviour
patterns, potentially resulting in loss of reproduction capacity. Combination ofthese effects with the
loss of breeding and nursing biotopes for fish and feeding ground for dolphins from dredging
operations will cause a major project impact.
(214) The limited data available show that also turtles can hear low-frequency sounds. Behavioural
changes have been observed when turtles are exposed to sound levels above 175 dB. These aquatic
turtles, all endangered, use charlands near the project area as their nesting site; disturbing of nesting
might have a negative influence on the already vulnerable turtle populations.
(215) Birds generally react on sudden noise by flying up and away. Commonly they return to their
nesting or feeding places straight away. It is expected that virtually all bird species will avoid the area
close to the project site during construction activities, but that they will return to the charlands
immediately thereafter. In case of continuing strong noise, however, biologically relevant bird songs
may be masked, resulting in lower breeding success. The following mitigation is required:
    o   The piling system with lowest sound generation should be selected in order to keep the
        disturbances as minimal as possible.
    o   In order to prevent impacts on reproduction of the Ganges Dolphin, noise should be kept as
        low as possible during the main calving period, which is May to July. For this reason, the
        limitation to piling for Hilsa migration (during March to May not in areas deeper than seven
        m) will be extended till end of July.

(216) Transportation ofpiles and other large materials will require dredging away ofparts of
Majhir Char. In addition, the provision of alternative routes for ferries will result in additional gullies
through char Janajat. Dredging of gullies will not only counteract the deposit plans for dredged
material on the char, but it will also decrease the ecologically important charland proper. In order to
keep the latter impacts as low as possible:
    o   Char dredging has to be limited as much as possible. Whenever possible, barges and ferries
        should make use of existing gullies and new and temporary ferry ghats should be located
        downstream ofthe project site (east of the River Training Works). Continued use of the
        present Kewrakandi Ghat, making use of the existing gullies, is an acceptable option for small
        craft only.

6.5.4   Impacts of River Training Works
(217) Impacts ofRTW on floodplain and river ecology are in principle long lasting or permanent.
These impacts are highly significant in view ofthe large footprint ofthe RTW, which is estimated at
328 ha on land and 292 ha in the river. The following impacts are foreseen:
(218) Dredging, filling and reshaping of 15 km of RTW alignment (44 million m3 in two years) will
result in substantial loss ofwildlife habitat. All embankments around the project site are wildlife
areas, especially those where grass and reed vegetations have established. Given the limited
availability of non-inhabitated lands in Bangladesh and the high natural biodiversity, it is essential to
keep as many charlands as possible untouched. The value of these sites is in principle comparable to
that of the charland beaches discussed earlier ( dredging impacts), although some areas are prone to
human disturbance. Replacement of the natural embankments by artificial materials in order to


                                                    61
increase bank stability will have a severe effect on all elements of the river bank ecosystems.
Especially the submerged parts of the embankments are important: their benthic communities,
macrophytes and plankton provide main breeding, nursing and feeding biotopes for numerous fish and
crustacean species, as well as feeding grounds for dolphins.
    o   Main mitigating will be the compensation for the loss ofwildlife habitat by the establishment
        ofa protected area or reserve for charland wildlife, as described under dredging impacts.

(219) Increase of turbidity during the dry season will inhibit production ofplankton, the basis of the
aquatic food chain. Since most dredging will take place along the embankments, where the major
feeding places are concentrated, the effect might be substantial. In addition, dredged material will
settle on submerged plants downstream, inhibiting photosynthesis and therewith their function in the
ecosystems.
    o   Main mitigating measures were mentioned under the section on dredging; they mainly consist
        of anti-turbidity valves on the cutterheads and of constant monitoring of turbidity. When
        turbidity along the embankments downstream of the dredging operations reach TSS values of
        200 mg/I for longer than 2 hours there will be an unacceptable high risk of damage to fish
        gills, and dredging schedules will have to be adapted or silt curtains will have to be used.

(220) The use of anchoring materials (geobags, riprap, geotextile) will result in a loss of 700 ha
natural embankment with submerged forelands. Embankments, and especially the submerged parts,
are important feeding and breeding biotopes for virtually all aquatic fauna. Undisturbed parts are
nesting places for birds and reptiles. Natural shore vegetation is rich in insects, serving as food for
birds. Protected stable riverbanks with underwater slope coverage have the positive impact of
providing more shelter to fish and other aquatic life as compared with present embankments, but
shelter is substantially less important than other habitat functions.
    o   No direct mitigation is possible, but the impacts support the need for compensation in the form
        of a wildlife reserve or sanctuary, including a riverine zone.

(221) River training works decrease the present seasonal wetland area. Temporary wetlands are
flooded agricultural lands during the monsoon periods. Their ecological significance is more or less
comparable to that of the submerged areas around the chars; decrease of the wetland area will result in
loss of feeding and nursing biotope of all fish and crustacean species.
    o   No direct mitigation, but the impacts support the need for the compensation in the form of a
        wildlife reserve or sanctuary, including a riverine zone.

(222) Embankment dredging will force aquatic fauna away from their preferred habitat. Dredging
for filling material is already discussed under the dredging section above. The longitudinal character
of dredging for river training works will have an additional impact on Hilsa migration, especially
along the northern embankment.
    o   Dredging for river training works along the northern shore should be suspended during the
        main Hi/sa migration period (March-May). Dredging along the south-western side (Janjira
        side) may continue.
    o   In order to prevent concentration of silt and other waste, dredging should proceed in upstream
        direction. An additional advantage is that aquatic fauna will be driven towards clean water.

(223) The RTW and the raised alignments of the approach road will obstruct the natural drainage
flow in the area. This may lead to waterlogging problems and stagnation of flood water after floods
retreat.
    o   For mitigation and prevention of these problems it is important to keep the existing natural
        drainage system functioning and to improve the system where the natural flow is blocked,
        hampered or changed in direction. A number of bridges and culverts have been designed to
        overcome these problems, but waterlogging may still create local problems in residential and
        agriculture areas. It is important to monitor the natural flow system during the monsoon and
        flood period for a number of years. It is expected that improvements to the drainage systems


                                                   62
          might be required at a number of localized places. Special attention should be given to the
          outflow of the natural drains, streams and gullies collecting flood/rainwater from the areas
          behind the RTW.

(224) The use of dredged material in the construction of RTW might affect neighbouring agricultural
and residential areas. The leachate of these sediments might contain colloids and possible harmful
substances which might percolate into the surface and groundwater system of the hinterland. Damage
to adjacent agricultural lands and homestead areas should be avoided.
      o   To mitigate this problem, a buffer zone behind the RTW of 150m wide with tree plantations
          and a proper drainage system should be created to contain seepage and leaching of effluents
          from dredged material, which might especially occur during floods and monsoon. The side
          slopes of the embankments should be properly compacted and covered with a layer of topsoil
          of at least O.5m. A turf grass cover should prevent possible erosion and gullying. More inland
          a strip planted with trees and a deep drain should separate the RTW from the hinterland.
      o   Provisions should be made to set aside sufficient good quality topsoil before starting with the
          RTW.


6.6       Impacts during operation and maintenance stage

6.6.1     Social impacts
(225) Increased risks because of enhanced traffic volume. A considerable increase in traffic passing
the bridge is expected from 12,056 vehicles per day in 2014 to more than 75,500 in 2044. This
increase will have impacts on the environmental quality for the population living in the roadside
settlements.
      o   Settlement planning should include traffic management and noise reduction in order to
          prevent decline of the quality ofliving and to prevent increase of safety hazards and accidents.
      o   An Emergency Response Plan has been prepared, which covers all aspects of emergency
          management including prevention, preparation, response and follow-up of emergencies
          (accidents, flooding, spill/leakage of hazardous materials). An Emergency Response Team and
          an Emergency Response Centre with trained staff and equipment will be established to deal
          with such events.

(226) Increased Green House Gas emissions. It is expected that more than 75,500 vehicles will cross
Padma River daily in the year 2044, contributing extra GHG emissions of approximately334,200 ton
CO2 equivalents/year (based on use of conventional fuel). Total project GHG emission contribution as
compared to the national total and world emission is insignificant. Moreover, the suspension of regular
ferry services will contribute to a further reduction ofGHG emissions.
      o   Introduction o/new techniques and new sources offuel wherever possible will result in
          lowering the additional GHG emissions.

6.6.2     Environmental impacts
(227) Increased noise levels because of enhanced traffic volume and speed. Traffic speed will be
higher on the planned four-lane road, adding to noise. Commercially impDrtant fish species like carps
and catfish breed near the project site. It is unclear what the effect of traffic noise will be on their
reproductive behaviour, but since this noise is expected to be of a relatively continuous character their
will be quick habituation, as is presently the case with the noise from river traffic. Vibrations from
trains, however, might cause more disturbances, since they will be transmitted through water and they
are less continuous. Train vibrations might well result in a permanent loss .of a part of the present
feeding, breeding and nursing biotDpe of dolphins and fish, and, especially, .of resting and staging
grounds for migratory birds.                                                      .
(228) Noise from traffic will not have an impact on bird presence or behaviour; since the noise is
more cDncentrated in place and more continuous in time than that from the present system of irregular
ferry movements. The presence of other terrestrial wildlife and livestock species is a testament to their
resilience to human induced disturbance.

    a   Provision of sound screens/barriers along the new road in the neighbourhood of schools and,
        ifnoise measurements command so, also in the neighbourhood of homesteads and settlements.
    a   Use ofsilent sleepers on the bridge proper.
    a   Provide speed reduCing devices on the bridge and set maximum train speed.

(229)   Oil spills from the bridge.
    a   Provision of oil gutters along the road on the bridge.

(230) Change of river and floodplain hydrology because ofRTW Long-term impacts from RTW
cannot be prevented: flow patterns may lead to changes in charland patterns different from what would
have happened without the RTW. Natural erosion and accretion processes will be influenced.and
replaced by comparable processes elsewhere. This, in tum, might influence the livelihoods of people
living along the river.
    a   No direct mitigation, but changes in flow patterns should be monitored and potentially
        affected people should be warned well in advance.

7        CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER RELEVANT ISSUES FOR BRIDGE DESIGN

7.1      Climate change

(231) The Government of Bangladesh has a pro-active policy with regard to climate change. In 2008,
the national "Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan" was published, prioritizing disaster risk
reduction, decreasing of carbon emissions, and provision of adequate finance for mitigation of
impacts.

(232) Climate change may result in the rise of future sea levels, higher temperatures, and wind
speeds and increased cyclone intensities and rainfall, which are all factors that may affect the design of
the Padma Bridge. A study was carried out as part of the EIA into the potential effects of climate
change.

7.1.1     Future sea level rise
(233) Sea level rise in the Bay of Bengal is the combined effect of global sea level rise, local changes
in sea level due to ocean density and circulation changes and possible subsidence or uplift of the delta.
The study used a model previously used in climate studies in Bangladesh. Three scenarios for global
sea level rise in the year 2100 as projected by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), 2007 were used:
     a high-end, low-probability estimate of sea level rise of 0.98 m;
     a low-end estimate of sea level rise of 0.26 m;
     a pragmatic mid-range estimate of sea level rise of 0.60 m;

(234) The above scenarios would cause a water-level rise at the bridge site of respectively 0.47 m,
0.27 m and 0.09 m. Even in the most extreme scenario seawater intrusion would remain far from the
bridge site, which is located 240 km inland.

7.1.2     Temperature and windforce
(235) Maximum, mean and minimum temperatures can rise between 2 and 4 C. The maximum
temperature can reach values of 43.9 C in 2050 and 46.6  C in the year 2100 in the once in hundred
year event. Cyclone intensities may increase with 10 to 20%. Wind forces can increase to 110 kmIhr
and during cyclones even up to 126 kmlhr.

7.1.3     Rainfall and hydrology
(236) Due to climate change the maximum rainfall may increase to 372 mm for I-day and 514 mm
for a 2-day period. The increased rainfall intensities can affect the entire hydrology of the Ganges-
Brahmaputra basin. Model studies show that increased precipitation could result in a potential peak
discharge of 151,000 m 3/sec at Padma Bridge and a minimum flow of7,345 m3/sec.

7.1.4    Impacts on bridge design
(237) Based on the results of the climate change studies the following extreme situations were taken
into consideration in the design of the Padma Bridge:
     A maximum extra water-level increase at the bridge site of 0.63 m, which is the combined impact
      of sea level rise (extreme scenario) and increased rainfall in the catchment area leading to a
      maximum water level of7.44m PWD;
     A maximum temperature of 46.6 캜 and a minimum temperature of 9.3 캜;
     A maximum rainfall of372 mm in I-day period and 514 mm in a 2-day period;
                                                           3
     A predicted maximum peak discharge of 151,100 m /sec and a lowest flow of 7,345 m3/sec; and
     Maximum wind speed of 126 kmIh.

(238) Following these design criteria no direct impacts from climate change on lifetime and
functioning of the bridge is expected.

(239) A positive impact from the project might be mentioned as well: one of the pillars of the
Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan is to develop infrastructure to ensure that coastal and river

                                                    65
embankments are fit to deal with likely impacts. The project's RTW assist in meeting this national
strategy.

7.1.5   Greenhouse gas emissions
(240) Bangladesh' Climate Change Strategy advertises low carbon development as one of its six
main pillars. During the project's climate change study, assessments were made of the carbon
emissions from fuel combustion, evaporation and leaks after construction of the bridge: they are
estimated to rise from the present 165 ton/year to some 750 ton/year in 2014 (and to a tenfold ofthis in
2044). Although the total amount might be insignificant from a global perspective, the impact will
certainly be negative and will need to be compensated by emission decreases elsewhere. The proposed
use of hollow cement blocks in stead of traditional bricks for all building activities on resettlement
sites and the planned increase of the number of trees in the area will result in partial compensation.


7.2     Erosion

(241) Erosion of river banks and of charlands is a common phenomenon in the active Padma River
system. Periods with little erosion and more accretion usually alternate with periods of increased land
erosion.

7.2.1   Natural bank erosion
(242) During the last two years Char Janajat has been exposed to increased land erosion and it is
expected that the charlands upstream of the Arial Khan off-take may also experience some massive
erosion, especially on Char Badrashan. This could be caused by a change in the main channel flow of
the Padma River in southern direction. This will happen both with and without the project, and is
expected to become more severe due to future heavier rainfall patterns and accelerated melting of
Himalayan glaciers. It is not very likely that the bridge will have much influence on this erosion
process. The affected area lies more than 15-20 km upstream of the bridge and studies with numerical
and physical models concluded that the expected backwater effect from the bridge would be not more
than 2 km upstream. Further protection of the charlands at the present time would fall beyond the
scope of the present project.

7.2.2   Possible impacts on charlantis
(243) However, char dwellers could attribute the increased erosion to the construction of the bridge
and raise compensation claims against BBA. For this reason a Charland Monitoring and Management
Framework (CMMF) has been prepared which gives guidelines for identifying potential impacts and
risks for the charland communities given the uncertainty of erosion and accretion processes in the
floodplain of the Padma River. Development of an Early Warning System for riverine floods and
subsequent erosion levels will have to be included.

8         ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN

8.1       Objectives of the EMP

(244) This section presents an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) that outlines a programme of
activities to minimize or attenuate potential environmental impacts.

(245) The main objective of the EMP is to:
     Ensure that negative impacts identified in this EIA are effectively eliminated, controlled, mitigated
      or compensated;
     Provide guidance to the implementing organisation (BBA and their Consultants and Contractors
      working on the Project) on appropriate measures to be implemented to ensure that impacts are
      effectively eliminated, controlled, mitigated or compensated;
     Build capacity within the implementing organisations in environmental management; and
     Provide training in environmental management to staff involved in construction and in the
      operation of the project.

(246) The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) includes various categories of mitigating and
compensating measures. These are appropriate instruments that can be adopted to prevent, mitigate or
compensate for potential impacts or risks caused by the project. The measures include:
     Measures that can be included in design and contract documents. Many of the measures are
      included in lists of Environmental Code of Practices (ECP) to be annexed to the general conditions
      of all contracts carried out under the project;
     Stand-alone mitigation measures, for which the required actions are beyond the responsibility or
      ability of contractors, unless the contracts are specifically aiming at such measures; and
     Proactive compensatory measures, e.g. measures to preserve specific habitats.

(247) An overview of impacts and mitigating measures is presented in Table 8.1.


8.2       Measures in Design and Contract Documents

8.2.1     Environmental Code of Practices
(248) The ETA process was instrumental in improving some ofthe earlier design options (in river
training works, resettlement sites, approach roads, etc). The design consultant has incorporated general
and specific environmental protection measures into the contract documents.

(249) Most of the construction related impacts and some of the operation related impacts can be
prevented, minimised or mitigated by following environmentally-friendly design options and by
including special conditions in the respective construction bid documents. A standard Environmental
Code of Practices (ECP) has been prepared to address all general less significant construction-related
environmental impacts. ECP's for 19 different construction related activities is presented in Annex C.

(250) The design consultant will include relevant ECP's in the contract documents and makes them
conditional for contract award.The task of the supervising consultant is to monitor implementation.

8.2.2     Measures to be budgeted by contractors
(251) The specific measures concerned are listed hereunder. In general they concern adaptations in
technology that are not expected to require substantial funds: they can be found within the already
specified budgets for civil and social works. The identified measures will complement the
environmental requirements that are normally included in contractor contracts relating to waste and
sewage, noise and vibrations, health and safety, damage to properties, etc.

(252) Additional measures are:
     Restriction of construction yards to old lands and developed charlands;
     Compacting of filled areas, covering them with top soil from old settlements, planting them with
      turf, and maintaining turf until full cover is established. (as far as road verges are concerned,
      spraying of a mixture of tar, compost and grass seeds guarantees low levels of erosion during
      germination and quick turf establishment);
     Provision of ponds for domestic use and fish production in the resettlement areas (approximately
      12 ha, to compensate for the loss of an equal area);
     Use of hollow cement blocks for buildings in stead of traditional bricks;
     Acquisition of environmental clearance for harvesting of natural products (rocks, gravel);
     Use of silent sleepers for railway;
     Provision of oil gutters along the bridge;
     Interruption of piling in water deeper than seven m during March-July;
     Use of a piling system with lowest sound generation;
     Prevention of night-time activities with bright lights, especially in or close to the river;
     Use of anti-turbidity valves for dredging;
     Maximum restriction of Char dredging and no dredging at Char Janajat and Chandra Bari Char,
      both biodiversity hotspots;
     Suspension ofRTW dredging at the Mawa side during the main fish migration period (March-
      May); and
     Dredging in upstream direction.

(253) During construction, the consultant responsible for supervision ofEMP and RAP will monitor
civil works contractors and verify that they implement the works in accordance with the measures
mentioned in the construction bid documents. The supervising consultant will also raise environmental
sensitivity and awareness of the personnel of contractors and sub-contractors working on the project.


8.3      Stand alone mitigation and compensation measures

8.3.1    Social Action Plan
(254) A Social Action Plan (SAP) has been prepared which details compensation and resettlement.
These are based on the following principles:
     Avoid or minimize impacts through alternative designs;
     Consultation of affected households and disclosure of plans at the project sites;
     Compensation of lost assets at full replacement cost determined by an independent property
      valuation commission;
     Provision of resettlement assistance to all affected persons;
     Establish grievances committees to resolve disputes;
     Provision of additional assistance to poor women and vulnerable groups;
     Provision of income and livelihood restoration support; and
     Monitoring by independent external agency/experts.

(255) The details of these principles have been worked out and included in a Resettlement
Framework, which describes all the entitlements, procedures and activities for compensation and
resettlement assistance to the affected households and individuals. An overview of the eligibility for
entitlements is given in Annex D. The Social Action Plan further includes Resettlement Action Plans
for the different project components and supporting programmes focussed on participatory approach,
support to poor women and vulnerable groups, public health and safety, and potential impacts on
charlands. A summary of the cost of SAP is given in Table 8.2.

8.3.2    Resettlement Action Plans                                            .
(256) Resettlement Action Plans have been made for the Resettlement sites (RAP I), the Main
Bridge and Approach roads (RAP II) and the River Training Works (RAP III). Four resettlement sites
will be developed for permanent relocation of households which have indicated to be willing to

                                                   75
resettle in these villages. Designs for these resettlement villages have been prepared; they include the
provision of infrastructure and services. Another group of households has expressed their wish to
relocate themselves (self-relocation in host areas). These households will be absorbed in neighbouring
villages to share existing civil facilities. In order to support the integration of these families into the
existing communities the project will improve or expand the existing religious and educational
facilities in these host villages, as well as physical infrastructure, such as access roads, water supply,
drainage and power supply.

8.3.3   Income and Livelihood Restoration Plan
(257) As part of the Resettlement Action Plans an Income and Livelihood Restoration Plan is
prepared, in order to develop alternative incomes and skills for those people that are forced out of their
traditional livelihoods: farmers, fishermen, ferry personnel. Some of those people (numbers are not yet
known) may be employed temporary in project activities, but most of them will require a complete
new life. A development fund of I million US$ is earmarked for the Plan; it is not yet clear if, and for
what part, this fund will be used for compensation of lost income.

8.3.4   Gender Action Plan
(258) A gender action plan has been prepared to promote women's participation in project planning
and implementation and to maximize women's access to project benefits. It is expected that the bridge
and the improvement of road and communications networks will have far-reaching impacts on their
lives. Improvement of road connections will increase mobility and access to health clinics, educational
institutions and social services. Better opportunities for employment and income generating activities
will also be created for women. The plan pays special attention to support for poor, female-headed and
disabled households.

8.3.5   Public Health Action Plan
(259) The objective of this plan is to set up a programme of preventive health care aimed at the
resettled communities in the four resettlement sites and the host areas. The programme of information,
education and communication will focus on issues like personal health, sanitation, food and nutrition,
vaccination, malaria prevention and HIV/Aids/STI prevention. Also curative health facilities and
services will be set up in the four resettlement sites and in two service areas. These centres will
provide medical services to resettled people, the general public as well as to the work force in the
project. The two facilities in the service areas will also have the capacity to treat emergency cases. The
centre on the south bank will be able to manage trauma patients. The programme is designed to
facilitate an easy integration into the public sector health care system of the respective upazillas after
completion of the project.

8.3.6   Charland Monitoring and Management Framework
(260) Hydro-morphological studies of the Padma River during the last decades have revealed that
there is a risk of bank erosion of the Janajat charlands upstream of the bridge. According to local
people on this char there has been about two km of erosion during the last two years and more erosion
is to be expected during the years to come. This natural process, which is a common phenomenon in
the delta of Bangladesh, is rather unpredictable. Most probably the construction of the bridge and the
associated river training works will not accelerate the erosion process, since the backwater effect of


                                                    76
bridge and RTW is limited to a few kilometres only and model studies have confirmed that bridge
construction is expected to have no impact on the river flow. However, ifbank erosion should occur, it
will be very difficult to assess whether the bridge is responsible for increased bank erosion or natural
erosion. Given the uncertainty of erosion and accretion in the floodplain of the Padma River a
Charland Impact Management Framework will be developed to monitor developments and implement
mitigation measures in case of adverse developments affecting the charland communities who are
amongst the most vulnerable groups of people in Bangladesh.

8.3.7   Emergency Response Plan
(261) An Emergency Response Plan has been prepared for unexpected events and accidents during
the operational phase, such as extreme flooding, traffic accidents (road and rail), leakage or spill of
hazardous materials, civil disturbance/riot, terrorist attacks/threats and gas leaks or explosions. The
plan aims at applying effective prevention techniques to avert an emergency event from ever taking
place. It further includes measures for a rapid and effective emergency response; the provision of
assistance to emergency and security services; the implementation of an evacuation plan if required,
and the establishment of good communications with persons/institutions involved in transport and
emergency services.

8.3.8   Preservation of topsoil
(262) The topsoil of the areas to be filled with dredged material should be preserved, since this
material contains humus and clay and represents the most fertile part of the soils in the project area.
Material from dredge disposal mainly consists of infertile and sterile fine sand and silt, without any
clay or humus and devoid of any soil life. It would take many years and large quantities of compost
and manure to achieve sufficient water holding capacity and fertility to make the dredged material
suitable for tree cultivation and as homestead garden. Therefore it is important that a layer of 0.25-
0.50 m of topsoil (depending on later land use) is stripped off and put aside and stored for later
application as covering layer on top of the sandy dredged material in those areas where tree planting or
homestead gardening is foreseen.

8.3.9   Dredging Material Management Plan
(263) Dredging works will be carried out during the entire construction period (three seasons), in
order:
   to remove riverbed sediments for the construction ofRTW;
   to prepare channels in the shallow parts of the river near the bridge. alignment to make the
    construction site accessible to barges carrying cranes and other heavy construction equipment; and
   to provide alternative channels for ferry operations.

(264) These dredging activities will generate an enormous quantity of dredged material, part of
which will be needed at a later stage of the project. Large quantities of dredged material are needed for
earth filling activities of the various project sites to levels above maximum flood level, although at
different moments during construction, requiring stockpiling of dredge dredged material for some time
in temporary basins (Confined Disposal Facilities) or on non-vegetated charlands. A Dredging
Material Management Plan aims at bringing supply and demand together as close as possible. Part of
the dredged material might be used for creation of an artificial char to be developed into a protected
char area.

(265) A Dredging Material Management Plan is prepared in order to optimize operations and to
minimize damage to charlands, wildlife habitats and fisheries. The plan describes the method of
dredging operations and type of equipment to be used, method and conditions for each of the
designated dredging areas, and methods for temporary or permanent disposal. Essential elements of
the plan are the description of methodologies and tools to be used by contractors, direction of dredging
operations, and interruption of dredging during ecologically sensitive periods. All these elements will
be part and parcel of the contract documents for dredging contractors. Their compliance will be
checked by the supervising consultant, whereas the final effects on habitats, biodiversity and fisheries
will be monitored by an appropriate independent organization, such as IUCN, engaged by the
Supervising Consultant.

8.4            Proactive compensation measures to preserve and enhance riverine and wetland areas

8.4.1          Tree replanting and reforestation plan
(266) More than 400,000 trees will be planted to compensate for the loss of trees on the 1,185 ha to
be acquired by the project. The trees will be planted in strips along the approach roads, along internal
roads and in green belts around resettlement sites, construction sites, public places and behind river
training guide bunds. Species selected include 50% trees for timber, 30% fruit trees, 10% medicinal
tree species and 10% trees suitable for production of fuel wood. Settlers will receive a number of
saplings to be planted around their houses after topsoil has been relocated there. On the sandy non-
settlement sites tree planting holes should be filled with compost in advance. In order to compensate
the 359,549 bamboo and banana trees, 719,098 saplings of banana and bamboo will be distributed to
the people in the host villages. The ratio of bamboo and banana will be 60:40. This will bring positive
attitude within the host village population for accepting project affected people.

(267) Although tree growth is fast under the tropical conditions of Bangladesh, it will take a number
of years (the longest for timber and fruit trees) before they will provide their services at the level of the
trees they have to replace. In order to keep the waiting period low, only trees of (at least) 3-5 years old
(girth of 10 cm or more) will be planted. Tree owners will be compensated for their loss of trees and
for the period without products (including fuel wood) from newly provided trees through the RAPs.
BBA will engage Forestry Department staff (two officers on deputation basis) for valuation. These
Forestry Department officers will also supervise and monitor the tree planting programme, in
cooperation with the Safeguard Department of BBA. The actual work (programming, distribution,
planting, maintenance and training) will ,be carried out by selected "Plantation Development NGOs".

(268) The availability of 400,000 young trees of suitable size requires a massive nursing activity
from the onset of the project. FD district nurseries will only be able to provide a part of the needs. The
Plantation Development NGOs should be provided with funds and space to carry out the necessary
nursing activities, under supervision of the FD, and starting as early as possible. The tree planting
success of the project will be fully dependent on the success of the nursery activities. The cost of the
tree planting and forestation is presented in Table 8.3.

8.4.2     Padma Protected Sanctuary
(269) As compensation for the loss of wildlife biotopes and biodiversity conservation through
project activities a 1,000 ha protected sanctuary or nature reserve will be established on a suitable
location close to the project site, where the main biodiversity hotspots are located. A suitable location
would be Char Janajat. The reed lands and the submerged areas surrounding the char are excellently
suitable for such compensation measure, since the human habitation is low and the biodiversity is very
high. The protected area on the char must acquire official status and will contain a core area and a
buffer zone. The core area will extend into the river, in order to create highly-needed reproduction,
nursing and feeding areas for fish, crustaceans, turtles and dolphins.

(270) In stead of developing a protected area on an existing char, with all the difficulties ofland
acquisition and erosion, a site selection process could also result in the advice to develop a new char,
using the surplus of dredged materials. If an artificial char is kept free of human habitation, the
ecosystem development proceeds rather fast. Conditions for selection of this alternative are:
     the char should be relatively close to the bridge site, in order to develop its cost-recovery system
      (the eco-tourism connection);
     the char should be relatively insensitive to river erosion;
     the char should have a height of 1-(max)3 m above the monsoon water level;
     the char should have a number of water bodies or channels;
     guards should be employed from the start in order to prevent human occupation.

(271) In case an existing char is selected for protected area development, human activities will be
restricted there, but people already living there (if any) will continue to find a local living: the
protected area will be managed and maintained by the local community (income from tourism and
otherwise). Rangers (most probably in cooperation with the Forestry Department) will be trained to
monitor and guard the area. On an existing char, any tree removal from the reserve will be prohibited
in order to compensate as much as possible for loss of nesting opportunities elsewhere.

(272) The establishment of a protected sanctuary with local management and maintenance and a
related cost-recovery system through ecotourism development (see section 8.4.3) could well serve as a
regional model for compensation of ecological damage by large infrastructural works.

(273) Preparation of a protected sanctuary could best be done by an organization with international
and national experience in this type of activities, such as IUCN. The preparation would include the site
selection, zoning and demarcation, design of facilities, official procedures to acquire legal status,
development of management and maintenance procedures, training ofloeal people, and design of
monitoring schedules and procedures. A cost estimate for establishing a protected area is given in
Table 8.4.

8.4.3   Visitor Centre at Mawa
(274) In order to acquire financial self-sufficiency for the protected sanctuary, an eco-tourism
venture will be part and parcel of the development model. The venture will be set up in the form of a
Visitor Centre, where all aspects of charlands (development, ecology, biodiversity) will be made
visible in a dynamic and interactive manner, and where charland information materials and souvenirs
can be procured. A modem Visitor Centre includes a small restaurant and special facilities for groups
of children.

(275) A suitable location for the Visitor Centre would be in Mawa, from where tourists and day
trippers from Dhaka can travel per electric boat to char Janajat to make a guided walk in the protected
area and watch the reed lands and its fauna. The Mawa side is preferred in order to allow people to
visit without the burden of paying bridge toll.

(276) As for the protected area, detailed plans for the visitor centre will be prepared by an
experienced organization (IUCN), assisted by international consultants and in close cooperation with
BBA, the Ministry of Environment, the Department of Fisheries and the Parjatan Corporation.
Implementation of developed plans will be undertaken by the project authority (hardware) and mCN
(social aspects, training, information and education materials, exhibits). It is expected that a large part
of the residing families from the projected protected area or from the environs can be employed for
maintenance and eco-tourism activities; experiences elsewhere have shown that it may be expected
that the tourism part will be able to cover the costs within 2-3 years after opening. In case the situation
in Bangladesh results in less income than required, the Environment Enhancement Fund (1 % of the
toll proceeds) will supplement. For monitoring the effects on biodiversity, reproduction results and
migration success, both terrestrial and aquatic, again the services of IUCN will be acquired, being the
most appropriate independent organization in this field.

(277) The Visitor Centre could be built in Mawa on (part of) the construction yard area after
completion of the bridge project. There will be sufficient space for parking of visitors and for related
activities. From the Centre a ready connection to the main roads as well as to the Charland Reserve
(by boat) is secured. The Visitor Centre will provide additional employment (some 50 jobs) to local
people.

(278) Tickets will be sold for the boat trips. Experiences elsewhere have shown that sales of tickets,
souvenirs and consumptions will cover operation and maintenance and salaries after 2-3 years. Since
the budgets in Tables 8.4 and 8.5 are calculated for 5 years, a surplus might be created. This will be
used for further development of the Visitor Centre as well as the Char protected area. A cost
estimate for the Mawa Visitor Centre with exploitation during 5 years is given in Table 8.5.

(279) Most of the land acquired by the project was agricultural land; about 1,000 ha will be lost for
agricultural production of some 20,000 tons per year. Farmers are compensated for the loss of
farmland, but usually in money and not in farmland. It is expected that average farm sizes in the area
will decrease and that farmers will have to increase their productivity in order to generate the same
farm income as before.

(280) In the agricultural development plan mitigating measures are included to raise productivity,
mainly through stimulation of cropping on barren or fallow land (extent not given) and by increasing
cropping intensity (especially on the north bank) and diversification towards growing high-value
horticultural and agricultural crops, introduction of improved varieties and better marketing on the
remaining cropping area (less than 10% of the original area). Provisions have been made to recruit a
number of agricultural extension workers in close cooperation with the Department of Agriculture and
to supply inputs for demonstration plots on farmers land. Farmers will be trained how to increase their
farm incomes through the organization of farmers field schools and through demonstration plots.

(281) It is clear that the plan will not be able to compensate for all losses: the remaining area for
agriculture is very small and the proposed cropping systems are at best in an investigation stage.
Criteria for selection of farmers are not yet prepared. This means that a main part of the agricultural
development plan will consist of payment of compensation and assistance in finding alternative
sources of income for the still unknown number of farmer families that will not return to agriculture.
Funds for this will have to be found in the RAPs and the Income and Livelihood Restoration Plan,
since the Agricultural Development Plan only includes a budget for research, demonstration and
training, as well as for technical and financial support to the few farmers that may continue farming.

8.4.5 Community Environmental Management Plan
(282) Experience from previous projects showed that the lack of community involvement in the
management and operation of resettlement sites has resulted into defunct water supply systems,
clogged drains, scattered waste dumps, muddy roads and unhygienic sanitation. From consultations
with the community it was also concluded that the environmental awareness of the residents is



                                                   82
generally very low. For a proper functioning of common facilities involvement of both operator and
community are key elements for sustainable management.

(283) A Community Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) will be set up where both operator
and community will be involved in implementation and monitoring ofthe community infrastructure
(e.g. water supply and sanitation facilities, roads, drainage etc.). The objective of the CEMP is to
define the roles of stakeholders and make the communities understand the environmental impacts
associated with the establishment and maintenance of basic infrastructure facilities, and provide
guidance to them on how to coordinate with the operator for the effective operation and maintenance
of these facilities in a sustainable manner. A Community Environmental Management Committee
(CEMC) is proposed for each RS to supervise the implementation ofthe CEMP. The budget required
for implementation of CEMP is estimated at USD 306,000. The budget for implementation of CEMP
will be covered from monthly tariff collection from the community supplemented by toll collection on
the bridge (1 % deposit in Environmental Enhancement Fund).

8.4.6 Environmental Enhancement Fund
(284) This fund will be created in order to finance sustained environmental development and
protection of the project area during the O&M stage. The fund will be created by earmarking a 1%
contribution to the vehicle tolls of the Padma Bridge for development and management of the
environment at the project site, including the charland protected area and the charland visitor centre.


8.5       Monitoring and Monitoring Plan

(285)     The project monitoring programme has a dual purpose. It is designed:
     to monitor the contractor's work during project implementation in order to check contractual
      compliance with specified mitigation measures, and subsequently
     to assess the actual environmental impacts ofthe project over the years following completion of
      the various project components.

(286) The first type of monitoring will be implemented by the contractor and supervised by the M&E
consultants of CSC. The second type of monitoring will be commissioned to an independent external
agency (local organization/consultants) with sufficient experience in hydrological and ecological
monitoring. Monitoring will be continued for a period of 5 years after project completion. Result of
monitoring of impacts will have to be reviewed and evaluated from time to time by the M&E
consultants or by independent subject-matter specialists provided by the Co-financing agencies.
Findings might be used to revise the operational rules of the project.

(287) Commonly, environmental (and social) monitoring requires three prerequisites:
     Setting of baselines. Baselines (the pre-project situation) are required to be able to assess impacts
      in a quantitative manner. As far as the social impacts are concerned adequate baselines are set in
      the Social Assessment Report. In the Environmental Report adequate baselines are set for
      professional fisheries activities, whereas impressive species lists are produced. However, adequate
      monitoring baselines in terms of indicator organisms, critical habitats, biodiversity hotspots,
      special areas, etc., all for the various seasons, are not yet made. Since main environmental impacts
      are not expected before years two and three of the project, there is still time to complete baseline
      information during the first year (2010).
     Determination of parameters. Monitoring parameters will have to be indicative for the (potential)
      impacts expected and they will have to be measurable (quantifiable) and objectively verifiable. It
      is not sufficient to determine a few water quality parameters, unless they are representative for
      others, and it is not sufficient to determine biodiversity on the basis of field observations and
      literature data. Setting of suitable parameters is part of the baseline survey and will have to be
      carried out during 2010.
     Selection of actors. Setting of baselines and impact parameters will have to be carried out by a
      professional organization (e.g. IUCN) that knows how to recognize critical habitats, which


                                                     83
      indicators will have to be used for what impact category, and how to express this information in a
      measurable manner. The Environment Unit of the PIU ofBBA will not build up ecological
      capacity itself, but will be kept fully aware of the significance of results.

9.2       Project Implementation Unit

       (290) A project Implementation Unit (PIU) headed by a project director has been established by
       BBA to implement the PMBP. The PIU consists offour units: (i) Bridges and Roads, (ii) River
       Training Works, (iii) Resettlement, and (iv) Environment. The PIU will have the overall project
       coordination and management of the project. At present a programme of institutional strengthening
       is being developed and new staff is being recruited. The PIU is advised in its task by a Panel of
       Experts, appointed by BBA with national and international experts to provide guidance and periodic
       review of procedures and the work of the design consultants. The resettlement unit has established
       field offices in Mawa and Janjira and it operates a Monitoring and Evaluation section. The
       Environmental Unit (EU) is currently being strengthened to be fully operational during the
       construction of the PMBP.




                                                               87
9.3      Construction Supervision Consultant

      (291) PIU will employ a construction supervision consultant (CSC) for supervision of civil works,
      including supervision of implementation of portions of the EMP to be implemented by the
      Contractor responsible for the bridge and RTW. The CSC team will have an environmental unit
      with three international and five national environmental experts - including Occupational Health
      and Safety expert. Environmental specialists of CSC, in coordination with EU staff, will ensure the
      implementation of environmental management practices at each stage of the project activities. The
      CSC will also be responsible for updating EMP, if required.


9.4      Contractors

      (292) Each Contractor procured under the project (especially the contractors for main bridge and
      RTW) will be recommended to be a compliant of ISO 14001 Environmental Management System
      (EMS) certification. Further conditions of compliancy for OHSAH 18000 (2007) related
      Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and SA 8000 (Social Accountability) could also be imposed
      on the contractors. The Contractor staff shall include suitably qualified and experienced persons
      acceptably fluent in the English language, to function as Environmental Specialist and Occupational
      Health and Safety Specialist, who will be working in close liaison with the relevant staff of the the
      Engineer (CSC) and PIU. The Engineer shall assign duties and delegate authority to a suitably
      qualified and experienced assistant (an Environmental Specialist) to interact with the relevant
      Contractor staff. Based on the guidance provided in the EMMP, the contractors will prepare a
      Construction Environmental Action Plan (CEAP). This CEAP will be reviewed and approved by the
      CSC. It will also be supervised by the CSC for implementation.

9.5      Management Support (M&E) Consultants

      (288) To assist the Resettlement and Environmental Units ofPIU it is recommended to engage
      independent M&E consultants to undertake monitoring of RAP and non-RAP components and the
      EMP. A management support consultant will be hired by BBA. The Termso of Reference of these
      consultants will also include the requirement to M&E for the various components of the EMP-
      whether implemented through contractor or through other specialist NGOs. The MSC team will
      have be responsible for the collection of the baseline data followed by periodic monitoring and
      timely evaluation of the implementation of agreed measures.


9.6     Safeguard Department

      (289) BBA will eventually establish a Safeguard Department directly under the Executive Director
      of BBA next to the PIU in order to give due importance to environmental and social issues. Upon
      completion of the PMBP the environmental and resettlement staff now under the PIU will be
      integrated into the Safeguard Department. This department will then be charged with the
      management of environmental and resettlement aspects of all present and future projects
      implemented by BBA. The unit will consist of 3 senior resettlement specialists and 3 senior
      environmental specialists.


9.7      Implementation ofEMP

      (290) BBA will engage specialized NGOs and agencies to implement mitigation measures and
      safeguard plans developed under the EAP and the Social Action Plan. From previous experience it
      is now widely recognized that the task of successfully implementing resettlement programmes
      requires the typical experience, attitude and skills ofNGOs working at grassroots level. Most of the
      components of the SAP will therefore be implemented with the help of such organizations. This


                                                    88
       applies to RAP I, II and III, but also to the Public Health Action Plan, the Gender Action Plan and
       the Charland Monitoring and Management Plan.

       (291) Comparably, biodiversity protection and environmental quality monitoring included as part
       of the Environmental Management Plan needs specific expertise that can be found in international
       organizations like IUCN. Other elements of the EMP could be implemented by the contractor(s)
       under supervision of the CSC.

       (292) The establishment of a char protected area and the establishment and management of a
       Charland Visitors Centre could best be planned by international consultants, since this operation is
       the first of its kind in Bangladesh. Operation and management of the nature reserve and the visitor
       centre could be carried out by IUCN or a national NGO.


9.8       Using External Expertise/Advice for Environmental Management

       (293) Twinning Institutions: PIU will work together with some national organizations and training
       institutes like CEGIS, BUET, Atomic Energy Commission etc. which will act as 'twinning
       institutions'. These institutions will support the PIU through providing their laboratories for
       analyses and other technical facilities. These institutes will also assist in capacity building and
       development. For this purpose Memoranda of Understanding will be signed for cooperation and
       support with the twinning institutions.

       (294) Environment Management Committee: Since April 2009, the PIU has constituted an
       environment management committee. This committee includes experts from various national
       government and non-government organizations, universities, and research institutions. Their inputs
       are available to the PIU to tackle any pressing issues and also for regular monitoring as well as
       sorting out co-ordination issues between departments, and providing guidance on policy matters.

       (295) Panel of Experts: The BBA appointed panel of experts includes 6 international and 4
       national experts to provide guidance to BBA on issues specifically related to the project. The PoE
       includes an environmental expert. PoE's advice on the EA process has been prompt and helped
       improve the effective preparation. It is expected that this will continue during the implementation
       phase.


9.9       Establishment of Environmental Management System

       (296) BBA is committed to ensure that its operations will not create adverse environmental
       impacts. In this regard, the BBA will need to establish and effectively operate an appropriate
       Environmental Management System (EMS). A conceptual framework for establishing an EMS in
       BBA will be developed. It is intended to serve as a basis for discussion between the co financiers
       and the BBA to work out an appropriate EMS acceptable to both parties. The EMS framework is
       prepared based on an understanding of (i) the extent to which BBA can manage environmental
       aspects of its business; and (ii) environmental impacts of bridge operations and its associated
       facilities.


9.10     Establishment of GIS and MIS

       (297) PIU will establish and maintain a GIS/MIS system during the implementation of the project.
       PIU will hire the services of GIS and MIS specialists for development and maintenance of the
       GIS/MIS system.

Note:

1. Environmental Consultants for CSC has been included in the overall CSC budget and excluded from
the EMP budget (Table 8.7).
2. POE recommended to use only national consultants for capacity building and hence budget has been
reduced.

    10        PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS AND DISCLOSURE

    10.1      During project preparation and design
           (299) The process of public consultation and participation has been an integral part of all project
           preparations since 2003. During the pre-feasibility and feasibility study a series of 41 consultation
           sessions were organized in the area in the period between 2004 and 2006. During detailed design
           (2009-20 lOa total of 17 sessions were held. Some details on these sessions are presented in Table
           10-1. These consultations were held as proposed in the Public Consultation and Participation Plan
           with formal and informal meetings, village level workshops, focus group discussions and
           disclosures of project impacts to the affected households and communities. The views, needs and
           aspirations of the affected people as expressed during these consultations have been incorporated in
           the project design and the proposed mitigating measures with the objective to maximize benefits
           and minimize adverse social and environmental effects.

    10.2     Focus group discussions

         (300) There were different types of consultations. A very important role was played by the Focus
         group discussions, where discussions were held with affected groups of persons focussing on
         specific subjects.
    At the beginning of such meetings the anticipated impacts were disclosed and followed by discussions on
    possible solutions to prevent or mitigate such impacts. Major issues discussed in such meetings typically
    included: (i) land acquisition and possible alternatives; (ii) hydrology, drainage and river erosion; (iii)
    fisheries and wildlife; (iv) health hazards, (v) tree cutting and impacts on local ecosystems; (vi)
    community severance; (vii) employment/job opportunities and occupational changes; (viii) traffic
    congestion; (ix) cultural resources and infrastructure; (x) impacts on char lands; and (xi) relocation and

resettlement. Participants actively joined in discussions and contributed very useful suggestions and
ideas, which were recorded for follow up.
10.3    Public consultation meetings

       (301) Formal public consultations meetings were held at three locations involving about 350
       participants representing affected persons, union and upazilla leaders, NGOs, and national and local
       government representatives. The recommendations from the public consultations have been
       incorporated in the engineering design and the resettlement and compensation plan for the affected
       communities.


10.4      Expert consultations

       (302) Consultations with various groups of experts were held during the detailed design. The
       objective was to share information on the project and to obtain feedback on important social and
       environmental issues to be considered in the Social Assessment and Environmental Impact
       Assessment. Guidance and expert advice on the social and environmental studies was also received
       from the Panel of Experts appointed by BBA consisting often national and international experts
       charged with periodic review of procedures and progress of the PMBP.


10.5     Disclosure

       (303) After completion of the English version ofthe Environmental Impact and Social Assessment
       a Summary in BangIa is prepared and distributed to local authorities and relevant stakeholders. The
       Summary will also be published on the website of BBA. Advertisements in local newspapers will be
       published with invitations to the public for participation in two consultation meetings to be held in
       the project area in October 2010. More details on public consultation meetings are given in the
       Main EA Report.

 Scoping                           I
                           Conduct a process of Environmental Assessment that will consider in an integrated manner the potential environmental (including
                           health, and safety) risks and impacts of the project.
                      EA must take into account natural environment (air, water, and land); human health and safety; social aspects (involuntary resettlement,
                           indigenous peoples, physical cultural resources; trans~boundary and global environmental aspects
                      Under global aspects, EA should address impact of climate change on the project design, alternatives and operations.
                      Given the scale and complexity of the project, especially regarding the associated components (e.g. widening of national highway, rail
                           connectivity etc), EA should be applied at regional and strategic levels
                      Ensure that the project is designed and carried out in compliance with environmental laws and regulations of the country where the
                           operation is being implemented, including national obligations established under ratified Multilateral Environmental Agreements
                            \!\tfEAs).

 Sensitivities   I critical habitats
                      If a project is located within a legally protected area, implement additional programmes to promote and enhance the conservation aims of
                           the protected area
                      Proceed only if there are no technically and financially feasible alternatives, overall benefits from the project substantially outweigh the
                           environmental costs, and any conversion or degradation is appropriately mitigated
                      Use a precautionary approach to the use, development and management of renewable natural resources
                      Conserve physical cultural resources (PCR) and avoid their destruction or damage by using field based surveys with qualified and

 EMP            EMP consists of the set of mitigation, monitoring, and institutional measures to be taken during implementation and operation to
                  eliminate adverse environmental and social impacts,                       them, or reduce them to acceptable levels
                Preparation of Management Plan includes
                identification of responses to potentially adverse impacts;
                determining requirements for ensuring that those responses are made effectively and in a timely manner;
                describing the means for meeting those requirements
                EMP includes the following components
                Mitigation
                Monitoring
                Capacity development and training
                implementation Schedule and Cost Estimates
                EMP also provide for workers - safe and healthy working conditions, and prevent accidents, injury, and disease
                Establish preventive and emergency preparedness and response measures to avoid, minimize the adverse impacts and risks to the health
                  and safety of the local communities
                For Padma Project, EMP should be presented for pre-construction, construction and operational phases. It should include construction
                  safety and emergency preparedness plan to address gas leaks/explosion as well as spills due to accidents on the
                EMP should not just address mitigation measures but enhancement measures well e.g. green belt development plan, setting of a museum
                  etc.
                EMP should also address regional level planning and policy issues considering cumulative impacts of the associated components
                  (especially widening of national highway and rail connectivity) that are not in the scope of the present project.
                EMP should interface with management of social and economic issues e.g. development of Community Environmental Management Plan
                _{<::쬚Plior the resettlement sites and addressing loss of livelihood of fishermen and ferry boat owners.
                Free, prior and informed consultation with affected people and informed participation as early as possible and throughout the project
                 implementation. Disclosure in local language with understandable content during public consultation.
                Ensure community engagement free of external manipulation, interference, or coercion, and intimidation, and conducted on the basis of
                 timely, relevant, understandable and accessible information.
                Establish a grievance mechanism to receive and facilitate resolution of the affected communities' concerns and grievances about the
                 borrower's environmental performance.
             I  For Padma Pr()ject, stakeholder (expert) consultation, focus group discussion and two stage formal public consultations have adopted.
                For Padma Project, BBA should use inputs from Independent Panel of Experts (IPOE) and Environment and Social Safeguard Advisors

                          ENVIRONMENTAL CODE OF PRACTICES

Introduction

The objective of preparation of the Environmental Code of Practices (ECP) is to address less
significant environmental impacts and all general construction related impacts of the proposed project
implementation. The ECPs will provide guidelines for best operating practices and environmental
management guidelines to be followed by the contractors for sustainable management of all
environmental issues. This ECP will be annexed in the general conditions of all the contracts carried
out under the PMBP.

The list of ECPs prepared for the PMBP is given below:

ECP 1: Waste Management
ECP 2: Fuels and Hazardous Goods Management
ECP 3: Water Resources Management
ECP 4: Drainage Management
ECP 5: Soil Quality Management
ECP 6: Erosion and Sediment Control
ECP 7: Top Soil Management
ECP 8: Topography and Landscaping
ECP 9: Borrow Areas Development & Operation
ECP 10: Air Quality Management
ECP II: Noise and Vibration Management
ECP 12: Protection of Flora
ECP 13: Protection of Fauna
ECP 14: Protection of Fisheries
ECP 15: Road Transport and Road Traffic Management
ECP 16: River Transport management
ECP 17: Construction Camp Management
ECP 18: Cultural and Religious Issues
ECP 19: Workers Health and Safety

The Contractor can also prepare a 'Construction Environmental Action Plan' (CEAP) demonstrating
the manner in which the Contractor will comply with the requirements ofECPs and the mitigation
measures proposed in the EMMP of the EIA Report. The CEAP will form the part of the contract
documents and will be used as monitoring tool for compliance. Violation of the compliance
requirements will be treated as non-compliance leading to the corrections or otherwise imposing
penalty on the contractors.
