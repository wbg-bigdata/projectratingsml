1        INTRODUCTION

1.1     Project Location

The Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project (PMBP) is being undertaken to construct a road and railway
bridge over the River Padma, between Mawa (north side) and Janjira (south side) about 40 km south of
Dhaka. The main objective of the project is to establish a reliable and safe river crossing on the
highway from the capital towards the relatively isolated and under-developed Southwest Region of the
country, which is home to 30% of the entire population. The bridge will include a river crossing for a
future railway line to the Southwest. The project is situated in the active floodplain of the Padma River,
not far from the confluence of two of the longest rivers in the world the Brahmaputra (Jamuna) and the
Ganges, which, together with the Meghna River, form the largest delta in the world.

The three major rivers divide the country into four regions, the Northwest, North Central, East and the
Southwest. Dhaka, the capital, is located in the North Central region. So far five major bridges (Meghna
Bridge, Meghna-Gumti Bridge, Bhairab Bridge, Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge and Paksey Bridge) have
been built providing good connections between Dhaka and the Northwest, North and East regions. The
Southwest still depends on ferries, which are often unsafe and unreliable with long waiting times (up to
10 hours for trucks). The PMBP will replace the existing ferry connection between Mawa and Janjira
with a modern highway/railway river crossing, and end the relative isolation of the Southwest.

Bangladesh is divided into 6 administrative divisions, each divided into a number of districts. The
districts are subdivided into sub-districts (upazilas) consisting of several unions. A union consists of a
number of mouzas, which is the revenue administrative unit in the country..

The project covers parts of three districts in Dhaka division: Munshiganj, Madaripur and Shariatpur.
Together they have an estimated population of 4.2 million. These districts are predominantly rural with
an average urban population of only 11%. The project is spread over 31 mouzas belonging to 4 upazilas
namely: Lohajang and Srinagar (Munshiganj District), Janjira (Shariatpur District) and Shibchar
(Madaripur District).

Mawa on the mainland to the north is a small town with a high population density (4900 per km2). It
consists of more or less compact, mostly commercial settlements along the existing highway and linear,
fairly compact village settlements along the riverbank. The residential areas include many households
that were displaced by erosion, living on lands provided by relatives either on a rental basis or as "free-
users" ­ locally known as nodibashi or uthuli.

The villages affected on the mainland on the Janjira side are relatively new settlements developed on
chars (river islands formed by accretion) formed 70-80 years ago. The population density is much lower
than in Mawa with an average of 1319 per km2. The village settlements, locally called kandi, are mostly
linear along the riverbank and are typically named after the "pioneer" settler or influential matabbar
(village leader), which shows the kinship and/or patronage character of village settlements in the
floodplain. There are also village settlements and commercial establishments along the bank of the
south channel giving easy access to two ferry ghats, landing sites for ferries coming from Mawa.

In contrast to the north bank the area in Janjira is largely agricultural. The soils are of alluvial nature
and fertile. Every year during monsoon they are inundated with silt-loaded floodwater (2-5 m deep).
Farmers in the area grow two to three successive crops a year, mostly rice but also a large variety of
other crops such as spices, vegetables and jute.

The floodplain is generally flat and elevated 2-8 m above sea level. People living on the charlands in
the active floodplain, the islands and sandbars emerging though the process of siltation (accretion) do
not usually construct permanent houses and are ready to move to safer places in the event of major
floods or erosion.

1.2     Project background

The Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project (PMBP) is a priority project of the Government of Bangladesh
(GOB). The project is co-financed by GOB, the World Bank (WB), the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Islamic Development Bank (IDB).
                                                    1
The Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) is the executing agency. The bridge will establish a direct
connection between the Southwest and the North Central regions of the country. The bridge lies on the
Dhaka-Kolkata (India) route and will also be an integral part of the Asian Highway and Euro-Asian
railway network systems.

A prefeasibility study1 was carried out on the proposed bridge construction in 1999. This was followed
by a JICA-funded feasibility study2 in 2005 for project preparation. In 2006 the ADB commissioned
Project Preparatory Technical Assistance project preparation3. The JICA FS formed the basis for the
GOB decision to proceed with the detailed design4 and construction plan for the bridge, which is funded
under an ADB TA loan.

The detailed design of the project has undergone a number of changes since the feasibility study
including (i) a change in length of the bridge due to riverbank erosion on the Janjira side, (ii) additional
land acquisition to accommodate the railway approach viaducts and stations on both sides of the river,
(iii) the inclusion of a roundabout at the junction of the approach road with Highway N8 on the Janjira
side, and (iv) type and location of the river training works.

1.3     Past experience and expected issues

The BBA has completed a number of large bridge projects requiring land acquisition and involuntary
resettlement, including the Jamuna and Mukhtarpur bridge projects. They have gained experience in
compliance with the social safeguard policies of the international development financing institutions
from these projects. It should be mentioned that the resettlement in the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge
Project (JMBP)5 offers many "good practices", which include: (i) identification of all affected persons
and issuance of identity cards (ID); (ii) cut-off date established by census; (iii) preparation of automated
loss files of individual Entitled Persons (EP) and Entitlement Cards (EC); (iv) preparation of automated
payment statements; (v) compensation for losses irrespective of titles; (vi) provision of replacement
value of land and other assets; (vii) resettlement of affected households in GOB sponsored RS and host
areas; (viii) special provisions for assistance to poor women and vulnerable groups; (ix)
training/livelihood program for income and livelihood restoration; (x) project benefits for "host
villages" receiving affected households; (xi) development of computerized management information
systems for processing resettlement benefits, monitoring and evaluation; and (xii) involvement of
NGOs in the implementation of Revised Resettlement Action Plans. Since the completion of the JMBP
in 1998 these experiences have influenced the approach followed in many other projects in Bangladesh.
Also a draft national policy on involuntary resettlement6 was developed, which is currently awaiting
approval by the Government.

Major lessons have been learned from the experiences in JMBP as well. One is that income and
livelihood restoration measures for affected persons, which were limited to skills training and supply of
micro-credit, are not effective in the long term. Provision of bank credit without collateral for land
purchase proved to be impossible during JMBP, since banks did not respond due to uncertainty of loan
recovery.

  The Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Project was the First Project in Bangladesh where resettlement of
project affected persons was considered an integral component of the project. Resettlement action plan
(RAP) for resettlement and rehabilitation of the affected persons was revised substantially in 1993 by
an expert team commissioned by the World Bank..
6
  The Policy was drafted under ADB TA 4517-BAN: Development of a National Policy on Involuntary
Resettlement in Bangladesh. The Ministry of Land (MOL) was the Executing Agency of the TA. MOL is
in the process of finalizing the policy for submission to the Cabinet.

Gender issues were not particularly addressed in the JMBP. However, it proved that women could play
a major role in increasing participation of affected women, giving access to project benefits, reducing
social vulnerability, and providing opportunities to improve skills and employment.

Public health in JMBP was also not considered a concern. A major lesson learned was that an increased
risk of occupational hazards and health problems occurs during construction due to the presence of a
large workforce at site. The population of the project area has voiced its concerns for potential adverse
project impacts on health in the area, particularly in respect to noise and dust pollution, reproductive
health, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, and traffic accidents.

Lessons learned and good practices have been used to prepare a set of principles for the design and
implementation of a safeguard policy for payment of compensation and resettlement benefits for the
affected persons. BBA as executing agency of the PMBP has approved this and is fully committed to
implementing the following principles and guidelines:

 Replacement value of affected land, structure, trees considering the current market price with all
 implications for time and land titling costs.

 Income and livelihood restoration measures designed for a 10-year period following the
 implementation of the resettlement plan.

 The income and livelihood restoration program should consider the needs, personal capacities and
 skills, existing practices, gender, market demand, future potentials and availability of resources of
 affected persons.

 Preparation of resettlement plans for the different phases of the project, giving priority to
 development of resettlement sites, so that they will be ready before relocation of households affected
 by other components of the project.

 A gender action plan focusing on gender-balanced project implementation and sharing of benefits.

 A public health action plan to address public health impacts under the project and benefit all
 stakeholders during construction.

 An institutional framework for an independent Safeguard Division within BBA with separate
 environmental and resettlement units.

1.4     Resettlement Planning Process

The project preparation has witnessed a continuous process of planning as part of the project design to
identify and address social impacts under the project. Planning activities include socioeconomic
surveys, impact census and inventory surveys, poverty and gender assessment, assessment of local
public health institutions and service delivery etc. They were carried out at different times of the project
preparation and updated along the engineering design progress. The planning followed a participatory
process through information sharing and continuous consultation with local communities over impact
identification, compensation and resettlement policies, options for relocation and resettlement, approach
for livelihood development as well as their views and recommendations for the project. The studies
applied a participatory approach, placing the community in the centre, and involving a collective
process of reflection, discussion, and consultation with the different groups. All key stakeholders were
consulted individually, in homogenous subgroups or in mixed groups to understand the local needs,
priorities and demands concerning the proposed project. This program is broadly endorsed and
supported by local communities.



The following methods were used to collect data:

 Field visits by field investigators to all villages/communities affected by the project, to ascertain the
 socio-economic profile of the area.


                                                     3
 Focus group discussions (FGDs) at village level with different potentially affected groups of people,
 more importantly, women, fishermen, cobblers and other socio-economically deprived people to
 ascertain the impact of the project on them

 Meetings with the Upazila Nirbahi Officer, upazila representatives, health workers, school teachers
 and others were held during the course of field visits with emphasis on project impact and benefits,
 poverty, road safety, impact on vulnerable people, and other related issues.

 A poverty assessment was carried out through separate FGDs with groups of poor men and women
 and well-off men and women, to ascertain the particular project impacts on each of these groups.

 A socio-economic survey was undertaken as part of ADB PPTA Household Survey, 2006.

 A gender study was carried out to analyze the current status and needs of women and the potential
 impact of the project on them. Separate discussions were held to capture womens collective
 perceptions on social, economic and cultural norms and their ability to access facilities. Some
 specific exercises such as decision making analysis were also done.

 A detailed analysis of secondary data sources was carried out to understand the social, economic and
 demographic situation in the project area.

2          PROJECT DESCRIPTION

2.1        Development objective

The main development objective of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project is to provide direct
connections between the Central and Southwest regions of the country through a fixed river crossing
over the Padma River between Mawa and Janjira. The GOB considers the project to be a national
priority project stimulating both national and regional socio-economic development. The bridge
together with the completion of National Highway N87 will contribute significantly towards facilitating
social, economic and industrial development in the relatively underdeveloped Southwest region with a
population of over 30 million. A railway river crossing is included in the project as a first step towards
completing a railway connection between Dhaka and the Southwest. The bridge will further facilitate
utility river crossings including utilities like a gas transmission pipeline, a power transmission line and
an optic fiber cable.

The bridge lies on the route to Kolkata (India) and will form an integral part of the Asian Highway
network system. It is also expected to become an important highway for trade and transportation of
goods between Bangladesh and India. The projects area of influence is thus much larger and includes
the entire highway and railway corridor from Tamabil (land port to India) via Dhaka to Banapole (land
port to India) serving about 29% of all Bangladesh.

2.2        Project components

The bridge is designed to be an approximately 6.15 km long fixed-crossing double-deck steel bridge
with provisions for a four-lane divided motorway, a rail line, gas pipeline, optic fiber cable and power
transmission lines on the bridge. The project components include (see also Figure 2.1):

 A 6.15 km long two-level steel truss main bridge (4-lane divided highway on top and single track rail
 on lower deck)

 Bridge end facilities: 27 ha on the Mawa side and 117 ha on the Janjira side, including toll plazas and
 service areas on both sides of the river for emergency services, construction management etc, and
 tourism in the post-construction period, particularly on the Janjira side.

 Transition structures including road and railway viaducts from the bridge to the approach roads. The
 road viaduct in Mawa is 1 km long, and about 900 m at Janjira. The rail viaduct is 3 km in Mawa and
 4 km in Janjira with new railway stations at both ends.

 The approach road to the bridge consists of a 12.4 km 4-lane divided highway with 6 bridges (30 ­
 270 m) over local waterways, 9 local road underpasses and 14 drainage culverts.

 Access roads totaling about 8.9 km and 14.5 km of service roads.

 Four resettlement sites (two at Mawa and two at Janjira side) for the relocation of households and
 business enterprises to be resettled, including the required support infrastructure and services, such as
 schools, mosques, clinics, markets, utilities etc.

 River training works, including 2 km of river bank protection on the north bank near Mawa and a
 12.5 km bank protection on the Janjira site along the south channel.

3. SOCIO-ECONOMIC SITUATION

3.1     Previous studies

The socio-economic situation in the project area was assessed in a number of studies starting in 1999
(prefeasibility study). The main objective of the social studies was to identify the distinctive
characteristics of the project population with respect to their socio-economic profile, specifically taking
into consideration information such as literacy level, employment pattern, means of income generation,
health conditions, poverty incidence etc. The studies also looked into how the proposed project could
augment benefits for local population as well as minimize or mitigate potential adverse project impacts.

The process of data collection included a census and extensive socio-economic surveys in the sample
villages in the project areas. The studies were conducted as part of the ADB PPTA feasibility study in
2006 and covered a variety of households belonging to different socio-economic groups. A total of 10
villages and habitations in the project area were covered for extensive household surveys. Altogether
400 sample households were interviewed.


                                                    6
During the course of the study, the team used multiple methods like discussions with village leaders,
schoolteachers, shopkeepers, health workers, Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) exercises, Focus
Group Discussions (FGD) and individual field surveys. A wide range of data was collected, including
demography, social stratification, religion, education, occupation, and income and expenditure patterns.

3.2     Socio-economy

3.2.1   Population and demography

The three districts of the project are predominantly rural with an average urban population of 11%. The
average household size in the district is estimated at 5.1 members on average. Single person households
account for a mere 0.55 %. During the last decades the urban population in the districts of Shariatpur
and Madaripur has increased drastically by respectively 66% and 65% respectively, which is almost
double the national rate of 37%. The urban population of Munshiganj district on the north side of the
bridge has increased by 35%, which is more in line with the national rate. An estimated 30% of the
households in Mawa and Janjira live under the absolute poverty line as per the 2006 data, which is only
marginally lower than the average of the district at 32%.

Large parts of the districts are rural with 60 to 75% of land used for agriculture. About 60% of the
residents in the three districts own agricultural land. Only 19% of the land is irrigated. Poverty
incidence on the Janjira side is almost double than that on the Mawa side. An estimated 7.5% of all
households in Mawa live under the hard core poverty line against 12% on Janjira side.

3.2.2   Economy and employment

Income on the Mawa side is mainly generated through retail trade, services at the ferry ghat, industries
like brick kilns, transport, production of firewood etc. Mawa has a fish market, but not much land
available for livestock holding, poultry or kitchen gardening. The south side of the river has a strong
agricultural character and most people earn their living by growing a wide variety of agricultural and
horticultural crops. Farms are small and usually consist of several plots totaling no more than 1 acre.
Cropping intensity on the south side is high (210%).

Possession of entertainment and life-easing home appliances is an indicator of the quality of life and the
economic status of people in Bangladesh. According to the socio-economic survey about 61% of the
population in the project area sleeps in good quality beds, 35% of the households possess steel almirahs
and about 12% have a TV. People on Mawa site enjoy higher standards than those on Janjira site.

3.2.3   Education

According to BIDS Census Survey (July/August 2009) 31.3% of the female population in the project
area is illiterate compared to 23.5% of males. Government incentives in recent years on female
education increased enrolment of girls. The RAP study among the affected households in 2005/06
showed that girls' enrolment (52%) was higher than that of boys (48%). In Mawa relatively more girls
attend school while on Janjira side more boys attend schools (Table 3.1).

The gap in education among male and female is more or less close at primary and secondary school
level, but it still persists at higher secondary and tertiary level. At all secondary levels girls drop-out
rates are higher than boys. Gender inequalities in all areas continue, and are usually greater among the
poor.
                                                    7
3.2.4   Health services

Health services in the project area are poor. Most people have to travel long distances to reach medical
care in emergencies situations (Shibchar (30 min), Madaripur (2 hrs), or Dhaka (4 hrs). Since men are
more mobile, they have better access to health care. Char inhabitants have to travel by boat to either
Kathalbari to buy medicine or to Mawa to visit a health facility. In Mawa town about 85% have access
to a health facility and 80% visit a physician. In Janjira about 70% seek assistance from a facility or a
physician and 60% go to health services provided by NGOs. Most other people in the project area go to
quacks and medicine shops for minor medical treatment.

Immunization percentages for infants have improved. Maternal deaths still account for 20% of all
causes of death among women in reproductive age. An analysis by the World Bank (2008) concluded
that the key determinant of women utilizing reproductive health services was not so much physical
access, as education level, exposure to media and household income. This was confirmed during focus
group discussions. Certainly the latter two variables are areas this project could aim to address for the
project-affected people.

3.2.5   Water supply and sanitation

According to the national population census 2001, tubewells are the major source of drinking water
being used by about 87% of the population. However, only 37% of the population used sanitary latrines
in 2001. About 55% of the households in Munshiganj district have electricity, against 32% in
Madaripur and only 14% in Shariatpur district.

There is a high concentration of religious education in Madaripur and Shariatpur districts mostly
attracting students from very poor families. There are colleges for higher secondary and graduation
level education in the project districts. There are also schools and colleges specifically for girls. General
education is supplemented by mass education centers.

3.3     Position and role of women

3.3.1   Gender analysis

During the course of the project preparation a detailed gender analysis was undertaken to study the
position of women in the project area and the potential impact of the project on them. The surveys
concluded that the gender role and relations between men and women are largely comparable with
Bangladesh society at large. Few gender differences were noted between the two sides of the river.
Despite Mawas greater proximity to services and to Dhaka, men were noted to be much more mobile
than women in both areas. Women on the Janjira side lead a village based existence with mobility
restricted to visiting relatives or medical facilities in times of emergency. Husbands or sons do the
buying and selling at markets on behalf of the village women. Many women in Mawa have husbands or
sons living and working in Dhaka. As a result, women around Mawa predominantly live in rented
houses or leased land much closer to each other. Women on Janjira side enjoy more space mostly on
their own land.

3.3.2   Economic participation of women

Women are traditionally involved in home-based reproductive and unpaid domestic production work.
Participation of women in agriculture is mostly in the form of rice husking and processing of crops at
household level. Women have access to NGO-based micro-credit, but often they borrow money for
investments made by their sons, husbands or fathers. Very few women have been able to invest directly
in commercial operations like small shops, cattle raising, beef fattening, etc. In Mawa women and girls
are often involved in sewing designs for garments, resale of fabric, home-based tailoring, or as cooks in
local restaurants or migrant workers messes. Poor widows and divorcees normally work as domestic
help in local households.

3.3.3   Women's rights and empowerment

The status of women in the villages of the impact area is similar to that in the traditional Bangladesh
society constrained by cultural and religious bindings. Women generally have no leadership in the

                                                     8
village or in their families. The general outlook of the women in the area is male driven and they do not
dare speak out on their own. Poor women have little control over family resources unless the household
is female-headed or has access to micro-credit. The gap between men and women is clearly visible with
respect to health care, food intake, financial position, education, ownership of property and
participation in decision-making.

Gradually, women are obtaining access to small business concerns such as poultry, duck farming,
grocery, storing of seasonal goods, etc. Women are increasingly attaining access to ownership of land,
business, and they are struggling to establish their rights and ensuring their role in family lives and
community as well.

3.3.4   Women's mobility patterns

Womens mobility is limited to shopping, wage earning work, small business, attending school/college,
visiting clinic and hospital for treatment, and occasionally to relatives' homes. They are mostly confined
within their home and do not move far other than for registration of deeds and undergoing major
medical treatment. Women in poor households go out to earn their two square meals and maintain their
families8.

3.4     Charlands

3.4.1   Charlands within the project area

There are several chars within the projects area of influence. The largest is Char Janajat, which lies
between 2-15 km upstream from the bridge, along the south bank stretching from the confluence of the
Arial Khan with Padma River and Janjira. It is a complex of charlands developed over the last 20 years,
and attached to the mainland in recent years. Char Janajat is moderately populated with numerous small
villages locally called kandi. An estimated 43% of the area is used for agriculture the rest consists of
grass and reed lands and open water. Another major complex of chars (Char Teutia-
Louhajong/Korhati) lies 1 km downstream of the bridge stretching from Mawa along the north bank
with little or no settlement. The other chars are often small, usually not vegetated nor inhabited. The
charlands within the project boundary cover 47 mouzas belonging to 16 unions in 4 upazilas of 4
districts. The mouzas cover chars, open water and parts of the mainland. According to the 2001 Census,
about 93,000 people live on the chars upstream and almost 66,000 people on the chars downstream of
the bridge.

3.4.2 Socio-economic characteristics

Charlands emerge from the river as a result of accretion through sedimentation of silt and sand and they
may disappear as a result of erosion. The chars in the study area undergo erosion due to the heavy flow
of the river along the southwest side. Almost eight times more land was eroded along the bank lines
than was accreted in the River Padma between 1984 and 1993. In the project area, there has been
erosion on both banks, although the erosion rate was less. Nonetheless, if they have been silted up
above the normal flood level some chars become stable and are occupied for cultivation and settlement.
The charland communities live without or with only limited modern civic amenities like a good road
network, health centers, cyclone shelter, schools, electricity supply or other social institutions.9

The main occupation of charland dwellers is agriculture with relatively much livestock husbandry. Most
of the charland is double cropped, producing rice and winter crops including pulses, wheat, and
vegetables. Almost all households have cattle. However, the island and attached chars appear to be less
productive than the adjacent mainland areas. The major reasons for this are the less favorable soil
conditions and the uncertainties due to erosion and frequent floods. The perennial availability of river
water provides many of the char communities year-round opportunities for fishing.10 Current livelihood
sources of the char people include agriculture (80%), fishery (10%), trading (5%) and services (5%).

Job opportunities in the charland are much more limited than on the mainland. A sizable proportion of
char people migrate to the mainland seeking wage employment.

The charlands are characterized by the near absence of roads and other infrastructure. Most transport is
by boat. There are a few earthen roads, usually not connected to the mainland roads. There is very little
or no electricity. Rural markets or trading hubs are lacking. There are a few government primary
schools. After the completion of primary schooling, students have to move to the mainland for higher
education. Hospitals or health centers are absent.

Each year a large percentage of the charlands is inundated during floods. In a normal year floods have
little impact. But the high floods of1998, 2004, and 2007 inundated most of the chars by 1.5 m of water
and people became homeless and had to evacuate to safer places. Most charland dwellers have been
subjected to previous evacuations due to erosion or damage by high floods. People on the chars are
socially and economically very vulnerable.

3.4.3   Legal ownership of charlands

The ownership of the land between the riverbanks is determined by the Alluvion-Diluvian Land Law11.
Charlands are alluvion land when they are sufficiently emerged above the normal water level in the
river. There is a complex joint-ownership divided between government and original owners. The land
becomes diluvian, when it is eroded and disappears under water. In this event the owner is exempted
from paying any further revenues and the submerged area becomes property of the government. If after
re-emergence within 30 years of erosion the diluvian area becomes alluvion again, the previous owner
enjoys priority in getting the land back. The revenue exemption receipt has to be submitted as a proof.

3.4.4   Social dynamics and migration pattern

Landownership is constantly changing because of erosion and accretion. Just as the areas of the chars
are dynamic, so is the human population on them. Migration may be permanent or temporary. People
move permanently when their homesteads are eroded to accommodate themselves on newly accreted
land, or to find work in other areas. Temporary movements are made to take advantage of seasonal
economic opportunities, which may be outside the chars (out-migration to work in urban areas, for
example), or within when people use land that is only available in the dry season (in-migration).

Permanent out- or in-migration appears to be closely associated with past patterns of erosion and
accretion. Out-migration was limited along the bank lines which are subject to bank erosion. In-
migration was widespread in the new island chars and is presumed to be a response to the changing
chars. Seasonal in and out-migration is very common among char dwellers. Seasonal migration often
only involves some male household members leaving the others behind. Naturally at that time women
take care of the family in all respects.

Many households that have been displaced by bank erosion elsewhere have taken shelter on char
Janajat and char Teutia-Louhajong. Many of them are forced to find employment outside the area and
many have found temporary or permanent work in the urban centers in the greater Dhaka area, which is
relatively nearby.

no. 15/1994-13th July, 1994.

4            OVERVIEW OF LEGISLATION AND POLICIES

4.1          Relevant GOB legislation on land acquisition

 The Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance 1982 (Ordinance II of
 1982)

This Ordinance is the basic instrument governing land acquisition in Bangladesh. It is restricted to legal
owners of property as supported by records of ownership such as deeds, title or agreements,
compensating for land as well as any business, structure, trees and crops on the land. Owners of
acquired land receive cash compensation at market value with a 50% premium above the assessed price.
The law specifies methods for the calculation of the market value of property based on recorded prices
obtained from relevant government departments, such as the Registrar (land), the Public Works
Department (structures), the Divisional Forest Offices (for trees), the Department of Agricultural
Extension (for crops yield), the Department of Agricultural Marketing (for crop prices) and the
Department of Fisheries (for fish stock).

The Ministry of Land deals with land acquisition and has delegated some of its authority to the
Commissioner at Divisional level and to the Deputy Commissioner at District level. The Deputy
Commissioners (DCs) have authority over land acquisition and payment of compensation to legal
landowners (up to a maximum of 50 standard bighas or 16.7 acre)12.

The DC determines (i) a market value of acquired assets on the date of notice of acquisition (based on
the registered value of similar property bought and/or sold in the area over the preceding 12 months),
and (ii) 50% premium on the assessed value (other than crops) due to compulsory acquisition. The 1994
amendment provides for payment of crop compensation to tenant cultivators.

 The East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1951

The East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act 1951 (Section 7) defines the ownership and right of
use of alluvion (payosti) and diluvian land (sikosti) in the country. This law is relevant to the project for
the acquisition of lands within the bank line of the river for river training work (RTW). Legally, the
GOB owns the bank line and eroded land (submerged) in the river. However, the original owner(s) may
claim the land if it reemerges in a natural process within 30 years from the date of erosion.

 The Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project (Land Acquisition) Act 2009

The Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project (Land Acquisition) Act 2009 has been promulgated to refuse
any fraudulent claim for compensation of land or structures. Video filming the right-of-way is a
provision of the law to ensure compensation for genuine losses only. The law also ensures the projects
priority and indemnifies all its activities and actions beyond any question in court. The law entrusts the
DCs with the task of verification on the basis of evidence (including video images) to recognize or not
recognize any claim for compensation.

 Inadequacies of GOB legislation regarding land acquisition and resettlement

Current legislation has several inadequacies. First, 1982 Ordinance II does not cover persons without
title or ownership record affected by the project, such as informal settler/squatters, occupiers, and
informal tenants and leaseholders without land registration documents. Moreover the law does not
ensure a realistic replacement market value of property acquired as it is based on registered price which
is lower than the actual market price (it is well known that people in Bangladesh undervalue land during
transactions to pay lower registration fees. The result is that compensation for land paid by the DC,
including premium still remains lower than the real market price or replacement value. The act does not
have provisions for resettlement of affected households/businesses or any assistance for restoration of
livelihoods of affected persons. As a result, land acquisition potentially diminishes the productive base
of farm families and those affected and displaced by development projects.

     For larger areas the DC has to get litigation of Divisional level
                                                                   11
The National Constitution of Bangladesh mentions the fundamental rights and general guidelines for a
policy on resettlement/rehabilitation of citizens adversely affected due to any activity of the State.
Article 40 of the constitution states categorically that every citizen has the right to practice any lawful
occupation, which implies that anything that impedes such right (a) should not be done or (b) should
take supplementary measures to make good the losses incurred by the citizen. Resettlement and
rehabilitation of adversely affected people due to infrastructure projects clearly fall within this
requirement for supplementary measures. However, according to Article 42, no law with provision for
compensation for acquisition of land can be challenged in a court on the grounds that such
compensation has been inadequate.

4.2      Co-financier Safeguard Policies

4.2.1    World Bank Operational Policies

The World Bank has several operational policies13 that require social screening, impact assessment, and
public consultation and participation to ensure that projects in which it invests are implemented in a
socially responsible manner. However, OP 4.11 on Indigenous People does not apply, since there are no
indigenous groups or people as defined by the policy in the project area. But OP 4.12 on Involuntary
Resettlement is clearly triggered, since PMBP involves a major land acquisition and resettlement
operation. According to these policies, the social impacts of project interventions have to be assessed
and the persons affected by the project (PAPs), host communities, and NGOs have to be consulted on
issues relating to land acquisition and displacement of persons. PAPs also must be given the
opportunity to participate in planning, implementation, and monitoring of the resettlement programme,
especially in the process of developing and implementing procedures for determining the eligibility for
compensation and development assistance, and for establishing appropriate and accessible grievance
mechanisms. Particular attention has to be paid to the needs of vulnerable groups among those
displaced, especially those below the poverty line, the landless, the elderly, women and children, or
other displaced persons who may not be protected through national land compensation legislation.

OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement

Operational Policy 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement14 deals with the Banks approach to mitigation of
economic, social and environmental risks associated with involuntary resettlement due to projects
where a Bank investment is sought or applied. In summary the policy requires that:

 Involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible, or minimized, exploring all viable
 alternative project designs.

 If resettlement cannot be avoided, measures should be conceived and implemented to enable the
 displaced persons to share in project benefits.

 Affected persons should be meaningfully consulted and should be given opportunities to participate
 in planning and implementing resettlement programmes.

 Affected persons should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and standards of
 living or at least to restore them to pre-project levels or to levels prior to the beginning of project
 implementation.

4.2.2    The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Safeguard Policies

The safeguard policy of the ADB (2009) also stresses social screening, social and poverty impact
assessment and mitigation of adverse social impacts including resettlement, public health, gender and
ethnic minorities for formulation and execution of development projects compliant to social safeguards.
The social safeguards policy statements 2009 include SPS-2 on Involuntary Resettlement and SPS-3 on
Indigenous Peoples. For PMBP only SPS-2 applies.

SPS-2 on Involuntary Resettlement

SPS-2 on involuntary resettlement requires that involuntary resettlement is avoided or minimized
wherever possible by exploring all project and design alternatives, that the livelihoods of all displaced
persons are enhanced or at least restored in real terms relative to pre-project levels, and that standards of
living of displaced poor and other vulnerable groups are improved.

The involuntary resettlement safeguards cover physical displacement (relocation, loss of residential
land, or loss of shelter) and economic displacement (loss of land, assets, access to assets, income
sources, or means of livelihoods) as a result of (i) involuntary acquisition of land, or (ii) involuntary
restrictions on land use or access to legally designated parks and protected areas. It covers them
whether such losses and involuntary restrictions are full or partial, permanent or temporary.

Specific principles of SPS 2 are presented in Table 4.1:

Issue                            SPS 2- Safeguard policy for involuntary resettlement

Resettlement screening and Social and involuntary resettlement impact and risks will be assessed
social assessment          from the earliest phase of project cycle.

Consultation               and Affected persons and their community will be consulted and their
participation                  concerns and suggestions will be considered in the project design. A
                               grievance mechanism will be established to receive and facilitate
                               resolution of the affected persons concerns.

Livelihood restoration           Livelihoods of the displaced persons will be restored by adopting all
                                 viable alternative options including replacement of assets with equal or
                                 higher value or the replacement cost and additional revenues and
                                 services through benefit sharing schemes where possible. Special
                                 attention will be given to the poor, women, and vulnerable groups.

Assisted relocation              All relocation of displaced persons will be at project cost including
                                 subsistence for the transitional period and access to similar social and
                                 economic opportunities. Compensation and other resettlement
                                 entitlements will be provided before physical or economic
                                 displacement.

Land title                       Displaced persons without titles to land or any recognizable legal rights
                                 to land are eligible for resettlement assistance and compensation for
                                 loss of non-land assets.

Resettlement plan                A resettlement plan will be prepared elaborating on displaced persons
                                 entitlements, the income and livelihood restoration strategy,
                                 institutional arrangements, monitoring and reporting framework,
                                 budget, and time-bound implementation schedule.

Disclosure                       Disclosure of a draft resettlement plan, including documentation of the
                                 consultation process in a timely manner, before project appraisal, in an
                                 accessible place and in a form and language(s) understandable to
                                 affected persons and other stakeholders. Disclosure of the final
                                 resettlement plan and its updates to affected persons and other
                                 stakeholders. Monitoring reports should also be disclosed.

Monitoring and evaluation        Resettlement outcomes, their impacts on the standards of living of
                                 displaced persons and achievement of objectives of resettlement plans
                                 have to be monitored and assessed against baseline conditions.

4.2.3   Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)

                                                     13
JICA introduced new guidelines for environmental and social considerations on 1 April 2010,
consolidating the different guidelines used by former JBIC and JICA into a single set. The guidelines
are based on the following principles:

     A wide range of social impacts should be addressed.
     Measures for social consideration should be applied from an early stage until the monitoring stage.
     Accountability and transparency should be ensured during the entire process.
     Stakeholders opinions should play a prominent role in the decision-making process.
     Information should be disclosed in consultation with the project proponent.
     The capacity of organizations involved in environmental and social operations should be enhanced.
     Prompt implementation.

The PMBP is classified Category A, as large-scale involuntary resettlement is involved. Resettlement
Action Plans (RAPs) should be submitted as well as impact assessments for social and environmental
impacts of the project. Impacts to be assessed and examined, termed social considerations, include
impacts on human health and safety as well as involuntary resettlement. Environmental and Social
assessment reports and RAPs should be published on the websites 120 days prior to final environmental
and social review and board considerations.

4.2.4     Islamic Development Bank IDB

The social guidelines of the IDB are under preparation and yet to be published. IDB supports the
harmonized social safeguard policies applicable to the project.

4.3       Harmonization of Co-Financiers' policies

4.3.1     Gap analysis

The international development financing institutions, co-financing the project, have their own safeguard
policies to minimize displacement and require time-bound action plans with measures to restore or
improve livelihood and income of those affected by development projects. Since the 1982 Ordinance
falls short of a number of safeguard requirements, the project has developed a land acquisition and
resettlement policy that complies with the harmonized safeguard requirements of the co-financiers. The
harmonization was carried out through a gap analysis involving the 1982 Ordinance II and the co-
financiers safeguard policies15 as well as identification of gap-filling measures. The harmonization has
also benefited from the good practices in resettlement of affected persons in Jamuna Multipurpose
Bridge Project. The harmonized policy forms the basis for the preparation of Resettlement Action Plans
(RAP) for various project components.

4.4       Resettlement policy framework

4.4.1     Resettlement policy and principles

The resettlement policy framework for the PMBP has been designed to (a) cover all affected
persons/households irrespective of titles to land, (b) compensate for lost assets, and (c) restore or
enhance the livelihoods of all categories of affected persons. Those affected by the project will not only
receive cash compensation for land and other assets at full replacement cost as per market price at the
time of dispossession, but additional measures has been undertaken to ensure minimum disruption of
their lives and livelihoods during project construction. Households to be displaced physically and
affected economically will receive due compensation, relocation assistance and allowances in
accordance with the following policy and guidelines, which are also part of the projects Resettlement
Framework.16

 Affected persons will receive replacement value of land and other assets before relocation. Likewise,
 loss of standing crops and trees will be compensated at market price.

 Owners of residential/commercial units will be compensated at replacement costs.
 Renters/leaseholders affected by loss of living quarters or commercial premises will receive
 compensation and resettlement benefits due to loss of income or dislocation.

 Affected community structures or physical cultural resources will be rebuilt or replaced at market
 prices under project supervision.

 Affected people will receive assistance to re-establish lost assets or livelihood.

 The needs of women and vulnerable groups will be identified and provisions made for social and
 economic development support, employment, and means of subsistence to improve their
 status/livelihoods.

 Resettlement sites will be developed by the project with civic amenities to resettle affected people,
 particularly those losing homesteads and business structures in the proximity of their original
 villages.

 BBA/resettlement implementing NGO will assist PAPs and business-owners/operators ­ both
 directly and indirectly affected ­ in all aspects. The EA (through resettlement unit) will involve all
 stakeholders in the decision-making process concerning relocation and resettlement.

 BBA will guide, supervise, and monitor land acquisition, compensation payment, and resettlement of
 the PAPs, including grievance redress and resolution of disputed claims for
 compensation/resettlement benefits.

 Grievance Redress Committees (GRCs) will be formed to ensure participation, and speedy out-of-
 court settlement of as many disputes as possible.

 Independent third party monitoring by an external monitoring agency contracted to monitor
 resettlement operations and outcomes evaluation.

All affected households and persons will be eligible for compensation and resettlement assistance from
the project. The policy framework for the PMBP has been designed to ensure that those affected are not
disadvantaged, receive full support during the resettlement processes and can regain their lost income
and livelihoods.

4.4.2   Eligibility criteria

Eligibility for compensation and resettlement assistance will be limited by a cut-off date (COD). The
COD for compensation under law (Ordinance II of 1982 with amendments) for those identified on
project right-of-way land proposed for acquisition is considered to be the time of service of notice under
Section 3 or joint verification by Deputy Commissioners (DCs), whichever is earlier (legal COD). The
affected households and title holders have already received notice under section 3 from the concerned
DCs on 16 March 2008 in Munshiganj, 7 January 2008 in Madaripur and 23 January 2008 in Shariatpur
district.

The Census survey carried out by BIDS and satellite images taken by CEGIS will be considered as the
cut off date from BBAs side. Census survey to be conducted in the RTW areas after finalization of the
RTW design, or similar date as designated by BBA will be regarded as the COD for compensation
eligibility. Any non-titled persons such as nodibashi or uthuli or other informal settlers living in the
acquired/affected area will be identified as per BIDS census. Any persons moving into the project area
after the cut-off dates will not be entitled to compensation from DC or any assistance from BBA.
However, any PAPs not covered in the enumerations before the CODs can be enlisted with sufficient
proof established by IVC.

BBA made video films of the right-of-way land, structures and trees during the survey conducted by
JMBA in 2006 to control fraudulent claims at the implementation stage. This will be further updated
                                                    15
and cross-verified by satellite images of the project area provided by CEGIS17. Meanwhile, the GOB
has already taken legal measures to refuse compensation for fake structures erected on project right-of-
way with the aim to claim compensation18.

4.4.3   Valuation of assets

The Deputy Commissioner (DC) follows the rules laid down in the 1982 Ordinance to determine
market prices for assets like land, structures trees and crops, with assistance from other relevant
departments such as Public Works Department (PWD) for structures, Divisional Forest Office for trees,
and Departments of Agricultural Extension for yields and Department of Agriculture Marketing for
crop prices. The assessed value is typically lower than the replacement costs. To ensure that the project-
affected persons can replace the lost property, replacement value will be provided as determined by an
independent agency and recommended by the Property Valuation Advisory Committee (PVAC)
constituted by BBA with representatives from BBA, concerned DC office, upazila, and PWD. PVAC
has already been approved by GOB and gazetted on 25 October 2009.

The detailed design team will give PVAC all technical support to assess and recommend the
replacement value of acquired properties to the Bridge Division, MOC for approval. BBA will pay the
difference between the replacement value and the DC payments under the 1982 Ordinance II.
Furthermore, PAPs will be allowed to take back materials salvaged from their dismantled houses and
shops without cost, despite compensation paid by the DCs. A notice will be issued by BBA/DC Office
that PAPs may take away such materials.

4.5     Lessons learnt in JMBP

4.5.1   Institutional capacity and weaknesses

Resettlement in the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Project (JMBP) was conceived as a separate project.
A Resettlement Unit (RU) headed by a project director with headquarters at Dhaka was responsible for
planning, implementation and monitoring all resettlement activities under the revised RAP. Two field
offices on either side of the river were set up to carry out resettlement implementation at field level. The
RU was assisted by a management consultant with one expatriate and three local long-term resettlement
specialists and some short-term assistance.

The Deputy Commissioners on behalf of the GOB acquired land for the project. To ease off
replacement land transaction two special land registration cells were set up. A special subordinate judge
was appointed in each affected district to resolve legal disputes on land. In addition, there were legally
constituted Grievance Redress Committees (GRCs) to settle disputes outside the purview of the law.

An NGO was hired for the implementation of the revised Resettlement Action Plan engaging about 150
staff through five field offices. The NGO computerized all land acquisition and resettlement data and
developed automated information processing systems and instruments that supported the RU in their
task of entitlement delivery. After withdrawal of the NGO in December 2000 the RU continued
payment of entitlements up to 2003. The implementation of the revised RAP was widely viewed as a
successful set-up. Nonetheless, a number of limitations were identified:

 Involuntary resettlement was a new concept. Although the entitlement delivery mechanism and
 relocation and resettlement of the PAPs were efficient, the utilization of compensation money and
 resettlement benefit and credit support were not always effective due to lack of follow up
 programmes by the NGO involved for income restoration.

 Lack of updated landownership records delayed payment of CCL and the resettlement exercises
 thereby.

 The RU suffered shortage of manpower since only 29 staff were deployed out of 69 planned.

 The special courts established by GOB were not effective.

4.5.2   Strengths of policy application

The strengths of the applied policy in JMBP were:

 The intent of the revised RAP was to facilitate "land for land" by providing additional grants to cover
 replacement cost of land and refund of stamp duty for registration. PAPs have been able to replace
 105% of their homestead lost the project and 55% of their agricultural land.

 The replacement price of land and its enhancement after considering the price increase within three
 years was effective to resettle the affected persons.

 The cash assistance for dismantling, transfer and reconstruction of structures and salvageable
 materials given back free of cost was effective to vacate the land timely.

 The refusal of compensation for structures built with ulterior motives was a just policy that did not
 affect the actual structure losers.19

 Information dissemination and consultation with affected persons ensured peoples participation and
 transparency and helped the resettlement implementation in a positive way.

 The provision of house plots in the developed RS for persons without titles to their previous
 homestead, proved to be effective

4.5.3   Limitations of the policy application

Limitations of the resettlement policy were:

 Bank loans facilitating timely purchase of replacement land could not be continued after only a few
 disbursements due to inconvenient modality for banks.

 Payment of additional grand was tied with land purchase. As a result, not all the people who lost land
 were able to buy replacement land and avail additional grants for replacement land purchase and
 reimbursement of stamp duty.

 Female-headed households of EFAP were supposed to receive house plots in resettlement sites, but
 that did not occur.

 Households receiving construction grants could not be entertained with house plots in resettlement
 sites, even if they applied because the persons who received construction grant proved that he had
 already settled in a place of his choice.

 Not all wage losers in the households were entitled to one time cash grant; only one member per
 family was entertained.

 Fifteen decimal plots as an alternative to training people with less than 15 decimals of land was not
 entertained.

 Surplus land after construction was not leased out to affected persons.

 Institutional assistance to support affected persons purchasing replacement land did not work.



19
  The land acquisition in Bangladesh has traditionally been associated with some degree of fraudulent claims. The
generous compensation policy for JMBP led to loopholes for any subsequent acquisition after disclosure of the
policy. A huge number of structures were erected in proposed acquisition sites to defraud the government. With
the intervention of the media, policy attention was given to the issue and a new law was promulgated with stricter
cut-off dates for eligible claims (SRO 218 of December 18, 1995). The law delegated powers to the district
authority to exercise their discretion for preventing fraudulent claims.
                                                       17
 Due to lack of employment opportunities nearby the west resettlement site, the plots were not
 attractive to the settlers. On the other hand, the plots were lucrative to rich people, interested to settle
 near the bridge, who offered high price to the PAPs. The PAPs have been able to purchase about 1
 acre of agricultural land in the remote areas of Sirajgonj, selling his 2.5 decimal plot in the RS site.

 Income and livelihood restoration for the vulnerable affected persons could not be achieved.
 However, their housing and economic position enhanced substantially as they got back their house
 structure free of cost in addition to the compensation and replacement value they received for their
 lost land which was 5-15 times higher than cash compensation under law.

 Affected persons who left the area before the start of revised RAP implementation could not be
 notified adequately due to lack of resources.

4.5.4   Best practices

The JMBP resettlement programme established many ,,best practices as examples in resettlement
management. These include (i) a socio-economic survey by an NGO and an effective social impact
assessment; (ii) information campaigns and public consultations; (iii) minimizing resettlement effects
during project implementation; (iv) entitlement policy covering all categories of PAPs; (v)
comprehensive resettlement plan; (vi) special attention to women and other vulnerable groups; (vii)
civic amenities in relocated sites; (viii) strong and innovative resettlement organization in collaboration
with NGOs; (ix) computerized LA&R data management, use automated tools for payment processing
and effective supervision and monitoring by using a computerized Management Information System
(MIS) and Focus Group meetings of the PAPs; (x) market surveys in the project area to determine
market price of land twice during the implementation period to ensure replacement value; and (xi)
attention to mitigation of post-construction impacts.

4.5.5   Lessons learned

The practical experience in JMBP resettlement provided some vital lessons in developing future
resettlement plans as well as policy revisions for the government and the international development
financing institutions; including:

 The back-dated land administration and clumsy land recording system delays payment of
 compensation and sometimes present landowners cannot be fully compensated.

 Piece-meal acquisition tempted PAPs to abuse the policy and some benefited more than once.

 People losing negligible amounts of land (1 or 2 decimals or a fraction of it) created the problem of
 having to deal with unnecessarily large numbers of people with nominal entitlements. Many people
 did not appear to receive their too small entitlements.

 An award book for payment of compensation was a vital instrument for implementation of the
 resettlement action plan. However, it was difficult and time consuming to obtain an authenticated
 copy of the award book.

 Resettlement plots were often too small to accommodate relocated families. Large families with
 more than one married son faced difficulties in accommodating them.

 In a land scarce country like Bangladesh, many people could not buy replacement land and were
 eventually deprived of the assistance for replacement price of land.

 Erection of fake structures and compensation refusal required tremendous attention and input from
 the executing agency. The cutoff date for recognizing physical assets should be practical, so that no-
 one can defraud government.

 Host community incentives encouraged pulling in affected persons instead of not accepting them.

 Advance       information     to    the    affected        persons   could   prevent    many     problems.

5       PARTICIPATORY APPROACH AND CONSULTATIONS

5.1     Public consultations and participation
Consultation and participation has been a major principle in the planning and preparation of the detailed
design of the PMBP. Experience indicates that involuntary resettlement generally gives rise to severe
problems for the affected population making them apprehensive towards the project. These problems
can be reduced if people are properly informed and consulted during project planning and
implementation and are allowed to make meaningful choices. Consultation is hence a two-way process
where the executing agency, policy makers, beneficiaries and affected persons discuss and share their
concerns in a project process.

The process of public consultation and participation in the PMBP was first initiated in 2000 and has
since been an integral part of all studies and assessments. During the design and preparation of the
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs I, II and III) the affected people and communities have been strongly
encouraged to participate in project planning and design. Communities were consulted during public
consultation meetings, which were organized at various stages. The objectives of all these consultations
was to inform the communities and population about the positive and negative impacts of the project
and to incorporate their views, suggestions and inputs to minimize the adverse effects as far as possible
and to optimize the benefits of the resettlement operation within the limits of the harmonized safeguard
policies of GOB and co-financiers.

5.2     Consultations undertaken during project preparation
The BBA conducted a number of consultation meetings during the preparation of the LAP, the RAP
and the EMP in late 2005 and early 2006 including 3 workshops in three districts, 4 Focus Group
Discussions (FGD), 3 Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) consultations and 3 Social Communication
meetings. Prior to that, the JICA study team conducted 3 PRA consultations and 5 FGDs in the project
affected areas of Munshiganj, Shariatpur and Madaripur districts in 2004.
In 2006 during ADBs PPTA study 12 consultation meetings were conducted (7 in the project affected
area and 5 FGDs on the upstream charland). In addition 8 information and communication meetings
were organized as part of the poverty and social assessment in selected villages within the project
affected area and one in Char Janajat.
The consultation processes were further stepped up during the detailed design through formal and
informal meetings, village level workshops, and disclosures of project impacts to the affected
households and communities. All concerns raised in the past studies were addressed in the detailed
design stage in terms of enhanced mitigation measures and benefits.
In July 2009, BBA conducted 3 open meetings on resettlement site issues in Munshiganj, Shariatpur
and Madaripur areas. In addition, the detail design environmental team conducted a total of 10 FGDs -
one for each of the 5 resettlement sites, 2 service areas, 2 construction yards and one in the upstream
charland - on the likely impacts of the bridge.
A summary of the consultations undertaken in the different stages of Project Preparation is given in
Table 5.1.

5.3      Feedback from consultations
During the consultation meetings and FGDs the expected impacts were disclosed to the affected people.
Major issues in the discussion typically included: (i) land acquisition and possible alternatives; (ii)
hydrology, drainage and river erosion; (iii) fisheries, wildlife; (iv) health hazards; (v) tree cutting and
impacts on local ecosystems; (vi) community severance; (vii) employment opportunities and
occupational changes; (viii) traffic congestion; (ix) cultural resources and infrastructures; (x) impacts on
char lands; and (xi) relocation and resettlement. Participants joined in active discussions and
recommended their solutions to the problems. The recommendations were duly recorded in the minutes
of the meeting for follow-up.
Some of the key recommendations from these consultations are:
         All possible alternatives should be examined to minimize land acquisition for the bridge,
         approach roads and river training works.
         Compensation for all losses ­ land, structure, trees - should be at market rate.
         Resettlement sites should have all basic civic amenities.
         New cultural resources and infrastructures should be established in consultation with local
         people.
         Underpasses should be constructed in case of community severance due to the approach road.
         Project impacts on chars should be considered carefully.
         Bridge construction impacts on the flood regime, drainage, erosion, water and fisheries ­
         particularly hilsa migration should be considered with utmost care and attention.
         Sufficient tube wells with sufficient depth should be installed for the supply of arsenic-free
         drinking water.
         Local health facilities should be further developed to control water-borne diseases.
Where possible these views and suggestions have been incorporated into the design.
5.4      Feedback from women
One of the major benefits of the project expressed by women would be in terms of enhanced mobility.
The bridge construction would definitely augment the frequency and quality of transport; thereby
improving womens access to social services and income opportunities. Women share many positive
impacts of the bridge but gender discrimination regarding access to benefits may occur. Some village
women were anxious about having to move to a new location. Older women particularly were upset and
worried about the changes the project would cause to their lives, while younger women were more
accepting and pragmatic.

Coping with the construction disruption will be especially challenging. Local women will see increased
numbers of non-locals concentrated in the construction yards, river terminals and bridge sites, Most of
the women shared the idea that the influx of project labour would be a good income generation
opportunity: selling garden produce to labourers at a roadside stall. However, local womens movement
would be restricted during the construction period.

5.5      Community perceived benefits and impacts
During the consultations the following impacts were identified by the directly and indirectly affected
communities and groups:
Positive impacts of the bridge on the communities would be:
         Creation of new employment and business opportunities would enhance income.
         River crossing would be easier, safer and speedier.



                                                     22
          Multimodal transport facilities will be effectively in operation.
          Improved connectivity will improve access to healthcare and recreational facilities.
          Womens mobility will increase and as a result family income would be enhanced.
          Increased value of residual land.
          Protection against bank erosion.
          Opportunities for improved marketing and development of tourism.
In addition the affected households were also of the opinion that the project would contribute to
improving their living environment in the resettlement sites, since civic amenities and social
infrastructure would be made available to them. Notably, poor and highly vulnerable households, who
have never had a secured tenure, would for the first time have titled land (housing plots), economic
stability and improved quality of life at the resettlement sites.
The impacts arising from land acquisition and displacement (both physical and economic) were
perceived as major negative impacts of the project. According to most recent studies and estimates 21, a
total of 13,500 households will be affected by the project which includes 8,526 households losing land,
4,975 losing structures and 2,882 individuals indirectly being affected by wage loss or other losses.

6.1        Measures to minimize social impacts

All necessary efforts have been made to minimize project impacts on assets and avoid disruption of
livelihoods. To minimize impacts to the maximum possible extent, provisions have been incorporated
into the planning and design of the project to minimize or mitigate any unavoidable impacts. The key
efforts undertaken to minimize impacts are:

 Extensive consultations with the affected communities and people in the project areas to take in their
 views and incorporate them in the project design, as far as possible.

 The technical and social team have worked together to reduce the social project impacts by both
 design adaptation and innovative technical solutions. The realignment of the corridors has led to
 avoiding impacts on a total of seven villages on the Janjira side, which would otherwise be displaced
 by the project.

 Furthermore, the design of the proposed railway line has been realigned on the Mawa side,
 substantially reducing adverse impacts on structures (homesteads).

 The total acquisition for additional service area has also been reduced from 95 ha to 66 ha by design
 adaptations.

6.2        Project Impacts
The most important adverse social impact of PMBP is the land acquisition and housing demolition that
affects the livelihoods of about 13,500 households. . Resettlement impacts of the main bridge, bridge
end facilities, approach roads, resettlement site development, and river training works are summarized
below. The total land required for the various project components following the detailed design
is 1185.3 ha.
Table 2.1 below details the component-wise breakup of the land requirement.

Besides land acquisition, a total of 81.0 ha land is estimated to be requisitioned for a 5-year period for
construction yards. Once the project construction is completed, this land shall be returned to the owners

About 13,500 households (HH) will be affected by the project. This includes 8,526 HH losing part of
their agricultural land, 4,975 HH losing structures (housing and/or commercial) and 2,882 persons
whose income will be affected from wages and businesses (vendors, shopkeepers, boat operators,
beggars, and porters)23 due to closure of ferries in Mawa and Janjira. All in all, it is anticipated that
73,330 persons will be affected by the project in Munshiganj, Shariatpur and Madaripur districts, see
Table 2.2 below.

6.3     Impacts of resettlement site development
The development of the resettlement sites was given priority to ensure relocation of affected households
prior to the start of civil works. The feasibility design had provisions for 5 resettlement sites; 69 ha of
land have already been acquired. The lands to be acquired belong to 475 landowners comprising 2,581
persons, 31 households (196 persons) who would require relocation. An estimated 98 wage earners
(employees or wage labourers) will temporarily lose their income. Table 6.1 shows the households,
businesses, common property resources and other establishments to be relocated.

The surveys indicate that the employment patterns in the project area are varied and household incomes
diversified. Agricultural income generally represents a small proportion of total household income.
Hence, the impacts of land acquisition on income are expected to be limited. About 20% of the
households will lose more than 10% of their income due to land acquisition.


6.4     Impacts of main bridge and approach roads
About 255ha of land will be affected in Munshiganj, Shariatpur and Madaripur districts as a result of
the main bridge, toll plazas, service areas and approach road components. The majority of land
affected is on Janjira side amounting to 82% of the total land to be acquired. An additional 124.5 ha of
land will be acquired to accommodate rail viaduct and railway approaches on both banks.
The impacts of the main bridge and approach roads (toll plaza, service area and approach roads) have
been assessed on the basis of the most recent census survey undertaken by BIDS in July-August 2009
for all type of structural losses; the agriculture land impacts have been estimated based on the LAP
prepared by BBA in 2006 and the sample survey in 2006 by ADB PPTA (except areas for transition
structures - additional land for rail viaduct and railway approaches). According to these surveys, 7,614
households would be affected. The adverse impacts largely include loss of land (residential and
commercial); loss of structures (residential, commercial and PCR) income and livelihood (owners,
wage earners). In addition, the construction of these components would also entail some indirect
impacts such as loss of access to land by tenants and informal occupants; loss of access to residential
and commercial structures and loss of employment and workdays (Table 6.2).

About 6,070 households will be affected by the acquisition of agricultural land for the main bridge and
approach roads in the three districts. About half of the affected households will be in Shariatpur district
and a just over one third in Madaripur district. As the existing highway will be developed into an
approach road only entailing strip acquisition on both sides, the impact on agricultural land would be
limited in Munshiganj with only 17% of the households incurring impact on agricultural land in this
district. Some of the households losing agricultural land in the main bridge and approach roads will
also be affected by RTW.
The analysis of the impact ratio on affected households investigated during the ADB PPTA survey in
2006 shows that 22% of the affected households will lose more than 10% of their income as a result of
the land acquisition thereby making them vulnerable. Amongst these severely affected households, the
majority (55 %) would lose 10- 20% of their total income as a result of the acquisition whereas 11%
would lose more than 50% of their total income. Amongst the remaining vulnerable households, 12%
comprise disabled households, followed by 6% female-headed households and 5% hardcore poor
households.
Apart from agricultural land, a total of 1542 households would lose structures as a result of the
construction of main bridge, approach roads, toll plaza and service area. The affected households have
to be relocated. Of this group 56% comprise titleholders. The relocation of households would lead to
the displacement of 7,874 persons necessitating measures for their appropriate relocation and
resettlement.
In addition to private structures requiring relocation, 12 physical cultural resources (PCR) would also
require relocation, being 4 mosques, 3 clubs and 5 other PCR that will be in the projects right-of-way
(ROW).
A total of 1007 wage earners will be indirectly affected due to impact on commercial enterprises and
agricultural land. Most of those on the Janjira side are unskilled farm labourers, whereas on the Mawa
side the majority is non-farm skilled labourer.
6.5       Impacts of river training works
According to the detailed design, a total of 509 ha of land will be affected as a result of the construction
of the RTW on both banks of the river. The majority of land affected lies on the Janjira side amounting
to 83% of the total acquired land, whereas the remaining lies on the Mawa side. About half of the land
is submerged eroded land which is mostly khas (government-owned) land.
In absence of the final RTW design,24 the project impacts have been estimated on the basis of data
retrieved and processed from the ADB PPTA 4652-BAN Study 2006 database for all type of structural

24
  There was some uncertainty in the design of the RTW on hydro-morphological grounds, the impact on the
upstream and downstream charlands and erosion of bank line, especially in the Janjira site.

losses; the agriculture land impacts have been estimated based in the LAP prepared by BBA in 2006.
These surveys brought forth that a total of 7,197 households comprising of 31,437 persons would be
affected.
The adverse impacts of this component mainly include loss of residential and commercial land; loss of
structures (residential, commercial and PCR), loss of income and livelihood (owners, wage earners).
Construction of the RTWs also entails some indirect impacts such as loss of access to land by tenants
and informal occupants; loss of access to residential and commercial structures and loss of employment
and workdays. Table 6.3 on next page summarizes the impacts on the affected population. In addition to
private structures, a total of 63 PCR including mosques, educational institutions, social institutions,
would be affected as a result of the RTW.
About 2,018 households will be affected by the acquisition of agricultural land for the RTW. About
49% of the affected households live in Munshiganj district and a little more than one third in Shariatpur
district. Madaripur accounts for only 17% of the households to be affected. It is worth noting that the
land for the RTW work will be taken along the bank line where agricultural land is less productive and
about 50% of the land will be submerged eroded land as 50% of the revetment structure will be
constructed on the slope of the bank or submerged land.

The analysis of the impact ratio on affected households brought forth that 23% of the affected
households will lose more than 10% of their income as a result of the land acquisition. Amongst these
severely affected households, the majority (11.8 %) will lose 10- 20% of their total income whereas 2.1
% would lose more than 50% of their total income.
Apart from agricultural land, a total of 3,465 structures would also incur severe impacts due to the
RTW construction. The survey data revealed that all these structures would incur impacts on their main
structure leading to displacement of 3,402 households and necessitating their relocation. Of these, 42%
of the displaced households comprise titleholders whereas the remaining are non-titleholders (renters,
occupiers, sheltered, etc.).
In addition to private structures requiring relocation, a total of 63 PCR would also be affected including
mosques, and educational and social institutions.
Apart from the households incurring direct impacts on structures and land, 1,777 wage earners will also
be indirectly affected due to impacts on commercial enterprises and agricultural land. Most wage
earners would be affected in Madaripur (851), followed by 509 in Munshiganj, mostly unskilled and

  Household size among the affected households is 5.47 on an average. This has been used to calculate PAPs with
affected agricultural land owners.


                                                      28
skilled non-farm workers. In Madaripur, 419 wage earners would be affected the majority being farm
labourers.
A little less than one-fourth (21.5 %) of the total affected households were identified as socially and
economically vulnerable groups. From the 1559 vulnerable affected households, 29% will lose more
than 10% of their agriculture land thereby making them vulnerable. Amongst the remaining vulnerable
households, 39% comprise disabled households, followed by 18% female-headed household and 14%
hardcore poor households. The studies and surveys recorded no indigenous groups in the project area.


6.6     Potential impacts on charlands

6.6.1   Impacts from flooding and bank erosion

Extensive flooding of cultivable land is normal on the island chars. Each year a large percentage of the
charlands are inundated. In a normal year the floods would have little impact. However during high
floods these chars are inundated with 1.5 m or more water, requiring evacuation of people to higher
grounds. Currently some charlands are experiencing some heavy erosion. In particular Char Janajat is
subject to heavy erosion on the unprotected north side, which according to local people caused land to
be eroded away over a strip of about 2 km in the last two years. Elsewhere in the project area, there has
also been some erosion of both banks, but the rate was much lower. Earlier studies of the Padma River
have shown that between 1984 and 1993 almost eight times more land was eroded than accreted. Bank
erosion is thus a common phenomenon even without project.

The project designers have learned from the lessons from Jamuna Bridge Project where charland
erosion impact was a big issue. Instead of narrowing the river course with the bridge, the Padma bridge
design follows the natural banks. A hydrological study was conducted as part of the design and it
indicates that the project construction with the current design would have no erosion impacts on the
communities on the charlands.



6.6.3   Need for a Charland Monitoring and Management Framework

 However, there exist a strong perception amongst the communities that the construction of bridge
would aggravate erosion and floods in the area. In view of the community apprehensions, the project
has developed a framework to monitor for any induced erosion impacts under the project and establish a
process to plan and implement any mitigation measures if they are required.

In line with the above the framework has two objectives; one is monitoring of any unanticipated impact
and the other is mitigation planning if impacts are confirmed by assessment during project
implementation. Broadly the framework will guide the identification and mitigation of losses of the
charland people both upstream and downstream and involve the charland communities as beneficiaries
of the project. The framework is a guiding document which will be used to develop the mitigation
measures and action plan.

7       RESETTLEMENT AND LIVELIHOOD RESTORATION
7.1     Mitigation of resettlement and livelihood impacts
A Social Action Plan (SAP) has been prepared to mitigate the social impacts of involuntary relocation
and resettlement of affected people. The SAP consists of a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) that
provides an overall policy and guidelines for preparing plans for resettlement, and three Resettlement
Action Plans (RAPs): a special RAP for the development of resettlement sites and two RAPs to mitigate
the impacts of resettlement for the two main components of the project: (i) the main bridge, approach
roads and bridge end facilities, and (ii) the river training works. A special Income and Livelihood
Restoration Program (ILRP) has been prepared for vulnerable groups and households losing more than
20% of their income. The RPF, RAPs and the ILRP are summarized in the following sections.
7.2     Resettlement Policy Framework
7.2.1   Background and objectives
The RPF is the primary policy document that provides the basis for preparing RAPs for various
components of the project in a phased manner. It sets out the policy and procedures to be adopted by the
BBA for preparation of RAPs and revision during project implementation. The RPF ensures that BBA
will formulate and implement the RAPs in compliance with national laws and the policy principles and
matrix derived from harmonized safeguard policies and guidelines of the co-financiers.
The RPF gives special attention to developments during the construction and post-construction period
and outlines the objectives, policy, principles and procedures for acquisition and requisition of land and
involuntary resettlement, payment of compensation and resettlement benefits and other assistance, and
procedures for preparation of additional safeguard for issues identified during project implementation.
7.2.2   Policy principles
 The RPF ensures that lack of legal documents for customary rights of occupancy/titles to land shall not
affect eligibility for compensation of losses other than land. It stipulates payments of compensation of
the assessed value of land and structures to the project affected persons (PAPs). In addition to
compensation paid by the Deputy Commissioner (DC), PAPs will receive additional assistance in cash
or kind to match replacement costs, which is the difference between the cash compensation under law
and the assessed value for lost assets (land, houses and trees), transaction costs such as
stamps/registration costs (in case of purchase of replacement land) and other cash grants and
resettlement assistance such as shifting and reconstruction grant, resettlement benefit for loss of
workdays/income due to dislocation. Socio-economically vulnerable households namely female-headed
households without adult males, households below poverty line, households headed by disabled and
elderly people will be given additional cash assistance for relocation. A large number of PAPs have
indicated to prefer resettlement in neighbouring areas, the so called "host areas", e.g. with friends or
relatives. Measures to improve the infrastructure of these host areas ­ for example, additional class
rooms in the existing educational institutions, new access roads, improved water supply and sanitation ­
to enhance the carrying capacity will be undertaken so that project benefits are enjoyed by both the host
and resettled families, and so that host-resettlers are integrated socially and economically.
7.2.3   Disclosure, consultation and participation
Concerns raised during previous studies and detailed design have been addressed in terms of enhanced
mitigation measures and benefits. Updated RAPs will be implemented in close consultation with the
stakeholders and will involve disclosure, focus group discussions (FGDs) and meetings, particularly
with the affected households. In addition, a resettlement information brochure containing information
on compensation and resettlement benefits will be made available in Bangla and distributed among the
PAPs and explained adequately. Project design, impact and policies for mitigation of adverse social and
environmental impacts will be disclosed to the people in the area, particularly the affected persons and
host communities. All PAPs will be provided with information regarding all their entitlements. The
RPF will be made available in Bangla during public meetings at community level. A summary of RAPs
will be translated into Bangla and will also be disclosed among the PAPs and made available at the
upazila office and union parishad (local council). The RPF and the RAPs will be published on BBA



                                                   30
and co-financiers websites. Consultations will continue throughout the project implementation period.
Each RAP will also be informed about a detailed procedure for community complaints and grievance
redress.
  7.2.4       Income and livelihood restoration
The project recognizes diminishing income and dislocation of livelihoods during and after relocation.
As a result, in addition to providing compensation and resettlement benefits, appropriate supporting
measures have been included for income and livelihood restoration. Affected persons will be given
preference for employment in civil works construction, and in office and management work whenever
possible. BBA will make provisions in the contractors contract for employment of PAPs with ID cards
or their dependents/women on a priority basis. The RAP-implementing NGO will prepare lists of
female workers available to work on site and hand them to the local contractors. The
supervision/management consultants will monitor this through monthly statements of labour employed
from affected categories.
BBA will establish a Social Development Fund (SDF) to support income-generating activities,
particularly targeting the poor and vulnerable groups, including poor female-headed households. All
RAPs will have provisions for income and livelihood restoration for implementation over a 10-year
period from the date of displacement. SDF will support the ILRP, which will include human resource
development and occupational skill development training and subsequent credit support for suitable
businesses. Existing skills, resources and markets will be included in the ILRP. Besides the charland
management and development plans, the GAP will also focus on income and livelihood issues,
including provisions for training, credit and marketing support for income-generating activities and
enhanced organizational and leadership/advocacy among poor women for sustainable social
development.
Furthermore, the RAPs will have provisions to provide assistance to restore and supplement affected
businesses with subsistence for loss of income during transitional period.
7.2.5        Implementation arrangements
The RAPs and the ILRP will be implemented using the services of experienced and capable NGOs. A
safeguard division has been proposed within PMU in BBA and the capacity of the Resettlement Unit
(RU) of the safeguard division is being enhanced through recruitment of additional staff/consultants.
Budgets for implementation of RAPs and ILRP will be included in the project cost and all land
acquisition and resettlement costs will be borne by the GOB.
7.3          RAP-I for resettlement site development
Project resettlement planning included a rigorous process to identify resettlement sites. Five sites have
been selected among the identified site options in consultation with and with direct participation of the
affected communities (RS I has now been excluded from the project scope due to reduced length of the
RTW in Mawa Side. Thus 4 sites are being developed). Development of these sites requires land
acquisition and house demolition. A planning process was completed to address these impacts. A RAP
has been developed covering the 4 sites.. Of the four sites, two are on Mawa side (RS II ­ Jasaldia; RS
III ­ Kumarbhog), and two on Janjira side (RS IV ­ Paschim Naodoba, and RS V ­ Bakhorkandi).
RAP-I has been prepared to (i) address and mitigate the impacts of RS development; (ii) comply with
the safeguard requirements of the co-financiers for loan processing; and (c) be able to pay compensation
to the households affected by RS development in order to meet the project development schedule.
The affected households requiring relocation from the RS will have multiple options to choose between
temporary relocation and on site development before they resettle permanently including:
      (i)     Monthly rental allowances in case of rented accommodation (homestead losers).
      (ii)    Cash allowance to lease land for temporary shifting until the Resettlement Site development
              is complete.
      (iii) Provision to stay on site during staged development along with on-site moving and
            reconstruction grants.



                                                     31
In all cases, costs for temporary relocation and house reconstruction grants will be available. Once site
development is complete, the affected households will be allocated plots in the RS with assistance or
grant for relocation and reconstruction. All households affected by RS development are eligible for
house plots in the respective sites with payment of money equivalent to compensation under law. The
affected households will receive all payments for loss of land, structures, trees, and standing crops prior
to site development. Additionally, they will receive cash assistance to move and reconstruct on site as
required during the development of the site and services.
Recognizing that RS development will have construction-related impacts on the affected households,
the following measures have been planned to facilitate the staged relocation:
      (i)     Provisions have been included in the tender documents that require the contractor to allow the
              affected households to remain temporarily at the residences/homesteads on the RS under
              staged relocation arrangements while civil works are being executed.
      (ii)    The contractor is required by the tender documents to take all reasonable steps to ensure
              access, safety, security, acceptable living environment for the affected resident households at
              the sites.
      (iii) In preparing the work plan, the contractor will be required to set out specific measures in line
            with the above, and BBA will review the work plan for its adequacy.
      (iv)    BBA will monitor construction activities and the above measures through the BBA field
              office and the resettlement implementing NGOs. They will interact with the affected
              households to ensure that any concerns they have during the staged development will be
              addressed.
      (v)     A site specific Community Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) has been prepared to
              address the environmental aspects in RS development.
      (vi)    Affected households requiring temporary relocation from the RS will be paid a disturbance
              allowance.
RAP-I covers relocation, resettlement and livelihood restoration of 30 homestead-losing households
(including one with a shop), 436 agricultural land-losing households26, and 98 temporary wage losers in
the four resettlement sites.

7.4          RAP-II for main bridge and approach road
7.4.1        Coverage
RAP-II has been prepared to address and mitigate the impacts of a) 6.15-km long double-deck steel
truss bridge (4-lane divided carriageway on the top and a single track rail on the lower deck) with two
toll plazas and service areas; b) 12-km long 4-lane approach road on the Janjira side with service area
near the landing point for construction management and tourism in the post-construction phase; c) 7-km
of rail line (3-km in Mawa and 4-km in Janjira) and two railway stations; d) access roads of 8.86-km
and service roads of 14.5-km and e) a roundabout connecting the bridge to N8.
7.4.2        Objective
The primary objective of RAP-II is to identify impacts and to plan measures to mitigate/compensate
these impacts. RAP-II is based on the general findings of the census survey by BIDS during July-
August 2009 (except in additional land, for which a land acquisition proposal has been prepared), field
visits, meetings and consultation with various project affected persons in the project area. The RAP
presents (i) type and extent of loss of assets, including land and structures; (ii) principles and legal
framework applicable for mitigation of these losses; (iii) the entitlement matrix; (iv) resettlement and
rehabilitation budget and (v) institutional framework for implementation of the plan including
monitoring and evaluation.


26
  According to the data available with the RAP implementing NGO on RAP-I implementation, total number of
awardees in four resettlement sites is 649.


                                                       32
7.4.3   Eligibility for compensation and assistance
All affected persons will be entitled to compensation and resettlement assistance based on the severity
of impacts and ownership status.27 Lack of legal documents for customary rights of occupancy/titles
shall not affect eligibility for resettlement assistance. In addition to compensation paid by the concerned
DC, PAPs will receive additional assistance in cash or kind to match replacement costs, which is the
difference between the market value established by the DC and the assessed replacement value for lost
assets (land, structures, trees and crops), transaction costs such as stamp duty and registration costs and
other cash grants and resettlement assistance such as transfer and reconstruction allowance,
compensation for loss of workdays/income due to dislocation.
Structures on non-titled land, if displaced but not compensated by the DCs will be entitled to
resettlement benefit from the project. Socio-economically vulnerable households such as female-headed
households, households below poverty line, households headed by disabled and those losing more than
10% of their total income as a result of the project will be given additional cash assistance for relocation
and house reconstruction.
Affected PCR will be entitled to all compensation as above and will be rebuilt at project cost at
alternative permanent sites selected by the affected community. These resources will be replaced
through the concerned service providers and public authorities.
Measures such as host area benefits ­ for example, additional classrooms in existing schools, access
roads, improved water supply and sanitation ­ to increase the carrying capacity of the existing facilities
and areas will be undertaken so that resettled families are welcomed by the host communities.
Resettlement sites have been selected at designated locations suitable for relocation of the residence
losers failing to find alternative permanent sites for relocation. The residence losers will be entitled to a
plot at nearby RS on a 99 years lease basis.
Entitlements for different categories of losses and their corresponding PAPs have been given in the
entitlement matrix which was developed in compliance with the Project Resettlement Policy
Framework. Eligibility of PAPs will be governed by the entitlement matrix, cut-off dates and other
conditions as per RAP implementation plan/guideline28 (Administrative Manual and Payment
Modality).


7.4.4   Self-managed resettlement by affected households
Self-managed resettlement could be on own land in the same village or in nearby villages; through
purchase of new land for housing and resettlement. According to the completed surveys so far, 70% of
affected households prefer to relocate themselves in the same or nearby villages after receiving all
eligible assistance according to the policy framework and entitlement matrix. In most cases, they would
need to develop the new land by filling it with 3-4 meters of spoil as the nearby areas in most cases are
predominantly low-lying. Provisions to assist families to undertake these tasks (land-filling) have
already been included in resettlement assistance. It is anticipated that the self-managed relocation
strategy would limit social disruption by allowing the displaced families to stay around their own social
kin groups and on their own choice.
7.4.5   Small group resettlement
Households displaced in groups of 25-30 families, generally related or other social group, will be
encouraged to resettle in clusters in nearby (host) villages. This form of self-relocation enables the
affected families to remain together for mutual self-help. The preference for this kind of small group
resettlement has been voiced by 7.5% of the displaced households.


27
   The severity of impacts is based on the difference between temporary and permanent effects and minor and
significant impacts as defined in the Glossary of Terms derived from co-financiers safeguard policies on
involuntary resettlement.
28
   An Administrative Guideline/Payment Modality has been prepared for approval by the project proponent as a
guide to implement the resettlement action plans.


                                                      33
In keeping with this, the project will provide additional support to these families and host villages in the
form of additional civic amenities (such as arsenic-free tube well and sanitation, road development,
additional rooms and spaces in mosques, schools, clinics in the host area etc.) to enhance the carrying
capacity of the host villages and improve settler-host relations.
7.4.6   Relocation to resettlement sites (RS)
The household surveys revealed that 22% of the displaced residence and businesses losing households
prefer to be relocated in project-sponsored RS. It is important to note that these displaced households
largely consist of squatters or informal settlers and members of vulnerable groups (female headed
households, households with disabled family members) mainly landless, who might not succeed in
resettling by themselves.
Residential and commercial plots in project-sponsored RS will be allocated to the displaced households
in accordance with the entitlement matrix. Interested female entrepreneurs will be given preference in
commercial plots allotment in the RS. Members of the Association of Women Entrepreneurs will be
privileged in the distribution of these plots. The women will organize cottage-type industry and
marketing of homemade products to generate employment and income for them as well as other women
residing in the RS. A few plots will be kept for organizing community livestock-raising in large sheds.
7.4.7   Resettlement site development and participation
All four sites were identified and selected in keeping with the principle of minimization of further
displacement due to site development. Issues of proximity, social networks, and employment
opportunities have also been considered in site selection. The displaced households will be given the
opportunity to choose the nearest site to maintain their current social ties and networks.
Site-specific plans for the four sites have been revised and finalized, based on consultations with the
affected households and communities. In all, the four sites have provisions for 1,944 housing plots and
80 commercial plots for shops and small businesses. Layout and design have been disclosed to the
affected communities in community consultation meetings for their inputs.
The sites are currently being developed and expected to be ready by Sept 2010 for relocation of the
displaced households. All civic amenities such as access road, power line, water supply, drainage facility
etc. will be provided prior to moving people there. PCR like schools, mosque/temple and community
centers will also be built in each of the four sites. A sample layout and design of a RS is illustrated in
Figure 7.1.

Three categories of plot sizes: (i) 2.5 decimal; (ii) 5.0 decimal, and (III) 7.5 decimal have been designed,
see Table 7.1.

                           They will only bear the cost of registration. The plots will be registered in the
                           joint names of the husband and wife or only women in case of female headed
                           households. On divorce/separation/death of husband the ownership will
                           automatically be vested to the wife.
Category B      5.0        Affected households losing their homestead and structures due to land
                decimal    acquisition for the project will be entitled to 5.0 decimal plots. They will pay
                           a modest price for the plot and bear the registration cost. They will bear full
                           stamp duty and registration fee admissible under the compensation package
                           for the registration of the plots.
Category C      7.5        Affected households losing large homestead land (20 decimal or more) or
                decimal    who have two or more married sons living with the head of households will
                           be entitled to 7.5 decimal plot under the same conditions explained in B
                           above.

Each of the affected households will be allowed to build their own house rather than be supplied with
pre-built shelter. Each plot will be marked and developed by BBA before handing over and
reconstruction. A system of lottery will be used to distribute the plots under each category to avoid any

Affected businesses will receive commercial plots in the nearest RS to re-establish their businesses.
Since the sites are located nearby, they may not lose their business or clients significantly. Furthermore,
there will be several hundred families on the RS who will further act as "captive" customers. Like the
homestead losers, no business loser will be allowed to have more than one plot irrespective of quantum
of loss.
Each RS has provisions for open spaces that may be used by floating/temporary traders or to celebrate
occasions such as village fairs, New Year or other seasonal or national holidays.
7.4.8    Host community facilities
The resettlement strategy in this project precludes resettlers-host conflicts since the households will
largely remain within the same general area of the existing villages and thus will continue to maintain
their pre-project social ties and networks. RAP I will provide infrastructure facilities to enhance the
carrying capacity of the host villages where more than 25 families will resettle in small groups. It is
expected that these facilities will help strengthen the mutual relations between the host villagers and the
resettlers. Therefore, conflicts or tension between the host village and resettlers is not anticipated. The
needs of the host villages to enhance their carrying capacity will be identified by the RU and
implementing NGO in consultation with the communities and the Resettlement Advisory Committee at
the time of implementation. If necessary, BBA and the INGO will conduct meetings with host
communities in the post-resettlement period to establish a congenial atmosphere amongst them.
7.4.9    Gender planning and other vulnerable groups
Special attention will be given to women and vulnerable groups. Social impacts of resettlement on
women are a particular concern, since they are often intensified by low levels of awareness, lack of
access to information and a low level of education. There is also a risk of women being deprived of
their due share of compensation for parental land being acquired under the project and of reduced
access to replaced assets and regenerated livelihood resources.
The policy framework adopted in this RAP specifies that vulnerable groups will enjoy special attention
in RAP planning and implementation. Vulnerable groups are those likely to be particularly
disadvantaged as a consequence of acquisition and resettlement, more prominently poor female-headed
households, households headed by disabled and households under the absolute poverty line. The RAP
has special provisions for project-affected women and vulnerable groups to meet their needs and
support their means of subsistence: for example, (i) provisions for additional shifting allowance for
female-headed households; (ii) income and livelihood restoration allowance for loss of income or
employment; and (iii) roadside tree plantation as an alternative income-generating programme.
Womens interests will be further safeguarded in allocation of RS plots (residential and commercial),
identification of affected persons in jointly owned plots and payment of resettlement cash entitlements.



                                                    36
A Gender Action Plan (GAP) has also been prepared to safeguard the interests of women in the
resettlement process.
7.4.10 Physical Cultural Resources
Physical Cultural Resource are defined in WB OP 4.11 "as movable or immovable objects, sites,
structures, groups of structures, and natural features and landscapes that have archaeological,
paleontological, historical, architectural, religious, aesthetic or other cultural significance".
Following the above definition, screening of PCRs in the project areas was conducted as part of the
resettlement planning process. Only one Juma mosque and one mazar (shrine) was selected as PCR in
RAP II. All identified PCRs under RAP II and RAP III will be rebuilt at project cost, in consultation
with the PAPs and the affected communities. Affected PCRs will be rebuilt at alternative sites selected
by the community or at the resettlement sites, where the PAPs relocate (or most of them).
Compensation for land and structure and additional assistance from BBA will be provided to obtain an
alternative site for construction of the PCR structure. BBA will also provide necessary access roads to
these facilities. While INGO will facilitate the process, BBA will coordinate site selection, design and
estimate, site development and reconstruction.
Authorized representative of the PCRs, preferably the head of the management committees will be
directly involved in the process in formal agreement with the community members. Compensation will
be used for procurement of land at selected site and the construction will be undertaken by BBA by
means of deployment of construction contractors through competitive bidding or through the
community. Community members under the leadership of the head of management committee will
supervise the construction of the PCRs with assistance from the BBA field engineers. Special attention
will be given to selecting the re-construction area of PCRs so as to serve both the affected community
as well as those resettling in the RS, as far as possible.

7.5     RAP-III for River Training Works (RTW)
7.5.1   Coverage and objective
RAP-III has been prepared to address and mitigate the impacts of RTW along 2 km on Mawa side and
about 12.5 km on Janjira side. The objective of RAP-III is to plan measures to mitigate the social
impacts of land acquisition and demolition of structures caused by the RTW. Given the consideration
to follow the natural river banks, the embankment works will be designed on a section basis during
implementation. Considering this approach and the natural continuous river bank erosion, it is agreed
to use the 2006 inventory survey for cost estimate purpose. The inventory of impacts and the associated
cost will be updated on a section basis following the section engineering design.
7.5.2   Eligibility for compensation and assistance
RAP-III as per the PRPF ensures that all affected persons will be entitled to compensation and
resettlement assistance based on severity of impacts and ownership status.29 Lack of legal documents
for customary rights of occupancy/titles shall not affect eligibility for compensation and assistance. In
addition to compensation paid by the concerned DC, PAPs will receive assistance in cash or kind to
match replacement costs, which is the difference between the market value established by the DC and
the assessed replacement value for lost assets (land and houses), transaction costs such as stamp duty
and registration costs and other cash grants and resettlement assistance such as shifting and
reconstruction allowance, compensation for loss of workdays/income due to dislocation.
7.5.3   Policy Framework
In addition to usual compensation and assistance as stipulated in the RAP-II policy framework, RAP-III
will also address private owners of charland and submerged eroded land to be acquired or taken over for
construction of RTWs. Land acquisition and taking over land for RTW are guided by the alluvion-
diluvian law when submerged charland is involved.

29
  The severity of impacts is based on the difference between temporary and permanent effects and minor and
significant impacts as defined in the Glossary of Terms derived from co-financiers safeguard policies on
involuntary resettlement.


                                                      37
Unit of entitlement will be a person or head of household as defined in RPF/RAP-II. Compensation for
structures as per law is guided by land titles. However resettlement assistance and replacement value of
structures will be provided irrespective of land titles. Socio-economically vulnerable households such
as female-headed households, households below poverty line, households headed by disabled and those
losing more than 10% of their total income, will be assisted under the same policy of RAP-II. This also
applies to the policy on relocation of affected PCR. Physical improvements to infrastructure in host
areas will be provided to increase the carrying capacity of existing facilities so that resettled families
can be easily integrated into the host community area.
7.5.4      Relocation of households and businesses
As in RAP-II self-managed resettlement or relocation at the project-sponsored RS will be possible. This
applies for affected households and businesses. Some 3,402 households will require relocation. So far
only 22% of the affected households have opted for resettlement in the projects RS. Most of these
families belong to the group of landless, poor and vulnerable groups. The actual requirements for
resettlement in the project-sponsored sites may be higher since some households may fail to find
suitable homesteads by self-managed relocation.
The provisions for resettlement and the modalities for plot allotment and distribution are similar to
those under RAP II, see also Section 7.4.
7.5.5      Social and environmental management
As mentioned under RAP-II, RAP III will also apply a Community Management System in the
management of the RS. For community inputs in environmental management and enhancement there is a
Community Environmental Management Plan (CEMP)30 for the RS. Specific recommendations of the
Public Health Action Plan31 will be implemented for both the resettlers and residents of project area.

7.6        Income and Livelihood Restoration Program (ILRP)
7.6.1      Objective
Restoration of affected peoples incomes to a pre-project level is one of the most important tasks in
resettlement management. The RAPs have provisions for alternative income generating/skill
development and other enabling strategies, through which PAPs can either continue their previous
occupation, start new ventures or undertake an alternative occupation. The basic objective behind the
income and livelihood restoration activities and schemes is to restore the economic status of the affected
persons enjoyed prior to the project, which also complies with the co-financiers safeguard policies on
involuntary resettlement.
7.6.2      Approach towards ILRP
The main objective of the ILRP is to improve or, at least restore, the livelihood of all displaced persons.
The plan recognizes diminishing income and dislocation of livelihoods during and after relocation and
the time needed for social absorption of the affected population in the new social and economic
settings. As a result, appropriate supporting measures have been included for income and livelihood
restoration in addition to providing compensation and resettlement benefits. The project will adopt a
two-fold approach for ILRP. To begin with there will be short-term livelihood restoration followed by a
long-term program to achieve a sustainable livelihood for affected households. Table 7.3 details various
activities which may help the affected HH to either improve or at least restore their livelihood.

The feasibility of these options was verified through various studies conducted during ADB PPTA 2006
and a survey undertaken by BIDS in 2009. The surveys brought forth that the above options are viable
as the affected HH have the necessary skills to undertake these activities and there is an assured market
for them. During implementation detailed business plans will be made for each activity to further
establish its viability and sustainability.


7.6.3   Short-term Income and Livelihood Restoration measures
All persons losing their livelihood resources or places of generating income as a result of the project
will be supported with short-term income and livelihood restoration assistance for subsistence during
the transitional period. These short-term measures will be for immediate assistance and include the
following:
 Compensation for land and other lost assets in full prior to relocation.
 Temporary or short-term employment in construction activities at the resettlement or project
 construction sites will be provided.
 Special assistance, appropriate to vulnerable groups such as women, the aged and disabled.
In addition to the above, the RAP will provide the following short-term assistance for income and
livelihood restoration:
    1. Cash assistance to support lost income
    PAPs, including those experiencing indirect impacts, will be eligible for assistance for loss of
    employment/workdays (wage earners) due to dislocation and relocation. One-time cash grant for a
    certain number of days will be paid to all such PAPs. It is expected that PAPs will be able to
    recover their losses and/or find alternative employment within this period.



                                                   39
    2. Assistance to re-establish business/enterprises
    All owners of affected businesses will receive cash compensation and cash grant for loss of
    business premises plus moving allowance. This assistance is intended to help them re-establish their
    enterprises in new locations. All PAPs are likely to continue their previous occupations and
    commercial activities in new sites. In addition, commercial plots will be allotted to business-losers
    in project-sponsored residential and commercial RS on lease basis to re-establish affected
    businesses. PAPs who need to change profession will be given skills training and assistance to
    establish new business or be absorbed in new trade.
    3. Special assistance for vulnerable groups
    Both the co-financier safeguard policies and good resettlement practices in Bangladesh stress the
    need for special attention to vulnerable groups during implementation of a resettlement programme
    so that resettlement acts as an opportunity to improve their socio-economic status. Since vulnerable
    groups risk becoming particularly disadvantaged as a consequence of involuntary resettlement,
    special assistance will be provided to assist them in their rehabilitation.
    4. Employment during project construction
    The project construction activities will require many unskilled labourers and skilled staff for
    earthworks in embankment and construction of bridge, approach road, offices and management
    work for a period of about 3 years. BBA will make provisions in the contract with the contractors to
    employ qualified PAPs and their dependents in the recruitment of local labour, including affected
    women. Employment in project construction will act as an added source of income in the income
    and livelihood restoration processes of PAPs.
    The NGO implementing ILRP will prepare a list of all capable female workers among the affected
    households and submit it to local contractors through BBA. The supervision/ management
    consultants shall monitor this through monthly statements of number of labour employed from the
    affected people.
    Local people whose livelihood is impacted by the project will have preference for jobs associated
    with project construction. Jobs in the semi-skilled and unskilled category shall be offered to the
    PAPs on a preferential basis.
    5. Roadside Plantation and Social Forestry
    Major plantation works will be required to develop the RS, approach road sides, interior road, guide
    bund aprons, service areas and other facilities of the bridge infrastructure. These are activities
    where rural destitute women can be employed by NGOs and the Department of Forestry as has been
    proven in road construction projects. Affected women and other vulnerable groups will be
    employed for these jobs. The ILRP-implementing NGO, assisted by Gender/Community
    Development Specialist, will organize plantation programs. Selection of tree species, design, plan,
    and other technical support (e.g. training) for roadside plantation will be provided by BBA and
    other appropriate agencies, including the Departments of Forestry and Environment.

7.6.4   Long-term Income & Livelihood Restoration Plan (ILRP)
A long-term ILRP for post-relocation activities will be designed and implemented over a period of 10
years. Under the guidance of a national-level NGO, local NGOs will be involved to develop ILRP
activities in participation with local communities.. The program will be designed through identification
of target group beneficiaries and assessing the needs and feasibility of potential income generating
activities.
The long-term ILRP will be developed for the following categories of project-affected people, eligible
as target group beneficiaries:




                                                   40
         Eligible members32 of poor33 and other vulnerable (female and disabled headed) households to
         be relocated as a result of project construction.
         Poor households or the employees and daily wage earners of the diminished businesses or their
         nominated representatives.
         Poor households losing access to agriculture land including sharecroppers and leaseholders.
         Poor households losing access to commercial land including business proprietorship.
         Poor households losing more than 10% of their regular income due to acquisition and execution
         of the project.
         Female entrepreneurs and their association to be organized to establish cottage-type activity and
         marketing networks for rural products.
In order to ensure smooth implementation of the long-term ILRP, a Social Development Fund (SDF)
will be created by the project. Allocations have already been included in the RAP budgets. The SDF
will be used to extend the following support to the affected households:
         Working capital
         Capacity building support and human resource costs required implementing the program
         Business development services
         Market links
         Skills development
         Female entrepreneurs
         Collective enterprises
         Farm-based inputs and extension services.


7.6.5    Needs assessment and feasibility study for viable ILRP options
Sustainability of income and livelihood restoration activities depends on local resources, skills, needs
and market opportunities. To enable viable livelihood activities, an in-depth Baseline & Needs
Assessment Study was conducted to identify resources and/or opportunities available, to assess present
level of occupation, income generation activities, pattern of trading, small business, and other
employment opportunities, needs and aspirations of the affected person.
The main objectives of this study were to:
         Analyze the economic activities of PAPs by gender, age, education, skills, income, household
         size, preference, options to assess their needs, primarily from census data.
         Identify multiple income and livelihood restoration programs (both individual and group
         specific) through beneficiary consultation, market and financial feasibility analysis.
         Explore product-marketing opportunities within and outside the affected area.
The study made a detailed inventory of all possible options that could be developed for income and
livelihood restoration:

     1. Agriculture Development Program. Land acquisition for the project will reduce the farm size
        of the affected farms in the project area as replacement land will be scarce. It is further evident

32
   Male or female household members between ages 18 to 45 years will be eligible for special assistance under
income and livelihood restoration programme.
33
   Households having income below the national property line (Tk. 4800 per household per month) in Bangladesh
as on 2006 (estimate by consultant).


                                                     41
    from the BIDS survey that the displaced persons particularly the affected households losing
    agricultural land in the south bank (Janjira site) will opt to retain their current occupation in
    agriculture. However, to cover the gap in agriculture income, the farmers will have to increase
    productivity. Diversification into the production of high-value horticultural and agricultural
    crops, improved varieties and better marketing may help to increase production. An agriculture
    development program will, therefore, be worked out to train affected farmers in improved
    farming method and enhanced production and marketing methods. Under the program, a
    number of agricultural extension workers in close cooperation with the Department of
    Agriculture Extension will be placed to guide and assist the farmers. The farmers will be
    provided with agriculture inputs (quality seed, fertilizer, and the like), technology support (soil
    testing and fertilization planning, crop selection, etc.) and finally short-term credit. Farmers will
    be trained how to increase their farm incomes through establishing farmers organizations and
    demonstration plots.

2. Cage culture and floating ponds. The water of the Padma River can be used for fish culture
   using cages and/or floating ponds. The beneficiaries of this program can breed fish as a source
   of income and livelihood resource. This income activity is widely practiced by the people along
   the river bank and has been reported very profitable.
3. Nakshi (design in stitches). There is a growing trend to utilize female labour in producing
   village handicraft items. Private entrepreneurs with sufficient skills in designing, color
   processing and local and international marketing are effectively tapping this potential. Women
   and girls can earn an average TK 1500-3000 per month. The women in the affected households
   can be organized by providing adequate training, technology, marketing facility, financial and
   organizational support.
4. River-based activities. There are opportunities near the landing sites of the bridge for various
   commercial activities connected with (on-going) local ferry operations, boat cruises, the fish
   market and tourism.
5. Occupational skill training. A survey undertaken by BIDS in areas adjoining the RTW
   revealed that about 25% of the affected persons have undergone occupational skills training in
   the past. Training for PAPs and their families may include a wide variety of subjects like
   cattle/goat rearing, poultry raising, beef fattening, driving, primary and other health care, plastic
   goods manufacturing, banana cultivation, radio/TV repairing, tailoring, sewing/embroidery,
   family planning, car repairing, fish cultivation, mechanics and carpentry. Such households
   would be provided with credit support to set up their own small enterprises.
6. Tourism development. The project is planning tourism development at both Mawa and Janjira
   side. There are also opportunities for eco-tourism in a nature reserve on the charlands. The
   scope of tourism will include trips to local chars up and down stream of bridge site which
   provides a fascinating view of the flood plain and river system.

8.       MITIGATION OF OTHER SOCIAL IMPACTS
8.1      Introduction
Besides the direct impacts of resettlement there are also other social impacts. . These include impacts on
gender , public health and potential impacts on the charland communities. BBA has carried screening
and assessment on the respective impacts and developed action plans in consultation with the local
communities.
8.2      Gender Action Plan (GAP)
8.2.1    Objectives
A GAP has been prepared for the PMBP on the basis of a gender impact assessment as well as
consultations with women and women groups in the project areas. The GAP translates the project
gender analysis of general and specific gender concerns and social vulnerabilities into actions which
will:
         Promote womens participation in project planning and implementation.
         Maximise womens access to project benefits.
         Provide opportunities to increase womens skills, incomes and participation in decision-making
         (practical and strategic benefits to women, progress towards gender equality).
         Minimize social vulnerability.
The GAP sets out the major objectives and actions required to achieve gender development outcomes,
and it provides quantifiable indicators by which these may be measured.
8.2.2    Increasing participation of women in project planning and implementation
Participation of women can be ensured during the design phase by stimulating their participation in all
community meetings, but also by consulting them separately in focus group discussions to learn their
preferences, experiences and needs. Another major concern is to verify that women are fully informed
about entitlements and exact timetable for compensation and relocation activities and have effective
access to their entitlements during the land acquisition process.
During construction the NGOs contracted for external monitoring should include a community-led
monitoring component, which can be carried out by a local woman in each resettlement village. In
addition there should be FGD with women each quarter in each resettlement area, including female
construction workers and women living on the char.
8.2.3    Maximizing women's access to project benefits
Local affected people, including women and those living on the char should be encouraged to take up
construction employment. This will be done through raising awareness about the types of jobs
available, timeframes and pay rates, how to apply for work, and issue of ID cards to give them
preference for project work.
Rather than introducing quotas for female workers in the construction contracts, which often works
against women indirectly, local authorities, BBA staff and NGOs hired can be assigned to monitor
implementation and to assist contractors to form female work groups to take on discrete construction
tasks. NGOs undertaking livelihood rehabilitation projects will be asked to formulate such project
specific training in order to form and up-skill womens work groups.
The implementation consultant and BBA may refer to the Local Government Engineering Department
(LGED) methodology to form labour contracting societies comprised of groups of poor women
interested in undertaking construction work. The contractor will be required to monitor and report on
participation in project construction employment by project affected status and gender, as well as the
usual covenants on equal pay regardless of gender and prohibition of child labour.
BBA, local authorities and NGO staff should raise awareness amongst women of other ways to take
advantage of the construction project to boost their incomes. This can include providing services to the


                                                   43
project (catering, laundry, supply of fresh produce and other consumables, office services, managing
accommodation), and working for NGOs (project monitoring and evaluation, community mobilization
focal points, female enterprise leaders, etc). NGOs providing livelihood development services should
specifically target women for skills training which can leverage indirect employment opportunities of
the project, such as setting up nurseries to provide plants for roadside environmental planting, training
female drain-laying and grouting teams, etc.
The focus should be on promoting remunerated employment for women, rather than simply making
them responsible for unpaid volunteer work, such as environmental management work.
8.2.4 Providing opportunities to increase women's skills, incomes and participation in decision
making
As part of the livelihood restoration program for people affected by resettlement, ,,womens corners
will be constructed in each RS. These womens corners will serve as physical spaces where women can
network, learn, support each other, and undertake group and individual income earning activities. In
first instance, NGOs granted contracts to promote livelihood activities will be specifically instructed to
target women at these centers on a number of levels.
Firstly, womens corners will be a place where education and safeguard messages targeting women and
girls will be displayed. Every womens corner will be managed by a female manager from the
resettlement village, to be selected and trained by the NGO as a mobilizer and motivator of the village
womens group. The NGO will assist in the initial establishment of a village female entrepreneurs
group and begin training and support for small income earning activities for women using the womens
corners as training location.
Initial activities will be those the women are familiar with, such as establishment of productive home
gardens (incorporating value-added techniques such as vertical gardening, rainwater harvesting and
alternative crops), and piecework sewing/embroidery. Gradually this can branch out into more non-
traditional areas depending on the womens interests and identification of market niches. Exposure trips
to successful womens businesses, such as some of those funded by the Department of Cooperatives,
can be facilitated. Linkages with micro-credit providers and more empowering finance modalities
should also be explored.
The programme can gradually be expanded to include training in business skills such as identification
of markets, valuation of labour and materials for pricing products, product marketing and distribution.
8.2.5   Reducing women's social vulnerability
Social vulnerability in the context of this project covers the following: domestic violence against
women; public sexual harassment; vulnerability to sexually transmitted infections (STI) including
HIV/AIDS; human trafficking; social stigma and exclusion as a result of single parenthood. In order to
reduce womens social vulnerability at the resettlement villages each ,,womens corner will have a
secure space where women facing violence in their homes can find a safe retreat. Provision of
information, education and communication materials and capacity building can also include information
about STI and HIV/AIDS, raising awareness about public health and education services in the area.
Every womens corner will be owned and operated by a womens organization having received initial
and continuous management training from NGOs in gender issues and womens protection.
A comprehensive public health plan (see below) will be implemented in the construction sites and
camps using a combination of peer education, health checks, referrals, distribution of free prophylactics
and information and education materials on HIV/AIDS and STI and on human trafficking. Contractors
will be asked to implement a zero tolerance policy against sexual harassment that will be externally
monitored under the public health action plan, with associated awareness-raising included in the peer
education program.
8.2.6   Implementation of GAP
Since GAP implementation measures are fully mainstreamed within project activities, there is no
separate implementation budget. The services of the national gender adviser, to guide and provide
capacity support to implementing partners with respect to GAP, are included within the budget of the



                                                   44
supervision consultant (safeguards unit). The GAP will be implemented by NGOs or other institutions
hired for project implementation contracts. Specific actions have been built into the terms of reference
of each of the implementing organizations to ensure gender mainstreaming and GAP implementation.
Provisions have been made for gender capacity building of each organization prior to implementation.
The safeguards team of the design consultant will provide capacity building for BBA and any currently
contracted NGOs in gender mainstreaming and the implementation of GAP. Monitoring indicators have
been provided and monitoring protocol made explicit, and a budget provided for ongoing capacity
development and support.

8.3     Public Health Action Plan (PHAP)
8.3.1   Introduction
A PHAP has been prepared on the basis of an overall evaluation of the public health situation and
services in the project area as well as the additional requirements of health services in terms of quality
and extent during project construction. The overall objective of the plan is to address the public health
impacts associated with the project and contribute to the improvement of public health services in the
project areas. The plan is scheduled for a period of 5 years. The main target groups under this plan are:
 The relocated households (PAPs) and their host communities

 The general public in the surroundings of the bridge and construction sites

 The construction workforce (estimated at 5000 people)

8.3.2   Activities for safeguarding health of PAPs and host communities

During the pre-construction phase public health activities will mainly focus on safeguarding the health
conditions of the relocated families as well as of the host communities receiving settlers. Health
facilities and services will be set up in the 4 RS and 2 service areas. This shall be done in such a way
that they can later easily be integrated into the public sector health care system of the Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare (MOHFW) upon completion of the project. During the first phase, activities will
include a strong information, education and communication program focusing on personal health
practices, in particular handling household solid and liquid waste, hand washing, a "keep village clean"
campaign, a food and nutrition education campaign, vaccinations and detection of childhood illnesses,
and prevention of malaria and STI/HIV/AIDS. A close link will also be established with the activities
carried out under the GAP and the planned "womens corner". For practical and logistic reasons health
centers will be established in or close to the RS as they should also serve the surrounding population
across union boundaries.

8.3.3   Activities to safeguard general public health in the area
During the pre-construction phase a baseline study will be carried out on STI/HIV risks, vulnerability,
capacity needs and estimated prevalence. The baseline survey will determine key criteria and
characteristics of the target group (the general public in the project area). The findings will provide the
starting point and lead for the design of an information, education and communication program aimed
at the population in the project area who will interact with the expected influx of workers during
construction.

During the construction phase activities will be expanded by setting up and operationalizing adequate
and appropriate measures to minimize adverse effects on the health of people migrating to or resident in
the project surroundings who are attracted by and interact with the construction related workforce.
Activities will focus on reproductive health and prevention of STI and HIV/AIDS.
8.3.4   Activities to safeguard the health of the construction workforce

The activities in the plan will be focused on keeping the construction workforce safe from occupational
hazards and health risks from living together in compounds. The workforce should have easy access to
clinical care in order to minimize adverse effects and health risks.



                                                    45
On either side of the river a health facility with primary and emergency/first aid capacity will be
established in the service areas. A medical facility will be set up for the construction workers and
simultaneously function as one of the population service centers. The two service area facilities must
also have the capacity to treat emergency cases. The centre at the south side shall particularly be
enabled to manage trauma patients.

Other measures to be implemented include introduction and implementation of specific occupational
health safety measures, introduction of mechanisms to prevent biological contamination of drinking
water, food supplies and prepared meals; education campaigns on HIV/AIDS and STI; easy access to
condoms and voluntary counseling and testing.
As far as feasible secure housing for workers encouraging them to live with their families on site will
reduce the likelihood of risky behavior with multiple sex partners.

8.3.5   Activities after completion of construction
In the last year before project completion a needs assessment study should provide a base plan to turn
the health clinics over to the regular public health services of MOHFW. The plan should cover the
public health needs in the area and include assistance in monitoring and responding to the needs of the
various target groups. It should also include a program for assistance to redundant health staff and for
re-migration of construction workers. .

8.4     Charland Monitoring and Management Framework
8.4.1   Mitigation of impacts on charlands
The project will monitor the river behavior to assess the unanticipated project impacts on charlands
situated within the defined project boundary (15-km upstream and 7-km downstream from the bridge).
In case of any impacts such as induced floods or bank erosion caused due to the construction of the
bridge, the impacts will be assessed and mitigation undertaken to address the losses. Experience from
the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Project (JMBP) will be used as guidance for the development of a
policy and mitigation framework. The JMBP had adopted a policy to deal with social and
environmental consequences of project-induced flood and erosion impacts during the project
construction period. Due to the difficulties in making a clear distinction between induced and natural
erosion and floods on chars and bank lines, the project treated equally all affected persons as eligible
persons for assistance without regard to that distinction. This policy was adopted for a period of three
years and provided assistance for loss of land due to erosion and crop losses due to induced flooding to
families who experienced such losses. The Jamuna experience will be used to guide and deal with any
induced flooding and erosion in the Padma Bridge Project.

8.4.2   Needs and objectives
Considering the past experiences of JMBP and the discussions held with communities within the
boundaries of the PMBP there is a strong perception amongst the communities that the construction of
the bridge could aggravate erosion and floods in the area. In view of the communitys apprehensions,
the project aims to address all such project-induced impacts by means of making the community aware
as well as providing appropriate assistance to those directly affected, in case such incidence takes place
after project construction.
To deal with any unanticipated project impacts on the char and its population the Charland Monitoring
and Management Framework (CMMF) has been prepared. The framework addresses the potential risks
that are likely to take place in these physical settings. The framework will give policy guidelines to
address and mitigate potential losses of the charland people both upstream and downstream of the
bridge and improve the livelihood of the charland communities as beneficiaries of the project.
Therefore, this framework represents a commitment of the BBA to protect and safeguard the vulnerable
charland communities, in view of any unanticipated impacts and make PMBP a socially and
environmentally sustainable project.
8.4.3   Anticipated risks to charland communities




                                                   46
The floodplains and the history of erosion and accretion make it obvious that annual erosion is a natural
phenomenon. A certain periodicity in river dynamics has been established in the past, which includes a
shift of the main channel in about 20 years time. Major changes in the meanders of the river usually
mean increased erosion and dislocation of people living on the charlands. According to local people
Char Janajat has experienced severe erosion along the river bank of the char. The attached char is the
large complex of charland situated upstream of the bridge along the south bank of the Padma. An
estimated 2 km land from the original bankline has disappeared during the last two years. According to
river morphologists more erosion might occur associated with a changing channel pattern in the years to
come. This erosion will occur with or without bridge.
8.4.4   Minimizing the impact on char land
In order to minimize the anticipated impact upstream an integrated approach combining structural
interventions and safeguard measures was considered essential during the stakeholders meeting to
reduce erosion risk and loss of land. Despite minimal (up to 2 km) backwater impact due to bridge
construction the char communities will probably attribute flooding and erosion within the project
boundary to bridge construction. As a result there will be issues for compensation from BBA to affected
charland people during construction and afterwards. The construction of an additional revetment
upstream of Aria Khan along the char would provide some solution to reduce erosion. However, an
optimal approach would combine a structural solution with social safeguard measures involving
monitoring, management and development of the charland.
8.4.5   Implementation strategy
Since the Padma morphological model suggests a 20-year timeline for channel migration in the
floodplain it is necessary to develop a plan taking this timeframe into consideration. However, given
the extreme uncertainty of erosion and accretion in the floodplain a 5-year development plan with a 20-
year perspective, namely the Charland Monitoring and Management Framework (CMMF) will be
developed for implementation purposes. The 5-year plan and experience will be reviewed for
subsequent planning and development. This adaptive approach will address the changing impacts of the
project and needs of the charland communities. Broadly the framework will guide the identification and
mitigation of losses of the charland people both upstream and downstream and involve the charland
communities as beneficiaries of the project. The framework is a guiding document which will be used
to develop the mitigation measures and action plan. The framework represents a commitment of the EA
to protect and safeguard the vulnerable charland communities, in view of any unanticipated impacts and
make PMBP a socially and environmentally sustainable project.

A multidisciplinary team will be formed including representatives of the social safeguard team, the land
survey, the district administration, and technical specialists from the Ministry of Water Resources and
the Bureau of Disaster Management. The team would provide technical guidance in the identification of
project impacts and development of mitigation measures. The team will develop a guideline for detailed
assessment, screening and eligibility for assistance in the case of induced impact.

8.5     Public Consultation Plan
A Public Consultation and Participation Plan (PCPP) has been prepared with the framework of
continued public consultation and participation during the execution of the project. The PCPP is aimed
at informing the stakeholders on the project plans and activities in a manner that promotes open
dialogue among all interested parties, and focuses on effecting dialogue with those who are or will be
affected by the project. The plan allows directly affected parties to have meaningful input in the
decision-making process in project design and the mitigation of impacts that will affect them. The plan
places strong significance and emphasis on a well constructed and continuous consultation and
participation process throughout the project cycle.
The major activities to be undertaken during project implementation will include the following:
8.5.1   Public Information Center
The nature and details of the project will be made available in easily understood terms and local
languages to inform as many stakeholders as possible. To maintain transparency and keep the


                                                   47
communities informed, BBA will establish three Public Information Centers (PIC) in the project area.
One PIC will be set up in Mawa and the two others will be on Janjira side. These centers will have a
key role in disseminating project-related information and will house an array of project-related
documents ­ RAPs34, land records, safeguard documents, information booklets etc. The centers will be
managed by the NGO. NGO staff will be available at each of the PIC for interaction with the project
communities providing them with necessary information. A register will be maintained at each of the
PICs to register queries, suggestions and grievances of the project communities and PAPs. All queries,
suggestions and grievances recorded at the PICs will be forwarded by the INGO to the Resettlement
Unit (RU).
Furthermore, there will be continuous on-site consultation between the field offices of the RU and the
INGO during the construction stage to ensure that PAPs receive their due entitlements and benefits.
PAP/community leader input will also be sought in the resettlement monitoring and evaluation process
through participatory rapid appraisal and community consultation meetings.
The PCPP shall ensure that the project process includes vulnerable and otherwise excluded groups, such
as women, disabled and poor, and such groups shall be actively targeted, consulted and involved in the
project processes.

8.5.2   Public disclosure of project-related documents
The nature and details of the project will be made available in easily understood terms and local
languages to inform as many stakeholders as possible. The directly affected persons and communities
will be fully made aware of the extent of project impacts on their communities and individual
households. The policies for mitigation of adverse social and environmental impacts will be disclosed
to the influence area peoples, particularly the affected persons and host communities. Specific
provisions for public disclosure of project-related plans have also been incorporated in the specific plan
documents.35 These documents outline the specific mechanisms that have been or will be adopted for
conducting meaningful consultation with affected persons and for enabling their informed participation
in preparing, implementing, and monitoring of the plans. These documents also outline the specific
institutional responsibilities as well as the disclosure arrangements for the same.
A summary of these documents has already been translated into Bangla and will be made available to
the affected people by BBA prior to loan appraisal. An information booklet has been designed for
distribution among the affected persons as the primary tool for disclosure. For illiterate people, other
suitable communication methods will be used. These materials will also be available in the union
parishad, upazilas and district offices in the project area.
Disclosures will also be continued using the following instruments:
        Advertisements in newspapers
        Advertisements on radio and television
        Billboards and posters
        Community workshops
        Information brochures
        Information dissemination through PICs at district, upazila and union levels
        Village level meetings.



34
   During the RAP implementation stage, a Resettlement Advisory Committee will be formed in each district to
seek inputs from local stakeholders in the decision making and implementation of the RAP. Also, affected
persons will be involved in the Grievances Redress Committees to review and resolve disputes or claims over
resettlement entitlements and benefits.
35
   Resettlement Planning documents (RAP I, RAP II & RAP III) and Environmental Management Plan have
specific provisions for public consultation and disclosure.


                                                      48
Further steps will be taken (i) to keep the affected people informed about additional land acquisition
plans, compensation policies and payments, resettlement plans and schedules, and (ii) to ensure that
PAPs are involved in making decisions concerning their relocation and the implementation of the RAP.

8.5.3   Regularly scheduled project update workshops
During the implementation, the Safeguard Unit of BBA will organize project update workshops (one
each at Mawa & Janjira side) at the end of each implementation year. These workshops will address the
issues related to the progress of civil works and their impact in terms of land acquisition, resettlement
and environmental impacts and the status and effectiveness of implementation of safeguards
compliance plans. These workshops will include the following tentative agenda:
        Update on PMBP activities over the past period
        Environmental and Social Action Plan performance updates
        Public Health & Safety Program Performance Update
        Employment needs and hiring update in the civil works
        Plans for future activities
        Other issues and concerns
The participants in the annual workshops will be the government stakeholders including the DC office
dealing with land acquisition, the upazila land offices, and union revenue office, local government
institutions, INGO, local level NGOs and community based organizations, affected persons (men and
women) and the host community. Media presence in these workshops will further make the
implementation process transparent.

8.5.4   Special orientation and consultation sessions
The implementing agencies, monitoring agents and executing agency will identify the need for
occasional consultation with beneficiaries and affected persons. With the emergence of public
involvement in special issues to avoid difficulties in the implementation process, BBA will instruct the
NGOs and agencies to organize need based consultation sessions. Only emergent agenda will be
discussed in the special orientation and consultation sessions.

9       MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING PLAN
9.1     Overview
The overall Social Action Plan (SAP) to avoid or minimize adverse social effects from the project
consists of several components, which have been discussed in the previous chapters. It is the
responsibility of the project executing agency, the Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA), to implement
the SAP in a coherent manner in order to achieve the objectives. Resettlement Action Plans (RAPS)
aim at improving or at least restituting the social and livelihood resources of the affected persons to pre-
project level. The Gender Action Plan (GAP) will mainstream gender issues in project process. The
Public Health Action Plan (PHAP) will cover public health safety during and after project construction.
The resettlement policy framework (RPF) will guide BBA in preparing RAPs for additional impacts in
additional areas within the project boundary. The Charland Monitoring and Management Framework
(CMMF) will provide guidelines to prepare mitigation measures for any identified impacts induced due
to project construction. The Public Consultation and Participation Plan (PCPP) finally is intended to
ensure consultation, participation and disclosure of the affected persons and their community in the
project design, implementation and monitoring.
Implementation of SAP will maximize the benefits of the project to the local residents and minimize
adverse social impacts including involuntary resettlement. About 74,000 people will be resettled
including relocation and livelihood restoration. The 5,000 workers for project construction will receive
appropriate health services and local residents will enjoy health services and be safeguarded from
communicable diseases due to influx of non-local people.
The BBA will implement the SAP components. BBA will be assisted by a supervising consultant, a
management consultant, NGOs and the MOHFW for implementation, management and monitoring of
implementation. A Resettlement Unit (RU) as a division of the Safeguard Department of the BBA will
be responsible for successful implementation of SAP on behalf of BBA. Additional staff resources will
be placed within the RU to enhance its capacity and delivery skills.
The SAP component plans have been prepared with known project impacts based on previous studies
and ongoing investigation. The plans will be updated with time and events in the course of project
design and implementation.

9.2     Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
BBA has established a PIU to execute and manage the civil works construction and has included a
Resettlement Unit (social safeguard unit) in the PIU to implement SAP components and monitor the
implementation process to ensure expected outputs. The process of implementation must ensure that
affected persons are able to regain their pre-project socio-economic status, maintain their usual health
safety and voice their choices and concerns as desired. Monitoring of the process of planning,
implementation and delivery of institutional and financial assistance to the PAPs and their community
has been designed as an integral part of the overall functioning and management of the project. BBA
will establish a management and monitoring plan through a management set-up and a monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) system as a continuous process of collecting, collating and analyzing information
about the progress and a tool for identifying strengths and weaknesses of the process. Also a periodic
evaluation of the process and the outcomes will enable BBA to identify lapses, procedural weaknesses,
policy inadequacies and institutional drawbacks to devise and implement corrective measures to
achieve the desired goals and objectives of SAP.
The PIU will be assisted by external agencies and NGOs for management and monitoring of the
implementation of social safeguard compliance plans including RAPs and ILRP, GAP, PCPP, PHAP
and CMMF. A management consultant will be employed to assist PIU and RU in supervision,
management and monitoring of the activities for implementation of the SAP component plans. The
institutional structures and linkages are detailed in Chapter 10.
BBA will carry out internal M&E of RAP implementation involving the RU field offices, INGO and
the Construction Supervision Consultant (CSC). An independent External Monitoring Agency (EMA)
will carry out independent M&E. The project supervision consultant will oversee and monitor the


                                                    50
safeguard compliance of the project while the Panel of Experts (POE) will conduct periodic missions
for monitoring. In addition, the co-financiers will conduct their own missions within their own
framework of social and environmental compliance monitoring. The PAPs, their community and local
level NGOs will also participate in the M&E process (Figure 9.1).

9.2.1   Office of the Project Director
The Project Director (PD) will be responsible for overseeing proper and timely implementation of all
activities in RAP. The RU within the PD office will operate and manage implementation of RAP with
the assistance of an appointed INGO. Monitoring will be carried out by Head of RU with support from
the field offices and the resettlement INGO. The RU will establish an M&E section at the head office
headed by a Deputy Director for M&E. The M&E Section will have sufficient staff with appropriate
skills and capacity, and necessary resources. The implementing NGO will collect appropriate data from
the field and provide feedback to BBA on progress of RAP implementation and the day to day
problems arising from the process.
The INGO will prepare monthly/quarterly reports on RAP implementation progress. The M&E Section
of RU will collect and assimilate information from the project site in the form of monthly progress
reports of RAP implementation and adjust the work programme where necessary, in case of delays or
problems. An automated MIS will be designed and developed by the INGO to monitor the output
indicators by BBA field and headquarters.

9.2.2   Independent External Monitoring Agency
An independent external monitoring agency (EMA) with experience in resettlement and rehabilitation
of development induced displacements will be engaged to carry out the external M&E and reporting on
RAP implementation. The EMA will carry out quarterly, annual, mid-term and final evaluation and
recommend necessary changes to the Head of RU and the PD of PMBP for consideration. The scope of
external monitoring will cover compliance monitoring and social impact evaluation of RAP
implementation.

The EMA will cover compliance issues such as (i) compensation and entitlement policies, (ii) adequacy
of the organizational mechanism to implement the RAP, (iii) restoration of PAP incomes, (iv) settling
complaints and grievances, and (v) provisions for adequate budgetary support by BBA to implement the
RAP. The EMA will assess if the PAPs: (i) have been provided with alternative sites for relocation; (ii)


                                                     51
have re-established their structures; (iii) have re-established their business; and (iii) were extended
assistance to restore their incomes to pre-project levels. It will also appraise the accounting documents
used to record the compensation payments to PAPs by BBA. In addition, there will be an annual impact
evaluation at least once a year to assess the effectiveness of the work being undertaken and the level of
results.
A comprehensive and relevant database and management information system (MIS) will be established
within the RU. The automated MIS will be updated periodically to monitor various activities of SAP
implementation. SAP databases generated through the LAP, census and inventory of losses, baseline
socio-economic survey, land market survey and consultation, payment of compensation and
resettlement cash assistance, health monitoring and gender mainstreaming will become essential MIS
input. BBA will develop a monitoring program that covers all essential stages of SAP implementation
including updating the plans, relocation of affected households, businesses and common property
resources, providing incentives to host areas, development and allocation of resettlement site plots,
consultation, disclosure and participation, gender equity in project process and public health actions.
Monitoring will also cover the performance of individual staff in management and operation of SAP
plans. Data will be generated through need based surveys and FGD for use in the monitoring process.
BBA will also establish an M&E system integrated with a set of automated MIS to be executed in
conjunction with and assistance of external public and private agencies and NGOs.

9.2.3    Implementation and monitoring database
The DDC with the assistance of concerned agencies will establish a complete electronic databank and
document archive as the key source of information on all resettlement-related data for implementation
and monitoring purposes.
After the finalization of the RTW design BIDS will conduct a census survey, establishing an inventory
of losses and a cut-off date (COD) for entitlement eligibility of non-titled persons. The BIDS database
will assess losses and price of all types of land in all the affected mouzas. Any person moving into the
project area after the COD will not be entitled to compensation from DCs or any assistance from BBA.
However, any PAPs not covered in the enumerations before the CODs can be enlisted with sufficient
verification by IVC.
CEGIS has been engaged to assist the DD consultants with technical services. CEGIS will collect
satellite images of the affected area, digitize mouza maps, and establish a geo-referencing system to
ensure that the database is accurate and that information is neither manipulated nor that the policy
framework is subsequently abused. CEGIS will also prepare a program for files on entitled person (EP)
in individual losses for checking and verification purposes. The Central databank will enhance the
institutional capacity of BBA/Field Offices and the INGO in resettlement management and operations
of the project.

         Monitor and resolve problems due to migration of PAPs to host areas, if any.

9.4      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

The M&E system will serve as a tool for monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement programme
ensuring timely and fair delivery of entitlements. M&E will give BBA feedback from the target
population and provide field operatives to devise corrective measures to ensure achievement of targets
within schedule. The objectives of M&E will enhance the delivery capacity of BBA and maximize
benefits of RAP packages to the affected persons and the host communities.
M&E will be carried out by collecting, analyzing, reporting and using information on the resettlement
progress as per scope of the SAP and the process adopted to achieve that progress. It will ensure that
inputs are provided, procedures are followed, and outputs are monitored and verified as per approved
plan and schedule of actions. On identification of any lapses and failures in the implementation process,
BBA will undertake timely management actions. A benchmark database and necessary software will be
developed for ongoing monitoring and periodic and ex-post evaluations of the SAP targets.
BBA field offices will conduct field level monitoring and assess the day-by-day operation of land
acquisition, payment of compensation, physical identification of entitled persons, and process their
entitlements, relocation and resettlement.
Monitoring will be done both internally and externally to provide feedback to BBA and to assess the
effectiveness of the SAP policy and implementation. Internal monitoring will be carried out by BBA in
three consecutive stages of SAP implementation: SAP apprehension or preparatory stage, relocation
stage, and rehabilitation stage. Scope of M&E will be as follows:

9.4.1    Preparatory Stage

During the pre-relocation phase of resettlement operation, monitoring involves administrative issues
such as, establishment of resettlement unit, budget management, requirements for further land
acquisition, consultation with PAPs in the preparation of resettlement plans and their participation in
the implementation process, information dissemination on payments of entitlement due, grievance
redress, and so on. The key issues for monitoring will be to:
         Conduct baseline surveys
         Hold consultations
         Identify PAPs and their numbers.


                                                    55
        Identify different categories of PAPs and entitlements of individuals.
        Collect gender disaggregated data and preferences of women.
        Establish inventory of losses.
        Ascertain entitlements.
        Valuate various assets not covered by PVAC.
        Budget delivery.
        Disseminate information.
        Assess institutional capacity.
        Implementation schedule and items of expenditure.

9.4.2   Relocation Stage

Monitoring during the relocation phase covers such issues as site selection in consultation with PAPs,
development of relocation sites, assistance to PAPs (especially to vulnerable groups) in physically
moving to the new site. Furthermore, aspects such as adjustment of PAPs in their new surroundings,
attitude of the host population towards the newcomers and development of community life are issues to
be considered at this stage. The key issue for monitoring will be:
        Payment of compensation.
        Delivery of entitlement.
        Grievance redresses
        Support in CCL collection process.
        Preparation of resettlement site, including civic amenities (water, sanitation, drainage, paved
        streets, electricity supply).
        Consultations.
        Relocation.
        PAPs who do not relocate.
        Payment of resettlement benefit.
        Income and livelihood restoration assistance.

9.4.3   Rehabilitation Stage

Once PAPs have settled down at the new sites, the focus of monitoring will shift to economic recovery
programs issues including income generating schemes (IGSs), acceptance of these schemes by PAPs,
impact of IGSs on living standards, and the sustainability of the new livelihood patterns. The key issues
for monitoring will be:
        Initiation of income generation activities.
        Provision of basic civic amenities and essential facilities in the relocated area.
        Consultations.
        Assistance to enhance livelihood and quality of life.

9.4.4   M&E indicators for social impact monitoring

Compliance of the SAP policy and targets in the implementation process will be monitored by setting
up indicators. The most crucial components/indicators to be monitored are the specific contents of the


                                                      56
activities and entitlement matrix. The SAP component plans contain indicators and benchmarks for
achievement of the objectives under the resettlement program. These indicators and benchmarks are
judged on the implementation process, outcomes and impacts.

9.5     Monitoring levels and hierarchy

Monitoring will be carried out at three levels. The Project Director (PD) will carry out regular internal
monitoring with input from the field operation. External monitoring will be commissioned by BBA
employing an independent external agency. The construction supervision consultants (CSC) will also
carry out supervision and monitoring to assist BBA and the co-financiers. The co-financiers Panel of
Experts (POE) will monitor overall performance of the project including SAP implementation. The co-
financiers themselves will also commission supervision missions from time to time.

9.5.1   Internal monitoring

The PD will carry out internal monitoring through the Deputy Director, M&E with the help of the
INGO and the CSC. Internal monitoring will consist of monitoring the process indicators and the output
indicators. The NGOs will gather information on SAP implementation covering relevant activities as
per schedule. CSC social safeguard consultants (international and national) will assist the PD in
monitoring the NGOs activities and review field progress reports regularly. NGOs will prepare
monthly progress reports that will include monitoring issues. The PD will develop progress and
performance monitoring software for monitoring output on a regular basis. Internal monitoring reports
on SAP implementation will be included in the quarterly BBA Project Progress Report.
The internal monitoring report will contain: (i) accomplishments to-date, (ii) objectives attained and not
attained during the period, (iii) problems encountered, and (iv) suggested options for corrective
measures. The internal monitoring reports submitted by the NGOs will be synthesized by the CSC
social safeguard consultants. The international consultant and CSC will assist PD in preparing the
overall implementation status in the PPR in consultation with the national consultants. However, the
national safeguard consultants will particularly monitor the activities of NGOs and report to the PD on a
monthly basis under the guidance of the international safeguard specialists.

9.5.2   External Monitoring

External monitoring will be carried out periodically to review and assess resettlement implementation,
verify the results of internal monitoring in the field, and make suggestions for adjustment of delivery
mechanisms and procedures as required. The main objectives of external monitoring will be to review
SAP implementation and assess the achievements vis-à-vis resettlement objectives; changes in living
standards and livelihoods of those affected; restoration of their economic and social base; the
effectiveness, impact and sustainability of entitlements, and the need for further mitigation measures.
The overall aim of external monitoring will be to learn strategic lessons for future policy formulation
and planning. External monitoring will be independent of the BBA-RU involved in SAP
implementation.
External monitoring will be carried out on a quarterly basis. Mid-term and final evaluations will be
done to assess the achievement of objectives of SAP against the performance impact indictors. A
database for monitoring and evaluation, building upon the project's own M&E system will be developed
for external monitoring. It will optionally include maps, charts, photographs of affected property, copies
of contracts and land titles, payments, and valuation documents relating to resettlement.
9.5.3   M&E by the panel of expert (POE)

The POE with nominated members from co-financiers comprising international and national technical
experts will commission periodic monitoring and evaluation of SAP implementation. The objectives of
POE supervision and monitoring will be to ensure safeguard compliance with respective safeguard
policies of the co-financiers. POE monitoring focuses on achievement of targets of process indicators
within an agreed timeframe.



                                                   57
9.5.4    M&E by co-financiers

In addition to POE missions, the co-financiers will also commission progress monitoring of SAP
implementation with their respective safeguard specialists. The GOB has also commissioned a special
committee to monitor the timeliness of the execution of project activities.

9.5.5    Methodology and approach

The M&E approach will be to identify and select a set of appropriate indicators and gather information
on them to assess changes and variations. Stakeholders participation, especially of affected persons,
women and vulnerable groups will be ensured in the M&E process. The process will also include
various formal and informal surveys for impact analysis. Assessment of resettlement efficiency,
effectiveness, impact and sustainability will be carried through the M&E process to identify lessons
from the PMBP and build upon them of the affected people future policies with involuntary
resettlement in the country.
Monitoring tools would include both quantitative and qualitative methods as follows:
         Sample household survey: a baseline household survey of representative sample (20% of
         affected households), disaggregated by gender and vulnerability to obtain information on the
         key indicators of entitlement delivery, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability.
         Focused Group Discussions (FGD): consultation with a range of stakeholder groups (local
         government, resettlement field staff, NGOs, community leaders and PAPs including women
         and vulnerable groups).
         Key informant interviews: consultation with individuals like local leaders, village workers or
         persons with special knowledge or experience in resettlement activities and implementation.
         Community public meetings: open public meetings at resettlement sites to elicit information
         about performance of various resettlement activities.
         Structured direct observations: field observations on status of resettlement implementation, plus
         individual or group interviews for crosschecking purposes.
         Informal surveys/interviews: informal surveys of PAPs, host villages, workers, resettlement
         staff, and implementing agency personnel using non-sampled methods.
         In the case of special issues, in-depth case studies of PAPs and host populations from various
         social classes will be undertaken to assess the impact of resettlement.

9.6      Capacity Building and Training

There is a need for an efficient organizational set-up for involuntary resettlement management. The key
organizations/agencies responsible for implementation of the three RAPs involve:
         BBA as the Executing Agency (EA) for the project
         Deputy Commissioner(s) of the concerned districts
         Department of Fisheries, Forestry, Agricultural Extension, Cooperative, Upazila administration
         and banks
         Local government institutions like Upazila Parishad and Union Parishad which represent the
         PAPs in all forums regarding land acquisition, resettlement, and income and livelihood
         restoration
         Experienced NGOs/Institutions/Consultants to assist BBA for RAP implementation, income
         and livelihood restoration, need-based surveys and services, and internal monitoring
         BBA is in the process of establishing a Safeguard Division within the permanent structure of
         the organization with separate environmental and resettlement units.



                                                   58
Participation of these organizations/agencies is important to implement a time-bound (i) Land
Acquisition Plan, (ii) Resettlement Plan (iii) Gender Action Plan, (iv) Public Health Action Plan, (v)
Public Consultation and Participation Plan and (vi) Income and Livelihood Restoration Programme. In
order to build the capacity of these bodies, specific terms of reference, legal/administrative authority,
intensive training/orientation focusing on the tasks and responsibilities, are considered imperative.
The DDC will conduct training on resettlement management to strengthen the capacity of the agencies
(RU, DC/Local administration, and RAC and GRC members) for effective implementation of RAPs.
The DDC will also conduct briefings on RAPs and implementation issues with INGO prior to
mobilization and implementation of resettlement.
At the BBA level, some capacity building initiatives ­ for example, analysis of existing capacity, staff
skills, staff development and training needs ­ have already been taken by the Social/Resettlement
Advisor36 to BBA. DDC will conduct short-term resettlement management training and workshops
involving related agencies and field staff dedicated to implementation of RAPs. In addition, a set of
operational guidelines and a handbook will be prepared to guide the field staff in consistent application
of the policies and practices.
In order to build capacity of key BBA staff, including field staff involved in RAP implementation, an
overseas training cum exposure on involuntary resettlement management will be organized. This
overseas training cum exposure trip will likely involve visits to Peoples Republic of China, India and
Sri Lanka and shall focus on sharing resettlement management experiences with similar types of
projects. The DDC will design an overseas training cum exposure programme for interaction with the
infrastructure agencies of those countries managing involuntary resettlement as per international
development financing institutions relevant policies.
Recently, BBA has recruited new staff/consultants for the safeguard department including a Safeguard
Manager (environmental and resettlement) and three senior resettlement specialists for five years.

9.7     Reporting requirements

The Head of RU responsible for supervision and implementation of each SAP component will prepare
monthly progress reports on safeguard actions to the PD. The PD will submit quarterly reports to the
co-financiers. The external monitoring agency (EMA) will submit bi-annual reviews directly to co-
financiers and determine whether resettlement goals have been achieved, more importantly whether
livelihoods and living standards have been restored/enhanced, and suggest recommendations for
improvement. Monitoring reports will be submitted at regular intervals as specified. Both monitoring
and evaluation will be part of regular activities and reporting on this will be extremely important to
undertake mid-way corrective steps.
Table 9.1 provides details on the content and timing for various reports associated with M&E.

        10 INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS

10.1    Introduction
The Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA)37 under the Bridge Division of the Ministry of
Communications (MOC) represents the Government of Bangladesh as the Executing Agency of the
Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project. BBA is responsible for undertaking all studies, design, and
construction of the bridge. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU), headed by a Project Director (PD), has
already been set up within BBA to execute the PMBP. BBA is also responsible for operation and
maintenance (O&M) of the bridge after its opening. BBA is mandated to undertake steps, as per
guidelines of the MOC and advice of the GOB, to secure required funds from both external and internal
sources for the implementation of the project. The WB, ADB, JICA and the IDB have agreed to co-
finance the project along with the GOB.
A detail design consultant (DDC) is assisting BBA in scheme design, detailed engineering design of the
approved scheme design and safeguard plans. DDC is also preparing procurement documents to employ
a construction supervision consultant, civil works contractors, NGOs and other agencies to assist BBA.
The Deputy Commissioners (DCs) of Munshiganj, Shariatpur and Madaripur have been assisting BBA
in acquiring land.
Besides engineering construction contractors, BBA will also engage NGOs and agencies for
implementation and monitoring environmental and social safeguard plans. The social safeguard plans

  Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) (formerly Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority) was created by
Ordinance No XXXIV of 1985 on 4 July, 1985. The objective of Ordinance was to construct a Multipurpose
Bridge over the Jamuna River. It was further amended in November 23, 1998 (Act. XXI of 1998)]. To keep
consistency of its works the government has changed its name into Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA).


                                                    60
include RAPs, PCPP, GAP, PHAP, and CMIF. These plans will be implemented under full
responsibility of BBA with the assistance of experienced national NGOs and agencies. An NGO for
implementation of the three RAPs has already been engaged by BBA.
Public health safeguards will be ensured through implementation of the public health action plan
(PHAP), which will be implemented in cooperation with the MOHFW in the project districts. Gender
issues will be addressed by implementation GAP.


10.2    Implementation of Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs)
10.2.1 Resettlement Unit (RU)
A (RU) has been established within the PIU, which is responsible for the implementation of the RAPs ,
including disbursement entitlements and resettlement of the project affected peoples (PAPs).The RU is
headed by a Superintending Engineer (Additional Director ­ Resettlement) and has field offices at both
Mawa and Janjira sites each headed by an Executive Engineer (Deputy Director ­ Resettlement). A
Deputy Director has also been put in place for Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of the
implementation of the safeguard plans as the Deputy Director ­ M&E at the headquarters of BBA
(Figure 10.1).
BBA is assisted in its task by the DCs of Munshiganj, Shariatpur and Madaripur districts for acquisition
of land for the project. The Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS)
has been engaged to computerize land acquisition data with GPS reference. The Bangladesh Institute of
Development Studies (BIDS) has been engaged to undertake surveys and verify field data for
preparation of RAPs. An experienced NGO (Christian Commission for Development in Bangladesh)
has already been mobilized for implementation of the three RAPs at field level.

The services of national and local level experienced NGOs will also be utilized by BBA for design and
implementation of the income and livelihood restoration plan (ILRP). A national level NGO will be
employed as coordinating NGO (CNGO) to implement the ILRP engaging the local level NGOs.
The DDC/CSC and the construction contractors will cooperate in respective areas for effective
implementation of the RAPs. In the RS, special arrangements will be made by BBA to operate schools
and health centers. Experienced NGOs with necessary skills and resources will be engaged to provide
these services.

10.2.2 Safeguard Department

BBA is in the process of establishing a Safeguard Department (Figure 10.2) with separate
environmental and resettlement units. The Safeguard Division will be permanent and remain part of
BBA administration in the post-construction period. The institutional study has recommended a
reformed BBA with a new organigram38. An action plan to set up the permanent Safeguard Department
within BBA has been recommended in this study. The recruitment of new staff/consultants is being
done in accordance with the plan. Three senior resettlement specialists have been recruited by BBA for
five years.

The Resettlement Unit (RU) is stationed at BBA headquarters in Dhaka. A total of three field offices
have been opened ­ one in Mawa and two in Janjira with respective desks to handle cases of Janjira and
Shibchar thanas separately. The main task of the RU, under the SE-Resettlement, shall be:
        Overall planning, management and monitoring of the LAP, RAPs, GAP, PHAP, PCPP and
        ILRP.
        Synchronization of resettlement activities with the construction schedule of the project.
        With the help of consultant/INGO design and set up necessary computer and software facilities
        for preparation of ID cards, and computerized loss, entitlement and payment files of individual
        EPs in order to effectively monitor and evaluate RAP implementation.
        Ensure that all eligible persons are identified, provided with their respective entitlements (as
        per the resettlement policy/package) and relocated/resettled as per the implementation

        of their eligibility for resettlement benefits.
        Form Grievance Redress Committees (GRC) and ensure their smooth functioning, including
        disposal of grievances.



                                                       63
        Monitor the effectiveness of entitlement packages and delivery mechanism and, if necessary,
        propose modifications to BBA management.
        Prepare Terms of Reference for resettlement INGO/Agencies and other agencies that are to
        execute specific components of resettlement implementation on behalf of the BBA­RU.
        Select and appoint such agencies to implement and monitor progress and take remedial action
        against slippages.
        Prepare monthly and quarterly progress reports for BBA management and co-financiers.
        Prepare Terms of Reference for a Post Resettlement Survey as well as select and appoint an
        appropriate agency to execute these survey(s).
        Propose any remedial action needed to BBA, based on the Post Resettlement Survey results.
        Payment of additional grants for replacement land purchase, house/business reconstruction
        grant, and dismantling and removal assistance and all other assistances in cash or kind, as
        stipulated under the resettlement policy, to all the eligible PAPs.

        trees and crops and recommend prices/rates for all types of losses incurred by PAPs.
        Update, if required, the land market survey to determine the replacement cost of land in and
        around the project area and accordingly recommend the maximum allowable replacement value
        (MARV) for replacement land.
        Identify and plan resettlement measures for EPs who have already vacated their lands.
        Co-ordinate with related agencies regarding possible adverse impacts on the population as a

        mitigation measures.
        Liaise with other government and non government agencies in the country, on matters of
        mutual interest, related to resettlement.

10.2.3 Deputy Commissioners (DC)

The DCs play a key role in the land acquisition (LA) and assist in the R&R process. The DC has the
legal responsibility of acquiring land and paying compensation directly to the PAPs as per the
Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982 and subsequent amendments.
Furthermore, the DC has access to official records and the Legal/Administrative authority for title of




                                                 64
land and eligibility of PAPs for Cash Compensation under Law (CCL) for land as well as for other
assets covered by the law.
Taking into account the additional land acquisition requirements of the project, there is a definite need
to enhance the capacity of the LA section of the concerned DCs, by engaging additional senior LA staff,
for efficient processing of LA requests. It is also necessary for other DCs to initiate their own website
for disclosure of necessary information relating to LA cases as done by DC Munshiganj.
The BBA and INGOs, will work with representatives of the DCs during the joint verification of
affected properties and the market survey of the properties, to ascertain the current replacement value,
before budgeting the total compensation payable to the PAPs.
The DC offices will receive funds for CCL payment from BBA and effect payment of CCL to the
directly affected persons immediately following issuance of notice under section 7. The CCL payment
receipts will be given to BBA to facilitate quick disbursement of differentials, if any, by the BBA.
Participation of the DC will be necessary in the host area meetings. Similarly DCs
intervention/assistance will be required in matters such as land requisition, disposal of land ownership
disputes, allotment of khas land and other surplus land.

10.2.4 Implementing NGO (INGO)
It is now generally recognized that the task of successfully implementing a RAP requires the special
attitude and skills in dealing with people at grassroots level. This experience is available among some
reputed NGOs in the country. Therefore, government has adopted the policy to commission the services
of such an NGO to assist in the implementation of the RAPs. An experienced NGO has already been
engaged. The principal task of the INGO would be to identify the project affected households/business
enterprises and persons relating to the enterprises, estimating their losses and dislocations, and
processing their entitlement as per the packages. The next main task would be to assist BBA in
disbursing entitlements, which are outside the purview of CCL.
The INGO would also play an important role in addressing legitimate grievances of PAPs and
vulnerable groups and undertake income and livelihood restoration activities.

10.2.5 Project consultants
Resettlement specialists of the DDC and CSC team, acting on behalf of the project and BBA, will
ensure that sound methodologies and practices are followed in the implementation of RAP. The
consultants will advise on any changes in the modalities of the implementation work, participate in
meetings with the contracted agency/NGO and BBA, and monitor the work of the INGO/agency in the
field. The consultants will also review, on behalf of SE-RU, the implementation progress report,
submitted by the contracted NGO/agency, on a regular basis.

10.2.6 External monitoring
Except internal monitoring and evaluation by the EA for land acquisition and resettlement, an
independent monitoring agency (EMA) will be engaged through competitive bidding to undertake
resettlement supervision, and monitoring and evaluation of land acquisition and resettlement
implementation. The EMA will evaluate the implementation of the resettlement program and submit an
independent monitoring and appraisal report on RAP implementation to the PMO, BBA and the co-
financiers.
The overall institutional structure for implementation of the RAPs is shown in Figure 10.3.

10.2.7 Resettlement management committees
The process for RAP implementation will be participatory with representatives from the government,
local elected representatives, community and affected persons. Selected representatives from
appropriate stakeholders will be included in the resettlement management committees. A PVAC at
upazila level will be formed to determine the replacement market value of land and assets for
compensation. A GRC for each union will be formed to address affected persons grievances in the



                                                   65
resettlement process, and a RAC will be formed to facilitate BBA for timely relocation of PAPs from
the required land and assist delivery of project sponsored resettlement benefits as designed in RAP.
Furthermore, in case of any confusion, an Inventory Verification Committee (IVC) will be formed to
identify the quantity and quality of affected properties concretely.
In order to ensure collective sharing of responsibilities, PVAC, GRC, RAC and IVC will be formed
with representatives from the BBA, consultant and representatives of the Local Government Institutions
through administrative order of the Ministry of Communications with appropriate legal authority
through gazette notification. Formation, roles and responsibilities and the mandates of the committees
proposed are presented below.

       A) Property Valuation Advisory Committee (PVAC)
Given that compensation levels are often inadequate in reflecting replacement value (RV), it is necessary
to form PVACs to (i) provide guidance for the valuation of properties at replacement cost, and (ii)
recommend the RV to the GOB for approval. The Executive Director (ED), BBA/Secretary, Bridges
Division, Ministry of Communications, will authorize the formation of PVACs in each of the upazilas
covered by the project. The PVACs, which should record proceedings of all their deliberations, shall
consist of the following:
           Superintending Engineer (Resettlement), Convener
           Chairman, Upazila Parishad (Member)
           LA Officer, DC Office (Member)
           Sub-Divisional Engineer, District PWD (Member)
           Deputy Director (Resettlement), PMBP (Member-Secretary)
The DDC will assist the PVACs by providing technical expertise to assess RVs for properties (land by
type and mouza, structure by basic construction type, trees by broad species-type, and crops by type). As
needed, DDC will consult with affected persons and host populations to obtain adequate information
about property values, and review past reports on replacement value.39 For land, DDC will seek to
reconcile the values with the land market survey data obtained under the census surveys conducted by
BIDS.
The PVACs will review and verify as needed the replacement values assessed by type in all three districts
and submit them to MOC for approval. The difference between CCL and RV will be paid by BBA to the
eligible persons (EPs) with the assistance of the RAP-INGO.



       B) Inventory Verification Committee (IVC)
Inventory of losses (IOL) has been established at different stages of the project feasibility study and
preparation starting from JICA feasibility study (2003-05) through BBA RAP study (2005-06), ADB
PPTA study (2006) and DD census by BIDS (July 2009). The DCs have also conducted joint verification
of physical properties and usage of land under acquisition for the project. During the implementation
stage, identification of affected persons and determination of their losses will be based on IOL data
consistent with present conditions and project implementation status. Data has to be verified and
confirmed against COD and legitimate impact following the IOL at various stages. The IVC will therefore
be formed with particular responsibilities for data validation through gazette notification by the MOC.


Formation of the IVC will be as follows:
           Executive Engineer-Resettlement, RU                  :       Chairman
           Resettlement Specialist/BBA, DDC/MC                  :       Member
           Representative of DC office                          :       Member
           Local Government Institution Representative          :       Member
The IVC will compare the IOL with that from different sources and verify cases where variations more
than 10% on either side are found. Depending on the volume of work, IVC may use services of an
NGO/consultant with computerized data processing and programming capacity at the field level.

39
     In particular, BCL (2006) and ADB PPTA (2007).


                                                      68
     C) Resettlement Advisory Committee (RAC)
At the implementation stage, BBA will form a RAC in each union with the approval of the head of BBA-
RU in order to involve the local communities and PAPs in the implementation process. The committee
will ensure local participation, provide local inputs and assist in all matters related to implementation of
the RAP. This committee shall consist of the following:
        Executive Engineer-Resettlement                     :                Convener
        Area Manager of INGO                                :                Member- Secretary
        LGI representative                                  :                Member
        Representative of Female PAPs                       :                Member


10.3    Implementation of PCPP
BBA, as the project proponent, will have overall responsibility for consultation with stakeholders and
ensuring their participation in the project process. BBA will design the structure of all consultation
activities with assistance of the consultants. BBA will take responsibility for the organization of all
aspects of consultation meetings and workshops excepting minute taking and recording of issues raised
and commitments made with the help of INGOs and agencies. The INGOs and agencies will be
responsible for distribution of disclosures instruments among the various stakeholders including the
affected persons and the host community. In addition, the INGO will be responsible for managing and
running the Public Information Center (PIC).
BBA will respond to concerns and ideas raised through public consultation through the Safeguard Unit 40
with the assistance of respective advisors. The PD will ensure that all public consultation and information
disclosure requirements of the international co-financiers have been met, including documentation of
results.
The INGOs will assist in the execution of the consultation and participation process at field level and also
assist BBA in designing and implementation. The NGOs will report to the SE­Resettlement. Specific
responsibilities of the INGO with regard to consultation and participation shall include the following:
        Continued public consultation with local communities affected by the project, using appropriate
        communication processes taking gender and cultural issues into consideration.
        Provide local communities with project information and related issues.
        Monitor employment of local labourers, affected persons and members of vulnerable groups in
        civil works construction and other project related work.
        Identify any significant new issues that may arise during the construction period.
        Work with the EA, local communities, INGOs and civil works contractors to resolve any disputes
        between parties.
        Coordinate with and mobilize stakeholders for effective PCPP processes (organization of annual
        workshops), by providing adequate support to BBA.
        Maintain records of public disclosure and information dissemination, document all consultations,
        and the queries/suggestions/grievances of the project communities received in PIC and include
        the same in periodic reports submitted to BBA.

  The Safeguard Unit comprises of the Superintending Engineer (Resettlement) and Additional Director
(Environment)


                                                      69
       Ensure that the project process is inclusive and includes vulnerable and excluded groups, such as
       women, disabled and poor. Such groups shall be actively targeted, consulted and involved in the
       project processes.
The INGOs will assist BBA in executing the PCP process and producing the report and
recommendations. Based on the review of recommendations by the INGO and the external monitoring
agency, BBA will identify corrective measures for implementation in the field upon approval from the
MOC.

10.4     Implementation of Public Health Action Plan (PHAP)
10.4.1   Institutional arrangements
To implement the PHAP, BBA will contract a private health care provider for primary health care,
including preventive health care, information, education and communication services and capacitating
public sector facilities in the area. The health facilities will serve as primary health care facilities for the
construction workforce as well as the population of the project area. Secondary health care and the
implementation of occupational health measures for the workforce remain the responsibility of the
contractor(s). However, the health care provider should oversee contractors compliance with
occupational health safeguard measures and identify possible gaps. Furthermore, close cooperation should
be established between the private health care provider and the MOHFW health care unit in the unions, as
well as with the Zila physicians in order to design a common strategy and set priorities as well as
effectively coordinate implementation. A detailed plan for the integration of health services into the
regular health infrastructure for the post construction period should be designed.
10.4.2 Institutional requirements of the health care provider
The health care provider or NGO to be contracted should have wide experience and capacity in designing
and implementing preventive health care campaigns and activities. They should also have sufficient skills
and qualified staff to provide practical training for local health workers to upgrade their skills in
prevention and awareness of waterborne and STI and HIV/AIDS. Also important is that the organization
has previous experience in community engagement and a thorough understanding of gender and social
development. There should be sufficient capacity to oversee and control the application of occupational
health measures. For primary health care there should be sufficient capacity to provide care in
emergencies.
10.4.3 Monitoring
It remains the responsibility of BBA, in cooperation with MOHFW to monitor the performance of the
private health care provider, assuring the quality of delivery, technical and financial accountability. This
implies a contractual relation with BBA, a formalized four-partite understanding between the BBA,
MOHFW, the construction company and the private health care provider, outlining the respective
responsibilities and tasks.

10.5     Implementation of GAP

10.5.1 Implementing organizations
In order to ensure gender considerations are mainstreamed in the project and not marginalised the
implementation of the GAP is mainly to be carried out by the following organizations:
         NGOs contracted for implementation of the RAP.
         NGO contracted for the external monitoring of the RAP (EMA).
         Upazila government staff, particularly those representing female constituents.
         Local authorities, livelihood NGOs, BBA and contractors regarding project employment.
         Livelihood development program NGOs for skill development and non-project employment.
         Womens corner managers.
         Womens entrepreneur groups.
         NGO contracted for raising public health awareness.
         The organization charged with the implementation of the Charland Impact Management
         Framework.


                                                      71
        Monitoring NGO for the Community Environmental Management Plan.
Since GAP implementation measures are fully mainstreamed within the project activities, there is no
separate implementation budget. The services of the national gender adviser, to guide and provide
capacity support to implementing partners with respect to GAP implementation, are included within the
budget of the supervision consultant (safeguards unit).

10.5.2 Gender activities implemented in other programs/plans
The programs implied by the various GAP methodologies above will be implemented by NGOs or other
institutions hired for one of the following project implementation contracts:
        The design consultants safeguards team will ensure maximum participation of women in socio-
        economic surveys, and inform them through additional focus groups of safeguards design,
        livelihood rehabilitation measures and project infrastructure.
        The LIRP will include all the specific measures described above for activities taking place in or
        centered at womens corners in resettlement villages.
        The PHAP will include all activities described in the public health plan, and associated advocacy
        activities aimed at prevention of sexual harassment. All monitoring data will be disaggregated by
        sex, plus age group where possible.
        External monitoring of resettlement implementation will include community-led monitoring as
        undertaken by women for a stipend payment. All monitoring data will be disaggregated by sex,
        plus age group where possible.
        Works contractors will provide information on level of engagement of affected persons in project
        employment, disaggregated by sex. They will also report on incidence of sexual harassment and
        actions taken to mitigate the same; and incidence of noticeable disease as per the requirements of
        the PHAP.
        All monitoring reports on project impacts from design phase onwards should present sex-
        disaggregated socio-economic information where relevant and specifically analyze impacts on
        men and women separately, with comparisons, including such areas as participation, income
        earning, access to project benefits, negative impacts, migration, education, health, public opinion,
        etc.
        Capacity building: the design consultants safeguards team will provide capacity building for
        BBA and any currently contracted NGOs in gender mainstreaming and the implementation of the
        GAP to ensure understanding, support and sustainability of gendered outcomes. The supervision
        consultants contract includes provision for a national gender adviser over a period of 5 years to
        provide follow-up training and support in the area of gender.
Specific actions have been built into the TOR of each of the implementing organizations to ensure gender
mainstreaming and GAP implementation. As noted above, provisions have been made for gender capacity
building of each organization prior to implementation by the design consultant, and ongoing capacity
building and support during the construction phase.

10.6    Implementation of CMMF
BBA will hire a local NGO to implement the Charland Monitoring and Management Framework under
the umbrella of the coordinating NGO (CNGO). CNGO will guide and facilitate the functioning of
various local NGOs, who will work as INGO. The INGO will be responsible for direct implementation of
all activities planned under CMMF. There may be more than one INGO for the total area. Local level
NGOs working in the area will be encouraged to participate in this program. The TOR requires the INGO
(i) to undertake activities involving identification of project-induced disaster (flood, erosion) affected
people and payments of compensation; (ii) to develop sustainable income-generating activities based on a


                                                    72
needs assessment survey consistent with NGOs census and socio-economic survey conducted during the
design phase; and (iii) to draft overall development strategies.
In the third quarter of 2010, the INGO will open its CMMF Project Offices in Mawa and Janjira. The
entire CMMF operation will be supervised by BBA through the CNGO Project Manager, Mawa and
Janjira Offices, assisted by technical staff for project administration and monitoring: 2 GRC members, 1
computer operator, 1 Kanungo (land expert) and 3 accountants.
The INGO census shall be considered a cut-off survey; however, BBA will review claims of individuals
who may have been left out through locally constituted GRCs.
Based on the census, the INGO will develop a comprehensive database of the potentially affected
charland people both on attached and island charlands, up and downstream of the bridge. The INGO
census database should provide detailed information on household characteristics, occupation, settlement
history, landholding, ownership/occupancy, land value in individual chars/villages, and losses incurred by
project-induced disasters such as major floods and subsequent erosion in the recent past. The INGO will
distribute resident registration cards to all households listed in the census. It is expected that the same
NGO will implement the CMMF.
All these NGOs have their own development programs for the ultra poor population as well as relief
programs for disaster-affected people at the time of emergency. Their development programs mostly
cover micro-credit supply to develop small-scale enterprises, trading, enhancement of economic
conditions by investing more input into their own occupation and many other fields. These activities have
already proven to enhance the socio-economic conditions of the people by promoting more than one
occupation for active members and involving all family members in their respective position. Womens
empowerment is one of the principal achievements of this micro-credit /development program. The
awareness programs in addition to the credit programs have contributed greatly towards social
development, like improving education levels of subsequent generations, health and sanitation, human
rights and others. Thus, even after completion of the CMMF these vulnerable people can be part of the
regular programs of the respective INGOs sustaining their development.
The BBA will maintain liaison with DC and District Disaster Management Committees as well as a
committee of varying hierarchy in the government and local political arena to coordinate participation in
any relief or rescue operation at the time of emergency induced by the project.

11 Grievance Redress

11.1    Grievance Redress Committees (GRC)
To deal with resettlement related disputes and to make the project accountable to the affected people, a
two-tier GRC will be established. First, GRC at the local level consisting of local representatives of the
affected people, project staff, and local government representatives and INGO will receive cases and will
resolve locally within a defined timeline. Cases which are not satisfactorily resolved or affected persons
have grievances, will be forwarded to a project level "independent" GRC. The decision by the
independent GRC will be binding on the project.

Local level GRCs have already been established in the project area in each Union Parishad and gazette by
the Government of Bangladesh. Thus the GRCs are officially recognized community based body to
resolve disputes arising out of various matters related to SAP and EAP. The fundamental objectives of
GRCs are to resolve any resettlement-related grievances locally in consultation with the aggrieved party
to facilitate smooth implementation of the social and environmental action plans. Another important
objective is to democratize the development process at the local level and to establish accountability to
the affected people.

Composition of local GRC

The following GRC composition has been gazetted for the entire project are with representations from
BBA, INGO, local elected officials, representatives of affected people and women in the project area to
ensure participatory process and to allow voices of the affected communities in the grievance procedures.

Executive Engineer ­ PMBP                        :        Convener

1 representative of INGO                         :        Member Secretary
Chairman ­ concerned Union Parishad              :        Member

Female member of concerned ward of the UP        :        Member

Representative of Women APs                      :        Member

One (1) representative of APs (based on the recommendation of INGO and approved by Convener)

This structure of GRC has worked in the past projects ­ for example, Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge
Project, Bhairab Bridge Construction Project, Pakshey Bridge Project and Southwest Road Network
Development Project. The post-project evaluations indicate that GRCs have worked well and was
successful in resolving disputes in a participatory manner and with fairness in the decision making
process. Unresolved cases will be forwarded to the project level independent GRC. The GRC is
empowered to take a decision which is binding on BBA. In RAP I, the GRC processes under the above
format is functioning well in resolving dispute quickly.

TOR for local GRC

The scope of work and the Terms of Reference (TOR) for GRC are:




                                                     74
        (i)      The GRC shall review, consider and resolve grievances related to social/resettlement and
                 environmental mitigations during implementation received by the RU Field Office
        (ii)     Any grievances presented to the GRC should ideally be resolved on the first day of
                 hearing or within a period of three weeks, in cases of complicated cases requiring
                 additional investigations. Grievances of indirectly affected persons and/or persons
                 affected during project implementation will also be reviewed by GRC
        (iii)    The GRC will not engage in any review of the legal standing of an "awardee" other than
                 in the distribution of shares of acquired property among the legal owners and associated
                 compensation or entitlement issues
        (iv)     GRC decisions should ideally be arrived at through consensus, failing which resolution
                 will be based on majority vote. Any decision made by the GRC must be within the

        (vi)     A minimum three (3) members shall form the quorum for the meeting of the GRC.


GRC meetings will be held in the respective RU Field Office in the project area or other location(s) as
agreed by the Committee. If needed, GRC members may undertake field visits to verify and review the
issues at dispute, including titles/shares, reason for any delay in payments or other relevant matters.

Project level Independent GRC

The project level independent GRC will review all unresolved cases involving SAP and EAP. The project
level GRC is headed by a retired District Judge/Professor. The composition of the Independent GRC will
be as follows:

Chair Person ­         Retired District Judge (nominated by the Bangladesh Judicial Association)/Senior
                       Professor of Law (nominated by the Law Department of a Public University)

Member Secretary ­ Head of RU, BBA

Member ­               Representative of Civil Society (nominated by NGO Forum/Public universities)

The provision of Independent GRC will further establish fairness and transparency in the resolution of
grievances by project affected persons. In case of technical nature of environmental issues, or any legal
matters, CSC environmental and social development specialists will advise the Independent GRC. In
specific cases, external legal advisors may be sought, if required. The Member Secretary will facilitate
the process with project policy and background information. All decisions at this GRC will be by a two-
third majority.

                out field level verifications.
        (iv)    Resolutions should be based on consensus among members, failing which the decision may
                be taken on majority vote.



                                                    75
        (v)   Any decision made by the GRC must be within the purview of RAP policy framework and
              entitlements.
        (vi) The GRC will not deal with any matters pending in the court of law.
        (vii) All three (3) members are required to form the quorum for the meeting of the GRC.


11.2    Procedures for Filing GRC Cases and Documentation

APs will be able to file their grievances without any fear and intimidation. Where required, the
implementing NGO will assist the APs in drafting the grievances. All grievances must be submitted in
writing to the Chair, GRC. The complainant may be represented by the AP him/herself or appointed agent
such as locally elected officials/legal advisors. The judgment made by GRC will be communicated to the
concerned AP in writing. If dissatisfied, and with the agreement of the GRC, the AP may request a further
review of the judgment of local GRC by the Project level Independent GRC. In such cases, the case will
be forwarded to the Independent GRC with all documentations. If the disputant still remain unsatisfied,
he/she can go to the formal court of law. Therefore, in this project the affected persons have multiple
options to deal with grievances regarding resettlement issues.

GRC procedures and operational rules will be publicized widely through community meetings and
pamphlets in the local language (Bangla) so that APs are aware of their rights and obligations, and
procedure of grievance redress.

All local GRC documents will be maintained by INGO for review and verification by CSC/MC, Co-
financiers and Panel of Experts. The BBA Field Office(s) will act as the Secretariat to the local GRCs. As
a result, the records will be up to date and easily accessible on-site.

The local GRCs will forward the unresolved cases to the project level independent GRC. Member
secretary of independent GRC will be responsible for maintaining the case records and will act as the
secretariat of the independent GRC. The GRC proceedings will be available for review by co-financiers
missions, members of POE and external monitors.

11.3    Approval of GRCs and Entitlements of GRC Members

All GRC members (both local and independent) will attend a training and orientation meeting prior to
commencement of their work. The training will be conducted by Project staff and consultants/resettlement
experts.

Local GRC members (except for BBA and NGO representatives) will be entitled to Tk. 300/- (three
hundred) per day as honorarium from the implementing NGO budget (i.e., reimbursable head). Light
snacks/refreshments will be provided during the meetings under the NGO budget. In case of day-long
meeting, GRC members may also be served lunch. Necessary stationery and other logistics will be made
available by the NGO.

Independent GRC will be housed at the PMO office in Dhaka. Members of Independent GRC (except for
member secretary) with receive a sum of Tk. 3000 (three thousand) per sitting from the project
resettlement budget as fees and local travel expenses. There will be at least one session every three
months to review cases received by independent GRC. The Independent GRC will be provided with all
documentations from the field offices for review purposes. If required, they will request the presence of
the complainants and may undertake field visit for verification purposes.

The social action plan (SAP) for the construction of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge includes land
acquisition and resettlement of project-affected persons, including restoration of their livelihoods, public
consultation and participation, public health, and gender equity in project planning, implementation and
monitoring. Addressing potential impacts on the charlands within a specific radius of the project site has
been a special safeguard issue for construction. SAP includes resettlement action plans (RAPs) for
various project components, public consultation and participation plan (PCPP), gender action plan (GAP),
charland management framework (CMF) and institutional and implementation arrangements. All these
components of the SAP have administrative, management and financial implications for the project-
executing agency. The cost of the plan includes financial assistance to the affected persons for mitigation
of adverse social and economic consequences of the project components as well as institutional support,
monitoring and capacity building of the executing agency.

12.2    SAP Implementation Schedule

The project involves many social development and mitigation plans beyond RAP implementation. Each
individual RAP has a defined implementation schedule. In addition, Table 11.1 provides an overall view
of the SAP implementation during and beyond the project construction period. This further illustrates
commitments of the Project in short, medium and long-term approaches to mitigation of project impacts
and social development activities beyond the project period. In sum, SAP activities will continue for 10
years or more in the project.

12.3    Cost of SAP
According to the plans (per 22 April 2010) implementation of SAP will involve a total cost of BDT
19,133.53 million (USD 279.33 million). It is proposed to implement the GAP under the RAPs and
therefore no separate budget has been allocated. The budget for CMMF will be proposed once the impacts
and mitigations have been identified. The cost of institutional and implementation arrangements to
implement non-RAP plans have not been included since these will largely depend on the budgets of the
respective non-RAP plans (Table 11.2).

12.4      Cost of Resettlement Action Plans (RAP)

12.4.1 RAP implementation budgets

RAP budgets cover the cost of mitigation measures to cover resettlement costs due to (i) Development of
resettlement sites (RAP-I), (ii) Construction of the main bridge and approach roads (RAP-II) and (iii) the
river training works (RAP-III). Except for RAP-I, the RAPs are based on provisional and estimated
inventory of losses and are subject to updating after finalization of detailed design and subsequent land
acquisition. Furthermore, there are additional areas to be acquired or leased for the establishment of
construction yards. Additional RAPs will be required to mitigate the additional impacts. As of 22 April
2010, total cost of the three RAPs is estimated at BDT 18,535.14 million (USD 270.59 million), see also
Table 11.3, next page.

12.4.2 Provisions for RAPs

RAP provisions include compensation and resettlement provided to PAPs in two separate forms:
          Compensation under law for acquisition of land that will be disbursed through the Deputy
          Commissioners.
          Additional assistance for resettlement of project-affected persons that will be disbursed directly
          by BBA.
The additional assistance for resettlement of PAPs is defined below:
Replacement Value Provisions for additional assistance (difference between replacement costs and
compensation under law) will be assessed on the basis of the actual compensation paid by the DCs. The
amount obtained from DC offices will be deducted from the replacement value of land, structures and
trees to calculate a balance for ensuring replacement value of land and property. The balance will be paid
to the owners of land and property directly by BBA with assistance from the INGO.

Dislocation Allowance for loss of land will be provided to all affected persons losing land. The
allowance will be BDT 100 for one decimal of acquired agricultural land, water body and fallow land,
and BDT 200 for homesteads and commercial land. The maximum amount of dislocation allowance will
be BDT 20,000 for all types of land. Lessees of land will be given a dislocation allowance of BDT 100 for
one decimal of land be up to BDT 5,000.
Allowance for Loss of Access to Eroded Land is an allowance for loss of access to eroded land if it
reappears by a natural process within 30 years after erosion. The allowance will be BDT 200 for one
decimal of acquired eroded land. The maximum amount of dislocation allowance will be BDT 20,000 for
any type of land per owner. Any lessees of eroded land will be entitled for this seizure allowance if there
is sufficient proof and the owner certifies. This allowance is well accumulated in the land replacement
cost and does not appear as item in the budget.
Transfer Grant All displaced households, businesses and physical cultural resources will have to move
their belongings and salvaged materials for which a transfer grant will be provided at the rate of BDT 07
per sqft for residential structures, and BDT 10 per sq.ft for commercial and physical cultural resource
structures.
Reconstruction Grant All displaced households, businesses and physical cultural resources (community
premises) will have to reconstruct their homes, business and community premises at permanent
alternative sites. A reconstruction grant will be provided to the affected persons at the rate of BDT 10 per
sqft for residential structures, and BDT 15 per sq.ft for commercial and physical cultural resource
structures.
One Time Special Assistance Affected female-headed households, disabled-headed households and
owners of self-operated commercial premises will be granted One Time Special Assistance at the rate of
BDT 5,000 each. The entitlement will be paid directly to the head of households and actual owners of the
commercial premises.
Income and Livelihood Restoration Grant Owners of affected self-operated commercial premises,
affected agricultural and commercial/ industrial wage labourers, renters and lessees of residential and

commercial premises and affected households losing more than 10% of their income due to acquisition of
land will be provided with income restoration grants (IRGs). The rates of the IRGs as per type of affected
persons will be as follows:
     Owners of affected self-operated commercial premises will receive a sum equivalent to 5% of the
     cash compensation under law received from DC offices for the affected commercial structure.
     Affected unskilled farm labourers will receive BDT 19,800 calculated on the basis of 90 days wage
     at the rate of BDT 220.
     Affected unskilled non-farm labourers will receive BDT 13,200 calculated on the basis of 60 days
     wage at the rate of BDT 220.
     Affected skilled non-farm labourers will receive BDT 18,000 calculated on the basis of 60 days
     wage at the rate of BDT 300.
     Affected renters and lessees of residential and commercial premises and persons losing more than
     10% of their family income due to acquisition of land will be entitled to a one-time lump sum of
     BDT 4,000.
Livelihood Regeneration and Social Risks Management The project will develop four resettlement
sites for permanent relocation of willing households and businesses covered in RAP-I. It is expected that
the self-relocated households will be absorbed individually or in groups in the neighboring villages to
share existing civic facilities. To accommodate them socially, improvement and extension of existing
civic facilities such as religious and educational institutions, access roads, water supply and drainage
systems, and power transmission lines will be supported by the project. The host villages absorbing the
displaced families in their vicinity will be provided with additional facilities or support to improve
existing facilities.
Affected physical cultural resources will also be supported for reconstruction and operation. A social
development fund (SDF) will be in place to provide long-term livelihood restoration support to the
affected wage earners and peasant families losing more than 10% of their productive asset to the project.
An STI-management program (under the PHAP) will be implemented during the construction period to
safeguard public health in the project-affected areas. The RAPs have budgetary provisions for (i) host
area development, (ii) re-establishment of CRPs, (iii) SDF, (iv) STI program, and (v) host area facilities.
Capacity Building of Executing Agency BBA has experience in handling the first and largest ever
implemented resettlement program in Bangladesh with the implementation of the Jamuna Multipurpose
Bridge Project. The Resettlement Unit (RU) of the BBA for the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project has
been manned with personnel having that vast experience at the head of RU. The RU contingent will
undergo extensive training and orientation through interaction with the DCs, the DD Safeguard Team, the
INGO and the co-financiers safeguard officers. An overseas tour has been provisioned for the BBA-RU
staff in the second year of implementation. However, the complex project context and the multi-source
data management under a harmonized safeguard policy requires continued refreshing of the process and
strategies for the RU staff. To this end the project will design and organize refreshers for both the RU
staff and the INGO once every year. A lump sum amount has been included under each RAP for capacity
building of RU staff.

12.4.3 Adjustments of the resettlement budget

The rates for cash entitlements for rehabilitation as well as allowances payable to affected households will
be adjusted annually, based on the actual annual inflation rate. BBA will determine the annual inflation
rates to be applied to all cash entitlements when the RAP is updated on the basis of the final inventory
verification after completion of the detailed engineering design and confirmation of the acquisition
boundary of the bridge end facilities and approach roads.




                                                    80
The INGO will assist BBA in preparing resettlement budgets for RAPs covering all eligible loss and
entitlements confirmed through joint verification and determination of replacement market price of land
and property by PVAC. This budget will be approved by BBA through appropriate authorities and made
available for placement with the RU account of the BBA as per requisition from the Superintending
Engineer heading the RU.

12.5    Cost of Non-RAP Plans

12.5.1 Gender Action Plan
Since GAP implementation measures are fully mainstreamed within project activities, there is no separate
implementation budget. The services of the national gender adviser, to guide and provide capacity support
to implementing partners with respect to GAP implementation, are included in the budget of the
supervision consultant (safeguards unit).

12.5.2 Public Health Action Plan
The budget for implementation of PHAP includes all expenses such as capital and running costs, staff
salary, office accommodation, services and activities, training, computer/software, transport, field
expenses and other logistics necessary for field activities, data collection, processing and analysis for
monitoring and evaluation work etc. The proposed PHAP resource requirement amounts to BDT 607.38
million (USD 8.68 million), see Table 11.4.

12.5.3 Public Consultation and Participation Plan
The budget for implementation of the consultation and participation processes under the PCPP has been
included in the SAP. In addition, a total of BDT 5,000,000 will be allocated to organize Annual Project

claims from the charland communities. Given the extreme uncertainty of erosion and accretion in the
flood plan, a 5-year development plan will be developed within a 20-year perspective for implementation
purposes. The 5-year plan and experience will be reviewed for subsequent planning and development.
This 5-year adaptive approach will address the changing impacts of the project and needs of the charland
communities. A budget covering the mitigation measures cannot be developed without understanding the
impacts and risks. According to the hydrological model, there will be no project impact on the charlands.

12.5.5 Institutional and implementation arrangements
Institutional and implementation arrangements cover the cost of institutional arrangements for
implementation of RAP plans and for capacity building of the executing agency including recruitment of
consultants to strengthen the safeguard staff. Recruitment of a national safeguard manager and senior
resettlement specialists to strengthen the capacity of the safeguard division of the BBA is well underway.
