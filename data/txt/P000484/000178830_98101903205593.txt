SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Despite substantial French aid, educational development in Chad
has been slow, partly due to financial constraints and partly to the phy-
sical conditions of the country.  Enrollments in primary and secondary
schools are 33% and 2% respectively of the appropriate age groups. Pri-
mary schools are lacking in accommodation and equipment; secondary schools,
though better provided, are Eew.
ii.       The proposed project would be the second education project in
Chad assisted by the Association. The first project, Credit No. 126-CD,
signed in August, 1968, provided US$1.8 million to assist the establish-
ment of a teacher training college at Moundou and an agricultural tech-
nician training center at Fort Lamy. After a slow start, mainly due to
Government inexperience in dealing with IDA projects, its implementation
is now improving.
iii.      The proposed project would provide:  (a) the replacement of
the technical secondary school at Fort Archambault by new construction at
Fort Lamy where technician and craft training would be carried out in
close cooperation with the industries served; (b) the remodelling of
the vacated school buildings at Fort Archambault to train workers for the
areais developing agricultural industries; and (c) the transfer to
Fort Archambault of the agricultural technician training center original-
ly intended for Fort Lamy and forming part of the first education project
under Credit No. 126-CI). The transfer of this center is feasible because
of the delay in the execution of the first project; it is still in the
design stage. Its re-location would accord with Government policy of de-
centralization of higher education facilities and is justified by recent
agricultural developments in the region.
iv.       At present only eleven percent of the pupils enrolled at the
secondary level receive formal training directed to agricultural, commer-
cial or indTIstrial employment.  The proposed project would improve and
expand exi.t 'n. f:acilities for training technicians, craftsmen and semi-
skilled workers to meet the needs of industry, agriculture and govern-
ment service  utiring the 1970's and effect replacement of some of the many
expatriates now holding lower and middle-level technical and managerial
posts.
v.        The proposed project would assist in financing:
(a)  construiction and equipment of a secondary technical school
at 1ort lamy;
(b) construction aanid additlonal equiprment for the conversion
of the existing technical secondary school at Fort Archam-
bault lnto a vocational training center;

(c)  transfer of the agricultural technician training center,

vii.       The project unit established within the Ministry of Education for
the first education project (Credit No. 126-CD) would be responsible for
the implementation and overall supervision of the proposed project. Accom-
modation schedules and lists of equipment and furniture have been reviewed
by the Association and are acceptable. The buildings would be designed by
consultant architects and constructed by private construction firms. Con-
tracts for civil works and procurement of furniture and equipment would con-
form to Bank/IDA guidelines on international competitive bidding. Domestic
manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be accorded a preferential
margin equal to the existing rate of import duty or to 15% of the c.i.f.
cost of competing imports, whichever is lower.
viii.      The proposed project is estimated to cost US$3.1 million equival-
ent, with a foreign exchange component of US$2.1 million equivalent. Con-
struction is expected to be completed within four years of signing the cred-
it agreement.
ix.       The project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$2.2 million to
Chad which would be equivalent to about 72% of the estimated total proj-
ect cost.



1.  INTRODUCTION
The Request
1.01      In April, 1967 the Government of Chad requested financial assis-
tance for a primary teacher training college at Moundou, an agricultural
technician training center at Fort Lamy and an extension to the existing
technical secondary school (lycee technique industriel) at Fort Archambault.
After appraisal in May, 1968, the first two items were included in a first
education project under Credit No. 126-CD but the third item was insuffi-
ciently prepared. Implementation of this first project proceeded slowly at
first due to the Government's lack of experience with IDA projects but the
position is now improving.
1.02      Following a Unesco technical education mission in February, 1968,
the request for assistance to the technical secondary school was resubmitted
in May, 1969 and appraised in September, 1969. It was found that most of
the existing buildings were either unsuited to their purpose or needed major
repair and that the objectives of the school could be better met at Fort
L.amy, the center of the country's industrial activity. The cost of new con-
struction would be of the same order as that of renovation and extension at
Fort Archambault.
1.03      After lengthy discussions with IDA, the Government accepted the
recommendation of the appraisal mission as to the location of the technical
school but expressed concern with regard to the concentration of education-
al facilitîes at Fort Lamy and requested the transfer of the proposed agri-
cultural technician training center to Fort Archambault, in an agricultural
area with developments in cotton growing, sugar production, leather goods,
and meat-canning.  The transfer would be in accord with the Government's
plan for regionalization and would be feasihle because, as a result of some
delay in implementatlon of the first education project, the school was still
in the desigrn stage. After further discussions with the Government and a
careful revlew of the situation, the proposal was agreed. On balance, there
is some ad'aiitaw,e în the Fort Archambault site and the additional costs due
to re-desi.gn are small.  The Government further requested the construction
and equipment of a vocational training center at Fort Archambault to train
factorv and office workers for the industries planned in that area. In so
far as was possible, the existing buildings and equipment of the secondary
technical school would be used for this purpose.
1.04      In September/October, 1970, a mission consisting of A. Stam
(architect), J. C. Jones (technical educator, consultant) and A. Magnen
(agricultural educator, Unesco) visited Chad to appraise these proposals.
Liaison between the mission and the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation
(F.A.C.) was provided by Mr. J. Raison (F.A.C.).



-2-
1.05      The proposed project would improve and expand the training of
technicians, craftsmen, and semi-skilled workers in the fields of indus-
try, commerce, and agriculture. It would consist of:
(a) construction and equipment of a technical secondary
school at Fort Lamy;
(b)  construction  and additional equipment for the conver-
sion of an exlsting technical secondary school at Fort
Archambault lito a vocational training center;
(c)  transfer of the agricultural technician training center
(Credit No. 126-Ci) from Fort Lamy to Fort Archambault;
(d)  a study of young-farmer training schemes; and
(e) continued operation of the existing project unit for
the implementation and overall supervision of the proj-
ect.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$3.1 million and the foreign
exchange component at US$2.1 million.
Socio-Economic Background
1.06      Bordered by Cameroon, Nigeria, Libya, Sudan, and the Central Afri-
can Republic, the Republls of Chad covers an area of 1,284,000 km2 of which
about one-half is desert and the rest mainly savannah. One of the largest
African countries, it is also one of the poorest; it is landlocked and has
few natural resources.  its 3.6 million population has been growing at about
2% p.a. Emigration is high, with about three-quarters of a million Chadians
living in neighboring countries. About nine-tenths of the population are in
rural areas; only nine towns have populations in excess of 10,000. Fort Lamy
with 135,000 inhabitants is the main economic and administrative center.
The official language is French but Arabic is widely spoken.
1.07      The traditional economic sector, which includes livestock and cot-
ton production, accounts for about 62% of the national income with subsis-
tence agriculture as the main contributor. Modern agriculture, services and
light industry are expanding but are handicapped by lack of transportation
facilities, small size of the market, lack of trained manpower, and by insuf-
ficient water and power resources. The economy remains predominantly agri-
cultural with about 90% of the economically active population employed in
agriculture and almost all exports coming from that sector; cotton alone ac-
counts for more than 60% of Chad's exports. The Gross Domestic Product per
capita is about US$70 (1967). In the absence of reliable data, it is not
possible to assess the actual rate of economic growth but it does not seem
to be considerably higher than the population growth rate. The economic
growth potential of the country in the near future is not promising.



II. THE EDUCATION SYSTEM
Education and Training
2.01      Educational development in Chad has taken place under conditions
of considerable difficulty. Contributory factors are the lack of homo-
geneity of regions strongly influenced by bordering countries, the nomadic
life of part of the population, the difficulties of internal transport and
communication particularly during the wet season, a lack of experience in
educational administration and financial constraints. With French assis-
tance, experience in education is being built up and expansion is taking
place but progress has been slow. The literacy rate is only 7% and the en-
rollments in priuary and secondary schools as proportions of the relevant
age grotips are only 33% and 2%, respectively.  l/  While conditions vary
from area to area many primary schools are of poor construction, lacking
furniture and teaching equipment. With foreign help, secondary schools are
generally of good standard but are few in number.
2.02      The Ministry of Education (Chart 1) is responsible for formal edu-
cation at the primary and secondary levels. Certain other government depart-
ments, particularly those of the Ministries of Agriculture and Labor, have
separately administered training schools. Liaison between the Ministry of
Planning and the Ministry of Education is effected through a National Center
for Educational Planning.
2.03      The educational structure, based upon the French system, has six
years of primary education followed by post-primary alternatives of varying
lengths and purpose (Chart 2). Data on enrollments and output given in An-
nex 1 support the enrollment percentages referred to in para. 2.01 above.
figures include a high proportion of repeaters and over-age pupils,
estimated at 30 percent and 25 percent respectively for the primary schools.
Only 10 percent of the entrants complete the course.
2.04      At the secondary level less than 11 percent of the total enroll-
ment of some 10,000 pupils are attending technical or commercial courses.
The technical secondary school at Fort Archambault (129 pupils) offers
three-year craftsman and technician courses following the second and fourth
years of first-cycle secondary education, respectively. The results at
both levels call for considerable improvement. The technician course re-
quires better science and technological facilities while the craftsman
course does not yet include third-year industrial experience as was planned.
1/   Comparable figures are:                        Primary           Secondary
Sudan                   33                   6
Cameroon                82                   6
Ivory Coast             63                   6



-4-
Shortage of workshop materials prevents the full use of the eqtuipment and
adversely affects instruction. The secondary commercial school at Fort Lamy
(457 pupils) offers courses similar in structure to those of thte technical
school with outputs at the clerical and hlgher secretarial levels.
2.05      The Ministry of Labor one-year practical courses for office and
semi-skilled factory workers at the Fort Lamy vocational training center
have an enrollment of 144 full-time students (including up-grading courses)
and 73 part-time students.
2.06      Agricultural training is offered at first-cycle secondary level
at the Ba-Illi School (151 students). A regional veterinary and animal
husbandry institute for Central Africa, located near Fort Lamy, offers a
three-year secondary course for technicians in animal husbandry; it lias
43 students, half of them Chadians. Practical training for about 500
young farmers is offered in seven school farms; other pilot schemes have
also been initiated recently.
2.07       In primary education the teachers are all Chadian but most have
been trained at the "monitor" level only; one and two-year courses are giv-
en in schools at Bongor, Fort Lamy, and Fort Archambault. The last-named
school also trains assistant teachers but this work is to be transferred to
the Moundou teacher training college, part of the first education project.
To improve the quality of teaching and to reduce class sizes, (the pupil-
teacher ratio is more than 60 to 1), the Government may establish two more
primary teacher training colleges. Higher teacher training is undertaken
at Brazzaville by arrangement with the Congolese Government.
2.08      Secondary education owes a great deal to French bilateral assis-
tance but this is unlikely to exceed its present level and so enrollment
at the secondary level is expected to remain relatively static at 2% of
the age group. The present small output is attracted to the better-paid
posts in government administration and industry and few graduates take up
teaching.  Considerable expansion is required if the higher ranks in gov-
ernment, industry, and the teaching service are to be Chadianized.
Education Finance
2.09      Financial responsibllity for education rests primarily with the
central government.  Community contributions have been mainly in kind:
labor and materials for constructing primary schools. Private schools run
by religious organizations account for about 11% and 6% of primary and se-
condary school enrollment respectively and are subsidized by the government.
About 15% of the government budget is spent on education. 1/ The public
1/   Comparable figures for 1967 are Sudan 19%, Ivory Coast 18%, Gabon 16%
and Uganda 28%.



- 5 -
funds are inadequate and are supplemented by substantial foreign aid schemes,
mainly from France.
2.10      Local and foreign-aid expenditure on education increased by 75%
between 1963 and 1968 (from CFAF 1,750 to 3,061 million) or by 12% annual-
ly; external assistance accounted for 43% of total expenditure during the
period (Annex 2). Almost three-fourths of foreign aid was spent on recur-
rent expenditures and accounted for 36% of the total recurrent cost of edu-
cation. All but 7% of capital expenditure in education during these years
was financed by foreign aid.
2.11      In the near future, Chad looks mainly to foreign grants and loans
for its capital expenditure on education. For recurrent expenditure the
government plans to reduce gradually its dependence on assistance from
abroad.  Recurrent expenditure financed from local sources is expected to
increase by 7%-8% p.a. in the 1970's; this rate, considerably lower than the
rate of 12.5% attained in the years 1963-70, is determined by limited growth
expectations of the economy and the continuous deficits in the government's
budget.
2.12      The draft Five-Year Development Plan (1971-75) allocates to edu-
cation the sum of CFAF 8,122 million out of a total investment sum of CFAF
48,650 million. The education total is sub-divided into:
Primary education          2,782 million
Secondary education        1,981 million
Technical education        2,269 million
Other expenditure          1,090 million
Total           8,122 million CFAF



III. MANPOWER NEEDS
Labor Force and Labor Market
3.01      About 1.4 million or 40% of Chad's total population ls considered
economically active.  The majority is engaged in subsîstence farming and
cattle-raising, sectors characterized by extensive underemploynient and sea-
sonal unemployment.  Of the estimated 51,000 persons employed in non-agri-
cultural activities about 33,000 are salary and wage-earners and the rest
self-employed workers, craftsmen and shopkeepers. Civil services ermploy
about 11,000 while another 7,000 are in the army and the police. Wage em-
ployment in the private sector and government organizations amounts to about
15,000 of whom 53% are unskilled workers and domestic servants (Annex 3).
3.02      The educational background of the Chadian labor force is very low,
reflecting low school enrollment ratios of the past.  About 13% of those
employed in the private sector and three-quarters of the technically trained
labor force are expatriates. Practically all Chadians with technical or
managerial qualifications are in government service. However, most of the
key administrative and technical services in the public sector depend heavi-
ly on personnel provided under foreign technical assistance schemes. The
estimated 45,000 expatriates manage the private sector of the economy and
man virtually all upper and middle level managerial and technical posts.
Although the government intends to make the country self-sufficient in
skills, it has not announced any plan to replace expatriates with local
staff.
3.03      The proper organization of the labor market is made difficult by
the small size of the wage-earning force. Unemployment among unskilled
workers leads to low wage levels whereas the need to draw upon expatriate
labor at the upper levels of employment gives rise to high salaries de-
termined by conditions prevailing in markets abroad, by personal contacts,
and by institutional arrangements.
Manpower Requirements and Shortages
3.04      The manpower requirements of the Second Development Plan (1971-75),
now in preparation, have not yet been analyzed in sufficient detail to per-
mit accurate forecasts of future employment and the needs for skills. Since
only a modest expansion of economic activity is expected in the coming years,
the labor requirements will also be modest. However, the small number of se-
condary school graduates (154 in 1969) who could eventually qualify for
senior positions in the private, government and education sectors, now held
by expatriates, indicates that it is necessary to increase the supply at
this level of the education system. At the level of unskilled workers, no
shortage is anticipated in any sector of the economy.



- 7-
Skilled and Semi-Skilled Workers
3.05      The modern sector of the economy employs at the skilled and semi-
skilled level about 4,000 workshop and 2,300 office staff. Fitters, turners,
motor mechanics and electricians are in short supply. According to employers,
there are some 80 vacant posts for skilled workers. At a replacement rate of
3M for retirement alone, the annual needs for the two groups of workshop and
office staff amount to 120 and 70 persons, respectively. The replacement of
expatriates and expansion of economic activity will create additional needs,
but lt is difficult to estimate them accurately at this stage; increasing
these figures to 200 and 120 is probably not an overestimate. The major
need in Fort Lamy is for craftsmen skilled in general and auto-mechanics,
in electrical work, and in modern construction. In Fort Archambault the
major needs are for maintenance and semi-skilled workers in the developing
agricultural industries, and for office secretaries, typists, and book-
keepers.
Technicians
3.06      At present, there are about 400 technicians of all fields employed
in various sectors of the economy; more than half are foreigners. The coun-
try faces an acute shortage of qualified engineering technicians. Demand fi-
gures show, for instance, that registered employment offers for about 30
electrical technicians annually could not be satisfied. One reason for these
vacancies is that employers are reluctant to hire Chadian graduates whose
practical training they consider deficient.  Hence, there is a need to modify
the training program and to establish closer links between the training sys-
tem and the employers.  The annual needs for regular replacement, expansion
and gradual replacement of expatriates is estimated at about 50-60 technicians,
most of them in general and auto mechanics and electrical engineering.
Agricultural Needs
3.07      The prospects for agricultural development in Chad depend inter
alia on a more efficient use of land. A basic requirement for expansion
and diversification of production and increased productivity in agriculture
is an effective extension service. Of about 800 field agents employed by
the Mintstry of Agriculture, more than half have had no technical training
an(d little or no general education while the majority of the rest have had
eight years of schooling or less. For the small number of higher level
agriculturists (post-secondary degree and diploma) that the country needs,
Chad depends on regional institutions in Cameroon, Senegal and the Central
African Republic. The crucial need is at the level of extension agents for
wlhich institutional training is not offered in the country. It is estimated
that Chad needs five to six agents for each of the 30 sub-districts or one
for every 2,000 families, about 150-180 in total.
3.08      The Agricultural Training Center included in the first IDA educa-
tion prolect (Credit No. 126-CD) would graduate 35 extension agents annually



- 8 -
after a three-year eourse at upper secondary level. They would fill exist-
ing vacancies and, at a later stage, would replace unqualified agents in
service. The needs for field assistants are adequately met by the existing
training center (a four-year lower secondary course) at Ba-Illi.
3.09      A number of pilot achemes for the training of young farmers have
been instituted in recent years. A comparative study of their effectiveness
should be undertaken before any expansion of the system is considered.

IV. THE PROJECT
General
4.01      The proposed project would assist the expansion and improvement
of education and training at the technician and craft levels in the fields
of industry, commerce, construction, agriculture and services. It would
assist in financing: (i) construction and equipment for new and existing
institutions as listed at (a) and (b) below; (ii) additional costs result-
ing from the transfer of the agricultural technician training center from
Fort Lamy to Fort Archambault as listed at (c) below; (iii) a study of
young farmer training schemes; and (iv) the operating expenses of a unit to
administer the project.

4.02      Technical Secondary School.  lhe project would establish a new tech-
nical secondary school at Fort Lamy to offer two training programs, one for
technicians .ani the other for skilled craftsmen.  Both programs are of three
vears duration, the craftsmen at grades 9-11 and the technicians program at
grades 11-13. tJach program would provide courses in three fields: general
imechanics, electricity, and automobile mechanics. With an annual intake of
65 and a total enrollment of 180 for each program, a total of about 55 tech-
iticians and 55 craftsmen per year should be produced. Provision would be
niade for outstanding students in the craftsmen program to transfer to the ap-
priate technician courses. The graduates of this school would meet urgent
skilled manpower needs of the country (paras. 3.05 and 3.06).
4.03      Curricula and syllabi would be determined in relation to the coun-
try's needs. Students in the craftsman program would spend most of the
third1 year of the course in industrial establishments to acquire practical
experience. Technician students would also spend part of their course in



- 10 -
gaining industrial experience. Successful students would receive the C.A.P.
(Certificat d'Aptitude Professionnelle) from the craftsman program and the
Bac. de T. (Baccalaureat de Technicien) from the technicians program. ro
upgrade the latter to the Bac. Tech. (Baccalaureat Technique) is not ad-
visable because it would orient the program to unlversity entrance require-
ments at the expense of middle-level technician training, the economy's
most urgent need. During negotiations, the government gave an assurance
that, for the present, the techniciants program will prepare students only
for the Baccalaureat de Technicien.
4.04      There is a sufficient number of first-cycle secondary school
graduates from which to recruit for the technicians program and enough stud-
ents completing the second year of secondary education to feed the craftsman
program. The existing teaching staff of 23 would need to be increased to 26
to meet the new requirements. The additional number would be recruited
either from among qualified Chadians or through technical assistance.
Scholarships would also be provided for upgrading some of the staff in ser-
vice. An assurance has been given by the government that steps would be
taken to secure the necessary technical assistance and provide further train-
ing of staff before project completion.
4.05      To ensure adequate liaison between the school and employers, a
school advisory council, to include representatives of industry, would be
established to assist in relating courses and curricula to the needs of
the economy and employment opportunities. The government has given assur-
ances that this council will be established sufficiently early to advise
on curricula and equipment.
4.06      Vocational Training Center.  The project would provide for the re-
modelling of certain existing buildings and for the additional construction
and equipment necessary to convert the technical secondary school at Fort
Archambault into a vocational training center producing semi-skilled office
and factory workers. Trainees would be 18 years of age or older, would have
completed a primary education and would sit an entrance examination involv-
ing attainment and intelligence tests. Ihe courses would be of 7 to 10
months' duration according to the subject taught.
4.07      The center would have a capacity of 120 student places and would
offer two industrial courses and one construction course for 20 trainees
each and two commercial courses for 30 trainees each.  It would provide in-
struction in: (i) general and automobile mechanics; (ii) electrical power
and installation work; (iii) carpentry and masonry; (iv) bookkeeping; and
(v) secretarial arts. Trainees who pass the course tests would be awarded
a government certificate. Employers would participate in the design of
curricula and courses through a representative advisory council to be estab-
lished for the center. The government has given assurances that this coun-
cil will be established before completion of construction. The center would
provide the economy with 120 semi-skilled workers annually (para. 3.05).
4.08      The center would need ten instructors of practical subjects and
related theory. The government has given assurances that it will train in



- il -
the country or abroad these instructors; scholarships available through for-
elgn assistance programs could be used for this purpose. The center could
not start before 1975, for the secondary technical school would not have va-
cated the site before completion of its new buildings in 1974.
4.09      Agricultural Technician Training Center.  The project would pro-
vide for the costs of transfer of this center from Fort Lamy to Fort Archam-
bault (para. 1.03). Construction and equipment for the center is provided
in IDA's first education project in Chad (Credit No. 126-CD) which original-
ly located the center at Fort Lamy; design work is complete but construction
for the center has not yet started. Fort Lamy is developing as the indus-
trial center of the country while the Fort Archambault region should become,
as the result of recent developments, a major agricultural area with cotton
as its main crop, and sugar and livestock as promising developments. Stud-
ents at the agricultural training center would have opportunities for prac-
tical training on farms adjacent to the center. Its location at Fort
Archambault would be in accord with the government's regionalization policy.
4.10      The center, with a capacity of 120 student places, would offer a
three-year program (grades 11-13) of theoretical and practical training.
Courses would be given in crop production, animal husbandry, agricultural
engineering, farm economics, and agricultural extension work. In the third
year of their studies the students would spend mnost of their time in super-
vised assignment on rural development projects. One hundred students would
be boarders and the rest day-students from the surrounding area. Boarding
is necessary because of the national character of the center and the lack of
housing facilities in the area. The center would provide the country with
about 35 agricultural technicians annually (para. 3.07).
4.11      The proposed project would provide for costs, additional to
those already included in Credit No. 126-CD, generated by: (i) modifica-
tion of plans and higher transportation costs consequent upon the transfer;
(ii) 28 additional boarding places; (iii) provision of power and other util-
ities; (iv) cost adjustments and contingencies because of delayed construc-
tion. Additional costs amount to aboutUS$156,000, raising the total cost
to US$810,"00.
4.12      Tlie present output of first-cycle general secondary schools plus
selected graduates from lthe lower secondary agricultural school at Ba-Illi
woulcl provide a sufficient number of qualified entrants for the center.
ihe eight instructors required for the center would be recruited among
qualifled Chadians and assisted by personnel from abroad.
4.13      Study of Young Farmer Training Schemes.  Farming schools of the
traditional type tend to produce government agricultural agents rather than
practtcing farmers and It is necessary to conslder other forms of training
for thie latter. Pilot schemes using such different methods as short cour-
ses, young farmers' associations and youth camps have been initiated in
Chad. A study to evaluate the results of these schemes should be undertaken



- 12 -
before they are expandedon a broader basis (para. 3.09). The study would re-
quire the services of an agricultural educator for three months and an econo-
mist for two months.

:=~  _2=c: ~     .       _ 
4.16       The foreign exchange component of US$2.1 million equivalent, rep-
resenting 69% of total project cost, has been calculated as follows:  (i)
building and site development, 67%; and (ii) furniture and equipment, 65%;
(iii) professional fees, pre-investment study and project administration,
90% .
4.17      Construction cost estimates are based on recent experience in
sîinilar projects in Chad at about US$185 per m2 plus 30% of building cost
for site development; these are among the highest in the world, the reason
beîng that more than 80% of construction material is imported from overseas
and is transported overland to Chad at high cost. Import duties are high
at 30% for civil works and average 40% for furniture and equipment. The
percentage for the site development is relatively high because of the need
for deep foundations as confirmed by detailed soil studies carried out in
connection wîth the first IDA education project. Furniture and equipment
costs, estimated by the government and the appraisal mission, are appro-
priate for these types of institutions.



- 14 -
4.18      The project cost includes a contingency allowance, the sanie for
foreign exchange and local currency costs, for unforeseen factors - such
as extra soil tests and earth moving and alternative designs and specific-
ations - equal to: 10% of estimated costs for buildlings, 10% for profes-
sional fees and 15% for site development, furniture and equipmnent. Costs
estimated in October, 1970, are expected to increase as in recent years
and an additional 14% contingency (based on 6% annual rate), for both for-
eign exchange and local currency costs, has been included for civil works,
furniture, equipment and professional fees (Annex 5). All contingencies
amount to 20.6% of total project cost including contingencies (8.8Z for
unforeseen factors, 11.9% for price increases), or to 26% of total project
cost excluding contingencies.
4.19      The schedules of accommodation, with a use factor varying from
75% to 82% (Annex 6), are economical.  Estimated costs per place for the
new project schools are relatively high for the reasons mentioned in para.
4.17; they are shown in Annex 7 along with unit costs for similar institu-
tions financed by the Bank Group in other countries.
4.20      Annual recurrent cost of the project institutions is estimated
at about 215 million CFA francs. With the foreign assistance it receives,
Chad would be able to meet this expenditure and its share of the capital
cost without compromising other high priority needs in education or in
other sectors.

V. IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT
5.01      Administration - Project Unit.  The project unit established
within the Ministry of Education for the first project (Credit No. 126-
CD) would also be responsible for the implementation and overall supervi-
sion of the proposed project and for liaison with the Association. Re-
placements in the posts of the project director or the education adviser
would be acceptable to the Association. The project unit would be pro-
vided with adequate supporting staff, including a full-time accountant,
and necessary facilities. The salaries of key personnel and operational
expenditures of the project unit are included within the project cost.
5.02      Professional Services.  For the design and supervision of con-
struction of the project institutions the Ministry of Education would
employ the services of consultant architects acceptable to the Associa-
tion and on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association. The
consultant architects appointed for the first education project (Credit
No. 126-CD) would remain responsible for the design and supervision of
the agricultural training center.
5.03      Land.  Of the three project institutions, the vocational training
center would be expanded on the existing site of the technical secondary
school. For the technical secondary school a suitable site, sufficiently
near to the commercial secondary school at Fort Lamy to permit close co-
operation between the two schools, has been proposed by the government.
For the agricultural training center a site some 10 kilometers from the
town of Fort Archambault has been suggested by the government; subject to
satisfactory results of soil tests the site is appropriate. The government
has given assurances that it will have title to all sites before construc-
tion begins and that it would obtain access to them for the consultant ar-
chitects as required.
5.04      Procutrement.  Construction work, and procurement and installa-
tion of furniture and equipment would be completed within four years from
the credit agreement signing (Annex 8). The buildings would be constructed
by private construction firms; there are several foreign construction firms
operating in Chad capable of carrying out the project. Contracts for civil
works and procurement of furniture and equipment would conform to the Bank/
IDA guidelines on international competitive bidding. Domestic manufacturers
of furniture and equipment would be accorded a preferential margin equal to
15% of the c.i.f. cost of competing imports or to the existing rate of import
duties, whichever is lower.
5.05      Disbursements.  The Association would disburse or reimburse:  (l)
the c.i.f. cost of imported furniture and equipment together with local
transportation and installation costs estimated at 74% of total cost of
furniture and equipment; (ii) the cost of professional services of the
young farmer study, and of project administration; and (iii) 84% of the



- 16 -
cost of civil works for the Agricultural Technician Training Center and 677
of the cost of civil works for the remaining project items. In the event
that expenditure should exceed the present estimated cost of US$3.1 million,
these percentages would be adjusted so that withdrawals from the credit would
not exceed US$2.2 million. Savings in any category would be available to
cover overrune in any other category. Untdisbursed anounts would be avail-
able for cancellation.



- 17 -
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During the credit negotiations, agreement was reached on the fol-
lowing principal points:
(a)  the programs to be offered at the technical secondary
school (para. 4.03);
(b)  provision of qualified staff for the technical secondary
school (para. 4.04) and the vocational training center
(para. 4.08);
(c)  advisory councils for the technical secondary school and
the vocational training center (paras. 4.05 and 4.07);
(d)  extension of the responsibilities of the existing project
unit to cover the proposed new project (para. 5.01); and
(e)  site acquisition (para. 5.03).
6.02       The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA cred-
it of US$2.2 million to Chad for a term of 50 years including a 10-year grace
period.
