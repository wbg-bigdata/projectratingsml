mEmORADUM AND RECOmmENDATION OF THs PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO SRI LANKA
FOR A HE&ILTH AND FAMILY PLANINGC PROJECT
1.        The following mmorandum and rvco mndation on a proposed develop-
ment credit to The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for SDR 12.9
million (US$17.5 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years' maturity and would help
finance a health and family planning project.
2.        Background.  Sri Lanka's health and family planning indicators rival
those of many middle-income countries. Life expectancy is 67 years for males
and 71 years for females. The crude death rate is 6 per 1,000 population.
Infant mortality is estimated at 32 per 1,000 live births. Over the past 27
years, total fertility has fallen by more than 40% from 5.4 to an estimated
3.0.  Since 1980 the country also has embarked on an ambitious Primary Health
Care (PHC) program emphasizing preventive care. However, the pace of
improvement has begun to slow as emerging constraints threaten the achievement
of national health and population goals.
3.        Four main problems namper health sector development:  (a) weak
management and declining efficiency of p.Ablic health services; (b) difficul-
ties in implementing the new PHC system as an effective vehicle to address
health problems and priorities; (c) the need for both explicit community
health objectives and strategies to deliver the appropriate mix of services;
and (d) how to modify the health financing system for proper targetting of
costs and subsidies.
4.        Current manifestations of these problems include an absence of
strategic and organizational planning for the sector, overly centralized
management and budgetary controls, and difficulties in recruiting and
deploying professional staff in the absence of manpower and career development
planning.  Skew _ service delivery patterns lead to bypassing of underused
lower-level facilities and overcrowding at expensive, specialized hospitals;
access to PHC remains uneven and inadequate. Annual drug and supplies losses
are estimated at 10-15% of stocks and arrangements for vehicle and equipment
maintenance are also weak.
5.        Family planning performance is well below its potential as evidenced
by extensive unmet demand and scope for generating more demand for spacing
methods. Considerable additional effort will be needed for Sri Lanka to
maintain its estimated 60X level of contraceptive prevalence in the face of
declining demand for sterilization and a projected net increase of 100,000
women of reproductive age annually, 1988-93. Improvements are needed in three
key areas: program management and coordination, program strategy and service
mix and demand generation.



-2-
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Association's role in the sector
is to assist Sri Lanka's efforts to: (a) develop and carry out policies,
strategies and programs to deal efficiently and effectively with main health
problems; and (b) reduce fertility to economically and socially sustainable
levels. The Association's strategy involves a blend of sector work. policy
dialogue and lending. Other health donors currently focus on development of
physical infrastructure, family planaing r_earch and operations, technical
assistance for PHC, child i unization, diarrhoeal diseases management and
development of a health research network. The project would be the Bank's
first Sri Lanka operation in the sector. It derives from the fank health and
population sector report (No. 5218-CE) of April 1986, and subsequent
discussions with Covernment on its findings. Support to the project would
position the Government to increase future donor responsiveness to identified
sector issues and would promote both concerted Government-donor approaches to
major health and family planning problems and better donor coordination.
7.        Project Objectives.  The project seeks to:  (a) strengthen
management of the Government heaith system at central and regional levels;
(b) increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the health logistics
system; and (c) promote lower fertility and increased maternal-child health
through increased and more effective use of modern and traditional child-
spacing m.ethods.
8.        Project Description.  The project would strengthen management irt the
Ministries of Health and Women's Affairs and Teaching Hospitals by assisting
the establishment of Human Resource Management, Financial Management and
Management Development and Planning Units. It also would support: (a) health
policy development through a health strategy and financing study and opera-
tional research; and (b) improved service delivery in two health regions where
management improvements would be tested and adapted for wider replication. In
logistics, the project would improve storage facilities and management systems
for drug and medical supplies distribution and would strengthen systems for
vehicle and equipment maintenance and repair. In family planning, the project
would assist strategic and service delivery planning and monitoring, as well
as communications efforts to generate additIonal demand for spacing methods
complementing a major service delivery effort financed by the United Nations
Fund for Population Activities. The project would be carried out over five
years. It provides funds for civil works; vehicles, furniture, equipment and
supplies; training and technical assistance; studies; special service delivery
programs in two health regions; family planning grants to non-government orga-
nizations; production and dissemination of family planning messsages through
mass media, project coordination and incremental operating costs. The total
project cost is estimated at US$21.39 million equivalent, with a foreign ex-
change component of US$5.74 million (271). It includes US$260,000 in Project
Preparation Facility financing and US$100,000 equivalent in retroactive fi-
nancing of pre-project costs incurred after September 30, 1987, principally
for preparation of site plans and surveys, working drawings, fixtures and
fitting lists and detailed cost estimates for construction of drug storage
warehourses. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan appear in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement
sch tdule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events appears in Schedule C. Two maps are attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 7050-CE dated March 25, 1988, is distributed separately.

9.        Actions Completed as Conditions of Negotiations--(a) Government
establishment of nev units and posts in both health ministries for human
resources and financial management, for Management Development and Planning
Units and creating of two comunications posts in the Population Division of
the Ministry of Plan Implementation (MOPI); (b) Ministry of Health possession
of 30 sites for community health center construction; (c) Government prepera-
tion of site surveys and plans, preliminary floor plans, fixture and fittings
lists and construction cost estimates for major logistics facilities to be
funded by the project; and (d) Government agreement to maintain Inter-
ministerial Steering Conittee for the project under terms of reference
satisfactory to IDA. Conditions of Effectiveness--Staffing of (a) Deputy
Dire:tor-General and Director posts in project-funded health management units,
(b) two communications and one research post in MOPI's Population Division and
(c) project coordinator's post in MOPI. Assurances Received at Negotiations--
(a) by September 30 of each year, Government furnishing of work plans for pro-
ject-funded tcaining and health policy research for subsequent calendar year;
(b) by August 31, 1992, Government to complete health strategy and financing
study under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, discuss results with IDA
and implement recommendations on which it and IDA agree; (c) by August 1,
1989, Government to prepare terms of reference satisfactory to IDA fo- special
service delivery programs in two health regions; (d) Government would enter
into agreements with non-government organizations satisfactory to IDA govern-
ing the use of grant family planning funds under the project, and (e) Govern-
ment to carry out project reviews under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA
in third and fifth project years, discuss results with IDA and develop and
carry out an action plan to implement agreed changes in project design and
operations.
10.       Benefits.  The project would develop increased capab:lities for
health management and planning; increased absorptive capacity in the sector;
more cost-effective, efficient and equitable use of resources for health care,
and reduced fertility. These changes would in turn lead to improved health
status. Through reduced wastage and losses, the logistics comvonenc alone
would produce annual savings estimated at Rs3O million or more from the third
year of the project. Reduced fertility would benefit both individuals and
society. Low-fertility couples would enjoy lower risk of maternal and infant
morbidity and mortality. A 0 4 reduction in total fertility, to which the
project would contribute, would enable Sri Lanka to reach replacement fer-
tility five years earlier than currently anticipated.
11.       Risks.  The project faces two main risks: possible faltering Govern-
ment commitment to implementing management reform once the initial staffing
effort is completed and possible Population Division difficulties in forging
effective collaboration among concerned Government actors and voluntary
agencies for integrated family planning service delivery and communications.
To help counter the first risk, the project provides a combination of tech-
nical assistance and in-service training, for which details have been worked
out, at all critical levels of the health management system. Annual training
plans will be prepared and reviewed with IDA well in advance of execution.
The establishment of Management Development and Planning Units in both health
ministries also will help stabilize management processes and provide mecha-
nisms to adjust them as required. Strengthening the Population Division's



- 4 -
capacity for planning and iupleMntotion will *nable it to coordinate more
effectively with concerned agencies on population matters. The use of work-
shops as a principal mechaniss to develop family planning and communications
strategies will promote inter-agency consensus on goals and agency roles.
Woreover, the aid-term project review will serve as a vehicle to identify
shortcomings in initial project assumptions and operations and make
appropriate course corrections.
12.       Rocomendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would co_-
ply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recomend that the
Executive Diractors approve the proposed credit.
