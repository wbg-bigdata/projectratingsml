I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Sector Strategy and Performance
Background
1.01      Agriculture is constrained in Algeria by difficult climatic and
geological conditions, and about 80% of the total land area is unproductive.
Generally, the richest agricultural areas are located in a narrow band in the
north, where annual rainfall (500-1,000 mm) permits growing fruits, vegetables,
industrial crops, and high yield wheat varieties, and where the ainount of
fallow land is lowest.  Areas in the 300-500 mm rainfall zone located between
the Northern zone and the desert, depend on a rotation of cereals and fallow.
Further south in the Steppe the population is almost entirely dependent on
sheep and goat production. Overall, forest and alfa grass (Stipa tenacissima)
cover about 4% of the land area, pastureland used for grazing of livestock
about 13%, and cultivable land about 3%. Of the roughly 8 million ha of
cultivable land, 5 million ha were utilized in 1976, and the balance left
fallow. The cropping pattern included 43% winter cereals (wheat, barley, rye),
41% fallow, 5% fruit trees, 4% forage crops, 3% vineyards, 2% vegetables,
1% pulses and the balance under industrial and other crops.
1.02       In 1977, despite its relatively narrow resource base, agriculture
employed about 43% of Algeria's total active population of 4 million and 60%
of Algeria's 17.3 million people lived in rural areas. However, the rapid
growth of the industrial, hydrocarbon and urban services sectors, along with
the emphasis given by Government to industry, and improvement in housing and
social services in urban areas, has contributed to high migration from rural
to urban areas. During the past ten years population growth averaged 3.2%
p.a., with growth of urban population equal to 5.1% p.a., and that of rural
population 2.0% p.a.
1.03      Government efforts to increase employment opportunities in non-
agricultural sectors were relatively successful, with 359,000 jobs created
during 1974-1976 or an employment growth rate of 6.8% p.a. Unemployment in
non-agricultural sectors fell from 17% of the work force in 1973 to 10% in
1976. In agriculture, employment creation was considerably slower. The num-
ber of permanent jobs rose by 43,000 from 1973 to 1976 at a growth rate of
1.6% p.a., while seasonal employment increased by about 0.3% during the same
period. Agricultural underemployment is high, with estimates ranging from 25%
in the self-managed sector (para 1.05), to 60% of the total agricultural work
force. Despite this, there is evidence of localized shortages of manpower
during parts of the year when agricultural activity peaks. In addition, it
has been the younger and better workers who have left the agricultural sector.
Sector Objectives and Investment Strategy
1.04      At the time of independence, Algeria was a predominantly agrarian
society with a very limited industrial base. The basis of independent
Algeria's economic policy has been the promotion of rapid industrialization
combined with increasing the country's economic independence. Structural



reforms were undertaken to reduce the dependence of the economy on foreign
interests and on trade with France, the principal of which was the applica-
tion of central planning to the economy. In parallel, efforts were made to
develop education and training to meet the manpower needs of the strategy.
The goal in agriculture, in addition to structural reform, was to shift from
the export orientation developed during the colonial period to meeting domes-
tic food requirements. However by assigning paramount importance to achieving
the structural reforms such as establishing self-managed farms, "Offices" and
the cooperatives of the agrarian revolution, which are discussed in the follow-
ing paragraphs, insufficient emphasis was given to agricultural investment,
incentives and productivity.
1.05      The Self-Managed Farms.  Just before independence, about 20,000
properties on 2.4 million ha were owned by Europeans. There were 630,000
Algerian properties covering about 7 million ha (including pastureland).
Average property size was 124 ha and Il ha respectively. European-owned farms
were found on the better land with the highest rainfall, mostly within a
narrow strip in Northern Algeria. Employment on European farms, both seasonal
and permanent, totalled about 250,000. These farms used modern farming
techniques, considerable machinery and modern inputs. Production was directed
mainly to the export market, with vineyards and orchards most important. Land
owned by Algerians was generally of lower quality, and unevenly distributed.
Property was fragmented and traditional farming techniques were predominant.
Production was directed towards local consumption. Beginning before indepen-
dence in 1962, the European landowners left the country, and management of
their farms was taken over by the farm workers. Their land was nationalized
in 1963 and right to use it in perpetuity was given to the workers grouped
into large worker "self-managed" farms. The European properties were in most
cases consolidated so that about 2,000 "self-managed" farms were created on
about 2.1 million ha of cultivable land. About 180,000 permanent workers are
presently employed on these farms. A manager was appointed by Government to
each self-managed farm in order to provide technical assistance and to imple-
ment Government instructions. The self-managed farms continue to use produc-
tion techniques similar to those employed by the previous European landowners.
The self-managed farms are only partly autonomous, implementing the investment
and operating plans provided them by Government. These plans are derived from
a centralized planning process previously emanating from the Central Govern-
ment, but recently decentralized considerably to the Provincial level.
1.06      Marketing and Credit.  A major structural change begun in the 1960's
was the creation of Government owned marketing and input supply "Offices",
each specializing in a product or group of products. The marketing and input
supply "Offices" have required several years to organize, and in many cases
have not provided adequate service. Another structural change involved the
consolidation of the local assets of the European dominated banking system
into the Government owned "Banque Nationale d'Algerie" (BNA) Banque Algerienne
de Developpement (BAD) and other nationalized banks. However, credit allocated
to agriculture was reduced to low levels, contributing to the lack of replace-
ment of equipment in agriculture during the 1960's. Agricultural marketing
and input supply centers ("Cooperatives Agricoles Polyvalentes Communales de
Services", or CAPCS) were established during the 1970's and managed by staff



appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture. By 1977, CAPCS had been established
in 654 of Algeria's 703 communes. The CAPCS sell inputs to farms and market
agricultural output; primarily fruit, vegetables, and fodder to the "Offices."
The objective is to bring the marketing and input supply function close to the
farm.
1.07      Cooperatives of the Agrarian Revolution and Private Sector.  Further
structural changes took place in the 1970's. The first was the "Agrarian
Revolution" in which state and communal land, as well as land expropriated
from absentee landowners and from the largest private farmers was distributed
to landless peasants. Most beneficiaries were organized into production
cooperatives. By 1978, about 7,000 cooperatives had been created allotting
one million ha, including 120,000 ha of pastureland, to 100,000 beneficiary
families. These Agrarian Revolution Cooperatives, together with 2,000 self-
managed farms, form the socialist sector holding a total of about three
million ha of cultivable land. The remaining private sector supports about
700,000 families on 4.8 million ha of cultivable land. Private livestock
owners and farmers also exploit approximately 31 million ha of arid pasture-
land, primarily in the Steppe Region.
1.08      Agricultural Planning.  During the 1960's agricultural planning
was weak, principally due to manpower shortages, but it became more organized
with the beginning of the first Four Year Plan (1970-1973). There has now
been a partial decentralization of the planning process from the Central
Government to the Wilaya (Provincial) Government level, and the creation of
crop and livestock specific "institutes" at the national level which undertake
agricultural development, including applied research, demonstration and exten-
sion. For agriculture, decentralization has meant increased responsibility
for planning by staff of the Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Revolution
in Provincial headquarters, assisted by the institutes. Goals for agriculture
under the Second Plan, which are likely to apply for the Third Plan, included:
(a) continuation of the shift out of food exports to food
self-sufficiency;
(b) diversification of crop production;
(c) improvement of rural revenue, rural infrastructure, and
development of rural employment opportunities;
(d) improvement of agricultural marketing and input supply; and
(e) relative improvement of the condition of the poorest groups
in the rural sector.
The Third Plan is likely to continue to emphasize these goals and to put
greater emphasis on decentralization of planning and project execution and on
development of the private agricultural sector which has been neglected
(para 1.09).

Agricultural Investment and Performance
1.09      Despite ambitious national goals for agriculture and the relative
importance of the sector for the Algerian economy, agriculture has been allo-
cated small and declining shares of investment budgets: 15% under the First
Plan (1970-1973), and 11% under the Second Plan (1974-1977). Low priority
accorded to agriculture for building materials, equipment, import licenses,
and qualified personnel, as well as administrative delays in beginning proj-
ects and allocating credit, caused the sector to use up an even lesser pro-
portion of national investment funds: 10% under the First Plan, and 7% under
the Second Plan. Moreover, during this period of structural reform, invest-
ment in agriculture was nearly exclusively directed towards the socialist
sector. The private sector, with 62% of the land, received less than 5% of
credits to agriculture between 1972 and 1975.  Investments designed to satisfy
social objectives in agriculture were relatively successful, with the creation
of Agrarian Revolution Cooperatives, rural schools, dispensaries, roads, and
socialist villages, and the creation of CAPCS. Among productive investments,
shortfalls were most striking for irrigation schemes, where less than 50% of
targeted areas were developed. As a result it is hardly surprising that the
performance of the sector has been disappointing. Agriculture's share in GDP
declined from 10% during the First Plan to 7% during the Second Plan, and
agricultural production lagged behind the large strides taken by the hydro-
carbon and industrial sectors.
1.10      The cropping pattern has changed significantly over time as export
oriented crops such as grapes and olives have been replaced with domestically
consumed foodstuffs. As production of most crops in Algeria is highly vari-
able in response to variation in climatic conditions, it is difficult to
discern marked trends in yields. After rapid progress in soft wheat yields
in the 1965-1973 period, due to an increased area of improved varieties,
soft wheat yields reached a plateau, but there has been no long term improve-
ment in durum wheat production, although yields increased somewhat in the
1970-1976 period. Total grain production failed to keep pace with population
growth, necessitating increasingly large imports. Due to changes in the area
of crop, production of vegetables, pulses, some fruits (particularly cherries,
pears, and peaches), industrial tomatoes, has increased over the 1970-1977
period at an average rate equal to population growth. Production of several
industrial crops has tended to stagnate or decline, particularly cotton,
tobacco, and sugar beet, partly because of the deterioration of irrigation
facilities.
1.11       But food production failed to keep pace with demand due to higher
consumption levels brought about by improving standards of living. Food
imports increased rapidly over the 1970-1976 period, though with considerable
annual variation. Despite very high growth in imnports of non-agricultural
goods, the average proportion of foodstuff imports to total imports rose
from 14% to 17% between the First and the Second Plans. At the same time,
accentuating the deterioration in the agricultural balance of trade, exports
declined, as a result of lower production and of restrictions to the entry of
traditional exports of wine and vegetables in the Common Market. Thanks to
the increase in imports of foodstuffs, Algerians on average are provided with
adequate intakes of calories and proteins, although deficiencies appear among



- 5 -
the people living in urban areas and in the arid south.  Unless substantial
improvement takes place in the sector, however, or population growth abates,
the total food import bill is projected to increase by some 3.6% per annum in
real terms over the next ten years, representing an increasing claim over the
country's foreign exchange earnings.
B. Main Sector Issues
Incentives and Investment
1.12      The structural reforms leading to the establishment of the socialist
sector, and government supporting services have been largely completed. The
central issue now is how to make the sector more productive. The orientation
towards agricultural exports (chiefly wine) has been dropped, with few gains
in import substitution. If agricultural growth is to be accelerated, two
basic requirements must be met. First, adequate incentives must be created,
and second, more resources (investment and human) must be devoted to the sec-
tor, particularly to private farmers who own 62% of the cultivable land.
Farm Level
1.13       Socialist sector farms (including the self-managed farms and Agrarian
Revolution Cooperatives) must be given greater autonomy in financial decisions
as well as greater responsibility for repayment of credit obligations in order
to increase their incentive to make efficient use of investments. Increased
production incentives must be provided to workers on socialist sector farms,
including termination of the ceiling on profit distribution to laborers, an
increase in the percentage of profits distributed to socialist sector farmers,
more favorable producer prices relative to costs. Consistency of farm level
activity with Government plans could be assured through the more systematic
use of price policy. The present Government policy of increasing agricultural
prices relative to input prices should be continued in order to stimulate
production, reduce urban/rural income disparities and promote technical
innovation and the use of modern inputs by agriculture.
Supporting Services
1.14      Government Administration.  Over-centralization of Government ser-
vices still remains a serious problem, combined with a lack of coordination
between departments within MARA. They can best be resolved through (a)
investment and program coordination in regionally integrated projects and
(b) more decentralization of decision making from the Government administra-
tion to the level of the enterprise, farm and commune. The major constraint
on implementing these recommendations is the availability of qualified per-
sonnel. Although Algeria has undertaken an important training effort, the
scarcity of qualified staff would probably inhibit rapid decentralization at
all levels. Within the Ministry of Agriculture (MARA), in addition to present
training efforts, greater incentives must be provided to qualified personnel
to induce them to enter public service.



- 6 -
1.15      Research and Extension.  Algeria should confine its agricultural
research program to relevant and urgent production oriented questions and
insist on proper coordination between crop and livestock institutes. To
complement research activities Government should establish an agricultural
extension service, which should be systematically planned, implemented and
supervised. The service should assist all farmers including those in the
private sector. A Bank Technical Assistance Loan is assisti'ng Government
in the formulation of extension methods and system in the Sidi Bel Abbes
Region.
1.16      Marketing and Credit.  The major marketing issues involve the need
to give the private sector access to modern inputs and commodity marketing
structures, and to reduce scarcities of farm inputs and of agricultural
commodities.  Solutions involve expansion of the role and the facilities of
the commune level input supply and marketing cooperatives (CAPCS), increased
investment priority given to industries producing agricultural equipment and
inputs, reorganization of the marketing "Offices" and input supply interme-
diaries along market oriented as opposed to administrative lines and increased
flexibility provided to input supply intermediaries in importing inputs or
equipment when shortfalls occur in domestic production. The allocation of
agricultural credit should be decentralized to bank outlets at the commune
level. Moreover greater use should be made of contractual relationships
between farm units and public enterprises or cooperatives. Contracts could
facilitate the provision of credit and inputs to private farmers, with credit
repaid out of sales contracted with the CAPCS.
Irrigation
1.17      Irrigation potential is relatively untapped in Algeria, and most
irrigation structures which exist require rehabilitation. The largest devel-
opment shortfalls compared to Algeria's Development Plan have occurred in
the irrigation subsector. The administration responsible for water resource
development including irrigation has been reorganized and improvement in
quality and quantity of irrigation projects can be expected. The emphasis
in the irrigation subsector should be the rehabilitation of existing large
perimeters, and development or modernization of small scale irrigation
schemes. The potential for irrigated forage production, to overcome the
major constraint to livestock development which is inadequate feed, should
be exploited. National irrigation development requires a National Water
Master Plan, formulation of a new National Water Code, and reform of the
structure of water charges.
C. Bank Role
Sector Analysis
1.18      The Bank has recently prepared a sector report which is presently
under discussion in draft form with the Government. The report is based on
missions carried out in late 1977 and in early 1978, with the collaboration of



the Bureau National d'Etudes pour le Developpement Rural (BNEDER) in Algeria.
The views expressed in the report have already found wide agreement among
policy-makers in the sector. The report is complemented by a UNDP-financed
study, for which the Bank is executing agency, the aim of which is to set up
simulation models for the sector in order to assist Government in decision
making, and to establish a sector-wide monitoring system.
Project Pipeline
1.19      The Bank sector missions, described above, also identified a number
of agricultural projects for possible Bank financing, of which one is the
present Project. It has been proposed for early financing, since its success-
ful implementation is not dependent on policy changes. The Project will be
implemented by the Office National des Aliments du Betail (ONAB) (paras 2.17-
2.34), one of the main "Offices" under MARA. The Project will address several
of the issues raised in this chapter, coordination of crop and livestock
activities (para 1.15), strengthening of marketing through the CAPCS (para
1.16), increased livestock production (para 1.11) and reorganization of the
financial practices of the "Offices" (para 1.06).
1.20      A regional development project, which addresses directly the main
issues mentioned in this chapter, is under preparation for the Sidi Bel Abbes
Region. Project preparation is nearly complete but its finalization will
await acceptance by the Government of many of the recommendations of the
Bank's Sector Report. Other projects in the pipeline include irrigation
rehabilitation in the Lower Cheliff Valley (proposed for FY80) and projects
in fisheries, rural roads and forestry.
II. THE LIVESTOCK AND MEAT SUBSECTOR
A. Livestock Production
Zones of Production
2.01       Livestock is distributed through the three principal climatic
regions of Algeria. Apart from dairy cattle which are concentrated near to
the main urban areas, the lowest livestock numbers are to be found in the
littoral plain in the north, where with an annual rainfall of 500-1,000 mm,
conditions are more suitable for fruit and vegetable cultivation than for
livestock.
2.02      The greatest potential for livestock production lies in the High
Plateau and on the southern slopes of the Atlas mountains where rainfall
is between 300-500 mm. This area is primarily devoted to winter cereal
growing, mainly on large self-managed farms. It is referred to as the cereal
zone of the High Plateau in this report. The predominant rotation is wheat-
fallow-wheat. In 1976 some 3.4 million ha or 41% of the cultivable land was
under fallow, which provides some grazing for a sedentary sheep population,



- 8 -
and in the spring and summer also for transhumant sheep that move north from
the arid south. The sheep also graze the steep land which in the past has not
been cultivated. However with the spread of powerful tractors, cultivations
are now taking place in the dry summer, enabling a larger area to be prepared
for planting in the short autumn planting season. Moreover the steep land,
which used to be available for grazing, is becoming increasingly plowed up and
planted to cereals. Soils in this zone are alkaline, thin and friable, and
steeply sloping land is liable to erode when it is left bare.  A growing
reluctance on the part of the self-managed cereal farms is the risk of damage
from sheep grazing their growing cereal crops; this is another factor contri-
buting to reducing the sheep fodder available from stubble and fallow in this
zone. The sheep are not the only losers in this situation. The loss of
organic matter which the sheep used to contribute to the soil is resulting in
a loss of fertility and reduced moisture retention capacity of the soil, and
therefore lower cereal yields.
2.03       To the south lies the Steppe, which is a continuation of the High
Plateau and falls gently from the Atlas foothills out into the Sahara Desert.
Vegetation is typically semi-arid or arid desert low scrub, grazed by nomadic
sheep flocks. Average rainfall is less than 250 mm. Recently the wetter
northern fringes (300 mm) of the Steppe and the shallow valleys where moisture
collects, which have traditionally been reserved for dry season grazing, have
been plowed for cereal production. But cereal crops can seldom be harvested
and wind erosion destroys the land for future cropping or pasture, depriving
the sheep of much of its food supply. For generations the majority of Algeria's
sheep flock has migrated from the low rainfall arid Steppe in the early spring
to the moister plateau, returning to the Steppe in the autumn to spend the
winter. As a result of increased cereal cultivation over the last generation,
summer grazing in the High Plateau has been discouraged and a greater propor-
tion of the flock has remained throughout the year on the Steppe. The Steppe
has become heavily overgrazed, with a result that the quality of the pasture
is deteriorating, and carrying capacity is now becoming reduced. Visual
evidence supports the view that a cycle of degradation is underway.
Cattle Numbers and Production
2.04      Most of the cattle in Algeria are to be found in the wetter littoral
plain and the hills of Northeast Algeria. They are owned almost entirely by
small private farmers with relatively few head each. They are small, late
maturing animals used for both meat and milk. There is a steady increase in
the number of supply and marketing cooperatives helping to increase production.
Imported Friesian and Holstein cows (some 20,000 head in Algeria) have become
important on the self-managed farms and specialized dairy production is found
near large cities. Male progeny from these herds are fattened for beef pro-
duction as is indicated by the heavier carcass weights recorded for animals
slaughtered during the past two years (Table 2.1).
2.05       Statistics for the national cattle herd vary considerably, even
among different government bodies, and it has not been possible to satis-
factorily reconcile the estimates of meat production with the herd statistics.



- 9 -
The apparent percentage offtakes, shown in Table 2.1, would appear to be unrea-
sonably high indicating that the national herd is probably underestimated, or
less likely that meat consumption is overestimated (para 2.09). Assuming a 44%
weaning rate, 16% culling of mature males and females, a 4% adult mortality, a
more plausible offtake of 23% is obtained, which would indicate a national
cattle herd in 1978 of about 1.5 million. Cattle numbers increased over the
period 1970/72-1976/78 by about 3.2% annually and meat production over the
same period by 4.5%. However the rate of production increase has fallen
recently to about 3%.

/a   Source:  MARA/DPA who assume that 40% of total slaughter is unofficial.
2.06      It would appear that cattle numbers and meat production are both
increasing at least as fast as national population, and that MARA is already
encouraging active programs among cooperatives and self-managed farms. No
special production measures are therefore contemplated in the proposed Meat
Industry Project.
Sheep Numbers and Production
2.07      The three main breeds of sheep are the Ouled Djelal, the Rhumbi, and
the Hamra. Although they are all well suited to the hard conditions in which
they live, the Ouled Djelal appears to respond best to improved nutrition in
terms of liveweight gain and fecundity. As already noted the national sheep
flock is still in large measure transhumant, spending winter in the Steppe and
spring and summer in the cereal zone of the High Plateau (para 2.02-2.03).
Typical flocks of about 200 consist of about 60% mature females of which a
third are old unproductive ewes. Lambing takes place between October and
January with a weaning percent L/ of about 85% of the productive ewe numbers
1/   Number of lambs surviving to weaning age as a percent of the number of
ewes.



- 10 -
(60% of all ewes). The weaning percent is directly related to the condition
of the ewes at the time of mating, and as mating occurs between May and
August, when the flocks are normally on the High Plateau, the food supplies
in this zone directly affect the lambing percent. Lamb mortality is high,
usually about 20%, and is largely dependent on the food suppiy during winter,
when the flocks are on the Steppe.

2.08      As with cattle, statistics concerning the national sheep flock vary
greatly depending on the source. MARA's Animal Production Department esti-
mates presented in Table 2.2 assume that 50% of the total slaughter is
unrecorded. There is no doubt that mutton production has stagnated, and the
statistics for an individual abattoir (para 2.09) provide further support.
It seems probable that the main cause has been the reduction of locally grown
food supplies. Although the statistics show a regular increase in flock
numbers, it is likely that total flock numbers were underestimated in the
past, as nomadic flock owners are always reluctant to reveal their total
numbers. The apparent offtake percent in Table 2.2 appears to be unreasonably
high, particularly in the period 1970-73. Assuming 60% weaning overall and
7% mature deaths, a 26% offtake would be expected, suggesting a national flock
of around 13 million sheep at present.
B. Livestock Slaughter and Distribution
Domestic Meat Consumption
2.09      Animals are slaughtered in municipal abattoirs in urban areas, in
village slaughterhouses, and elsewhere in the country. Most families also
kill a sheep for the Muslim Aid-el-Adha feast. Statistics are only available
for the municipal abattoirs and from these total meat consumption has been
estimated. On this basis domestic red meat (beef and mutton) supply including
edible offal amounted to about 116,000 tons in 1978 as shown in Table 2.3.



- il -
Goats, horses, donkeys and camels are also sources of red meat but are ignored
in this report which principally concerns urban meat supply, although goat
meat is undoubtedly important in the rural areas, as is camel meat in Southern
Algeria.

/b   Includes 20% edible offal.
2.10        For the larger urban areas more reliable data exists.  Thus for
Algiers it is estimated that per capita consumption was about 8.8 kg in 1978,
and 11.4 kg in Oran. Slaughter in the Algiers municipal abattoirs and per
capita consumption of red meat has fallen since 1972 (Table 2.4), although the
total urban meat supply has not fallen much due to imports.

2.11      With increasing shortages of red meat, Government has made a major
and successful effort to increase poultry meat production (para 2.19) from
44,000 tons in 1972 to 72,000 tons in 1978. As a result per capita consump-
tion of white meat (poultry) has increased from 3.0 kg in 1972 to 4.0 kg in
1978, and consumption of red and white meat together has increased modestly.
Marketing and Distribution
2.12      Well over 95% of the cattle and sheep marketed in Algeria pass
through a well developed system of private dealers. In principle there are
two main types of operators, "maquignons", who deal in live animals, and
"chevillards", who buy live animals, slaughter them, and sell the meat to
retail butchers, but in practice many of the activities may be carried out
by the same persons.  Most traders are small scale and many are part-time
operators. Many chevillards also have their own retail butcher shops. As
a consequence of the large degree of overlap between the different stages of
marketing, it is difficult to establish the margins at any particular point.
However, the overall margins between sales of live animals in the markets
in the producing areas and the final retail price of meat are surprisingly
small (paras 2.14-2.15) and there is good reason to believe that the live-
stock and meat marketing system works efficiently, except before major feasts
such as Aid-el-Adha, when prices rise steeply. At present, ONAB purchases
animals mainly from the socialist sector. Marketing and distribution by ONAB
is discussed in paras 2.20-2.24.
Imports
2.13      Although Algeria imported small quantities of prime quality beef
before independence, no further meat imports were permitted until 1975.
Imports increased in 1976 but rapidly reached a ceiling in 1977 when a total
of nearly 13,000 tons of fresh and frozen meat were imported (Table 2.3).
Without proper handling facilities it would be difficult to increase imports
further. In principal ONAB is also the only meat importer. However due to
the present lack of facilities Galeries Algeriennes, a Government owned
department store, also imports fresh beef and mutton for sale in its stores.
ONAB imports both fresh meat by air and frozen meat by sea. Since meat is
regarded as an essential import, the Ministry of Commerce would increase
ONAB's annual import allocation as soon as it is able to handle an increased
quantity. At present ONAB rents two cold store chambers from SONATMAG, the
nationalized cold store chain at El Harrach, for Algiers, but the rooms are
neither cold enough for frozen meat (-4 0C instead of -18 C) nor are they
designed for bulk handling.  Two chambers (560 m2) are also available at Oran,
but there are no cold stores at Annaba. Most imports are sold locally although
some are dispatched directly to the petroleum complexes in Southern Algeria.
Prices
2.14      Domestic supply of beef and mutton together has barely increased as
rapidly as has population, with the result that domestic supply per capita has
not increased. At the same time with rapidly rising disposable incomes



- 13 -
(1972-76, 5.5%/year) the demand for red meat has also increased. The result
has been a rapid increase in liveweight prices as shown in Table 2.5, which
also shows poultry prices. These prices conceal large seasonal fluctuations.
Table 2.5: Algeria - Liveweight Prices

1978            11.0        12.0         8.4
2.15       ONAB purchases live animals on the domestic market, rather than meat,
so the effective purchase price of meat has been obtained by taking liveweight
prices and converting to carcass equivalent (allowing for condemned carcasses).
During 1978 the average price paid by ONAB for beef was DA20.40/kg carcass
equivalent, similar to the observed wholesale price in the municipal abat-
toirs. Mutton purchase prices were higher averaging DA25.70/kg for carcasses,
although prices rose up to 50% higher during Ramadan and just before the feast
of Aid-el-Adha. ONAB sells meat to the institutional market and to private
consumers at rates which are about DA3/kg less than prices for equivalent meat
sold by private retail butchers. Average purchase and sales prices during
1978 are shown in Table 2.6. Sales prices for individual cuts were of course
higher and lower than those shown in the table, with beef fillet for example
selling for DA32/kg and boiling beef for DA20/kg. These prices indicate both
the extremely high level of domestic meat prices and the surprisingly slim
marketing margins for both ONAB and the private sector. The cost of slaughter
and municipal abattoir tax is met from the value of offal sales (DA400/cow
and DA55/sheep). Hides and skins are sold to the National Tanning Company
(SONIPEC) at official prices of DAl.90/kg for hides and DA13/sheep skin.
ONAB's purchase and sales prices for imported fresh and frozen meat are also
shown in Table 2.6. More than half the cost of imported meat is made up of
duties and taxes.

Slaughter Conditions
2.16       The municipal abattoirs in Algeria have mostly outiived their useful
lives. They are of the fixed-station type, i.e. all operations from the actual
slaughter to the dressing of the carcasses are done in the same position, with
sheep suspended from a hook and cattle suspended by a winch. This type of
installation was intended to allow butchers to do their own slaughtering, but
it is now outdated and provides no assurance of hygiene. Two small modern
abattoirs using lines have been constructed at El Asnam and Sidi Bel Abbes but
even these do not meet EEC standards as concerns hygiene. Municipal abattoirs
come under the overall control of the municipalities who collect slaughter
tax, but the Ministry of Hydraulics is responsible for their construction. A
national plan has been prepared for constructing new abattoirs but progress
in its implementation is slow. The meat hygiene standards established before
independence have been revoked, since it was not possible to apply them due
to the poor physical state of the abattoirs, and the lack of a trained meat
inspection service. Government has a national plan to improve municipal
abattoirs which is being implemented by the Ministry of Hydraulics.
C. National Office for Livestock Feed (ONAB)
2.17       The National Office for Livestock Feed (ONAB) 1/ was created by
Ordinance No. 69-19 in April 1969.  It is a legally and financially inde-
pendent public agency ("Office") under the tutelage of the Ministry of Agri-
culture (MARA). ONAB's original role according to the Ordinance was indus-
trial production of animal feed for livestock and poultry.  In order to be
able to fulfill its role ONAB was required to purchase locally and externally
i/   Office National des Aliments du Betail (ONAB).

the needed raw materials, proceed with investment in production facilities,
and establish a security stock of animal feed. The following year, as a
result of red meat and poultry scarcity, ONAB's role was extended (July 1970)
by a decision of MARA so as to include also industrial poultry production,
marketing livestock from the socialist sector, and production and imports of
red meat.
Animal Feed
2.18      Originally, ONAB inherited a few formerly private feed mills which
had been nationalized since independence. New plants were opened, old plants
expanded, and at the end of 1978, ONAB found itself operating 16 mills distri-
buted widely throughout Algeria. ONAB controls about 98% of the national
market, producing about 40 varieties of feed for poultry, cattle and sheep,
as well as a vitamin/mineral concentrate. ONAB has developed animal feed
production by over 20% annually from 27,000 tons in 1970 to 218,000 tons in
1978. Some 70% of the total production is poultry feed for sale and for
ONAB's own poultry operations (para 2.19). Raw materials for feed production
are mostly imported, but locally produced inputs are also used, such as bran,
oil-seed cake and abattoir by-products. ONAB plans to increase annual produc-
tion of animal feed to 700,000 tons by 1985, with the construction of 5 new
mills, at an estimated cost of DA152 million.
Poultry Production
2.19      In the early seventies, when a serious meat deficiency started to
develop in Algeria major investments were made in industrial poultry produc-
tion as being the cheapest and fastest way to increase supply of animal
protein to the population; hence the rapid development of ONAB's activity in
this line. ONAB now runs the whole range of activities related to poultry
production, including supplying poultry farmers with hatching eggs for broiler
and layer production, layers, chicks, aviculture equipment and, as seen above,
poultry feed. ONAB operates 9 units for poultry production with capacities as
follows: broiler eggs (18 million/year); day old chicks (16 million/year);
broilers and poultry slaughter houses (13,500 tons/year); and eggs for
consumption (100 million/year). In spite of this, ONAB still imports some 250
million eggs valued at DA50 million annually, and sales of eggs amount to 25%
of ONAB's total sales. Several poultry production units are under construction
as part of a large expansion plan.
ONAB's Red Meat Operations
2.20      The role of ONAB in the red meat subsector is:
(a) to provide a market for animals which are produced by the
socialist sector;
(b)  to supply meat to the collective consumers (hospital,s`,> schools,
some Governmental agencies and institutions); and   '-



- 16 -
(c) to regulate by its intervention the red meat market as a buyer
when supply exceeds demand (in case of drought), or as supplier
of domestic and imported meat when supply is scarce.
2.21       ONAB's cattle and sheep operations can conveniently be divided into
two parts, (a) live animals, and (b) meat slaughter and distribution. Ori-
ginally ONAB's intervention in the meat market was limited to distribution of
livestock purchased from the socialist and private sectors. It soon became
obvious that without adequate cold storage capacity and/or yards for feeding
(feed lots), where cattle and sheep could be maintained alive, ONAB could in
no way regulate the fluctuations in supply and in prices. Accordingly ONAB
started to establish fattening and transit feed lats (Centres d'engraissement
et de transit - C.E.T.) of which presently 13 are in operation, 6 for sheep
and 7 for beef, which handle about 50,000 head of sheep and 7,000 cattle per
year.
2.22       ONAB's meat marketing activity has grown rapidly with sales increas-
ing from 1,750 tons in 1974 to a nearly 8,600 tons in 1977 and an estimated
12,100 tons in 1978, as shown in Table 2.7. ONAB's red meat sales now account
for 10% of the national total. In Algiers alone ONAB's sales (estimated at
9,700 tons in 1978) have risen to about 40% of the total for the city. In
Oran and Annaba, ONAB's operations have only started recently reaching 800
tons at Oran and 900 at Annaba. However the dependence on imported meat which
accounts for three quarters of total sales is marked.

/a   Excludes offal.
2.23      Almost all ONAB's meat operations are currently carried out in
Algiers, Oran and Annaba where facilities are rented in the municipal abat-
toirs. There are small facilities at Sidi Bel Abbes and Setif. In Algiers,
ONAB slaughters in a reserved bay of the municipal abattoir with a team of 15
ONAB slaughtermen. A refrigerated chamber is available to store about 150
carcasses. Frozen meat is stored at El Harrach (para 2.13). ONAB has also
established a small meat cutting plant handling about six tons per week to
provide cut and rolled meat for the institutional market, and a delicatessen
unit producing 6-8 tons per week is also in operation. At Oran part of the
municipal abattoir is reserved for ONAB, but there are no refrigeration



- 17 -
facilities. Frozen meat is stored in rented facilities. At Annaba conditions
are least satisfactory for ONAB. Slaughtering is in the antiquated abattoir
which has no refrigeration equipment and there is no cold store for frozen
meat.
2.24      ONAB's sales are mainly directed to the collective buyers (60% of
beef and 80% of mutton) but meat is also sold to Government stores, Souk El
Fellahs (35% and 15% respectively) and to a few private butcher shops and two
ONAB pilot retail shops (5% in both cases).
ONAB's Present Organization and Management
2.25       ONAB is managed by a General Director, and an Assistant Director
General reporting to MARA and operates under close supervision from the
Ministry. No Board of Directors has been nominated as provided for in the
Ordinance of April 1969 (para 2.17). ONAB's organization evolved somewhat
haphazardly, as the "Office" developed in many directions under the pressure
of circumstances, and assumed functions unforeseen at the time of its creation.
Headquarters are in Algiers and regional directorates operate from Algiers,
Annaba and Oran. A new organization is being introduced progressively since
mid-1978 in which three new departments are created for Animal Feed, Avicul-
ture and Marketing. The new Department of Marketing will be responsible for
the red meat sector and for distribution of imported eggs and poultry. It is
not yet clear what responsibility, if any, will be left to the regional
directorates (Directions Regionales de Production). Since the new organiza-
tion is not yet entirely operational, judgement on the new structure is not
possible based on results, and its success will largely depend on the quality
and dedication of ONAB's professional staff.
2.26      ONAB's most serious problem is the lack of trained and qualified
personnel, a problem which has confronted Algeria since independence. As in
other "Offices", ONAB salary scales are lower than in industry, although
higher than in the Adcrinistration. Nevertheless, in the past four years,
ONAB has been able to expand its labor force from a total of 1,046 persons
with only 19 professionals in 1974 to 2,450 persons and 120 professionals
in 1978. In addition to the permanent labor force ONAB employs as many as
1,800 seasonal workers. Consolidated sales per staff have increased in every
year except 1977 where exceptional labor force increase took place.
ONAB's Financial Situation
2.27       In common with other "Offices" the efficiency of ONAB's operations
is severely hindered by rigid financial procedures. All policy and investment
decisions must be approved by MARA, as well as the operational budget. All
financial transactions are made obligatorily through the Banque Nationale
d'Algerie (BNA) and are tightly controlled under rigid procedures. The
production units have to transfer current income to the Head Office income
account. The expenses of the units are covered by a monthly transfer from
Head Office to the Unit's current expense account, the amount of which conforms
strictly to a pre-established budget, which requires a lengthy procedure to
modify. Moreover, investments can be made only if they have been provided for



- 18 -
in the annual budget revision of the National Four Year Development Plan,
agreed by ONAB, MARA and the Ministry of Finance. Consequently, unexpected
investments, such as replacement of broken machinery or simple ommissions,
cannot be made resulting in long production stoppages or delays in completion
of project construction. The result, which is characteristic of the central-
ized socialist policies followed by Algeria, is a highly inflexible decision-
making structure often interfering with efficient management.
2.28       ONAB's financial position is marked by a very smail equity as com-
pared to total long-term resources and by an equally small net working capital.
ONAB's consolidated balance sheets for the years 1973 to 1977 (shown in the
Project File) reflect its rapid growth. The total assets increased six fold
during the period. Borrowing from government banks, marginal in 1973, reached
DA352 million in 1977 but the equity and the net working capital changed
little. The salient data of ONAB's consolidated balance sheets are the
following:

Debt equity ratio                            50:50   84:16   89:11   88:12   89:11
2.29      At the end of 1977 the medium- and long-term debts stood at DA275
million of which DA232 million were due to BNA (Banque Nationale d'Algerie),
DA30 million to BAD (Banque Algerienne de Developpement) and DA6 million
was a supplier loan. The conditions of the BNA medium-term loans are generally
a 7 year term with a grace period of 2 years and an interest rate of 5.5%.
BAD loans have a term of 12 years with again a 2 year grace period and an
interest rate of 5.5%. The interest rates have been reviewed recently and
increased to 7.5% for new lending.
2.30       ONAB's debt/equity ratio clearly demonstrates the Government's
policy of limiting the financial autonomy of ONAB.  From a situation of
equilibrium in 1973 when ONAB's equity stood at egality with long- and
medium-term borrowing, new investments were financed quasi exclusively by
borrowed funds without practically any increase in equity. The heavy reliance
on bank financing is not healthy.
2.31       The presentation of ONAB's accounts does not permit a meaningful
analysis of operations (see Consolidated Income Statement in the Project
File). The salient data of ONAB's income, expenditure and profit over the
three years ending December 31, 1977 were the following:

2.32      The substantial increase in sales in the years 1975, 1976 and 1977
was mostly due to the increase in ONAB's commercial (as opposed to industrial)
activity. Although no analysis exists separating the two activities at the
level of sales, available data on ONAB's imports of eggs and red meat indicate
that in 1976 about 25% and in 1977 32% of sales were imported goods which
were not processed or otherwise conditioned by ONAB. The high profit margin
on these goods explains also the significant improvement of the operational
surplus and gross margin in 1976 and especially in 1977.
2.33      The company profit tax rate in Algeria is 60% and ONAB is subject to
the tax as any other company or "Office". In fact, however, the effective rate
is substantially higher because the Government refused to consider - from the
taxation point of view - ONAB as one unit which could offset losses in some
production units against profits in others and ONAB had to pay the 60% tax
on profits of each unit making profit without a compensation with units making
losses. The resulting overall tax rate was therefore 66% in 1975, 166% in 1976
with, as result a net loss, and it was 89% in 1977.
Conclusion
2.34      ONAB's very rapid expansion in many directions has not been matched
with commensurate efforts in organization. Reorganization in mid-1978 has
not yet addressed basic shortcomings such as absence of cost control in the
production centers, or comprehensive long-term financial planning. There is
also a lack of systematic description of functional responsibilities. Among
other things the Project would address itself to greater financial autonomy
for ONAB, better financial structure and improved debt:equity ratio, and more
efficient organization (paras. 3.17 and 4.10).

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.01       Increase in the Supply of Beef and Mutton.  The main objective of
the Project is to increase the supply of beef and, more important, mutton in
Algeria, by increasing both imports and domestic suppplies, as well as increas-
ing storage for imported meat. Two main actions are envisaged to increase
domestic production:
(i)  removing young lambs and old cull ewes from the arid
Steppe, and
(ii)  fattening this flock in the cereal zone of the High
Plateau.
3.02      Reduction in Seasonal Price Fluctuations.  The principal means
whereby ONAB can assist in dampening seasonal price fluctuations will be
through controlled release of imports onto the market during periods of
shortage on the domestic market. Expanded cold storage capacity and frozen
and chilled distribution channels will be required to achieve this objective.
3.03       Supply of Meat to the Institutional Market and Private Retail.
The increasing needs of the large institutional market including factories,
schools, hospitals etc. necessitates the construction of abattoirs,
meat cutting and meat distribution plants in the main urban centers. As
a first phase three centers are proposed at Algiers, Oran and Annaba.
3.04      Establishment of a Modern Hygienic Meat Industry.  There is an
urgent need to improve meat hygiene in Algeria, and the project will provide
ONAB with the means to establish a modern meat industry in Algeria. The meat
complexes, including the slaughterhouses, will be designed and constructed
to EEC standards, not with intention of exporting to the EEC, but to provide
Algeria with a clearly defined set of standards suitable for application in
a modern industrialized society.
3.05      These objectives are complementary.  In the medium and longer term
Algeria must obviously make full use of a large potential fodder resource
in the cereal zone of the High Plateau for livestock fattening, and the
Project is designed so that ONAB can act both directly, and as a catalyst, in
mobilizing these resources as rapidly as possible. However in the short-term,
large increases in domestic beef and mutton production are not physically
possible and imports will have to increase to supply a rapidly growing national
demand for meat. Enlarged cold storage capacity is therefore essential to
satisfy the first objective of increasing meat supply, but it will also be
utilized to contribute towards the second objective of reducing seasonal
price fluctuations. The third objective of supplying the institutional market
is also directly linked with the other two, since few retail butchers or
private households have refrigerators or freezers which are required for the



- 21 -
distribution of frozen meat. Imports of frozen meat, the cheapest and most
reliable form of meat imports would therefore have to be distributed principally
through institutional markets where refrigeration and the necessary sanitary
controls exist.
B. Project Description
Main Features
3.06      The Project will comprise three main components:
(i) sheep purchase, transit and fattening:
(a) establishment of 12 buying centers on the northern
boundary of the arid Steppe;
(b) purchase of 30 trucks to transport 100,000 young lambs and
cull ewes from the Steppe to the cereal zone of the High
Plateau;
(c) establishment of 60,000 ha medic pasture (Medicago
spp) on self-managed farms; and
(d) construction of sheep handling yards on 120 self-
managed farms.
(ii)  establishment of three integrated meat complexes at Algiers
Oran and Annaba:
Meat Complex at Algiers
(a) construction of a multi-species abattoir with two
parallel lines for cattle and sheep with a capacity
of 16 head/hour for cattle and 100 head/hour for
sheep (7,200 tons/year);
(b) meat cutting plant with a capacity of 28 carcasses/
hour and associated chilled storage (7,850 tons bone-
in carcasses/year);
(c) meat products plant to produce 1,500 tons/year;
(d)  3,700 m2 storage for imported frozen meat;
(e) trucks and vans for the distribution of meat and meat
products;
(f) by-products plant for production of bone-meal,
hides and skins; and
(g) incremental working capital.



- 22 -
Oran and Annaba Meat Complexes
(a) multi-species abattoir with lines for 8 cattle/hour
and 40 sheep/hour (2,900 tons/year);
(b) meat cutting plant (2,440 tons bone-in carcasses/year);
(c) meat products plant (750 tons/year);
(d) 1,400 m2 cold storage for imported frozen meat;
(e) trucks and vans for the distribution of meat and meat
products;
(f) by-products plant; and
(g) incremental working capital.
(iii) technical assistance and training.
Detailed Features
3.07       Sheep Purchases, Transit and Fattening.  Although the potential
exists for the annual purchase of some half a million lamb and cull ewes from
the arid Steppe ONAB will only attempt to purchase some 100,000 additional
head of sheep under the Project.  Several programs have been started and are
ongoing to introduce medic pasture, and to fatten cattle and sheep on the
self-managed farms and cooperatives in the cereal zone of the High Plateau
with varying degrees of success. Due to institutional constraints (Develop-
ment Institute for Cereals and Pulses works only with crops, and Development
Institute for Sheep works only with livestock) it has been difficult to co-
ordinate research on medics with commercial livestock production (para. 1.15).
However, the Government of Algeria has expended considerable effort since 1973
to introduce a rotation of wheat followed by annual medicago spp based pasture
which, because of a high proportion of hard seeds, can regenerate after wheat
without reseeding. As a semi prostrate legume it provides a high quality
fodder, production against erosion and increases soil nitrogen. Although
problems of weed control and adaption to colder areas still remain, some 8,000
ha of medic pasture have been established in Algeria and about 50,000 ha in
Tunisia. Research into weed control and selection of cultivars adapted to
altitude greater than 600 meters is progressing satisfactorily and should
provide results in time for application to the areas where these factors are a
constraint to optimum development. ONAB as a semi-autonomous "Office" is in
a unique position to break through these constraints, but it is considered
that a three man technical assistance team with experience of sheep and medic
pasture farming is required to assist ONAB in making the advance from research
trials to commercial exploitation. Taking into account some resistance by the
self-managed farms to adopting new farm practices such a team could reasonably
establish some 60,000 ha of medics on 120 farms over three years.



- 23 -
3.08      The Project will establish 12 sheep buying centers (Annex 1, Table
1) by enlarging 10 existing Cooperative Agriculture Service Centers (CAPCS) in
the semi-arid areas and using two existing ONAB transit centers (CETs). The
CAPCS, which are currently used to supply sheep flocks with feed, fodder and
drugs, etc. will become ONAB buying points for weaned lambs and cull ewes
from nomadic sheep flocks in the semi-desert areas. They will be enlarged
through the construction of sheep handling yards, provision of trucks for
sheep transportation and the necessary staff. During the early spring buying
season each buying center would handle about 8,350 sheep over a period of one
month.  The sheep will be transported from the buying centers to selected
self-managed farms participating in the Project as soon as possible after
purchase. During the rest of the year the vehicles and the staff will be
used by ONAB for transporting animal feed.
3.09      ONAB will select some 120 self-managed or other farms in the cereal
zone of the High Plateau over a three year period. Participating farms will
each grow 500 ha of medic pasture to be used for sheep grazing of which 250 ha
would be in production each year. Self-managed farm average about 1,000 ha
and have approximately 340 ha in fallow land each year (MARA statistics) so
that the medic pasture will occupy 73% of the fallow land. Stocking rate
of 5 sheep per ha is assumed, permitting 1,250 sheep per farm over a four
month fattening period. As a working hypothesis it has been assumed that
two-thirds of the sheep to be fattened on the medics (a total of 100,000
sheep) will be provided by ONAB and will remain the property of ONAB. They
will be fattened on the self-managed farms on a contract basis. The remaining
50,000 sheep to be fattened on the medics will belong to the self-managed
farms themselves.
3.10      ONAB will provide technical assistance for planting the medic
pastures. The existing farm machinery will wherever possible be used for
establishing the pastures. In this way a total of 60,000 ha of medic pastures
will be established. Sheep handling yards would also be constructed on the
self-managed farms by ONAB. The sheep belonging to ONAB will graze the medic
pastures for a period of approximately 120 days from the beginning of February
until the end of May. The period coincides with the correct grazing period
for medic before seed setting takes place. Sheep belonging to the participat-
ing self-managed farms will either be sold to ONAB at that time or retained to
graze the medic stubbles after the seed has set from July 15 to October 15,
which will allow a total grazing period for the medics of 210 days. Medic
pastures may be expected to regenerate four or five times after wheat over 8
or 10 years before reseeding becomes necessary.
3.11      Algiers Meat Complex.  The complex will include a multi-species
abattoir with two parallel lines and a capacity of 16 head/hour for cattle
and 100 head/hour for sheep. EEC hygiene and health requirements will be
adopted which inter-alia require cutting of carcasses in the suspended posi-
tion, separation of clean and dirtied areas, and forward flow without any
back tracking or crossing, as well as the need for adequate refrigeration.
Initially a single slaughter team will operate a six hour shift killing
either cattle or sheep on a sequential basis, with an estimated annual
throughput of 5,760 cattle and 38,800 sheep (3,150 tons). The abattoir has
been designed so that both lines can operate concurrently, and when domestic
supply increases, a second slaughter team will be added to double annual



- 24 -
throughput to 6,200 tons/year.  The abattoir design includes chilled carccass
storage for 109 tons. The major part of the abattoir investment is in refrig-
erated facilities which will be required whether local or fresh imported
meat is being utilized. As domestic slaughter increases the proportion of
imported meat will decline. Thus, the abattoir will be efficiently utilized
from the beginning.
3.12      The meat-cutting plant wil] replace ONAB's totally inadequate
facilities at El Harrach, and will permit ONAB to supply its institutional
and retail customers with boned and rolled meat. An estimated 7,850 tons of
bone-in meat will be required annually to supply the plant of which three
quarters will initially have to be imported. Boneless cut meat will be
vacuum packed in heat shrinkable and clipped Cryovac packs. Bone-in cuts
will be packed in Multivac packs.  Price-weighed and labelled meat will
be stored in picking and dispatch chillers included in the meat complex.
3.13       Cold storage chambers (3,700 m2) for 3,600 pallets of frozen meat
will be included in the meat complex. Assuming 50% beef and 50% mutton
some 2,500 tons of meat could be stored at any one time which will permit
an annual throughput of 10,000 tons with four rotations. Defrosting chambers
will be included so that imported frozen mutton may be defrosted before sale
to the institutional and private retail market. A small blast freezer will
be included in the complex for freezing carcasses held back for veterinary
inspection, but it is not intended to freeze and store large volumes of
domestically produced meat. Trucks and vans for the distribution of meat
are included in the Project. Incremental working capital will be principally
required to finance frozen meat imports.
3.14      A meat products (charcuterie) plant to produce 6 tons of sausages,
pate and cured meats daily (1,500 tons/year) will be included to make use
of carcass trimmings, heads, offal etc. and culled hens from ONAB's poultry
operations. A small by-products plant to manufacture blood and bone meal,
edible fats, tallow and a separate plant for preparing hides and skins will
also be included. The technical characteristics and throughputs of the
Algiers complex are summarized in Annex 1, Table 2.
3.15      Meat Complexes at Oran and Annaba.  Integrated meat complexes will
be constructed at Oran and Annaba, which will be similar but smaller than the
one at Algiers. The abattoirs will also have two parallel lines: one for
cattle (8 head/hour) and one for sheep (40 head/hour). Initially these will
operate sequentially with one team operating either the cattle or the sheep
line and operating a single six hour shift. The meat cutting plant will also
be smaller than at Algiers and will require 2,420 tons bone-in carcasses of
which 1,440 tons will be imported. A total. of 700 tons frozen meat will be
stored on 900 pallets in the cold store, allowing an annual throughput of
2,800 tons with 4 rotations. Defrosting chambers for 840 tons mutton/year
will be constructed. The meat products plants to be built at Oran and Annaba
will be one half the size of the one at Algiers. It will utilize some imported
frozen meat as well as trimmings to produce a minimum viable output of 3 tons
daily. By-products and hides and skins will also be produced in the meat
complex. The technical characteristics of the Oran and Annaba meat complexes
are summarized in Annex 1, Table 3.

Location of Meat Complexes
3.16      Locations have not been finalized for the meat complexes, although
Government has been given site specifications to enable suitable sites to be
selected. Due to the critical importance of correct location to the technical
viability of the Project, it was agreed during negotiations that acquisition of
site locations acceptable to the Bank for the Algiers, Oran and Annaba
complexes will be a condition of effectiveness. The main criteria to be
satisfied are: location, access, water, drainage, electricity, and ground
conditions. A 7 ha level site within 35 km of the center of Algiers is
required (5.5 ha for Oran and Annaba). A reliable supply of 10 1/sec (2 1/sec
for Oran and Annaba) of wholesome potable water with no coliform bacteria in
100 ml is also needed. If a mains water supply is to be utilized a minimum
pressure of 0.104 N/mm2 for 16 out of 24 hours/day is required. Otherwise
water will be supplied from a deep tubewell which must be suitable for treat-
ment to required quality standards. Hydrological survey evidence will be
needed to substantiate the required abstraction rates of 10 1/sec at Algiers
and 2.0 1/sec at Oran and Annaba. Drainage requirements to prevent pollution
are given in para 3.28. Electricity supply will be 3 phase high voltage
current providing 2 MW at Algiers, 1 MW at Oran and Annaba.
3.17      Technical Assistance.  The Project will finance four sets of
technical assistance activities totalling about 636 months of expertise:
(a) consulting engineering services for preparation of tender
documents, evaluation of bids and during construction of
the meat complexes to be employed as a condition of loan
effectiveness and to start work before December 1, 1979
(288 man-months);
(b) in-service training for the meat complexes to commence
6 months prior to completion of their construction (180
man-months);
(c) sheep and medic pasture development teams to start work
by January 1, 1980 (108 man-months); and
(d) finance and cost accounting support for ONAB to start
before April 1, 1980 (60 man-months).
Supervision of construction of the meat complexes is discussed in para 3.18.
In-service training for the meat complexes will include a five-man team for
three years (1981-83) comprising a production manager, refrigeration engineer,
veterinary officer to teach meat inspection, a food technologist for the
meat products plant and a marketing manager. The team will be based in
Algiers but have particular responsibility for initial operations in Oran
during 1982 and at Annaba during 1983. Technical support for sheep purchase
and medic establishment will be provided by a three-man team comprising a
team leader, a sheep specialist and a legume pasture specialist. The fourth
set of technical assistance activities will include assistance in improving
ONAB's financial planning and procedures, and help in the establishment of

cost accounting. Technical assistance costs have been estimated at US$6,100/
man-month for (a) above, and at US$8,300/ man-month for (b), (c) and (d) above
inclusive of local costs, an average of US$7,300/man-month overall.
C. Status of Engineering
3.18      Detailed technical specifications and preliminary cost estimates
have been prepared for the meat complex at Algiers, and for the complexes at
Oran and Annaba, by consultants financed through a Bank executed UNDP proi-
ect. 1/ Site specifications to enable Government to select suitable sites have
also been prepared and given to Government (para 3.16).  Considerable thought
and discussion has gone into the capacities and throughputs of the complex and
the Bank has been fully consulted regarding the technical specifications that
have been prepared. Since construction would be by turn-key contract, the
technical specifications published in the tender documents may be less
detailed than those prepared to encourage innovation and to provide the
freedom for tenderers to use their own equipment sizes where the technical
requirements of the Project would not be jeopardized. No more than six
man-months will be required to complete tender documents comprising contract
details, and the less detailed specifications described above. Funding for
this work is available under the ongoing Bank executed UNDP Project. A
further two man-months will be required for evaluation of tender documents.
The tender documents will have to include clearly spelt out penalty clauses.
Eight man-months of consultant time remains unutilized in the ongoing Bank
executed UNDP Project, which is sufficient for finalization of tender docu-
ments and evaluation of bids. Engineering supervision will be required for
the duration of the construction period, for which costs have been included
in the Project. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that consultants,
acceptable to the Bank, will be employed to assist in the preparation of
tender documents, the evaluation of tenders and to supervise construction of
the three meat complexes, and that their employment will be a condition of
effectiveness of the loan.
D. Implementation Schedule
3.19       The Project will be implemented over a five year period, from
mid-1979 through October 1983 (Figure 3.1). Detailed specifications for
the meat complexes were completed in May 1979 and tender documents will be
completed and issued in July 1979. After receipt of bids and award of con-
tract, construction of the Algiers meat complex will begin in January 1980 and
be completed in October 1981. Construction of the Oran complex will begin in
January 1981 with completion estimated in June 1982. The Annaba complex will
begin a year later, January 1982, and be completed in June 1983. Construction

of the sheep buying centers will begin in 1980, and a start will be made to
establish medic pastures. The planned 60,000 ha of medics will be planted by
mid-1982, and should be in full production by early 1983.
E. Cost Estimates
3.20      The total project cost is estimated at DA420.7 million (US$105.2
million) including physical and price contingencies. Cost estimates for
civil works and equipment are based on unit rates obtained in contracts
in Algeria and North Africa during 1978. Physical contingencies included
in project estimates are 10% for both civil works and equipment. For all
civil works, price contingencies have been compounded at annual rates of
10% for 1979 through 1983, taking into account increases in international
prices and the rather higher rates of inflation in Algeria. For equipment
a lower rate of price increases would have been used, but due to the
specialized nature of most of the equipment to be installed and the rapid
increase in prices of livestock agro-industry equipment a rate of 10% has
also been adopted. The estimated foreign exchange component of the Project
is estimated at DA169.3 million (US$42.3 million), including contingencies
of DA50.2 million (US$12.5 million). The foreign exchange estimate assumes
that a foreign contractor will win a turn-key contract for all three meat
complexes but that most of the civil works will be subcontracted to local
Algerian firms. DA20.0 million (US$5.0 million) of the DA251.4 million
(US$62.9 million) local costs represents duties and taxes. Details of
the cost estimates are given in Annex 1, Table 4, and are summarized in
Table 3.1.
F. Financing
3.21       The proposed Bank loan of US$42 million will be made to ONAB thereby
encouraging and supporting Government policy of autonomy and delegation
of responsibility to State enterprises. The loan will finance the whole of
the foreign exchange cost of the Project. Local currency expenditures will be
financed partly by loans from BNA and BAD, and partly by a Government budgetary
appropriation. Government will bear the foreign exchange risk. The financing
plan will be as shown in Table 3.2.

3.22       The Bank loan would cover 40% of the total Project Cost.  The term
of the proposed loan would be 17 years including 4 years of grace based on
Project projected sources and use of funds. The Government contribution
would be provided on standard terms determined by current legislation which
provides for Government grants for site preparation and services, and for
training (US$12.4 million). Short term loans would be available from BNA
and (US$22.4 million) and long term loans from BAD (US$28.4 million) for the
balance at prevailing conditions, currently 7.5% interest. Assurances to
this effect and that ONAB will maintain an appropriate financial structure
were obtained during negotiations.
G. Procurement, Disbursement, Accounts and Audit
Procurement
3.23       Contracts, amounting to a total of US$70.3 million, including
physical and price contingencies will be tendered for under international
competitive bidding according to the Bank's guidelines:
(a)  construction of civil works and furnishing of equipment
for the meat complexes at Algiers, Oran and Annaba. This
will either be tendered as one single contract or three
contracts for Algiers, Oran and Annaba separately (US$66.2
million);
(b)  purchase of vehicle fleet for meat distribution (US$2.7
million); and
(c)  purchase of sheep transport vehicles (US$1.4 million).
Construction of the three meat complexes would be on a turn-key basis to ensure
that the specialized buildings and equipment are compatible and interface pro-
perly. An advantage of turn-key construction is that one contractor only
takes responsibility for the construction and operation of each complex. Other
advantages of turn-key contracts for construction of the meat complexes are the
possibility of obtaining the benefits of recent developments in design, and



- 31 -
savings in costs through use of fully compatible equipment. It is antici-
pated that the turn-key contractor would in fact subcontract the civil works
to a local Algerian firm (para 3.20). The duration of construction has been
phased over 4.5 years (Figure 3.1) to encourage medium sized as well as the
largest international contractors, and to permit time for training ONAB staff.
Strict penalty clauses concerning delays in construction, would be incorporated
in contract details included in the tender documents.
3.24      Construction of sheep handling yards for ONAB's use at the purchas-
ing centers, and on the participating self-managed farms would amount to
US$460,000 and would be let in small contracts after local competitive bidding.
All technical assistance provided under the Project will be under terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank. Assurances to this effect, and that all
civil works and equipment will be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines
for procurement dated March 1977, were obtained during negotiations.
Disbursement
3.25      The proposed Bank loan of US$42 million will be disbursed over five
years, 1979-1983. The loan will finance:
(a) 50% of the cost of the turn-key contract for constructing the
three meat complexes.
(b) 65% of the cost of locally procured vehicles and equipment
and/or 100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported vehicles and
equipment;
(c) 35% of the total cost of medic pasture establishment and con-
struction of handling yards; and
(d) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of consultant services.
Disbursements will be made against supporting documents such as confirmed
copies of contracts, receipted invoices and certified progress reports in the
case of civil works and technical assistance.
3.26      Any savings in Project costs will be cancelled.  Estimated schedules
of expenditures, disbursements, and the proposed allocation of the proceeds of
the loan are presented in Annex 1, Tables 4, 5 and 6.
Accounts and Audit
3.27      Separate accounts will be kept for the Project.  Presently ONAB's
accounts are not audited but only verified by a controller appointed by the
Government. Under the Project, ONAB's accounts will be audited by the Societe
Nationale de Comptabilite (SNC), an independent governmental accounting and
auditing agency which is now receiving technical assistance by Peat & Marwick
under the SNMC Expansion Project (Loan 1185AL-76). Assurances that ONAB will



- 32 -
keep separate accounts and have them audited by SNC, which is satisfactory to
the Bank, and that the auditors' annual report will be sent to the Bank within
six months of the end of each fiscal year were obtained during negotiations.
H. Environment and Health
Environment
3.28       The three meat complexes will be sited to ensure that there is no
adverse environmental impact. They will not be located adjacent to housing,
and will have good hard-surface access roads to avoid undue traffic conges-
tion.  Effluent disposal systems will be installed.  If effluent is dis-
charged into a main sewer it will have a capacity of 25 1/sec for Algiers,
and 6 1/sec for Oran and Annaba, and the effluent will have less than:  1.207
g/l.  Biological oxygen demand (B.O.D.); 1.503 g/l total suspended solids
(T.S.S.) and 0.647 g/l oils and grease.  If a main sewer is not available, an
additional 0.75 ha of land for treatment facilities will be provided so that
treated effluent could be discharged to either (a) an uncontaminated water-
course having minimum flows throughout the year of 200 1/sec at Algiers and
50 i/sec at Oran and Annaba; or (b) an additional area of open land suitable
for sub-surface irrigation of which the suitability will be determined by
standard percolation test; or (c) additional adjacent arable land capable of
utilizing water for crop irrigation purposes. If a main sewer is not avail-
able then the effluent will have less than 0.023 g/l B.O.D.; 0.027 g/l liter
T.S.S. and 0.009 g/l oils and grease. Government assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the procurement specifications for effluent disposal
already prepared by the consultants will be included in the tender documents
to ensure that there will be no adverse environmental effect from the effluent
of the meat complexes.
Health
3.29       The meat complexes will not be located downwind of industrial plant
emitting air borne pollutants - dust, soot, toxic fumes, etc. to prevent
contamination. The plants will be built and operated to EEC standards for
hygiene, except as appropriately modified by agreement between the Bank and
ONAB. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01       The Project will be implemented by the Office Nationale des Ali-
ments du Betail (ONAB) (paras 2.17-2.34). The new ONAB organization which
is now being put into effect introduces a new Department of Marketing which
is responsible for the red meat sector and will be responsible for Project
operations. As discussed in paras. 2.17-2.26 ONAB has grown dramatically during
the past five years and its record to date provides good assurance for the
future. In particular the meat slaughter and distribution operations have
grown under the most difficult conditions and there are existing teams of
competent personnel in Algiers, Oran and Annaba to provide the nuclei staff
for the Project's operations.



- 33 -
Sheep Fattening
4.02       Sheep purchase, transit and fattening will be under the responsibil-
ity of the Red Meat Production Division (Department Viande) of the Marketing
Department. In order to promote a rapid increase of sheep fattening on medic
pastures by self-managed farms, assurances were obtained during negotiations
that ONAB will strengthen the organization and staffing within its Red Meat
Production Division, and that a three-man technical assistance team will
be employed for three years, comprising a team leader, a sheep production
specialist and an agronomist with experience in medic pastures. 1/ ONAB's
current livestock buyers who would take on the responsibility for purchasing
the additional 100,000 head sheep planned for the Project. ONAB staff at each
buying center would consist of a veterinary technician, four drivers and a
clerk. The Red Meat Production Division would be responsible for executing
the sheep purchases and for their transportation from the buying centers to
participating self-managed farms, and subsequently to the abattoirs.
4.03       A major new function of the division would be to popularize commer-
cial sheep fattening among the self-managed farms in the cereal zone of the
High Plateau. To this end the Division would draw up and sign agreements with
the participating self-managed farms relating to medic pasture establishment,
sheep grazing conditions and renumeration to the members of the farms for
sheep grazing. (A draft agreement is given in the Project File.) The key to
the success of this part of the project, and in fact the key to a rapid devel-
opment of livestock in Algeria, would be the incentives given to the members of
the self-managed farms. If the contract grazing fee is merely absorbed up
into the general farm income, there would be no incentive for the workers on
the farm to become involved with the extra work associated with looking after
sheep. Assurances were therefore obtained from MARA at negotiations that con-
tracts between ONAB and participating farms would be acceptable to the Bank
and would include adequate incentive to ensure satisfactory participation by
the self-managed farms.
4.04       The agronomist in the technical assistance team will be specifically
responsible for coordinating his work with the local MARA officials and
with the Development Institute for Cereals and Pulses (IRGC) to ensure that
suitable areas are selected and methods used to establish medic pastures.
The livestock production specialist will be responsible for selecting and
supervising suitable CAPCS as buying centers for sheep purchases, assisting
the ONAB livestock buyers to ensure sufficient numbers are purchased and
supervising transportation to the farms.
Meat Complexes
4.05       Although the meat complexes will come under the control of the
Director of Marketing Department, each complex will be expected to operate
as an independent profit making enterprise, which will be headed by a produc-
tion manager. Consultants will be recruited to provide an in-service train-
ing team responsible for establishing operations first in the Algiers complex
1/   Terms of Reference for this team are given in the Project File.



- 34 -
and subsequently in the Oran and Annaba complexes. This team will be headed
by a counterpart production manager who will be a right-hand-man to the
Algerian production managers. As noted (para 3.17) the team will be based in
Algiers and the Algerian teams who would operate the Oran and Annaba complexes
would be trained at the Algiers facility priar to moving to their own centers.
4.06      A second key position will be the director of marketing for each
complex. Re will have responsibility for organizing sales to the institu-
tional market and to ONAB's retail outlets. He will have an experienced
advisor to help him organize operations. This advisor will also work with
MARA, the Ministries of Commerce and Planning so as to coordinate national
meat import objectives with ONAB's own operations. This may involve increas-
ing the proportion of frozen meat distributed to the institutional market so
as to release more fresh cut meat onto the retail market. In addition skilled
management will be required as the function of the meat complexes changes
initially from local supply in the three urban areas of Algiers, Oran and
Annaba, to an increasingly important regional distribution role. It has been
assumed that 60% of the imports of frozen meat will be removed from the cold
stores in bulk on pallets for distribution to the main towns.
4.07      Other operations of the meat complexes will also require technical
assistance, in particular operating the refrigeration installations. Currently
none of the frozen meat stores in Algeria operate at the required temperatures
and a considerable amount of training concerning their correct operation and
maintenance of the equipment will be needed. Funds are available under the
ongoing UNDP Project (para 3.18) for this type of training but a fulltime
refrigeration engineer will be required for 3 years. Expansion of the small
meat products plant at Algiers will necessitate a considerable amount of
training and an experienced food technologist will train the staff for the
expanded Project meat products operations. Due partly to the poor facilities
that exist for slaughter, and partly to lack of staff, meat inspection is
rudimentary in Algeria. Meat inspection is the responsibility of the Veterinary
Department of the Ministry of Agriculture. Therefore although ONAB will be
responsible for recruiting and employing a veterinarian, he will work closely
with the Veterinary Department in training inspectors to work in the ONAB's
meat complexes. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that five persons to
provide technical assistance to the meat complexes will be recruited for three
years.
4.08      When the new facilities come into operation, ONAB will give up its
existing rented and obsolete facilities at the municipal abattoirs at Algiers,
Oran and Annaba, which are not suited for further use. Staff will be trans-
ferred to the new location. At Algiers total manpower will be 420 and the
complexes at Oran and Annaba will each employ 165 people. Few additional
operating staff will be required for the abattoirs due to the greater effi-
ciency of the new facilities. Additional staff will be required for the
meat cutting, meat products and by-products plants, and considerable expansion
will be required for meat distribution. At present the institutions collect
their own meat from ONAB's rented facilities. Instead, ONAB will operate its
own transport fleet to avoid congestion and unrecorded disappearences of meat



- 35 -
during dispatch operations. Orders will be made either a day in advance in
which case a sealed prepacked order would be prepared, or purchasers could buy
directly from ONAB distribution vans (para 5.09).
Financial Management and Planning
4.09       The efficiency of ONAB's operations is severely hindered by rigid
financial procedures (para 2.27). Accordingly, a US$0.5 million technical
assistance component to provide about 60 man-months of services, has been
included in the Project to study, make recommendations for and to assist
in the implementation of improved financial procedures for ONAB. This assis-
tance will also have general application for other offices which come under
the overall responsibility of MARA. The assistance will be provided by
a financial management team, who in addition to reforming ONAB's financial
procedures, will establish and monitor cost accounting in the Marketing
Department over a one year period. ONAB does not have any cost accounting at
present though its introduction has been planned for several years and will
start on a pilot basis during 1979. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that a financial team acceptable to the Bank will be recruited.
Monitoring
4.10       In addition to cost accounting which will be strengthened as part
of the Project, ONAB will keep full records of the sheep purchase, transit
and fattening. These records will be supplemented with regular monthly
slaughter data collected from the main municipal abattoirs for sheep and
cattle, so that the trends in domestic meat supply are monitored, together
with data of meat imports. The Marketing Department will also continue to be
responsible for monitoring retail prices in the private sector in Algiers,
Oran and Annaba compared with elsewhere, and to use this information as a
basis for management decisions concerning:
(a)  total quantity and composition of fresh and frozen imports;
(b)  quantities of fresh meat including defrosted mutton sold
on the retail market (through the Souk-El-Fellah stores);
(c)  the ratio of fresh to frozen meat sold to the institutional
market; and
(d)  the relative availabilities and prices of poultry meat
for which information would be available from ONAB's
Poultry Department.
The Project's meat complexes will provide ONAB with an effective way to
dampen seasonal price fluctuations through controlled release of imports, and
control overall price increases, provided that the relevant indexes are
monitored and that the information is made available rapidly, and management
is responsive. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the purchase,
transit and fattening of sheep and the Meat Complexes would be fully monitored.



- 36 -
Completion Report
4.11       Semi-annual reports on the progress of the Project will be prepared
by ONAB and sent to the Bank throughout the disbursement period. Not later
than six months after completion of the Project, ONAB will prepare and furnish
to the Bank a report on the execution and initial operation of the Project,
its cost, the benefits derived and to be derived from it, the performance of
ONAB and the Bank of their respective obligations under the proposed loan
agreement and the accomplishment of the purposes of the proposed loan.
Assurances concerning semi-annual and completion reports were obtained at
negotiations.
V. PROJECT PRODUCTION, MARKETING
AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Project Physical Output
Sheep Purchase, Transit and Fattening
5.01      Out of 100,000 lambs and cull ewes, weighing an average of 20 kg
liveweight, purchased by ONAB annually through the purchase centers and
fattened on the self-managed farms, some 98,000 (allowing for mortality)
weighing 32 kg will be slaughtered in ONAB's abattoirs. It is estimated that
a further 50,000 head of sheep belonging to members of the self-managed farms
will also gain about 12 kg liveweight through fattening on the medic pastures.
Incremental production will amount to 6 kg carcass weight each, or 870 tons
annually. The main annual outputs of this component are given in Annex 1,
Table 1.
5.02      A total of 60,000 ha of medics will be eutablished by 1983 of
which half (30,000 ha) will be producing medic pasture in any one year, and
the other half wheat. There will be a corsiderable output of nitrogen from
the nitrogen fixing nodules in the medic roots and some 60 kg N per ha will
be available each year for the subsequent year's wheat crop, equivalent to
3,900 tons urea annually for the 30,000 ha.
Algiers Meat Complex
5.03      Abattoir.  The project output of 3,150 tons carcass weight (2,050
tons beef and 1,100 tons mutton) is based on sequential killing by a single
slaughter team operating either the cattle line or the sheep line at any one
time. Analysis of the 1977 and 1978 slaughter statistics shows considerable
seasonal variation in the proportions of cattle and sheep slaughtered, with a
peak in sheep numbers in the summer months which is somewhat balanced by a
peak in cattle numbers in the winter. Even so there is a marked irregularity
in the total numbers of cattle and sheep slaughtered from month to month.
The projected 1985 Project output represents a 60% increase over the 1978



- 37 -
level of throughput.  With one slaughter team killing cattle or sheep sequen-
tially the abattoir could just handle (104% utilization) the largest monthly
peak recorded in March 1978. On the other hand considerable flexibility has
been built into the abattoir design, and with concurrent slaughter and two
shifts (a total of 4 slaughter teams) annual throughput could be increased
to 12,000 tons. The capacities and outputs of the abattoir and the other
components of the Algiers meat complex are given in Annex 1, Table 2.
Meat Cutting Plant
5.04       The specific role of the meat cutting plant is to debone carcasses
of beef, and to cut and wrap the meat into individual portions.  Mutton
carcasses, being smaller than beef carcasses, are not normally cut but will be
wrapped in plastic before distribution. The plant will debone some 7,850 tons
of carcass beef for consumption by the institutional market and for direct
retail sale by ONAB. Raw material requirements of beef by 1985 would utilize
the whole of the projected throughput of beef from the abattoir and require
imports of a further 5,800 tons of fresh imported carcass beef. The projected
level of imports in 1985 is some 60% greater than actual fresh meat imports in
1977 most of which arrived by air from Eastern Europe. ONAB can make good use
of these fresh imported beef carcasses from Eastern Europe, which because of
their small size do not have a ready market in Western Europe. As domestic
meat production increases after 1985, concurrent slaughter will commence witn
both lines in the abattoir operating at the same time, so that fresh meat
import requirements will fall. Output of the meat plant would be 5,750 tons
boneless beef.  Chilled storage capacity is provided for 3 to 4 days of
carcass imports, and 2 days of local carcasses.
Frozen Meat Imports
5.05       By 1985, 10,000 tons of imported frozen meat will be distributed by
ONAB annually through the Algiers meat complex, of which half will be frozen
mutton carcasses and the other half frozen boneless beef. Frozen meat will
be distributed both locally in the Algiers metropolitan area and regionally.
It is assumed that 6,000 tons would be for regional distribution in bulk
direct from the cold stores on pallets. The remaining 4,000 tons of frozen
imports will be distributed in Algiers together with the fresh meat through
the dispatch department of the meat complex. An interesting feature of the
Project is the inclusion of defrosting chambers, which will be used prin-
cipally to defrost frozen imported mutton carcasses before sale, and will
enable some of the low cost imported meat to be sold on the private retail
market. In Algeria few retail butchers or private households have refrige-
rators and freezers, and this presents a problem for the distribution of
frozen meat on the private market, since it should be consumed soon after
defrosting. Mutton carcasses will therefore be sold after defrosting as they
would by a European retail butcher.  Frozen beef will be imported already
boned and boxed. It is less suitable for defrosting due to discoloration and
drip, and will be hand-sawed into individual order sizes and distributed
mainly to the collectivities.



- 38 -
Meat Products Plant
5.06      The plant will utilize about 1,000 tons annually of trimmings
available from the meat cutting plant after deboning local and imported
carcasses, 200 tons of edible offal from the abattoir (livers, etc.) and
200 tons of poultry carcasses culled from ONAB's laying operations. It
will produce about 1,400 tons annually (6 t/day) of meat products (sau-
sages, pate, and cured meats). The plant has been designed with considerable
flexibility and a maximum capacity of 12 t/day, so output could be doubled to
2,800 tons annually if required by utilizing the lower value cuts of imported
fresh or frozen meat. The actual mix of products on any one day will depend
on the availability of different raw materials and on the demand for the
different products produced.
By-Products
5.07      A plant located in the meat complex will manufacture blood and
meat meal (840 t/year), bone meal (2,250 t/year) and will separate out edible
fats (360 t/year) from tallow. A separate building in the meat complex will
be used to salt and prepare hides (12,000) and skins (69,000) before sale to
the National Tanning Company (SONIPEC).
Meat Distribution and Marketing
5.08      The meat complex includes a dispatch department with about 100 tons
chilled storage capacity. Daily and annual sales distributed in the Algiers
metropolitan area will amount to over 11,000 tons annually (50 t/day) as shown
in Table 5.1, with a further 6,000 tons handled in bulk for regional distribu-
tion.

5.09       It is assumed that ONAB will itself deliver 80% of its sales in the
Algiers area with the remaining 20% sold from a retail store located in the
meat complex compound. Distribution will be made by 50, one-ton capacity
delivery vans, 20 of which will be loaded at the meat complex for delivery to
those areas located nearby the complex. Five, six-ton refrigerated trucks
will also load each morning at the complex and transport meat and meat pro-
ducts to the districts where delivery is to be made. The other 30 vans will
be loaded from these trucks. The practice of loading the majority of the
delivery vans in the locality where the meat is to be distributed rather than
at the meat complex, is widely adopted by successful European meat distribut-
ing operations. It is assumed that the proportion of meat sold to the insti-
tutional market (schools, factories, etc.), and to the private consumers
through the Souk-El-Fellah Government stores will remain the same as at
present (70% institutional; 30% private consumers.) The 20% direct retail
sales by ONAB already mentioned, will be made from a "Cash and Carry" store,
located in the meat complex compound, but in a separate building from the main
meat complex. Meat and meat products will be sold direct to the small collec-
tivities and to the public, which will permit ONAB to continue to obtain first
hand information and understanding of day-to-day market conditions.

Output of Oran and Annaba Meat Complexes
5.10       The two meat complexes that will be built at Oran and Annaba will be
identical and will have similar components: abattoir, meat cutting plant,
cold store, etc. as at Algiers but will have about one-third of the output.
The capacities and throughput of the different components are shown in Annex 1,

output, some 19,150 tons (83%) would be incremental imports.

B.  Future National Supply and Demand for Meat
Supply
5.12       Beef production is projected to increase by 3% annually, similar
to the historic rate of increase. Domestic mutton production is projected
to increase by only 0.5% annually due to the lack of feed availability,
although the impact of the Project's medic pasture component would begin to be
felt by 1985. Total and per capita meat supply is shown in Table 5.4 which
shows that per capita supply of red meat would increase slightly from 7.2 kg
in 1978 to 7.7 kg in 1985. However, without the Project, per capita red meat
consumption would fall to 6.6 kg. The Project would account for 57% (23,200
tons) of the total projected increase in red meat supply of 40,800 tons in
Algeria between 1978 and 1985. Even so, ONAB would only represent 21% of the
total supply. Increased domestic beef production and increased imports of
fresh meat by Galleries Algeriennes would account for most of the rest of the
increase in red meat supply. Poultry production is projected to increase
rapidly mainly as a result of ONAB's increased broiler production, so that per
capita consumption of red and white meat together would increase from 11.2 kg
in 1978 to 13.7 kg in 1985.

Demand and Supply Gap
5.13      With increasing disposable incomes (4.4%/year) and an assumed 1.1
income elasticity of demand for meat, demand per capita is projected to
increase to 15.1 kg by 1985. Total apparent demand would in consequence be
about 30,000 tons greater than available supply assuming constant relative
prices. lIt is possible that some of the 12,500 tons of existing ONAB storage
space could be used in an emergency. It is also likely that consumer prices
would rise (para 5.14) so that demand would not be far out of equilibrium from
supply.
C. Prices
Meat Purchases
5.14       The extremely high prices of meat in Algeria have been mentioned
(para 2.15). Present liveweight prices of DA12/kg (US$3/kg) for sheep and
DAll/kg for cattle are expected to increase in constant terms to DA14/kg and
DA12/kg respectively by 1985, due to the continuing tight supply conditions
even with the Project. The prices paid by ONAB for cattle purchased from the
self-managed farms are expected to increase from DA9/kg to DA10.50/kg.  If the
Project meat complexes are not constructed, and red meat imports remain at
their present level then there is no doubt that prices would rise more than
estimated. Taking into account a 45% killing out percent for cattle and 48%
for sheep and allowing for rejection of some diseased carcasses, purchase
prices in 1985 for local mutton carcasses would be DA29.95/kg (US$7.50/kg) and
DA23.80/kg (US$5.95/kg) for beef carcasses.



- 43 -
5.15       In projecting prices for imported meat it is estimated that c.i.f.
prices would increase by 1985 by 35% in constant value terms above the average
level during the period 1976-78. The c.i.f. prices used in the financial
analysis are US$1,650/ton for frozen mutton carcasses, US$1,950/ton for frozen
boneless beef and US$2,200/ton for fresh imported beef carcasses by 1985.
Meat Sales
5.16      ONAB's sales prices for red meat are projected to increase by 16.7%
in constant terms during the period 1978-85.  Prices for fresh mutton are
expected to increase from DA30/kg (para 2.15) to DA35/kg, and for fresh beef
from DA27.80/kg to DA32.40/kg. For sales of frozen meat, separate sales
prices have been adopted for local distribution and for regional distribution.
For local distribution it has been assumed that ONAB would continue to sell
frozen meat at the same percentage discounts as at present. Offal, hides, and
skins have been valued at their present prices.
5.17      At present "regional distribution" accounts for a small proportion
of the total and ONAB charges one set of prices for all frozen meat sold.
For frozen meat (but not for fresh meat) ONAB is in a position to set prices,
since it is the only supplier of frozen meat in Algeria. However in the
future, as Algeriaes total meat imports increase, the meat complexes at
Algiers, Oran and Annaba would increasingly become temporary cold stores into
which shiploads of frozen meat are unloaded and stored before transport to
other cities. ONAB's costs at the meat complex located at the seaports
(Algiers, Oran or Annaba) would be only a part of total distribution costs.
Therefore for the 60% of frozen imports distributed regionally it has been
assumed that meat complexes would sell on a cost-plus basis with a 10% mark-up
on actual purchase costs (c.i.f. plus duty, taxes) to cover storage and
handling. The percentage mark-up could of course be increased or decreased,
and in most cases it would merely be a book transfer (say from ONAB's Oran
meat complex to its Sidi Bel Abbes distribution unit). Meat sales prices are
summarized in Table 5.5.

D. Financial Analysis
Sheep Purchase, Transit and Fattening
5.18       Both the self-managed farms and ONAB would have good financial
returns from the fattening enterprise. The annual operating cost to ONAB
of fattening their own 100,000 sheep on the self-managed farms are estimated
at DA386/ha, of which 43% represents the DA167/ha (DA50/head x 3.3 ONAB
sheep/ha) incentive bonus paid to the self-managed farms. This is equiv-
alent to a cost of DA9.6/kg (12 kg/head) of liveweight gain, compared with
the market price of DA14/kg liveweight. The financial rate of return is
estimated at 15% over 17 years, assuming that ONAB would reimburse the estab-
lishment and operating costs of the medic pasture and pay to the farms an
incentive bonus of DA50/head of ONAB sheep fattened. The fattening component
would also be highly attractive to the self-managed farms, who in addition to
the payments received from ONAB would receive the profit from grazing their
own sheep. It is assumed that the only cost to the self-managed farms would
be provision of labor to shepherd the flock, although the precise arrangements
between ONAB and each farm would be agreed by contract (para 4.03).
Meat Complexes
5.19       The financial rate of return for the three meat complexes after
deduction of income tax would be 11%. Returns for the individual complexes
would be similar. The rate of return is very sensitive to changes in meat
purchase costs, more than half of which is made up by import duties and
taxes. However, meat purchase prices are closely linked to sales prices and
since supply is so scarce ONAB would have considerable scope to adjust prices
and to retain a satisfactory operating margin. In particular, ONAB can
increase sales prices for frozen meat. Thus, the 40% of frozen meat sold
locally could be increased, since the price set by ONAB for frozen is con-
siderably below the market price for fresh meat, and the sale price of the 60%
for regional distribution would increase automatically since it has been
estimated on a cost plus basis (para 5.17). The Project is rather insensitive
to changes in investment costs, with the financial rate of return falling to
8% if capital costs increase by 10%.
5.20       If income tax is excluded from the analysis, which would be reason-
able since the tax liability would decrease if the net income decreases,
then the basic financial rate of return would be 21%. In this case a 5%
increase in meat purchase prices would reduce the financial rate of return to
10% if not compensated for by adjustments in sales prices. Increases in
other operating costs would not affect the rate of return much, and a 10%
increase in other operating costs would only reduce the return from 21% to
18%.
5.21      The overall rate of return for the Project would be 10%, which
is similar to the meat complexes, since the fattening operation is only a
small part of the total. The Project generates sufficient funds to repay the



- 45 -
loans (para 3.22) and, the accumulated cash generated over a 17-year life
assumed for the Project would amount to DA43 million (US$11 million).
E. Manpower Considerations
5.22      The total labor requirements for sheep purchase, transit and fat-
tening, and for the three meat complexes would be an estimated 830 persons:
20 managers, 470 skilled employees, and 340 unskilled workers.  Some 400 new
jobs will be created by the Project.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Production Benefits
Introduction
6.01      The Project strategy, as distinct from ONAB's specific objectives,
is simply to increase the supply of meat in Algeria in an economic manner.
ONAB's objectives are complementary (para 2.20). It is clear from the discus-
sion in Chapters II and V, that in the short run there is little scope for
increasing the domestic supply of red meat, although in the longer term there
is a large untapped potential for fattening livestock in the cereal zone of
the High Plateau. The Project is therefore designed to increase the avail-
ability of red meat for consumers through the enlargement of an effective
processing and distribution channel, which in the short run would have to
depend on imported meat. The main direct beneficiaries of the Project will be
an estimated 4.5 million urban consumers in 1985 in Algiers, Oran and Annaba.
Provision is included for the transition to make increasing use of domestic
meat production as it becomes available. Nevertheless, although most of
the investment is in agroindustries, the Project's main long-term impact is
likely to be in agricultural production through the integration of livestock
and crop production. The Project will permit ONAB to play an important
role in the establishment of a stratified livestock industry in Algeria,
whereby the Steppe range lands will become a zone specialized for breeding and
rearing of young lambs, and the higher rainfall cereal zone of the High
Plateau will become predominantly a fattening area for sheep and cattle.
Benefits from Purchase, Transit and Fattening of Sheep
6.02       The main impact of establishing purchase centers in the Steppe will
be a gradual reduction in grazing pressure on the range lands through removal
of young lambs and cull ewes before the beginning of the dry season. The
purchase centers will also provide a ready cash market for nomadic shepherds,
and by locating them in the existing CAPCS, the cooperative and marketing
functions of the CAPCS will be supported. If the Project is successful



- 46 -
it will be possible subsequently to increase the annual purchases from the
Steppe from 100,000 head per year to 500,000 head.  This will reverse the
spiral of overgrazing and degradation of the forage resources of the Steppe
range lands and permit sheep production from the Steppe to be stabilized.
No benefits have been quantified from the Steppe for use in the economic
analysis.
6.03      The benefits from the Project fattening operations arise from
(a) the availability of a large underutilized land resource (3.4 million
ha of fallow land annually) in the cereal zone of the High Plateau (para 2.02);
and (b) the possibility of adding incremental weight to sheep that would
otherwise have been slaughtered unfinished. Algeria can compete economi-
cally in livestock production with other countries producing low cost live-
stock from pasture. In economic terms the opportunity cost of replacing
fallow by medic pasture is almost nothing (some rough grazing foregone),
and once established (DA308/ha) the maintenance costs of medic (DA80/ha
once every two years) are low. Furthermore due to the acute shortage of
pasture in Algeria, most animals are slaughtered without being finished
(fattened). Therefore domestic meat production may be increased just by
fattening sheep and cattle without any overhead breeding and rearing costs,
and the whole of the weight gain (5 sheep/ha x 12 kg liveweight) is an eco-
nomic gain, without having to deduct any rearing costs.
6.04      In addition to liveweight gains, the incorporation of medics into
the crop rotation provides some 60 kg nitrogen for the subsequent cereal
crop (para 5.02). There is also a beneficial effect from the sheep grazing,
treading and manuring the land; the so called "sheep's golden hoof" well
utilized in European agriculture. The long-term improvement in soil fertility
and cereal yields in the cereal growing areas, resulting from establishing
medic pastures in the rotation will probably be as important as the additional
livestock weight gain.  The build up of organic matter and the avoidance of
bare fallow land will also have a major impact on the prevention of soil
erosion, particularly on sloping land. A further benefit of medics is that in
periods of severe drought sheep can find up to 400 kg/ha of high protein seed
pods from the ground. However, the only benefits quantified in the economic
analysis are the liveweight gain, and the value of 60 kg nitrogen/ha.
Alternatives
6.05      The Government has for some time recognized the importance of
reducing grazing pressure on the Steppe, and of the potential liveweight gains
from fattening animals which are at present sold unfinished. One alternative
has been to fatten animals in feed-lots (CETs para 2.21) on a grain based
ration. Given the present price structure feed-lot fattening is financially
profitable in Algeria, but it is not economic. Algeria is a net grain importer,
so c.i.f. prices must be applied for imported grain. Bran and other feed
by-products available locally can be better fed to poultry which have a food
conversion ratio (feed consumed:carcass weight gain) of about one-third to
one-quarter that of cattle or sheep. At current and projected prices it is
more economic to import fresh and frozen red meat than to fatten cattle or
sheep in feed lots on a concentrate rich feed ration.



- 47 -
B. Meat Complex Benefits
Integration of the Meat Complex Components
6.06      The justification for each complex is similar, although they are
entirely separate from each other being located several hundred kilometers
apart at Oran in northwestern Algeria, Algiers (north-central region) and
Annaba (north-eastern region), and their respective zones of influence are
quite separate. The benefits of the individual components are discussed in
the following paragraphs, but the basic justification of each complex is as
an integrated system which makes it possible to rapidly increase the supply of
meat and meat products in the main urban areas. For this reason an economic
rate of return has been calculated for each complex (para 6.17) but not
for the individual components.
Meat Cutting Plant
6.07       The central component of the meat complex is the meat cutting
plant and the associated distribution system. It provides a clearing house
or assembly market where, under hygienic and refrigerated conditions, domestic
and imported fresh and frozen meat can be packed for dispatch to institutional
and private consumer markets. Depending on daily and seasonal demand and
supply conditions ONAB's marketing manager would be able to utilize different
quantities of fresh meat from the abattoir, imported fresh meat, defrosted
mutton, or frozen boneless beef. Fresh mutton, fresh beef and defrosted
mutton would be sold both to the private consumers and to the collectivities,
but frozen beef, which is mainly used for manufacturing (hamburgers etc.) in
developed countries, would be sold mainly to the collectivities due to the lack
of domestic refrigeration (para 5.05). The collectivities provide the logical
market for imported frozen meat since they have a large daily demand, can be
easily controlled by public health inspectors, and in some cases already have
refrigeration facilities.
6.08      Other benefits of cutting the meat at the meat complex rather than
at the factory or school canteen are reduced transport and distribution costs,
more efficient meat cutting and full use of the trimmings and by-products.
Wrapping and chilling the cut meat in plastic improves the hygienic conditions
of the meat and reduces the considerable health hazards attached to the
present meat distribution system. On public health grounds a meat cutting
plant is therefore desirable. On grounds of convenience, consumers would
prefer to buy cut and rolled meat at ONAB's retail outlets.
Cold Stores
6.09      Apart from fodder based fattening, imported frozen meat provides the
cheapest source of additional meat from an economic standpoint. It would be
the principal means of maintaining per capita consumption of red meat over the
next 10 years. Each meat complex is located at major sea and air ports from
which meat may also be distributed to the main regional towns. To the extent
possible ONAB should distribute low cost frozen meat to the institutional
market in these towns as well as in Algiers, Oran and Annaba.



- 48 -
Abattoir
6.10       In the future it is planned that fresh meat imports would decrease as
domestic production increases. The economic justification of each abattoir is
simply that it provides a mechanism to introduce locally killed carcasses into
the system, since it would not be possible to use the unhygienic meat from the
existing unsatisfactory and obsolete abattoirs at Algiers, Oran or Annaba.
The abattoir is designed so that it can initially operate efficiently with a
small output (one slaughter team killing either cattle or sheep sequentially).
Throughput can be doubled simply by adding a second slaughter team to work
concurrently, but there will still be sufficient refrigeration capacity since
fresh carcass imports will be reduced as domestic supply increases.
6.11      Other benefits of the abattoirs would be as follows.  The abattoirs
will make a start in providing clean meat for the urban population. Algeria
has a rapidly expanding urban population who will require clean hygienic meat
as in other developing industrial countries. It is hoped that the munici-
palities would themselves build similar abattoirs, and that as a result of
the Project, the EEC code of regulations agreed at negotiations for ONAB's
meat complexes (para. 3.29) would also be adopted and practiced for all new
abattoirs.
Meat Products and By-Products Plants
6.12      The meat-products plant will make efficient use of trimmings and
edible offal.  It can also use frozen imported meat as a raw material.
Meat products are particularly scarce in Algeria which as a Muslim country
cannot import products containing pork. By using old hens culled from ONAB's
poultry operations, the plant will produce products not otherwise available
in Algeria. The by-products plant will make use of abattoir waste and bones
from imported carcasses that would otherwise be wasted.
Conclusion
6.13       From the foregoing it is clear that ONAB will use a mix of raw
materials, and distribute to both institutional and private consumers. In so
far as the actual product mix is different from that assumed in the Project
calculations the economic benefits of the Project would change. If ONAB uses
its quasi-monopolistic position only to increase domestic livestock purchases,
instead of increasing production through fattening, then the Project abattoir
will slaughter animals which would any way have been slaughtered and distri-
buted by the comparatively efficient, though unhygienic, private sector. In
this case the only benefit to the economy will be provision of clean meat,
whereas the economic success of the Project really depends on how much addi-
tional meat ONAB could produce, import and distribute into the economy.

C. Economic Rate of Return
Project Economic Rate of Return
6.14       The Project would have an overall Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
of about 50% over a 17 year life (1980-96). lncluding consumer gains (para.
6.16) the ERR would be about 60%. The large proportion of the total invest-
ment accounted for by the meat complexes has a major impact on the overall
ERR, so the sheep fattening and the meat complexes are therefore discussed
separately in the following section. However, certain assumptions are common
to both major Project components. It was intended to carry out a full shadow
pricing analysis but in the case of Algeria the price distortions resulting
from quantitative controls are so great as to make the analysis almost meaning-
less. A shadow exchange rate has been estimated of DA4.80:US$1.00 which is
20% higher than the financial exchange rate of DA4.00:US$1.00 used in the
Project financial calculations. However it is quite possible that this rate
misestimates the opportunity cost of foreign exchange, so shadow rates which
are 20% lower, 20% and 67% higher than the shadow rate adopted have also
been used in the sensitivity analysis. The Project remains thoroughly viable
irrespective of the exchange rate adopted.
Economic Return from Fattening
6.15      The small sheep fattening operation has a ERR of 22% over 17 years
at the Shadow Exchange Rate (DA4.80:US$1.00) adopted. In estimating benefits
the economic cost of the sheep (weighing 20 kg) is assumed to be nil, and the
benefit is the 12 kg of liveweight gain (6.0 kg of meat) less 2% mortality
during fattening. The incremental mutton production has been valued at its
border price US$3.50/kg (DA16.80/kg at the shadow exchange rate adopted)
rather than the market price of DA35.00/kg. The value of 60 kg/ha nitrogen to
the subsequent wheat crop has been included in the calculation based on a 1985
border price for urea of US$192/ton. The sensitivity of the fattening compo-
nent to changes in the shadow exchange rate is shown in Table 6.1.
Economic Return from Meat Complex
6.16      Without the Project, imports could not increase and per capita
consumption of red meat would fall. Total per capita consumption of meat
would only rise from 11.2 kg/head to 12.5 kg/head, compared with a potential
demand of 15.1 kg/head (Table 5.4).  Wholesale and retail market prices would
rise steeply in constant value terms.  The Project will permit per capita meat
consumption to rise to 13.7 kg, but there will still be an apparent supply gap
in 1985 of about 30,000 tons. Mission calculations indicate that assuming an
aggregate price elasticity of demand of 0.9, by 1985 prices are expected to
have increased in real terms by 31% without the Project but by only 16% with
the Project. The benefits of the Project comprise two parts:
(a) the gains to ONAB resulting from the lower purchase price
of imported meat compared to domestic meat; and



- 50 -
(b) the consumer gains due to the difference in consumer meat
prices without and with the Project referred to above.
6.17      In calculating benefits, border prices have been used for purchases
of incremental meat imports. Mutton purchased by the abattoirs from the
Project fattening component would be incremental and has been valued at the
border price i.e. the same price is used for purchases by the abattoir, as is
used for sales by the fattening unit (para 6.15). However, for fresh local
beef, where no incremental production is involved, the full market purchase
price (DA33.60/kg meat) has been used since each animal purchased by ONAB
represents one animal lost to the private sector. In this case, use of the
border price US$1.95/kg (DA9.36) would overvalue ONAB's contribution and
undervalue the cost to the economy of slaughtering domestic animals through
ONAB's abattoirs.  Given these assumptions the ERR of the meat complexes are
50% for Algiers and 60% for Oran and Annaba, taking into account only the
gains to ONAB. If the consumer gains are also taken into consideration the
ERRs are about 10% higher.
Sensitivity Analysis
6.18      The sensitivity of the Project to changes in shadow exchange rates,
prices and investment costs is set out in Table 6.1 which shows that both
the fattening operation and meat complexes are sound investments under all
likely circumstances. Results in general indicate little sensitivity to
increases in costs. On the other hand the ERR is fairly sensitive to changes
in total benefits.
Project Risk
6.19      The main risk involved in the Project concerns the proper selection
of a site for the meat complexes (para 3.16, 3.28-3.29). Specifically, it is
vital that the sites for the three meat complexes are selected and inspected
by the Bank prior to effectiveness of the Project. As already mentioned,
assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations (paras. 3.16, 3.28
and 3.29). Other risks affecting the meat complexes would be mainly concerned
with the competence of ONAB's management. Meat purchase and sales prices
would probably not be as critical as might be assumed from the sensitivity
analysis, since purchase and sales prices would be closely related. Moreover
ONAB is in a monopoly position to influence prices of frozen imported meat
(para 5.17).
6.20      For the livestock purchase, transit and fattening operation, there
are two main risks, first that shepherds on the Steppe would be unwilling
to sell their lambs and cull ewes, and second that the self-managed farms
would be unwilling to contract fatten as envisaged in the Project. In both
cases it is vital that in negotiating contracts, which will be subject to Bank
approval (para. 4.03), sufficient financial incentive is given to the Steppic
shepherds and to the members of the self-managed farms. The sheep component

offers enormous economic rewards if introduced on a national basis, and it is
vital that the small ONAB pilot enterprise is made to work. To this end the
full cooperation of MARA will be essential.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS AND LOAN CONDITIONS
7.01      During Negotiations assurances were obtained that:
(a) Consultants acceptable to the Bank will be employed to assist in
the preparation of tender documents, evaluation of tenders and
to supervise construction of the meat complexes (para 3.18);
(b) all technical assistance provided under the Project will be
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. All civil
works and equipment will be procured in accordance with Bank
guidelines for procurement dated March 1977 (para 3.24);
(c) separate accounts will be kept for the Project, which will
be audited by SNC, an independent auditor acceptable to the
Bank. The auditor's annual report will be forwarded to the
Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year (para
3.27);
(d) the procurement specifications already prepared for effluent
disposal from the meat complexes will be included in the
tender documents (para 3.28);
(e) the meat complexes will be constructed and operated accord-
ing to EEC standards of hygiene except as appropriately
modified by agreement between the Bank and ONAB (para 3.29);
(f) ONAB will strengthen the organization and staffing within
its Red Meat Production Division and that a three-man
consultant agricultural team, acceptable to the Bank, will
be appointed for three years to assist ONAB in developing
sheep fattening on medic pastures (para 4.02);
(g) agreements between ONAB and participating self-managed farms
for sheep fattening will be on terms and conditions satis-
factory to the Bank, and will include adequate incentives to
ensure satisfactory participation by the self-managed farms
(para. 4.03);
(h) consultants satisfactory to the Bank, will be recruited for
three years to provide a five person in-service training team
during initial operations of the meat complexes (para 4.07);



- 53 -
(i)  financial consultants acceptable to the Bank will be recruited
to improve ONAB's financial procedures, and to establish cost
accounting (para 4.09);
(j) the activities concerning the purchase, transit and fattening
of sheep and of the meat complexes will be fully monitored
(para 4.10); and
(k)  semi-annual reports on the progress of the Project, and a
final report not later than six months after its completion,
will be prepared and sent to the Bank (para 4.11).
7.02      Effectiveness of the Loan will be conditional on the acquisition of
site locations acceptable to the Bank for the Algiers, Oran, and Annaba meat
complexes (para 3.16), and on the employment of consultants (para 3.17).
7.03      Recommendation.  With the above assurances and agreements, the
Proposed Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$42 million to ONAB for a
term of 17 years including 4 years of grace.
