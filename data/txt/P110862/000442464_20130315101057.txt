                           RESTRUCTURING PAPER
           IRAQ: PUBLIC FINANCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT (P110862):
                   (GRANT TF094552) (RECIPIENT-EXECUTED)



     A. SUMMARY

1.      This Restructuring Paper proposes a Level II restructuring to (a) add a new
component, namely the “Integrated Financial Management Information System
(IFMIS)?; (b) re-allocation of Grant proceeds; and, (c) extend the project closing date, at
the request of the Recipient.

2. During the Mid-Term Review of the project in August 2011, it was agreed with the
Government that the Project’s impact would be significantly enhanced if an IFMIS is also
implemented. Component 1 on Budget Preparation and Component 3 on Budget
Execution Controls can deliver better results if implemented together with IFMIS. Under
the new IFMIS Component, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) plans to develop,
commission and test the prototype of IFMIS. Down the road, the Government also plans
to roll-out IFMIS to all public sector entities including all ministries, treasuries, spending
units and governorates at its own cost.

3.     The project’s original closing date was June 30, 2013. The Government has
requested for a 3-months extension to the project closing date citing the reason that the
implementation of the Project could not start until mid-2011 due to three terrorist attacks
on the premises of the Ministry of Finance. With regard to the extension, given that the
Iraq Trust Fund is closing on 31 December 2013, we are requesting an extension up to 31
August 2013.

     B. PROJECT STATUS

4.      The Iraq Public Financial Management (PFM) project was started as an
emergency operation in July 2009 under the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF). The project is to be
completed in June 2013. The total estimated cost of the Project is US$18 million: i)
US$16 million to be Recipient-executed; and ii) US$2 million to be Bank-executed on
behalf of the Recipient. Under the Recipient-executed part, against the project cost of $16
million, $3.6 million (23 %) has been disbursed. Under the Bank-executed part, against
the project cost of $2 million, the entire $2 million (100 %) has been disbursed. Against
the total project cost of $18 million, $5.6 million (31 %) has been disbursed.

5.      The progress made under the Recipient-executed part is as follows:

     a) Component 1- Strengthening Budget Preparation: The inception reports for
        (a) improving the budget strategy, content of and adherence to the Budget Call
        Circular (BCC), and, (b) improving the methodology of investment project
        preparation and evaluation, have been prepared.
     b) Component 2 – Strengthening Public Procurement: Under the assignment on
        developing the Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs), National Implementation
                                              6
        Manual (NIM), and Training Curriculum, draft outputs have been prepared.
        Similarly, a workshop on international arbitration was organized to inform the
        national stakeholders about international best practices. A contract for the
        Training Needs Assessment has recently been signed and the work is about to
        begin.
     c) Component 3 – Strengthening Budget Execution: Consultants have submitted
        their draft final reports on Cash Management and Commitment Control Systems.
        The procurement process for the organization of internal financial controls is
        ongoing and a contract for upgrading the MOF website for enhancing citizen’s
        access on fiscal data has recently been signed.
     d) Component 4 – Capacity Development: Consultants have prepared the Capacity
        Development Plan of the Ministry of Finance Accounting Training Center
        (MoFATC), which has been recently approved by the government. The actual
        capacity building work is expected to start soon.

6.      Initially, there were significant delays in procuring goods and signing consultancy
services contracts. The payment approval procedure used was not appropriate and led to
delays in payments. Accordingly, the last ISR rating of the Project in April 2012 was
Moderately Unsatisfactory. However, as per Bank’s task team’s advice, the payment
approval system has now been streamlined. The resignation of Finance Officer from the
project management team had led to a lack of an authorized signatory to issue payments,
which consequently led to payment delays. However, this issue stands resolved now. In
summary, the project has made some good physical progress under all components since
April 2012, but there have been delays in the payments, due to which disbursements have
not kept pace with the physical progress. The project has uncommitted funds of $6.78
million (44%) – but once the Government is able to sign the Integrated Financial
Management Information System (IFMIS) contract, all uncommitted funds would be
committed.

7.      The progress under the Bank-executed part has been as follows:

8.     Under the Bank-executed trust fund (BETF), US$2 million were allocated for the
technical assistance (TA) to support the implementation of the Grant and had two
components: (1) Strengthening Budget Preparation, and (2) Capacity Development of the
Board of Supreme Audit (BSA). All of the US$2 million allocated funds for the BETF
have been fully utilized and all planned activities completed. At the Government request,
a proposal for Additional Financing of $621,500 has been prepared for the approval of
the management. The component-wise progress is as follows:


     a) Component 1 – Strengthening Budget Preparation: A fully functional Medium
        Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) has been developed and has been used for
        preparing budget strategies for 2011-13; 2012-14; and 2013-15. The Iraqi
        Medium-term Fiscal (IMF) model is also operational and being tested for the
        budget strategy for the ‘2012-14’ period. A comprehensive historical database of
        fiscal information is in place. The budget preparation process improved with an
        increasingly detailed policy focus during strategy discussions. The use of the IMF
        Model has delivered MoF the capability to undertake research on policy
                                             7
         components of the budget; trend analysis; and to fine-tune the top-down setting of
         fiscal envelopes.

      b) Component 2 - Capacity Development of the Board of Supreme Audit (BSA):
         The program aimed at building capacity, improving key audit practices and
         methodologies. The BSA staff has enhanced their skills in financial, risk-based,
         procurement, and performance audit. In addition, capacity has built around special
         subjects such as oil audit, forensic audit, arbitration, contract management,
         auditing of World Bank-financed projects, and Monitoring and Evaluation. The
         program has trained about 270 auditors, including 10 master trainers investing
         about 10,500 training hour. It has developed one audit manual and improved
         another. Moreover, it provided the BSA with solid recommendations on how to
         proceed at a number of areas from peer SAIs and experts who had experienced a
         similar reform process.

      Extension of the Project Closing Date:

9.      The Government of Iraq, Ministry of Finance, has requested extension of the
project closure date citing that the implementation of the Project could not start until mid-
2011 because the premises of the Iraqi Ministry of Finance were exposed to three terrorist
attacks, which resulted in delaying the project. They have said that continuous fragile
security situation in Iraq posed a challenge for foreign consultants who found it risky to
travel to Iraq. While in Iraq, the security situation restrained their movements and the
time for which they could meet the government counterparts.

10.     From the perspective of Bank’s task team, while the security has indeed caused
some implementation delays, there have been several other factors contributing to slow
progress. However, the main reason why the extension is necessary is that as a
restructuring process, a new component IFMIS is being added which requires a minimum
9 months’ time to be completed. At best, the above implementation schedule could be
reduced to 8 months. The task team, therefore, recommends extension of the project
closure date until 31 August 2013. These two extra months would enable the government
to ensure completion of ongoing activities in a timely and orderly manner. If this
extension is not given, the project objectives will be difficult to achieve. This is the first
and last extension of the project. A detailed explanation on the extension of project
closing date is included in Annex 3.

  C. PROPOSED CHANGES

11.      Results/indicators. See Revised Annex 1 below.

12.    Components. It is proposed to introduce a new Component 5 on Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) to the Project. Following is the
description of this component.


NEW Component 5 – Integrated Financial Management Information System
(IFMIS) ($6,000,000)
                                              8
13.     The Ministry of Finance, Government of Iraq, wants to implement IFMIS in two
phases:
    a) Phase 1 – Prototype Development and Testing for the Supply and Implementation
        of Integrated Financial Management Information System to be conducted in the
        period January 2013 to August 31, 2013, and
    b) Phase 2 – Pilot Implementation and Government wide Rollout based on the
        results of phase 1 comprising:
           i.   Phase2A – Pilot Implementation – To commence on January 1, 2014 and
                conclude on December 31, 2014
          ii. Phase 2B – Government wide Rollout – To commence January 1, 2015
                and be completed by June 30, 2016.

14.    The Project would support only Phase 1 of this plan. Following the evaluation of
Phase 1, the Ministry of Finance, Government of Iraq, will implement the IFMIS
Government wide system in Phase 2 with other resources. The IFMIS would magnify the
impact of other components of the project in the following manner:

   a) Provide capability to automate the budget preparation process to ensure complete
      and accurate budget formulation and presentation (support Component 1);
   b) Increase the ability of the Ministry of Finance to undertake central control and
      monitoring of expenditure and receipts in government Ministries, departments and
      spending units (support Component 3); and
   c) Provide the Ministry of Finance with access to comprehensive and meaningful
      information on budgetary, financial and operational performance during the
      financial year (support Components 1 and 3).

15.     The Bank’s task team has been engaged in a policy dialogue with the government
on IFMIS since August 2011. The IMF too has participated in this dialogue.
Implementation of the IFMIS was part of the Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) of IMF. The
Government has shown commitment to implement IFMIS which was evident from their
participation in a series of workshops organized by the Bank. A 30-member delegation
from the government participated in the Stakeholder’s workshop in Beirut in May, 2012,
wherein after detailed deliberations, the functional and technical specifications of the
IFMIS system were agreed upon. An agreement was signed with the Bank on the
roadmap and detailed technical and functional specifications. The Government has
clearly stated that “the Ministry of Finance is ready to participate in providing funds from
its budget for implementing IFMIS, over and above what can be provided, by the World
Bank, under the Iraq PFM Project.?

16.     From a historical perspective, it may be pertinent to note that in 2003, the
Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had
conducted assessments that identified a need for improvements in the Government of Iraq’s
(GoI) budget and financial control system. These assessments found that the GoI financial
structure provided limited ability to monitor Iraqi ministerial budgets and expenditures,
leaving the ministries vulnerable to fraud, waste, and misappropriation of funds. The CPA,
which then managed the budget, conceived the Iraqi Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS) as a solution to manage and oversee the GoI budget. The U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) was instructed by the CPA to implement an Iraqi

                                             9
financial management information system, which entered into a broad-based contract with
BearingPoint, Inc. for that purpose. IFMIS represented only a small part of the total effort
and estimated cost under the contract. Bearing Point, in turn, provided a sub-contract to
FreeBalance to develop the design of IFMIS. Subsequently, during 2007-2009, Bearing
Point gave 11 Technical Assistance Orders (TAOs) to FreeBalance for maintaining the
ongoing operation of the system, mainly for BearingPoint staff, so that they knew how to
do it and could explain to GoI. In July 2007, the U.S. Embassy in Iraq ordered the
suspension of the IFMIS project because the BearingPoint project leader and his security
detail had been kidnapped and the GoI lacked support for the system.

17.    The task under this Project is to build on a system that was implemented under the
USA Department of Treasury financing of about $30 million, where the Free Balance
System was used by the main contractor (Bearing Point). The Ministry of Finance,
Government of Iraq, after having used the FreeBalance system earlier, wants to continue
using it in future, with some upgradation and customization as per their specific
requirements. Considering that the US Department of Treasury had indicated that they
were no more interested in funding the PFM Project, the Government of Iraq has turned
to the Bank as the financier of last resort. The Government is satisfied with the Free
Balance Accountability software for which there is availability of trained Iraqi staff
which is familiar with the system.

18.    The Ministry of Finance wants to use the FreeBalance Accountability Suite v7.0
configured in accordance with the Government of Iraq requirements to provide
automated financial management capability in the Budget Preparation and Budget
Execution functions. The proposed IFMIS will be based on implementation of the
required modules of the Commercial Off-the Shelf (COTS) FreeBalance Inc.
Accountability Suite version 7 with minimal customization.

19.     The proposed IFMIS will include Common Application requirements across all
modules, including user access and responsibility controls, the General Ledger Module
incorporating a Budget Classification Structure (Chart of Accounts) suitable for Iraq, a
Budget Preparation Module (including provision to upload approved budget for
execution) and a Budget Execution Module which incorporates appropriate business
processes, Commitment Control and Accounting, Expenditure Processing and Payment,
Revenue recording (Tax, Non-Tax, Grant, Loan), and Cash Management, Banking and
Reconciliation functions. Finally, the IFMIS will provide Financial Reporting for
management purposes and to meet GFS and IPSAS reporting requirements by developing
specific reports for Iraq circumstances.

20.     The award of contract to FreeBalance for the development and testing of IFMIS
prototype has been approved by the OPRC with the direction that the contract will be
revised based on its comments and will be cleared by the RPM. The contract is currently
undergoing revision by the government and will be submitted to the RPM for clearance
after the directions of the OPRC have been fully complied with. This is expected by
January 31, 2013.

21.    In the unlikely event that the Bank does not approves this contract, a System
Requirement Study (SRS) for implementing IFMIS would be conducted as an

                                            10
independent assignment, the outputs of which, could be used by the government for
designing the prototype, piloting and rolling-out of IFMIS, after this project is completed.

Cost of implementing IFMIS:

22.      The cost of developing and testing IFMIS prototype will be as follows:

      a) Cost for development and testing of prototype: Approximately US$4,900,000 will
         be required for the acquisition of the IFMIS, including the initial System
         Requirements Studies and subsequent Supply, Installation, and Commissioning of
         the FreeBalance Accountability Suite V9.0 at Select Ministries, Treasuries, and
         Independent Boards of the Government of Iraq.

      b) Acquisition of ICT hardware for the system operation:
           i.    Establishing the Data Centre for the IFMIS: US$700,000
          ii. Establishing the Disaster Recovery Site: US$300,000

      c) Consultant’ services:
            i.  Engaging an international ICT specialist US$60,000
           ii. Engaging a local PFM specialist US$40,000.

23.    Accordingly, a total funding of US $6,000,000 will be required for this new
component. The Ministry of Finance, Government of Iraq, has agreed to finance
additional requirements for computer hardware, networks and on-site development in the
pilot ministries and agencies.

Financing:

24.      Funding for the new component will come from the Project’s Unallocated
Category. The initial large unallocated amount of US$ 2.82 million was appropriate at the
start of the project, as the cost estimates did not include the numerous “downstream?
activities which were likely to arise from the consultant outputs, and, prior to those
outputs, it was not possible to accurately estimate the costs for these activities. However,
a number of the downstream activities did not materialize as expected, and other planned
activities have been modified or cancelled. As a result, this unallocated amount has risen
to US$ 7.00 million, which is sufficient to finance the IFMIS.

Financial Management:

26.    Project will continue using the same financial management and disbursement
arrangements, including accounting and reporting, internal controls, auditing and
budgeting. There are no overdue audit reports or overdue financial reports. The audit
report with audited financial statements and management letter for the year ended
December 31, 2011 were submitted to timely to the Bank. The external auditor has issued
unqualified “clean? opinions.

Re-allocation of Proceeds:

27.    The proposed restructuring will be accompanied with reallocation of uncommitted
and unallocated funds under the project for the new component 5 of IFMIS. The
proposed re-allocation of proceeds under different categories of consultancy, goods and
incremental operating costs is included in Annex 2.

Procurement Management:

28.   Procurement for this project will continue to be carried out in accordance with the
World Bank’s Procurement Guidelines as indicated in the Grant Agreement.

29.    Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under the new Component 5 estimated at
$1,000,000 includes ICT hardware, and will be added to the Procurement Plan as ICB
and NCB packages to be completed before closing date.

30.    Selection of Consultants: The new component would require initial System
Requirements Studies and subsequent Supply, Installation, and Commissioning of the
FreeBalance Accountability Suite V7.0 estimated at $4,900,000 to be added to the
Procurement Plan as Single Source selection as it is a buildup on previous FreeBalance
system installations, to benefit from the firm’s continued professional liability for the
system, and exceptional qualification for this specific assignment.

  D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY –

Economic and Financial

31.     The project, by introducing a modern PFM platform, will contribute to an
improved and more rigorous budget preparation process, provide a well regulated budget
execution methodology including control of cash resources, implement sounder
procurement and purchasing control and provide comprehensive and timely financial
reporting mechanisms subject to external audit. Improved business processes and
responsibility assignment within the IFMIS will help to minimize resource leakages, and
provide an accountability trail to identify those who indulge in leakages. The overall
fiscal impact of the project is, therefore, likely to be positive. Better overall resource
management, coordination amongst various government entities, and comprehensive and
timely available financial data will help to improve the allocation of public resources to
priority areas. A more efficient PFM system would curb irregularities in budget
execution; and generally improve fiscal transparency and accountability.

Technical

32.     FreeBalance is a global provider of software solutions for public financial
management (PFM). The FreeBalance Accountability Suite is a commercial off-the-
shelf, Government Resource Planning (GRP) solution which is implemented globally
within governments across the world. Customers include the governments of
Afghanistan, Antigua and Barbuda, Canada, Guyana, Iraq, Jamaica, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan,
Mongolia, Namibia, Pakistan, Palestine, Sierra Leone, Southern Sudan, Timor-Leste,
Uganda, and the USA.

33.     The FreeBalance Accountability Suite supports good fiscal practice and
internationally recognized standards such as the United Nations Common Functions of
Government (COFOG), the IMF Government Finance Statistics (GFS), the IMF Code of
Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency, Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International
Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), Millennium Challenge Corporation
(MCC), Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEF), and, the World Bank Treasury
Reference Model.

Social and Environment

34.     The proposed installation of IFMIS does not involve any physical structure or
construction, land acquisition and environmental impacts. IFMIS will be installed in the
existing government buildings. No new buildings are to be constructed. Only up-
gradation of existing computer rooms might be required before installation of IFMIS,
which is not expected to have an environmental impact. The project does not focus on
any particular population group. Therefore, the project will not trigger any environmental
and social safeguard policies. The project restructuring and additional financing is
classified as “Category C?.

                                           13
Risks

35.     The risks of adding a new component under the project through the proposed
restructuring are as follows:
    (a) Considering the Project closing date is June 30, 2013, the remaining time left
        under the project is only six months. If there are any delays at any stage of
        implementation, there is a risk that the task might not be completed within project
        time. As a mitigation measure, project closing date is being requested to be
        extended by 2 months.
    (b) The Government may not have the capacity to implement IFMIS as it requires an
        understanding of public financial management as well as complex and integrated
        IT systems. This may pose risk to the operations, management and sustainability
        of IFMIS. This risk will be mitigated by establishing a core group of functional
        and technical staff that would work with the FreeBalance team right from the first
        stage of system study and design. Also, the government project management team
        will be strengthened by recruitment of a new international ICT Advisor and Local
        PFM consultant.
    (c) The Government may not give timely clearances to interim deliverables of
        FreeBalance leading to implementation delays. As a mitigation measure, the
        Ministry of Finance has constituted an inter-departmental committee to review
        and clear the IFMIS software prototype.
    (d) There could be delays in procurement of hardware which is the responsibility of
        the government. If that happens, it would lead to an overall implementation delay.
        As a mitigation measure, the procurement process of hardware would be started
        soon after signing the contract with FreeBalance. The compatible technical
        specifications of the hardware have already been provided to the Government by
        FreeBalance.

2.     The Iraq PFM project was started in July 2009 and has to be completed by June
2013. Under the Recipient-executed part, against the project cost of $16 million, $2.46
million (15 %) has been disbursed. Under the Bank-executed part, against the project cost
of $2 million, $1.99 million (99.9 %) has been disbursed. Against the total project cost of
$18 million, $4.46 million (25 %) has been disbursed.

3.      Under the Recipient-executed part, the uncommitted funds are US$ 7.00 million,
which is about 44 % of the project cost. There is no additional requirement of funds
under the existing components and most funds are committed. There is no other purpose
for which the government wants to spend the uncommitted amount. Hence, the proposed
reallocation is necessary to provide funds for the new component 5 (IFMIS). It will be
done by reallocation of the uncommitted and unallocated funds under the project.
Considering the implementation of IFMIS will require additional funds under
consultancy, goods and incremental operating costs, commensurate increases have been
made in those categories as per above table.

 The US$ 1.6 million cited here is from the Allocation of Proceeds table in the Conformed Copy of the
Grant Agreement, and Annex 4 of the Emergency Project Paper (EPP) which at the time of Negotiations
was taken as 10% of the total Project cost. The larger figure cited earlier – US$ 2.82 million – is the figure
used in the EPP Annex 3 (Summary of Estimated Costs): refer to EPP Annex 3 Note 2, “..the bulk of the
Unallocated has been included in the Consultant Services category, as this category represents the majority
of the downstream activities.?

                            ANNEX 3: Extension of Closing Date


1.    The Iraq Public Financial Management (PFM) project was started as an
emergency operation in July 2009 under the Iraq Trust Fund (ITF). The project is to be
completed in June 2013. The total estimated cost of the Project is US$18 million: i)
US$16 million to be Recipient-executed; and ii) US$2 million to be Bank-executed on
behalf of the Recipient. Under the Recipient-executed part, against the project cost of
$16 million, $3.6 million (23 %) has been disbursed. Under the Bank-executed part,
against the project cost of $2 million, the entire $2 million (100 %) has been disbursed.
Against the total project cost of $18 million, $5.6 million (31 %) has been disbursed.

2.     The Government of Iraq, Ministry of Finance, has requested extension of the
project closure date citing that the implementation of the Project could not start until
mid-2011 because the premises of the Iraqi Ministry of Finance were exposed to three
terrorist attacks, which resulted in delaying the project. The continuous fragile security
situation in Iraq posed a challenge for foreign consultants who found it risky to travel to
Iraq on their respective assignments. While in Iraq, the security situation restrained their
movements and the time for which they could meet the government counterparts.

3.     The Government of Iraq, Ministry of Finance, has requested extension of the
project closure date citing that the implementation of the Project could not start until
mid-2011 because the premises of the Iraqi Ministry of Finance were exposed to three

situation in Iraq posed a challenge for foreign consultants who found it risky to travel to
Iraq on their respective assignments. While in Iraq, the security situation restrained their
movements and the time for which they could meet the government counterparts.

4.     The task team partly agrees with the justification provided by the Government and
feels that the adverse security situation has been one of the several reasons leading to a
slow pace of project implementation in the initial part of the project leading to less than
3 % disbursement at the time of mid-term review in August 2011. The project involves
inputs from international consultants, who find it extremely difficult to operate in the
prevalent security environment. There are delays in issuing visas and restrictions on
their movements in Iraq. The more substantive reasons for the implementation delays
were as follows:

  a)   Significant delay in procuring goods and signing consultancy services contracts.
  b)   The payment approval procedure adopted by the Project Management Team
       (PMT) was not appropriate and effectively delayed payment to consultants.
  c)   High level of uncommitted funds
  d)   Lack of full time staff
  e)   Lack of independent office for the PMT

5.     Most of above factors have now been rectified and proposed restructuring and
addition of a new component on IFMIS would enable the project to increase its
commitments to 100 %. From thereon, a good contract management and Bank’s
                                       27
supervision could ensure that the project is fully disbursed and the targeted results
achieved.

6.    However, the main reason why the extension is necessary is that as a restructuring
process, a new component IFMIS is being added which requires a minimum 9 months’
time to be completed. A Contract is about to be signed under which the 9-month
implementation schedule is as follows.


                  Activity/Milestone                        Time-Period

          (ii) System Requirement Study             January – March 2013

          (iii) Preparation of configuration        April – June 2013

          (iv) Establishment of ICT                 February – April 2013
          infrastructure

          (v) Testing of Prototype at MoF           July - August 2013


          (vi) Testing of Prototype at 5            August - September 2013
          Treasuries, 3 Line Ministries and
          Board of Supreme Audit

7.     At best, the above implementation schedule could be reduced to 8 months by
doing activities (v) and (vi) in parallel, during July-August 2013. The task team,
therefore, recommends extension of the project closure date until 31 August 2013. These
two extra months would enable the government to ensure completion of ongoing
activities in a timely and orderly manner. If this extension is not given, the project
objectives will be difficult to achieve. This is the first and last extension of the project.
