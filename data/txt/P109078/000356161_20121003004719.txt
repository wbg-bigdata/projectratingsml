F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

Overall the Catalytic Fund (CF) will help the Government of Mauritania to accelerate the
implementation of the Government's Education Sector Development Program (ESDP
2001-2010) in its entirety. Activities financed by the CF are within the ESDP's plan of
action over the period 2008-2010. CF would have the following more specific objectives:
(i) promote access to education, and improve equity and retention in the sector by
building additional classrooms in existing incomplete schools and through the acquisition

                                                vi
of equipment, furniture and the expansion of school feeding program; (ii) improve the
quality of the pedagogical content of the primary education and the internal efficiency of
the education system; and (iii) improve the quality of teaching and the internal efficiency
of education to improve monitoring and management of the education system.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       Country context. At the time of appraisal, Mauritania had experienced relatively
consistent growth between 2001 and 2005, averaging 4 percent. Fiscal policy, however,
was less stringent than expected, allowing for considerable extra-budgetary spending
(more than 20 percent of GDP in 2003), financed predominantly by central bank
advances. The government re-established macroeconomic stability by implementing
prudent monetary and fiscal policies, and made substantial progress in terms of
improving transparency in public expenditure management. Growth reached 11.7 percent
mostly due to the start of oil production 1. Strict observance of the fiscal and monetary
policy stances was instrumental in bringing 12-month inflation down to an average of 6.2
percent in 2006. Fiscal performance has been strong, reflecting the government’s revenue
collection efforts and sustained spending discipline. As a result, by end-2006, the basic
non-oil fiscal deficit was limited to 4.4 percent of non-oil gross domestic product (GDP).
However, approximately 47 percent of the population was still poor, with poverty
remaining a predominantly rural phenomenon. In 2004 the rural poor made up
approximately 75 percent of all of Mauritania’s poor. Given the discovery of oil
resources and an already stable macro-economy, increased public and private investment
was expected and thought to be leading to robust GDP growth. However, political
stability was undermined by a coup d’état in August 2008, which led to the suspension of
all Bank operations before project implementation could start. Elections took place on
July 18, 2009, the Bank re-engaged with the government on September 11, 2009 and the
first supervision mission took place in November 2009. Therefore, project start up was
delayed and implementation was carried out in a changed political environment
compared to appraisal.

2.      Sector Context. In April 1999, Mauritania adopted a sweeping reform of its
education system, which aimed at: (i) consolidating its education system with the
introduction of a single schooling track to help ensure full bilingual education; (ii)
strengthening lower secondary education by adding one additional year of schooling, and
introducing physics and information technology starting in years three and four; and (iii)
strengthening foreign language instruction 2.

3.      To meet the objectives of the new reform, the Government of Mauritania (GOM)
decided to take a comprehensive approach that would guide and support the evolution of
its schools. This decision led to the development of the “Education Sector Development
Program – ESDP?, adopted in 2001 and which covered the decade ahead. The ESDP was
in line with the letter of sectoral policy, had incorporated the national policy choices, and


1
  Oil revenues (including an exceptional signature bonus of US$l00 million) were estimated at US$223 million (10.9%
of non-oil GDP) in 2006.

                                                         1
defined the sector’s objectives and the different strategies to be adopted to meet these
objectives. In a sense, the ESDP played a dual role, serving as a policy tool as well as an
investment program that harmonized donor interventions in the education sector.

4.      By the time of project preparation, the combination of economic growth,
increased education expenditures and the satisfactory implementation of the ESDP led to
improved access to basic education. Primary school enrollment rates had increased from
88.6 percent in 2001-2002 to 98 percent in 2006-2007, and gender equity had reached
parity when averaged out nationwide. For four consecutive years, girls’ gross enrollment
rate (GER) had exceeded that of boys, with girls’ GER at 100 percent compared to boys’
at 95.4 percent.

CAS objectives supported by the project/rational for Bank Assistance

5.      The Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 - 2011 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objectives
were in line with the second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-2, 2006 – 2010)
and focused on: (i) economic governance and public sector capacity; (ii) diversified
growth through investment climate improvement, and possibly key enabling
infrastructures through enclave operations; and (iii) continued efforts to fight poverty and
inequalities in both urban and rural areas. The CAS also supported the PRSP-2’s five
strategic pillars, of which Pillar III “Development of Human Resources and Expansion of
Basic Services? focused on “education?, “promotion of gender equity and the role of
women? and “universal access to basic services? amongst other priorities. The PRSP-2’s
priority actions for primary school included: (i) continuing the expansion and
restructuring of educational supply especially through the continuation of classroom
construction and teacher recruitment programs; (ii) increasing the number of schools that
can offer ongoing education (to 50 percent by 2010); (iii) involving the private sector (10
percent by 2010); and (iv) reducing gender and cross-regional disparities. Furthermore,
the CAS’ results framework included improved quality of education infrastructure and
improved quality of teaching as two of its objectives to support the PRSP-2’s Pillar III.

6.      Therefore, project interventions were in line with both the CAS and PRSP-2
objectives.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.      The higher level project PDO was that the project would help the Government of
Mauritania accelerate the implementation of the Government's Education Sector
Development Program (ESDP 2001-2010) in its entirety and the activities financed by the
CF were within the ESDP's 2008-2010 action plan. The project would have the following
more specific objectives: (i) promote access to education, and improve equity and
retention in the sector by building additional classrooms in existing, incomplete schools
and through the acquisition of equipment, furniture and the expansion of the school
feeding program; (ii) improve the quality of the pedagogical content of primary education
and the internal efficiency of the education system; and (iii) improve the quality of




                                             2
teaching and the internal efficiency of education to improve monitoring and management
of the education system.

8.     The key indicators used to monitor impact of the project and progress toward
achieving the PDO are indicated in the table below.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

9.      The PDO was not revised during the project period. However, the list of PDO-
level indicators was updated as part of the 2010 restructuring paper that extended the
closing date from June 30, 2010 to September 30, 2011. Reasons for including two new
PDO-level indicators were to: (i) have a means to measure equity; and (ii) to retrofit the
project with one of the Bank’s relevant core indicators. The two new indicators were: (i)
ratio of girls to boys in primary education; and (ii) number of direct project beneficiaries,
with the percentage of females provided.

  The data provided in the ISRs during the project period was incorrect. The MNE official data shows that the baseline
for 2008 was 50.3 percent and the 2010 target was 50.5 percent (not 55 percent as originally stated) since the overall
proportion of females in the total population according to the 2011 MICS survey is 52 percent.

  The project was retrofitted with this indicator when the Bank began to include project beneficiaries as a core indicator.

from new classrooms and/or incentives; (iii) villagers who benefitted from new
classrooms in their communities; and (iv) MNE’s student assessment unit staff.

1.5 Original Components

11.    The project had three main components:

12.     Component 1: Promote Access to Education and Improve Equity and
Retention in the sector (US$9.14 million). This component supported: (i) construction
of classrooms, giving priority to incomplete primary schools to be able to offer six grade
levels, and the acquisition of equipment and furniture for such classrooms; (ii) training
parent associations in their involvement in school management; and (iii) expanding the
school feeding program to improve retention of students in areas where the poor are
concentrated.

13.     Component 2: Improve quality of the pedagogical content of primary
education and the efficiency of the education system (US$2.83 million). This
component supported: (i) the acquisition of three million textbooks aimed at increasing
the availability of textbooks and teachers' guides in schools; and (ii) acquisition of 75,000
instructional materials to supply small school libraries and reading corners.

14.      Component 3: Improve the quality of teaching and internal efficiency of
education (US$2.03 million). This component supported: (i) providing incentives to
encourage teachers who are teaching effectively (“prime de craie?) for a period of three
months; (ii) financing activities related to teacher evaluation to monitor the most
important aspects of classroom practices and teacher behavior (attendance, preparation of
lessons, planning of instructional time, student evaluation and interaction with parents);
and (iii) supporting improvements in the quality of student examination as well as the
activities of the student learning assessment unit (Cellule d’Evaluation des Acquis des
Elèves).

1.6 Revised Components

15.    The components were not revised during the life of the project

1.7 Other significant changes

16.    The project became effective on June 24, 2008 and on August 6, 2008, the project
was suspended for 13 months due to a coup d’état. Elections took place on July 18, 2009
and the Bank officially re-engaged with the GOM on September 11, 2009.

17.     There was a level 2 project restructuring approved on June 9, 2010, which
extended the project closing date from June 30, 2010 to September 30, 2011, giving the
project an additional 15 months for implementation. This was requested because once the
Bank re-engaged with the GOM, there were only nine months remaining for project
implementation and none of the project activities had been completed.



                                             4
18.     There was a second level 2 project restructuring approved on September 20, 2011
that extended the project closing date to March 31, 2012. This extension was requested
to: (i) complete the school construction that had been delayed due to heavy rain and
flooding; and (ii) finalize the acquisition of student desks and textbooks.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.     Project Preparation: In 2008, the Bank team prepared, appraised and approved
the project in four months using Education for All – Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI)
procedures relevant at that time. There was a need to submit the project document by the
time of EFA-FTI Board’s spring submission deadline in order to secure the US$14
million project financing. Efforts to meet this deadline negatively affected the preparation
team’s ability to take advantage of reviews that could have guided project design and
scope. However, the preparation and appraisal team included Bank technical experts that
were appropriate for the development of the project as well as technical experts from the
donor community in Mauritania. The preparation team used sectoral studies 5 and ongoing
IDA projects to guide the conceptualization of this project. However, the preparation
team did not finalize and disclose the Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF) as indicated in the project document. The risk assessment did not identify
potential government instability or MNE capacity constraints related to procurement.
These aspects were the areas that ultimately created implementation challenges for the
project.

20.    Project Design: The project design fit into the ESDP, PRSP-2 and the Bank’s
CAS, all of which supported equitable access, developing human resources, improving
governance and building capacity. The project was designed to support the ten-year
ESDP with a results framework that included sector-wide indicators to measure progress
and was linked to the government’s ESDP objectives and goals. Linking project results
frameworks to a country’s larger education sector goals and objectives was typical of
EFA-FTI projects at that time. The project design also included implementation
mechanisms that were based on an established government structure and built on the
successful experience of the community-based construction approach. This approach was
applied under the IDA-funded Education Sector Support Program (Cr. 3573-MAU) and
successfully contributed to the building of 1,802 classrooms.

21.     While the project fit within the Mauritania ESDP: (i) the PDO was complex; (ii)
indicator targets were sometimes inaccurately calculated or reported; (iii) there were too

many activities for a two–year period and insufficient resources to finance all planned
activities 6; and (iv) there were inconsistencies in the project documentation.

22.      Quality at Entry: As previously mentioned, the need to meet the EFA-FTI Board
submission deadline did not leave sufficient time to conduct a Quality Enhancement
Review for the project. Furthermore, the requirements for EFA-FTI project preparation in
2008 did not include quality reviews. However, the project would have benefited from a
quality review that offered recommendations on project design, particularly given the
limited resources and the need to strategically use those resources. The project would
have benefitted from a review that recommended narrowing the scope of the project,
simplifying the PDO and strengthening the results framework. The project also lacked
important details related to the: (i) teacher evaluation mechanism; (ii) student assessment
activities; and (iii) interventions to improve efficiency. This was in part due to the short
four month preparation period.

2.2 Implementation

23.     There were several exogenous factors that affected project implementation. The
project became effective in June 2008. Shortly thereafter, in August 2008, there was a
coup d’état and all Bank operations were suspended for over a year until the Bank re-
engaged with Mauritania in September 2009. By September 2009, there were only nine
months remaining until the project closing in June 30, 2010. In June 2010 the project
closing was extended for the first time to September 30, 2011. During the period of the
coup d’état, project implementation was stopped. In 2010, there was also a reshuffling of
the ministries in charge of basic education, which meant that the project implementation
unit, the “Direction des Projets Education et Formation – DPEF?, was moved from the
Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development to the newly created State Ministry in
Charge of Education. This change created a new reporting structure for the DPEF. There
were also four different DPEF directors over the life of the project, which resulted in loss
of continuity and institutional memory and affected project implementation. Finally, the
2010 floods slowed down school construction and the distribution of some student desks,
which led to an extension of the project closing date to March 31, 2012. All of these
exogenous factors presented challenges for project implementation.

24.      After re-engagement, the DPEF prepared an updated procurement and action plan
and project implementation began again, albeit slower than anticipated. Management and
procurement capacity within the DPEF was weakened by all the staffing changes and led
to implementation delays: (i) textbook acquisition took two years to complete due to
bidder complaints and contractual issues between the government and the firm; (ii)
procurement of desks was delayed due to bidder complaints and contractual issues; and
(iii) the school feeding program was delayed for one year because the World Food
Program (WFP) and the Bank needed to develop and agree on a subsidiary agreement


6
  Project costing during preparation underestimated the actual resources required to fully implement all activities
outlined in the project document. However, exchange rate gains helped ensure that those activities that were
implemented had adequate resources.


                                                            6
before being able to procure and distribute food to school canteens. Despite these
exogenous and endogenous difficulties, the project, which was under active
implementation for a total of 30 months, was able to: (i) complete and inspect 600
classrooms, which increased the percentage of schools offering six years of primary
education; (ii) deliver 30,000 student desks to the regional education offices (Direction
Régionale de l’Education Nationale - DREN), which exceed the original target by 9,900,
and was due to a pledge by the president to distribute more student desks 7; (iii) carry out
the school feeding activity that helped feed 149,609 children; (iv) train some parent
associations on canteen management and hygiene; (v) train approximately ten staff
members from the student learning assessment unit; (vi) purchase approximately three
million textbooks; and (vii) support the teacher incentive scheme (“prime de craie?) for a
three month period. At the time of project closing, the textbooks had just been delivered
to the central warehouse. By completion of the ICR, however, the textbooks had not been
delivered to the schools for the start of the 2012/13 school year.

25.      There were some activities that were not implemented due to an ambitious project
design, a limited implementation period, and insufficient resources to finance all planned
activities and inaccurate costing 8 . Activities that were not implemented were: (i)
financing the development of a teacher evaluation mechanism to monitor classroom
practice and behavior; (ii) improving the quality of student assessment; (iii) training
parent associations to become effectively involved in school management; and (iv)
procuring 75,000 instructional materials for school libraries and reading corners.

26.     The Bank conducted yearly supervision missions and worked with the
government to restart implementation after the 2008 suspension. The Nouakchott-based
TTL was able to meet regularly with the DPEF, DSPC, MNE staff and other donors to
deal with ongoing issues. The project also disbursed 100 percent of project funds by the
closing date despite difficulties encountered during implementation. However, the quick
disbursement levels led the supervision team to rate the project satisfactory even though
some project activities, as mentioned in the Bank’s supervision reports, were not being
implemented or were delayed. The Bank also did not use the two restructuring
opportunities to redefine the PDO, modify inaccuracies in the results framework and
strengthen it with more relevant PDO and intermediate level project indicators, or reduce
the number of project activities since there were insufficient resources to implement them.
The Bank team also did not finalize the safeguards documentation and therefore could
not monitor safeguards compliance of project construction because there were no
safeguards tools available.




7
  The presidential pledge was explained to be in response to the large need of student desks, which exceeded the
numbers proposed as part of the original project design.
8
  Although the cost to build schools was affected by the rise in construction material prices, it was off-set by
approximately US$2.73 million exchange rate gains. The procurement of student desks came in lower than originally
anticipated but the savings per student desk were not sufficient to fully cover the additional 9,900 student desks
procured as part of the presidential pledge.


                                                         7
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

27.      M&E Design. The project results framework was developed to measure progress
toward achieving the Government’s ESDP (2001-2010) goals. However, the project
activities were only designed to be implemented between 2008 - 2010 and were a sub-
section of the overall activities within the ESDP. The data collection system used for the
results framework was an established government system that collects data for the
statistical yearbook and was used to track progress of the IDA-financed Education Sector
Development Program (Cr. 3573-MAU). This data system is the beginning of the
Education Management and Information System (EMIS) that the government has been
developing. The fully-integrated EMIS will be included in the next basic education
project due to begin in 2013. The M&E design also included: (i) a joint annual
government and donor meeting to review progress toward the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), data quality and timely reporting; and (ii) government submission to the
Bank of quarterly progress reports. These M&E mechanisms were appropriate to measure
project progress.

28.     M&E implementation. The indicators in the results framework were monitored
and reported on during implementation. The DPEF was originally selected to collect and
monitor project data for the results framework. However, the DPEF did not have the
capacity to collect this data on a regular basis. Therefore, the Bank and the government
agreed to use the government’s statistical unit (Direction des Statistiques, de la
Planification et Coordinnation - DSPC) as the unit to provide project education data
since they are responsible for all education data. DSPC uses an existing system, which
was developed with the support of UNICEF to produce the statistical yearbooks. This
data is used by MNE to inform policy decisions made throughout the education system in
Mauritania. As mentioned, the project was designed to use the joint government and
donor annual reviews to monitor and evaluate progress toward the MDGs and validate
data. However, after the 2008 coup d’état, these joint annual reviews were discontinued
by the government, leaving it to the Bank or the Lead Donor (currently the French
Development Agency) to bring together the various donors involved in the education
sector. As a result, there was limited joint government/donor monitoring of the project or
the ESDP. The quarterly progress reports were provided to the Bank although often later
than required under the Grant agreement and did not include an in-depth data analysis.
This was in large part due to the rapid change in DPEF directors and associated staff
changes, which also affected the Bank’s ability to properly monitor project performance.
Despite all of these changes, the government did continue to collect data on a regular
basis albeit with delays in reporting.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

29.     Fiduciary Compliance. The fiduciary aspects of the project were handled by the
DPEF, which was adequately staffed to satisfactorily carry out the project’s financial
management functions. The DPEF prepared and submitted the required quarterly interim
financial reports on time. The annual audit reports were also received on time, revealed
no irregularities and were unqualified. Financial management of the project was



                                            8
consistently rated satisfactory. The project had adequate procurement staff, although their
capacity could have been strengthen with regard to the preparation of bidding documents
and bid evaluation process. This weakness became evident when complaints were filed
questioning a firm’s ability to fulfill the school desks contract. Although the complaints
were satisfied, the winning firm did struggle to deliver the agreed number of desks and to
meet the delivery deadline. Resolving procurement complaints coupled with weak
supplier capacity resulted in an extended procurement process and delays in delivering
the desks. Similar difficulties were also encountered during the procurement of textbooks.

30.     Safeguards. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) indicated that an
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was prepared during project
preparation and the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) rated safeguards as satisfactory
throughout implementation. However, the ICR team could only find an early draft of the
ESMF in the project files, and there was no indication that an ESMF was ever disclosed
in-country or the InfoShop. Moreover, the DPEF did not have knowledge of the need to
prepare an ESMF. Although the ESMF was never completed or disclosed, the
government did confirm that engineers supervised school construction in keeping with
standards issued by the Ministry of Environment. In addition, a post-construction review
was carried out, which indicated that all construction adhered to the norms established by
the Ministry of Environment. The review confirmed that there was no loss of livelihood
or long-lasting environmental damage. It also confirmed that all school construction was
carried out on existing school grounds to either extend existing schools or replace make-
shift schools, and did not involve the purchase of land. However, the norms established
by the Ministry of Environment have not been reviewed by Bank safeguards specialists
and therefore cannot take the place of an ESMF. The ICR team discussed the possibility
of carrying out an environmental audit. However, given that no ESMF was finalized, the
audit would not have had any points of reference and hence no measure of assessing
compliance. Based on the above, safeguards compliance is rated unsatisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

31.     A new Global Program for Education (GPE - formerly EFA-FTI) operation to
support basic education is under preparation with the involvement of the relevant
government entities and local partners. This project is expected to be delivered in FY13
and will build on the achievements and lessons learned of the previous operations in
Mauritania. The project will focus on quality of teaching and improvements in bi-lingual
education, which continues to be an impediment to improved quality and learning in
primary education, as well as access to lower secondary school. It will also focus on
specific inputs and define clear outcomes, while continuing to support the government’s
second phase of its ESDP (2011 – 2020).

32.     Institutional arrangement for the next operation. The DPEF is in charge of
project preparation and will also be responsible for implementation 9. This will ensure a
smooth transition between projects. The new project will also continue to use the DSPC,


9
    This will be done in close collaboration with the Bank and the French Development Agency, which is the lead donor


                                                           9
which has a strong track record in collecting, tracking and analyzing data, and help with
the establishment of a fully integrated monitoring system. Relying on these established
entities with their experience will ensure the appropriate support for the preparation of
the new project. In addition, the Bank’s team will continue its close collaboration with
the government and donors. Preparation activities will also include assessing
procurement and financial management capacity of the DPEF and propose remedial
actions if necessary.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

33.     Relevance of Objectives. The higher level objective of the project, which was to
help the government accelerate the implementation of the ESDP (2001-2010), continues
to be relevant to the country needs as reflected in the ESDP, the PRSP-2 and the CAS.
The project-specific objectives of increasing access and improving equity, retention,
quality and efficiency also continue to be relevant to the PRSP-2 and the CAS.

34.     Relevance of Design. The project design contributed to accelerating the
government’s education sector program by: (i) increasing the availability of classrooms
through school construction; (ii) improving the quality of education through the
acquisition of additional textbooks; (iii) keeping children in school by offering meals as
part of the school feeding program; and (iv) motivating teachers through the provision of
incentives. However, the project design had a complex PDO, a weak overall results
framework without enough project relevant PDO and intermediate level indicators, too
many activities to implement in two years, inadequate resources, and no safeguards
instrument. Based on the above, the relevance of project design is judged to be modest.

35.     Relevance of Implementation. The relevance of implementation for the project
is judged to be modest. The project design used existing MNE structures to implement
the overall project, which included the DPEF and DSPC. Both of these units had been
involved in previous Bank-supported operations. The project also used the World Food
Program (WFP) to implement the school feeding program thereby capitalizing on WFP’s
established process for delivering food to schools and communities. All of these
structures were properly selected for implementation. However, by using existing units
within the MNE, implementation delays occurred due to: (i) changes within the education
ministry structure that led to issues of project ownership and continuity; (ii) capacity
constraints caused by DPEF staff changes; and (iii) Bank and WFP bureaucratic
procedures associated with the school feeding program. In addition, the Bank did not use
the two restructuring opportunities to limit the scope of the PDO or project activities, nor
did it revise and strengthen the results framework and indicators. It also did not monitor
school construction from a safeguards perspective because there was no Bank safeguards
documentation.




                                            10
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

36.     The higher level objective of the project is judged to be substantial. This can be
seen by the project’s support of the ESDP action plan, which included constructing
classrooms, training parent associations in school management, expanding the school
feeding program, acquiring textbooks, teachers’ guides and library reading materials, and
providing teacher incentives. Achievement of the project specific objectives: (i) promote
access to education, and improve equity and retention in the sector by building additional
classrooms in existing, incomplete schools and through the acquisition of equipment,
furniture and the expansion of the school feeding program; (ii) improve the quality of the
pedagogical content of primary education and the internal efficiency of the education
system; and (iii) improve the quality of teaching and the internal efficiency of education
to improve monitoring and management of the education system, are judged to have been
modest.

37.     Promotion of access, improved equity and retention. These goals were to be
measured by the PDO indicators: (i) access to grade 1 of primary education (%) – GIR
and (ii) ratio of girls to boys in primary school (%). The original results framework did
not include primary school retention rates; however this indicator is monitored by the
government as part of the ESDP and therefore has been included in the ICR analysis.

38.     The percentage of students with access to grade 1 of primary school increased
from 108.5 percent to 112 percent by 2012 10 and the ratio of girls to boys increased from
50.3 percent in 2008 to 50.6 percent in 2012. The initial 55 percent target is incorrect 11
but was never changed to reflect the official 50.5 percent ESDP target. Therefore, the
ICR team considers this indicator to have surpassed its target. Available primary school
retention rate data indicates that retention rose from 58.6 percent in 2007/08 to 67.4
percent in 2011/12. This is a substantial increase over the three year implementation
period.

39.     The intermediate project indicators used to measure progress toward achieving the
access, equity and retention goals were: (i) primary schools offering a complete cycle
(%); (ii) percentage of girls’ enrollment in primary education in three disadvantaged
regions 12 ; (iii) implementing planning capacity through school mapping and other
planning mechanisms; and (iv) classroom construction. The project was successful in
completing the construction of 600 classrooms and meeting the end target. The school


10
   Although the Gross Intake Rate (GIR) increased, the achievement of this target cannot be assessed. The GIR target
provided in the ESDP was stated as 100 percent, which in fact refers to the Net Intake Rate (NIR). Therefore, the ICR
team cannot assess if the target was met. Table 8 provides a time series data of the GIR.
11
   The MNE official data shows that the baseline for 2008 was 50.3 percent and that 2010 target 50.5 percent. The end
target could not be 55 percent as mentioned in the project documentation because the percentage of females in the total
population was only 52 percent.
12
   Disadvantaged areas are areas identified by the Country Status Report as those with the lowest gross enrollment rates,
gross intake rates and girls’ enrollment, and include the wilayas of Guidimakha, Hodh el Charghi and Hodh el Gharbi.
They also belong to the six poorest regions (Assaba, Brakna, Gorgol, Hodh el Charghi and Hodh el Gharbi) as defined
by the PRSP-2 and associated poverty studies using geographical, socio-cultural, economical indicators, as well as
child and maternal mortality rates as criteria.


                                                          11
mapping exercise was also carried out and revealed that approximately 90 percent of the
600 classrooms were built in the poorest regions of the country. In addition, pedagogical
continuity improved because the percentage of primary schools offering a complete cycle
increased from 43 percent to 71 percent in project intervention areas. Although the target
of 78 percent was missed, it is a significant increase compared to the 2007/08 figures.
The percentage of girls enrolled in primary education in the three disadvantaged regions
increased from 48.2 percent in 2006/07 to 50 percent in 2012 thereby meeting the target
by project closing.

40.    Improved quality and internal efficiency of the education system. These goals
were to be measured by one PDO level indicator: completion rate of the primary
education cycle. During the project period, the completion rate in primary education
increased from 50 percent in 2008 to 73.1 percent, surpassing the 64 percent target by 9.1
percent.

41.     Intermediate indicators used to measure quality and internal efficiency were: (i)
decrease in the student:teacher ratio; (ii) number of additional qualified teachers as
measured by teachers graduating from pre-service teacher training; (iii) number of
teachers trained in-service training; (iv) 80 percent of primary teachers re-trained to be
able to teach the new curriculum in the bilingual system; (v) incentives for teachers in
remote areas; (vi) purchase of three million textbooks and 75,000 instructional materials;
(vii) primary students that have textbooks in four core subjects (%); and (viii) EMIS is
fully operational and personnel trained to use it (yes/no).

42.     The achievement of the selected intermediate indicators is as follows: (i) the
student:teacher ratio decreased from 47:1 in 2008 to 39:1 in 2012, surpassing the target of
40:1; (ii) the number of additional qualified teachers graduating from pre-service training
was 3,381 thereby exceeding the target of 3,286; (iii) the teachers graduating from in-
service training was 8,714 just missing the target of 9,000; 13 and (iv) 100 percent of the
primary school teachers were retrained to teach the new curriculum in the bilingual
system, thereby surpassing the target of 80 percent. The project also provided US$1.6
million in bridge financing to cover three months of teacher incentives until the extra
budget was approved by parliament and regularized in the education budget. This support
helped mitigate tensions between teachers unions and the government, and kept teachers
in schools. However, the student:textbook ratio cannot be verified because the textbooks
purchased with project funds arrived in Mauritania one week prior to project closing. The
project did procure 2.78 million textbooks but missed the target of three million. The
most recent information indicates that the textbooks are still in a central warehouse in
Nouakchott. The project was not able to purchase 75,000 sets of instructional materials
for school libraries and reading corners due to insufficient project funds. Although

   This is an Africa Core Indicator that was added in 2010 to retrofit all Africa education projects. In-service teacher
training in Mauritania is supported by the Spanish Agency for International Development. However, the Bank team did
retrofit the results framework with this indicator and therefore, the ICR team is including it in their analysis. In addition,
the ISRs included a baseline of 10,714 for pre-service and 5000 for in-service training instead of 0 as indicated in the
2010 restructuring paper.

teachers were re-trained to teach in both Arabic and French, their ability to do so in both
languages remains uneven.

43.     The project was to support the evaluation unit in the MNE to develop a teacher
evaluation instrument to measure classroom practice and teacher behavior, and support
the student learning and monitoring unit to improve student examination. The project
financed the development of a teacher evaluation questionnaire but a baseline study of
teacher behavior was not carried out. The project supported the training of the MNE’s
student assessment team, the development of associated materials and the carrying out of
an initial learning assessment. The project did not support investments in the EMIS,
however, Mauritania does have standalone monitoring systems that now need to be fully-
integrated to create a EMIS.

3.3 Efficiency

44.     The project disbursed approximately US$5.9 million to finance the construction
of 600 primary classrooms by communities. Approximately 80 percent of these
classrooms were new constructions, while the remainder was classrooms built to replace
old ones whose quality was inadequate. School mapping data shows that approximately
90 percent of the 600 classrooms were built in the poorest regions of the country. The
project built on 25 years of experience in Mauritania of using the community-based
school construction approach. The community-based approach supported the
achievement of the project objectives with a lower unit cost than the private sector and
despite the fact that construction material costs had escalated worldwide since 2005.

45.     During the project period, the average cost of classrooms was 2,800,000 UM,
increasing from 2,450,000 UM in 2008 to 3,150,000 UM in 2010. The recent tenders
issued by the state and executed by the private sector show that the cost charged by the
project using the community-based approach is economically viable and remains
competitive. Although the price per square meter for classrooms has risen from UM
45,370 in 2008 to UM 58,333 in 2010, it is lower than the private sector price (UM
94,981 in 2010). Data from the DSPC shows that the construction of new classrooms led
to an increase in the number of children attending school by 17 percent between 2007/08

and 2010/11 in the targeted areas. The 2009 Country Status Report (CSR), which used
the analysis of the 2008 permanent multi-purpose household survey (EPCV), indicates
two reasons for parents not sending their children to school: (i) the lack of teachers in
classrooms; and (ii) the lack of satisfaction with classroom conditions.

46.     Desks. The project financed 30,000 student desks compared to the initial 20,100
as a result of the pledge by the president. The budgeted unit cost was US$91/student desk
at appraisal. Following competitive bidding, the unit cost fell to US$80/student desk,
which helped cover 21 percent of the sector needs in terms of student desks.

47.     School Feeding. Research on the benefits of canteens suggests that school
feeding programs could contribute to a parent’s decision to enroll a child in school and
help the child stay in school. Several studies have examined the role of school feeding in
stimulating enrollment and increasing attendance. The project has reached 149,609
students based on WFP’s selection criteria, which include the poverty level, the level of
girls’ participation and overall vulnerability. According to the first results of the school
feeding program impact analysis, the success rates for first year of college entrance
exams is approximately 51.4 percent in schools benefiting from the program. This rate is
higher than the average in other schools without canteens. Assessments conducted in
Mauritania in 2001, 2006 and 2011 show a positive relationship between a child’s
learning outcomes in language and mathematics and the presence of a canteen.

48.     Textbooks: The project was supposed to support the acquisition of three million
textbooks and 75,000 instructional materials. The textbooks were rewritten by national
experts while the editing and printing of the books was done abroad. The project
supported the acquisition of 2,776,314 textbooks. The unit cost of these textbooks was
US$0.73 per book, which is slightly higher than the US$0.67 per book estimation in the
PAD. However, the price per textbooks acquired under this project is lower than that in
other countries: in Benin the cost of a primary textbook is approximately US$1.78 per
book, in Togo US$2.0, in Mozambique US$1.40, in Niger US$1.07 and in The Gambia
US$1.08 15. Unfortunately, the project did not purchase the 75,000 instructional materials
for school libraries and reading corners as originally envisioned.

49.     The education indicators have generally improved over the life of the project. By
project completion, the primary completion rate reached 73.1 percent in 2011/12, which
is an increase compared to 50 percent in 2007/08. In recent years, efforts have been made
to improve school provision, which contributed positively to the increase in enrollments.
The number of classrooms increased from 12,247 in 2008/09 to 13,240 in 2010/11
distributed across 4,075 schools. The project financed 600 of the 993 16 additional
classrooms that were constructed during this period and which correspond to
approximately 63.4 percent of the total number of classrooms. The number of additional
teachers reached 14,095 in 2011/12, thereby leading to a student:teacher ratio of 39:1. In


15
 However, this price comparison does not include an analysis of quality.
16
 The government and development partners have constructed a total of 993 classrooms: FTI-630; French
Cooperation-111; Government:73; earlier projects: 179


                                                      14
terms of access, the actions of the GOM have led to a significant increase in Gross Intake
Rate - GIR, which reached 112 percent in 2011/12. In terms of retention, available data
indicates that retention rose from 58.6 percent in 2007/08 to 67.4 percent in 2011/12;
Analysis by gender shows a slight difference in favor of girls at the national level (69
against 65.9). Sector spending more than doubled between 2005 and 2011 and accounts
for nearly one fifth of current expenditures of the state and more than 5 percent of state
revenue, while only 7 percent are covered by external resources.

50.     Despite these commendable improvements, broader findings indicate that overall
efficiency of the project was modest because of considerable shortcomings: (i) during
project preparation, the Bank team did not allocate sufficient resources, which resulted in
several key quality activities not being implemented; (ii) although the student desks cost
less than originally expected, some were deemed by beneficiaries to be of poor quality or
inappropriate for small children; (iii) the savings from procuring student desks were not
sufficient to finance the additional 9,900 desks, so that the additional cost had to be
financed with funds originally allocated for other activities; (iv) less textbooks were
purchased for a higher price than estimated, which negatively affected the projects ability
to finance the 75,000 instructional materials destined for small libraries and reading
corners; (v) procurement delays did not allow for the timely distribution of these
textbooks so that the majority is still in a central warehouse in Nouakchott; and (vi) funds
allocated for the school feeding program were only sufficient to cover 28 percent of a
normal school year 17.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

51.     The overall outcome rating of the project is moderately unsatisfactory. This
overall rating is based on the fact that: relevance of project design and implementation
were modest. This can be seen by the fact that: (i) the project design fit into the ESDP,
PRSP II and CAS; and (ii) the implementation mechanism was appropriate in that it used
existing MNE systems and units to implement the project. However, (i) the PDO was
complex, (ii) indicator targets were sometimes inaccurately calculated or reported; (iii)
there were too many activities, and (iv) some activities were not implemented due to
insufficient resources and in some cases inaccurate costing. Efficacy of the project is
substantial for all of the reasons stated previously while efficiency is judged to be
modest.

     According to government data, a normal school year consists of 150 days

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

52.     Mauritania’s share of girls’ enrollment in primary education continues to outpace
that of boys, which is impressive. As of the 2011/2012 school year, the gender ratio is at
1.07, with more girls in primary school on a national average. Specifically, school
construction interventions in the wilaya of Guidimagha (one of the Mauritania’s most
disadvantaged regions) seem to have helped improve the percentage of girls enrolled in
primary school compared to 2007/08 levels: at project onset, girls’ enrollment lagged
behind that of boys by four percentage points while by project closing, enrollment was
slightly higher for girls than for boys. Anecdotal evidence would indicate that beneficiary
communities are more optimistic about the possible returns they get from sending their
children to school. Mauritania, as other countries in the Sahel, is battling food shortages
due to drought, which significantly impacts a child’s physical and mental development.
Having contributed to WFP’s school feeding program has, at least in the short run, helped
meet the most imminent nutritional needs of school children.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

53.     The project aimed at strengthening the government’s student assessment and
teacher evaluation capacity. The project financed the training of the MNE’s assessment
unit in Senegal and France, which helped the government develop the relevant materials
and conduct a baseline study. It is expected that this experience and knowledge will allow
the government to conduct further assessments that can inform sound policy decision
making. The Prime Minister just recently issued a decree officially establishing the
student learning assessment unit within the MNE. This will give this unit official standing
and the requisite budget allocation for performing their responsibilities. The government
also instituted the “prime de craie? to give incentives to teachers to work in remote areas.
The capacity of communities to manage school canteens and classroom construction has
also been strengthened as part of project interventions as both activities included a
training component.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

54.    No significant unintended outcomes or impacts.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

55.     The project conducted a beneficiary survey (Enquête de satisfaction protant sur
“Le Programme Fast-Track? en République Islamique de Mauritanie), which is
available on file in French. However, the findings can be summarized as follows: (i) 75
percent of the student desks were of satisfactory quality and were viewed by education
personnel at the local levels as contributing to improved student learning, while the
remaining 25 percent were of sub-standard quality or not appropriate for small children;
(ii) the school construction program has improved teachers’ ability to teach, students’
ability to learn and parents’ opinion of the quality of schooling but designs should be


                                            16
adapted to local conditions; (iii) the availability of textbooks has a positive impact on
student learning and is appreciated by students and teachers alike but that there do not
exist sufficient textbooks to meet the needs 18 ; (iv) school canteens are viewed as an
effective way to help poor families meet their children’s nutritional needs, to ensure
school attendance and reduce drop out, and improve children’s ability to study/learn; and
(v) the teacher incentive scheme had a positive impact on teacher attendance.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

56.     The risks identified during project preparation were mostly appropriate: two were
rated negligible and three modest. The two ratings of negligible related to education
funding were accurately selected. Between 2005 and 2011, spending on the sector more
than doubled, thus showing the importance attached to education. Education spending
accounts for nearly one fifth of current expenditures of the state and more than 5 percent
of state revenue, while only 7 percent are covered by external resources. However,
supervision missions noticed that no maintenance plans for sector investments had been
established. The absence of adequately funded maintenance plans that include school
furniture and books there is a risk that the new construction will deteriorate and the gains
in access will diminish over time. However, the government continues to be committed to
financing education therefore, this risk appears to be modest. The two modest ratings
related to decentralization were appropriate. The government continues to build the
capacity of local education administrators so as to improve their ability to run the local
education systems. Therefore, risk is still modest because local responsibility for the
education system is recognized by the government as being important to the efficient
internal functioning of the sector. The risk associated with bilingual education should
have been rated substantial. The supply of qualified bilingual teachers is still very low in
Mauritania and deployment of those qualified teachers to the remote areas remains a
challenge for the government. However, the new GPE project will focus specifically on
improving the quality of bilingual education at the two teacher training institutions in
Mauritania. The preparation team did not identify procurement capacity as a risk nor did
they identify the risk of political instability. These should have been identified with the
appropriate mitigation measures. These remain valid risks and could affect project
outcome, especially because these were two areas that had already an impacted on project
implementation.




18
  A sample study carried out by the evaluators at the Institut Pédagoique National, which covered 206 schools across 6
wilayas and 30 departments, showed that only 62 percent of students in grades 3 and 5 each had a textbook in Math,
Arabic and French.


                                                         17
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

57.     The Bank preparation team included the appropriate staff to appraise the project
and the operation was appropriately aligned with the ESDP, PRSP-2 and CAS. The Bank
team was actively engaging with the government counterparts and local donors
throughout the preparation process. This collaboration ensured that all relevant
stakeholders were aware of the proposed project activities and enabled them to coordinate
the donor interventions. 19 The Bank team also prepared the project within the short
period of time provided by the EFA-FTI for submission and approval by the EFA-FTI
Board of Directors. However, the short preparation period led to the development of a
weak results framework that did not include enough relevant PDO and intermediate level
indicators or had targets that were sometimes inaccurately calculated or reported. There
were also inconsistencies in the project documentation that made evaluating the project
difficult, and some activities were not fully developed prior to project start-up. Finally,
the team did not finalize the ESMF and disclose it in Mauritania or the Bank’s Infoshop.
This could have been avoided had the preparation team systematically involved the
Bank’s environmental safeguards specialists.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

58.     The Bank team carried out annual supervision missions, with periodic interactions
of the country-based TTL with the relevant stakeholders. The Mauritania-based TTL was
also able to carry on a dialogue with the government and donors even during the period
of political turmoil. The presence of a fiduciary team (procurement specialist and
disbursement assistant) in Nouakchott was also important as it helped facilitate the
resolution of procurement issues related to the purchase of desks and textbooks. However,
supervision teams were often too optimistic when assessing project progress and focused
mainly on the satisfactory disbursement levels and progress of construction, textbooks,
student desk and school feeding activities. Although the project was restructured twice,
the Bank team did not use these opportunities to redefine the PDO, revise or strengthen
the results framework to better track progress and assess project performance. These were
missed opportunities to narrow the project scope by eliminating project activities for
which there were no or insufficient project resources and to correct some of the project
design problems. Finally, no environmental safeguards supervisions were conducted
during the life of the project.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

59.    Based on the discussion above, the ICR team judges the overall Bank
performance to be moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

60.     The government remained available and accessible for the Bank teams throughout
project implementation. This factor was very important for the Bank’s ability to support
the DPEF in implementing the project and conduct an open dialogue with the government.
However, the government political instability and ultimate coup d’état led to delays in
implementation. After the coup d’état, the government changed the education ministry
structure several times thereby changing the ministry responsible for the project. This
caused confusion that led to issues of government ownership and continuity. The
government also discontinued the annual education sector reviews which had proved
useful for both the donors and government in monitoring the ESDP and the project
implementation. Once these meetings were discontinued, there was no longer a
mechanism available to bring stakeholders together for dialog on challenges facing the
education sector. Therefore, the government’s performance is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

61.      DPEF was adequately staffed but frequent changes in staffing and weak capacity
of some departments slowed project implementation activities. Progress reporting
remained challenging throughout the life of the project, which was due to the lack of a
fully-integrated information management system. However, DPEF staff provided the
necessary support to Bank missions and helped facilitate supervision activities. They
were instrumental in organizing high-level meetings and field visits and were generally
responsive to the Bank’s requests. Also, the DPEF’s fiduciary departments functioned
reasonably well, displayed no irregularities and were consistently rated satisfactory.
DPEF was also able to manage classroom construction and facilitate the provision of
food supplies to canteens in addition to procuring textbooks and student desks. However,
the limited capacity of certain DPEF departments led to several implementation issues.
The procurement process was slow due to bidder complaints but also because of delays at
the DPEF level when requested to respond to procurement inquiries from bidders and the
Bank. Frequent staff changes at the DPEF also led to non-familiarity with Bank
procedures, which also impacted implementation progress. The DPEF also did not follow
up or ensure satisfactory completion of project activities, such as textbook storage and
distribution. Only at the insistence of the Bank’s supervision team did the DPEF work
with the responsible government entity to transfer the books to a more adequate storage
facility. Furthermore, the textbooks were not distributed, which negatively affected the


                                            19
textbook:student ratio indicator. By the time the ICR was completed the textbooks had
still not been distributed. Furthermore, the DPEF did not address the sub-standard quality
of 25 percent of the student desks at the time of acceptance. Based on this mixed
performance, the ICR team rates the implementation agency’s performance moderately
unsatisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

62.    The ICR team judges the borrower’s overall performance as moderately
unsatisfactory based on the discussion above.

6. Lessons Learned

63.    Lesson 1. Special agreements with United Nations agencies and other donors
should be cleared prior to project effectiveness. The project’s school feeding program
was delayed for one year due to the bureaucratic processes between the Bank and the
WFP. There existed no standard contracts between the government and the WFP, which
could have been reviewed and then approved by the Bank’s legal department. Going
forward it will be important for the Bank and the WFP to develop a standard contract that
can be easily adapted to different country and project circumstances.

64.     Lesson 2. Project implementation units within the ministry are more effective
than those outside the ministry structure. The DPEF plays an important role in donor
coordination and implementation of education projects. Moreover, having this unit
located within the regular structure of the ministry helps facilitate project management’s
interactions with other governmental departments. However, the risk of relying of such
structures is that there can be frequent staff changes (including at the level of the
minister) when governments change, which could have an impact on implementation
effectiveness.

65.      Lesson 3. Community participation for school construction is important for
ensuring low cost school construction and local ownership in Mauritania. Having the
community actively involved led to an increased sense of ownership and interest in the
overall management of a school. This type of construction also led to a more cost
effective use of project resources as evidenced by the project’s economic and financial
analysis. While schools constructed by the communities have proved to be cost effective,
it will be important for the future design and construction of these schools to include the
ancillary structures of latrines and fences. Communities should also be trained in the
maintenance of schools and the development of maintenance plans.

66.    Lesson 4. Joint government and donor annual sector reviews are important
for ensuring coordination of activities and quality implementation in Mauritania.
The previous education projects greatly benefitted from the Joint Annual Sector Reviews,
which served as a platform for donors and the government discuss education sector
interventions. It was beneficial in finding solutions to common problems and adapting a
coherent approach to donor interventions.


                                            20
67.     Lesson 5. Project preparation should include a quality review regardless of
institutional requirements. Many of the project’s short-comings might have been
avoided had there been a quality at entry review. The project scope was too extensive and
ambitious for the funds and implementation period allocated, and there were weak or no
linkages between the proposed objectives and interventions. A quality review would also
have allowed a deeper analysis of the results framework and ensured its ability to track
project progress and assess achievement of the objectives.

68.     Lesson 6. Projects must have adequate monitoring arrangements in place
prior to effectiveness. It is important to put in place a well staffed and capacitated unit
that would facilitate monitoring various aspects of project – project
outcome/output/process indicators as well project management. Future education projects
in Mauritania must ensure that the DPEF’s M&E unit has the required systems and fully
trained staff with adequate capacity to fully monitor all aspects of implementation.

69.      Lesson 7. Submission deadline constraints by external financiers can impact
the quality of project preparation. The preparation team only had four months to
prepare, appraise and submit the project to the EFA-FTI Board to secure the funds. Such
tight deadlines undermine the Bank team’s ability to follow due diligence in project
preparation and should be avoided going forward. It would be important for financiers to
put in place a mechanism that would allow project teams to delay submission without the
risk of losing funding.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Promote Access to Education and Improve Equity and Retention in
the Sector (US$9.14 million)

1.      This component was to support the first PDO of promoting access to education,
and improve equity and retention by: (i) constructing and equipping classrooms; (ii)
training of parents’ associations and sensitization campaigns; and (iii) expanding the
school feeding program. To measure achievements, the following PDO indicators were
tracked: (i) access to grade 1 of primary education (%) - GIR; and (ii) ratio of girls to
boys in primary (%). Although the original results framework did not included primary
school retention rates, this indicator is monitored by the government within the ESDP and
therefore has been included in the ICR analysis. Intermediate indicators were: (i) primary
schools that offer a complete cycle (%); (ii) classrooms built and/or rehabilitated; (iii)
percentage of girls’ enrollment in primary education in three disadvantaged areas; (v)
school mapping and other planning mechanisms are fully operational (yes/no).

2.      The percentage of students with access to grade 1 of primary school increased
from 108.5 percent to 112 percent by 2012. Although the Gross Intake Rate (GIR)
increased, the achievement of this target cannot be assessed. The GIR target provided in
the ESDP was stated as 100 percent, which refers to the Net Intake Rate (NIR). Therefore,
the ICR team cannot assess if the target was met. Table 8 provides a time series data of
GIR from 2008/09 to 2011/2012. The ratio of girls to boys increased from 50.3 percent in
2008 to 50.6 percent in 2012. The initial 55 percent target was incorrect 20 but never
changed to reflect the 50.5 percent ESDP target. Therefore, the ICR team considers this
indicator to have surpassed its target. Available primary school retention rate data
indicates that retention rose from 58.6 percent in 2007/08 to 67.4 percent in 2011/12,
which is a substantial increase.

3.      The project met the target of constructing 600 classrooms and exceeded original
target of 20,100 desks by 9,900. The school mapping exercise was also successfully
carried out, which showed that approximately 90 percent of schools were built in the
poorest regions of the country 21. Given the poor quality of school structures in those
regions, construction activities mostly focused on replacing existing classrooms. One of
the project’s main goals was to ensure that 78 percent of primary schools offer
pedagogical continuity 22 in 2010/11 compared to 43 percent in 2007/08. Although the
project did not meet the end target, 71 percent of the schools 23 supported by the project
now have the capacity to offer pedagogical continuity. This is a major achievement. The
percentage of girls enrolled in primary education in the three disadvantaged regions
increased from 48.2 percent in 2006/07 to 50 percent in 2012 thereby meeting the target.


20
   The MNE official data shows that the baseline for 2008 was 50.3 percent and that 2010 target 50.5 percent. The end
target could not be 55 percent as mentioned in the project documentation because the percentage of females in the total
population was only 52 percent.

   The project supported construction of 600 classrooms which impacted 292 schools.


                                                          23
The use of community participation in the construction of classrooms allowed the project
to reduce the cost by almost one third to UM 3.15 million. This is compared to the unit
costs for government-constructed schools (UM 4.83 million) and unit costs for
construction financed by the private sector (UM 5.13 million). This approach also helped
strengthen the capacity of communities to manage and supervise construction and
maintenance of schools due to training and provided by the DPEF.

4.      The decentralization activities within the project never fully materialized. This
was due to the fact that after the 2008 coup d’état, the government abandoned the
previous focus on decentralization. The project did not conduct the study on girls’
education and causes for gender gaps or train school committees in school management.
However, the project did supported a study on causes of regional gaps in completion of
schooling and the training of 546 school committee members in the management of
canteens, hygiene and environment through the WFP activities. While the project did not
complete all agreed activities, UNICEF carried out a study on girls’ barriers to education,
which included recommendations that have guided the preparation of the new GPE
project. UNICEF also supported 560 school committees, including parents’ associations,
in school management, environment, school maintenance and management of sub-
project/funds.

5.      The project was successful in providing US$1.94 million which allowed the
government to sign a contract with the World Food Program (WFP) for 1,876 tons of
food. It benefitted 149,609 children in 1,698 schools (1,808 schools including Koranic
schools) for 42 days, two meals a day. These funds also contributed to WFP’s overall
2011/2012 feeding program and purchased a total of 3.15 million tons of food to cover a
94-day period over two trimesters. Initial data seems to show that success rates for first
year of college entrance exams in schools with canteens are slightly higher than in
schools without (51.35 percent versus 50.11 percent). A preliminary report was prepared
by the WFP and shared with the ICR mission.

Component 2: Improve Quality of the Pedagogical Content of the Primary
Education and the Efficiency of the Education System (US$2.83 million)

6.      This component was to support the second PDO indicator of improved quality of
learning within primary education and the internal efficiency of the education system. To
reach this goal, the project supported the new government’s policy of providing free
textbooks to primary schools. The PDO indicator used to measure achievement of this
goal was the increase of the primary school completion rate from 50 percent in 2008 to
64 percent in 2012. The intermediate indicators used to measure achievement were: (i)
the purchase of three million textbooks and 75,000 instructional materials for school
libraries and reading corners; and (ii) primary students that have textbooks in four core
subjects (%).

7.     The primary completion rate increased from 50 percent in 2006 to 73.1 percent in
2012, surpassing the target of 64 percent by 9.1 percentage points.




                                            24
8.      The project outputs for this component are largely unmet. The project supported
the government’s free textbook program with the purchase of 2,776,314 textbooks. It
should be noted that the EFA-FTI project was the only donor project that supported the
acquisition of textbooks and therefore, any achievement within this component would be
directly attributed to the FTI project. However, the textbooks did not arrive in Mauritania
until the week of project closing and the latest information indicates that the majority of
these textbooks have not been distributed. Based on this, the student:textbook ratio
cannot be verified. In addition, the project was not able to purchase the 75,000 sets of
instructional materials for school libraries and reading corners. Therefore, the
intermediate indicator of 96 percent of primary school students with four core textbooks
was not achieved and there was only partial achievement related to the procurement of
textbooks and instructional materials.

Component 3: Improve the Quality of Teaching and Internal Efficiency of
Education (US$2.03 million)

9.       The component was to support the third PDO of improving quality of teaching by:
(i) providing three months of bridge financing for a new teacher incentive program that
required approval by the parliament in a special session since the education budget had
already been approved; (ii) supporting the evaluation unit in the MNE to develop a
teacher evaluation instrument to measure classroom practice and teacher behavior; and
(iii) supporting the student learning and monitoring unit to improve the student
examination. The project did not include a PDO indicator to measure quality of teaching.
However, the intermediate indicators selected were: (i) decrease in the student:teacher
ratio; (ii) additional qualified teachers as measured by the number of teachers graduating
from pre-service teacher training; (iii) number of teachers trained in-service training; (iv)
80 percent of primary teachers re-trained to be able to teach the new curriculum in the
bilingual system; (v) incentives for teachers in remote areas; and (vi) EMIS is fully
operational and personnel trained to use it (yes/no).

10.     The achievement of the selected intermediate indicators can be seen by: (i)
student: teacher ratio decreasing from 47:1 in 2008 to 39:1 in 2012 surpassing the target
of 40:1; (ii) the number of additional qualified teachers graduating from pre-service
training was 3,381 thereby exceed the target of 3,286; (iii) the teachers graduating from
in-service training was 8,714 just missing the target of 9,000 (iv) 100 percent of the
primary school teachers were re-trained to teach the new curriculum in the bilingual
system thereby passing the target of 80 percent (although their ability to teach in both
Arabic and French remains uneven); and (v) incentives were provided to teachers for
three months.

11.     The project outputs for this component were partially met. The project did
provide US$1.6 million in bridge financing to cover three months of teacher incentives
until the extra budget was approved by parliament and regularized in the education
budget. This helped mitigate tensions between the teachers unions and the government
and kept teachers in schools. The project also supported the development of a teacher
evaluation questionnaire but a baseline study of teacher behavior was not carried out.



                                             25
Therefore, information on school performance is not available. The project also covered
the costs of additional training in Dakar for the MNE student assessment team on
techniques for conducting student assessments (a first round of training took place in
France). The materials were developed and the government carried out a student
assessment in 2011, which is currently being analyzed. This is a positive step forward as
Mauritania continues to institutionalize assessment of the education system and this unit
will be used to implement the assessment activities in the new GPE.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Economic Analysis.

1.     Mauritania has over the last twenty five years developed an expertise in
construction according to community outreach and cost. The EFA-FTI project used
community-based construction as a part of project implementation. There was an audit of
the schools that were constructed during the project which showed that: (i) 95 percent of
the schools constructed were satisfactory according to the standard life of 25 years, (ii) 4
percent had deteriorated, and (iii) 1 percent was in poor condition.

2.      The project disbursed approximately US$5.9 million to finance 600 primary
classroom constructions by communities. Approximately 80 percent of classrooms were
new constructions, while the remainder were classrooms built to replace old ones whose
quality was inadequate. The project built on the 25 years of experience in Mauritania of
using the community-based school construction approach. The community-based
approach supported the achievement of the project objectives with a lower unit cost than
the private sector and despite the fact that construction material costs had escalated since
2005 worldwide.

3.      During the project period, the average cost of classrooms was UM 2,800,000,
increasing from UM 2,450,000 UM in 2008 to UM 3,150,000 in 2010 24 . The recent
tenders issued by the state and executed by the private sector show that the cost charged
by the project using the community-based approach is economically viable and remains
competitive. Although the price per square meter for classrooms has risen from UM
45,370 in 2008 to UM 58,333 in 2010, it remains lower than the private sector price (UM
94,981 in 2010).

4.     Data from the DSPC shows that the construction of new classrooms led to an
increase in the number of children attending school by 17 percent between 2007/08 and
2010/11 in the 600 classrooms. The 2009 CSR, which used the analysis of the 2008
permanent multi-purpose household survey (EPCV), indicates two reasons for parents not
sending their children to school: (i) the lack of teachers in classrooms; and (ii) the lack of


24
  Although the cost to build schools was affected by the rise in construction material prices, it was off-set by
approximately US$2.73 million exchange rate gains.

satisfaction with classroom conditions. The data below shows that, when parents were
asked about reasons for their dissatisfaction with schools, 25 percent indicated poor
conditions of schools, 14 percent cited the teacher competency and 12 percent mentioned
the lack of books.

5.       The CSR also indicated that the risk of non-attendance is stronger when children
are in rural areas and belong to the poorest quintile. The probability of not being educated
is estimated at 10.8 percent for children living in cities compared to 26.4 percent for
those living in rural areas. The rural areas represent 54 percent of the population of
children aged 8 to 13 years and therefore have a higher risk of not being educated. The
result is that 78 percent of children that are currently excluded from schools are located in
rural areas while only 22 percent are located in cities.

6.      The map below shows where classrooms were constructed with the support of the
project. They were in the poorest areas as identified in the PRSP-2 which mainly
concerns the wilayas of Gorgol, Brakna and Assaba. In addition, a maximum number of
classrooms were built in wilayas that traditionally have low levels of enrollment referred
to as “disadvantaged areas? (i.e. Hodh el Charghi and Hodh el Gharbi).

7.     The table below shows that the number of schools offering a complete cycle of
primary education has increased between 2008 and 2012, increasing from 25.2 percent to
33.9 percent. This increase can be attributed in large parts to the 600 additional
classrooms constructed through the project.

     This table includes the 26 classrooms that were completed by the government with its own funds after project closing.

8.      Desks. The project financed 30,000 student desks compared to the initial 20,100
as a result of the pledge by the president. The budgeted unit cost was US$91/student desk
at appraisal. However, following competitive bidding, the unit cost fell to US$80/student
desk, which helped cover 21 percent of the sector needs in terms of desks.

9.     School Feeding. Research on the benefits of canteens suggests that school
feeding programs could contribute to a parent’s decision to enroll a child in school and
help the child stay in school. They found that such activities could help parents: (i)
appreciate the value of education; (ii) have the peace of mind that there exist adequate
school facilities; (iii) weigh the direct and indirect costs of sending a child to school; and
(iv) realize that food is available at their children’s schools. Several studies have
examined the role of school feeding in stimulating enrollment and increasing attendance.
The project has reached 149,609 students based on WFP’s selection criteria, which
include the poverty level, the level of girls’ participation and overall vulnerability.
According to the first results of the school feeding program impact analysis, the success


                                                     30
rates for first year of college entrance exams is approximately 51.4 percent in schools
benefiting from the program. This rate is higher than the average in other schools without
canteens. Assessments conducted in Mauritania in 2001, 2006 and 2011 show a positive
relationship between a child’s learning outcomes in language and mathematics and the
presence of a canteen.

10.     Textbooks. The project was to support the acquisition of three million textbooks
and 75,000 instructional materials. The textbooks were rewritten by national experts
while the editing and printing of the books was done abroad. The project financed the
acquisition of 2,776,314 textbooks. The unit cost of these textbooks was US$0.73 per
book, which is slightly higher than the US$0.67 per book estimation in the PAD. This
higher cost included the cost of delivery to the central warehouse but not the distribution
to schools. However, the price per textbooks acquired under this project is lower than that
in other countries: in Benin the cost of a primary textbook is approximately US$1.78 per
book, in Togo US$2.0, in Mozambique US$1.40, in Niger US$1.07 and in The Gambia
US$1.08 26. The project did not purchase the 75,000 instructional materials as originally
envisioned by the project.

11.     The education indicators have generally improved over the period of the project.
By project completion, the primary completion rate reached 73.1 percent in 2011/12,
which is an increase compared to 50 percent in 2007/08. In recent years, efforts have
been made to improve school provision, which contributed positively to the increase in
enrollments. The number of classrooms increased from 12,247 in 2008/09 to 13,240 in
2010/11 distributed across 4,075 schools. The project financed 600 of the 993 27
additional classrooms that were constructed during this period and which correspond to
approximately 63.4 percent of the total number of classrooms. The number of additional
teachers reached 3,381 in 2011/12, thereby leading to a student:teacher ratio of 39:1.
Although the percentage of students with access to grade 1 of primary school increased
from 108.5 percent to 112 percent by 2012, the ICR team cannot assess if the target was
met as previously discussed. In terms of retention, available data indicates that retention
rose from 58.6 percent in 2007/08 to 67.4 percent in 2011/12; Analysis by gender shows
a slight difference in favor of girls at the national level (69 against 65.9). Moreover,
between 2005 and 2011, spending on the sector more than doubled, thus showing the
importance attached to education. They account for nearly one fifth of current
expenditures of the state and more than 5 percent of state revenue, while only 7 percent
are covered by external resources.

 However, this price comparison does not include an analysis of quality.

 The government and development partners have constructed a total of 993 classrooms: FTI-630; French
Cooperation:111; Government:73; earlier projects: 179

12.     Despite these commendable improvements, broader findings indicate that overall
efficiency of the project was modest because of considerable shortcomings: (i) during
project preparation, the Bank team did not allocate sufficient resources, which resulted in
several key quality activities not being implemented; (ii) although the student desks cost
less than originally expected, some were deemed by beneficiaries to be of poor quality or
inappropriate for small children; (iii) the savings from procuring student desks were not
sufficient to finance the additional 9,900 desks, so that the additional cost had to be
financed with funds originally allocated for other activities; (iv) less textbooks were
purchased for a higher price than estimated, which negatively affected the projects ability
to finance the 75,000 instructional materials destined for small libraries and reading
corners; (v) procurement delays did not allow for the timely distribution of these
textbooks so that the majority is still in a central warehouse in Nouakchott; and (vi) funds
allocated for the school feeding program were only sufficient to cover 28 percent of a
normal school year 28.

Opportunities for intervention and Recommendations

   •   In terms of access, the different sub-components were adapted to the needs and
       must be consolidated and focus on wilayas that remain significantly behind in
       terms of education; emphasis needs to be placed on the component student desk
       supply because the needs remain still very high;
   •   The qualitative performance of the education system in general and basic
       education in particular are inadequate and require special attention, including the
       improvement of the education and training of teachers and learning conditions;
   •   There exists a need to focus also on the acquisition of instructional materials;
   •   Conduct training for teachers;
   •   Incentives for teachers to improve the quality of basic education;
   •   The protection of schools through fencing and the putting in place of maintenance
       plans for all investments (including student desks and other infrastructure);
   •   Building local colleges to promote the education of girls;
   •   Continue support for school canteens under future interventions; and
   •   Involve local partners to supervise works and the maintenance of infrastructure
       and other investments.

Conclusion

The results of the project demonstrated its relevance to the achievement of objectives in
the field of basic education. Delays are mainly due to external factors (political change)
or procedural problems that were overcome with the Government’s support to ensure
proper implementation of the project but also the guidance and help of the World Bank to
help improve the primary school enrollment rate and quality of basic education.
Therefore, it is recommended to consider a new phase of the Fast Track project, which
should take into account the lessons learned from this phase.
