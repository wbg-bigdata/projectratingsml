KENYA
TANA RIVER DEVELOHOENT CCMPANY LIMITED
APPRAISAL OF THE KAMBURU HY)RCELECTRIC PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CCNCLUSICNS
i.        This report is an appraisal of the Kamburu hydroelectric project
on the River Tana in Kenya. The Project is to be built by the Tana River
Development Company Limited (TRDC), its estimated cost being US$37.5 million
equivalent. The Government of Kenya has requested assistance from the Bank
and from the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) to finance the
foreign exchange cost of the Project, which is US$26.1 million. A Bank
loan of US$23 million, which includes interest during construction of
US$2.9 million, and a SIDA credit of US$6 million are proposed. The loan
would be the Bank's first one to the power sector in Kenya.
ii.       The Project consists of an underground power station containing
two 30 NW generating sets, and provision for a third, similar set, later.
It also includes a transmission line about 105 kilometers in length from
Kamburu to Nairobi and a line of about 15 kilometers in length to an existing
hydroelectric power station lower down the river at Kindaruma.
iii.      Demand for electrical energy in Kenya is expected to graw at an
average rate of about 9% per annum through 1976. Additional capacity will
be required, perhaps by the end of 1973, and certainly by mid-1974 which is
the time that the Project will be commissioned. By the end of 1971 it will
be clear whether or not additional capacity will be needed before the
Project has been completed. If such capacity is needed, an order will be
placed for a 12 MW gas-turbine-driven generating set for installation in
1973.
iv.       A regional program of development of electrical power was agreed
by Kenya and Uganda in 1969.  Uganda at present exports power to Kenya; by
197h, no surplus above the guaranteed minimun of 30 MW will be available
from Uganda, and Uganda may wish to reduce the amount even further.  The
Project is therefore essential to meet the growth in demand and is the
least-cost method of so doing. It has been compared with an alternative
development based on oil-burning generating plant at Mombasa. The analysis
gave an equalizing discount rate of about 11%. There is another advantage
to the Project: its construction will make a large use of local unskilled
labor, and unemployment is widespread.
V.        Three companies are responsible for public electricity supply in
Kenya. The East African Power and Lighting Company Limited (EAP&L), a
corporation with widespread private ownership of its stock, was the only one
for many years. EAF&L formed two subsidiaries, the Kenya Power Company
Limited (KPC) and TRDC, with Government participation, in 1955 and 1964,
respectively, to be responsible for specific new projects. TRDC, the second
of these two companies, was charged with development of the Tana River.



- i~i -
As things stand at present, EAF&L is responsible for distribution of elec-
tricity, and it supplements its own output by buying in bulk at actual
operating cost plus debt service from the two subsidiaries, which have the
main responsibility for generation. EAF&L staffs and manages the two sub-
sidiaries. EAF&L is a well-managed utility; its organization is sound and
it will continue to 'Lie capable of managing TRDC efficiently when that
company has to carry out the Project.
vi.       The Government now has a controlling interest in EAP&L and KPC
and has recently aquired all the shares of TRDC. It has decided that the
structure of the industry needs to be rationalized and intends tci carry
out studies, on which it will consult with Sweden and the Bank, on how this
can best be accomplished.
vii.      The present arrangements are a reasonable basis on which to
proceed with the loan, provided the bulk sales agreement between TRDC and
EAR&L is amended so that EAF&L has a firm obligation to purchase a minimum
amount of power from TRDC which will provide sufficient revenues to meet
TRDCTs ascertained costs. It is also proposed to include as Dart, of the
costs payable by EAR&L a development surcharge which will cover part of the
local currency costs of the Project. The balance of these requirements will
be met by a loan from EAF&L (which has substantial surpluses) to TRDC.
This financing method is satisfactory. The surcharge will be fixed so as
to produce about the same average return on average net fixed assets in
service for KPC and TRDC combined, as for EAP&L. This return would be at
least 9.5% during the period 1972-1974, and 8% thereafter.
viii.     The findings of a preliminary investigation to determ ie the
ecological changes which are likely to follow from the construction of
the Project indicates that there are not likely to be any undesirable side
effects.
ix.       The Government has employed consultants to study the potential
agricultural value of the Tana catchment.  It has, however, granted water
rights which safeguard the production of the various hydroelectric power                  _
stations, in operation or proposed, on the Tana River, and except as Kenya,
Sweden and the Bank shall otherwise agree, will not commit itself to a
development program which would interfere substantially with the generation
of power at Kamburu.
x.        Procurement for the Project will be on the basis of international
competitive bidding for all equipment and works which are to be financed in
whole or in part from the Bank Loan.
xi.       The Project would be suitable for a Bank Loan of US$23 million,
for a term of 25 years including 3½ years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF THE KAMBURU HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTICN
1.01      This report appraises the Tana Rive l Development Campany
Limited's (TRDC) hydroelectric power project at Kamburu in Kenya, with
an initial capacity of 60 MW, and associated transmission lines. The
estimated cost of the Project is KE 13.4 million (US$37.5 million);
XL 9.3 million (US$26.1 million) would be foreign exchange. The
Government of Kenya has asked the Bank, and the Swedish International
Development Agency (SIDA), to finance the foreign exchange. The proposed
Bank Loan would be Kb 8.2 million (US$23 million) which includes
S           US$2.9 million interest during construction; KX  2.1 million (US$6.0 mil-
lion) would be covered by the proposed SIDA credit. TRDC would finance
the local costs of the Project from surpluses accruing to it and from a
loan from the East African Power and Lighting Company Linmited (EAF&IL),
which manages TRDC. The Bank has made no previous loans for power in
Kenya.
Background
1.02      An August 1967 Bank economic Report on Uganda recommended
coordination of the development of electrical power in Kenya and Uganda,
using the transmission line between Uganda and Kenya for the interchange
of power. The Governments and Electricity Authorities in Kenya and Uganda
agreed to coordinate power developments in each country, subject to unfore-
seen events, up to the year 1976. The first project agreed for development
in Kenya was the Kamburu Project, for commissioning in 1973. The Kenya
Government requested Bank financing in September 1969. A description of
the proposals for interchange of power between the two countries and for
development to 1980 is given in Annex 1.
1.03      This  report  is based on information provided by the East
African Power and Lighting Company Limited (EAP&L); the findings of an
appraisal by Messrs. A. E. Bailey, A. A. Raizen, and T. B. Russell in
March/April 1970; and on information obtained by later visits in October
and November 1970, and during negotiations.



2. GENERAL ECCNONY AND THE POWER SECTOR
The Country and the Economr
2.01      Kenya borders the Indian Ocean and Somalia (east); Ethiopia and
Sudan (north); Uganda and Lake Victoria (west); and Tanzania (south).
Total area is 225,000 sq mi, about 75% of which, mainly in the north, is
mostly semidesert. Population of about 11 million has been growing at
3.3% per annum since 1962, one of the highest rates in Africa. Density
exceeds 1,000 per sq mi in parts of the southern coastal area and plateau.
Urban population has been growing at nearly 7% per annwn. Nairobi, the
capital, has a population of nearly 500,000 (almost double the 1962 figure),
and Mombasa, the main port, has 250,000; there are eight other towns with
populations ranging from 10,000 to 50,000.
2.02      GDP grew at 6.3% per annum at constant prices during 1964-1969;
annual growth rates of the monetized and non-monetized sectors were 7.1%
and 4.1% respectively, and GDP per head increased by 2.8% annua-lly to
US$123 in 1969. An adequate supply of domestic and external capital
played a large part in achieving these rates of growth; investient was
about 20% of GDP. In 1969 the monetized sector accoumnled for about 76%
and the subsistence sector for 24% of GDP. Agriculture contributed about
34%, manufacture 10%, transport and communications 9%, and Government 15%.
A real annual growth of about 6.5% 1/ in GDP should be possible until 197',
the period covered by the current development plan, during which the share
of agriculture is expected to fall to less than 30%, and manufacture to
rise to nearly 12%.
Energy Resources
2.03      The main energy resource is hydroelectric power.  Its physical
potential is estimated at over 30,000 GWh per annum, half scattered over
small rivers mostly uneconomic to exploit. The Tana River accounts for
the other 15,000 GWh, of which about 2,700 GWh is economically exploitable.
No fossil fuels have been discovered in Kenya. Surveys have shown no coal
seams of economic value and the geological structure of most of Kenya seems
to preclude the occurrence of oil except in a strip bordering 'Somalia and
in the north-east. Imported crude oil is processed at a refinery in Mombasa
with a capacity of 2.2 million tons per annum; more than 40% of its output
is exported.  Oil for electricity generation is supplied direct from the
refinery. Kenya imports 30 MW at 95% load factor from the Ugarnda Electricity
Board (UEB).

2.04      Preliminary tests have shown tha-t there may be exploitable
geothermal energy in the Rift Valley at Lake Hannington. Detailed
investigation is now in progress with UNDP assistance.
The Power Sector
2.05      EAP&L is responsible for public electricity supplies.  The market
grew at little more than the rate of the GDP during 1964-70 partl.y because
of the slow growth of industrial sales (see paragraph 2.06). Statistics
for 1964 and 1970 are summarized below; details are in Annexes 2 and 3.
Annual growth of sales ranged from a low of 2% in 1965 to a high of 12.2%
in 1970 with substantial fluctuations during intermediate years. The Nairobi
district accounts for over 60% of total sales and the coastal area, including
Mombasa, for 25%.

2.06      Growth of industrial demand was inhibited until recently by the
development of industries in Uganda and Tanzania, which prior to indepen-
dence depended heavily on Kenya industry for consumer goods. The resurgence
of industrial demand in Kenya suggests that the surplus capacity created by
loss of markets in Tanzania and Uganda has naw been absorbed by the growth
of Kenya's economy, which may be expected to continue at a faster rate for
some time.

3. THE BCRROWER AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY INDUSTRY
Structure of the Electricity Supply Indus t.r
3.01      The elec'uricity supply in Kenya consists of three companies:
(a)  The East African Power & Lighting Company Limited (EAP&L);
(b) The Kenya Power Company Limited (KPC); and
(c)  Tana River Development Company Limited (TRDC).
EAR&L, which is the sole distributor, was founded in 1922 by the amalgama-
tion of two private companies which had supplied Nairobi and Mombasa since
1907 and 1909.  Both KPC and TRDC were created by EAF&IL, the former in 1955
principally to finance the interconnection with Uganda and sell to EAP&L
power imported, and the latter in 1964 to develop the potential of the
Tana River. At the time these companies were formed the stock of EAP&L
was privately owned by a large numberof shareholders. Almost all of the
capital raised for KPC and TRDC was loan capital. EAF&L shared the owner-
ship of the nominal equity with the Government which became the owner of
one third of KPC's equity capital and one quarter of TRDCts. EAP&L coordi-
nates all sources of power and staffs and manages the other two companies,
neither of which has any directly-appointed staff. A brief description of
the history of the power companies is in Annex 4.
3.02      When finanicing the Kamburu Project was under consideration, the
Government in 1969 decided to obtain control of EAF&L by purchasing its
shares. As a result of market purchases and a bid made early in 1970 for
all the Company's shares on the London stock register, the Government
became, in July 1970, the majority shareholder in the company and consequently
of KPC. The Government is continuing to purchase shares on the Kenya register
as and when they become available.  The Government aquired all the shares of
TRDC in February 1971, and plans to do likewise with KPC.
3.03      With Government control of EAP&L, if it were possible to solve the
financial and other problems involved, there would be merit in merging the
three companies. Prior to negotiations the Government had announced its
intention of amalgamating TRDC and KPC, and of making the new campany res-
ponsible for the construction and operation of all new major generation and
transmission facilities, so leaving EAP&L primarily a distributor. During
negotiations the Government stated that its present view is that rationa-
lization of the structure of the power industry could best be achieved by
integrating all three companies. The Government also stated that it proposed
to make a study of the problems involved and it would consult with Sweden and
the Bank in this connection.
3.04      EAP&L purchases the entire output of KPC and TRDC at "ascertained"
cost, I/ and is the only company with surplus revenue-earning capacity. The
_7 Ascertained cost is defined in Paragraph 6.02.



funds required to enable the proposed bor:arer to cover its operating expenses,
pay its debt service and meet the local currency costs of the Project must
therefore come from EAP&L, and appropriate arrangements are necessary to
assure TRDC's revenue. Discussions were held during negotiations with the
Government and EAP&L concerning these matters. It was agreed that a develop-
ment surebarge be included to meet the needs of TRDC's development program.
It was also agreed during negotiations that EAP&L would be required to pur-
chase a minimum amount of power from TRDC which,bearing in mind the price
limitation of 0.75 cents per kWh specified in the Bulk Supply Licence,
would provide sufficient revenues to meet TRDC's ascertained costs. Since
EAF&L will be dependent upon the output from TRDC's hydroelectric power
stations in meeting its system demand, and the minimum amount of power involved
is less than 30% of the amount EAP&L would normally purchase under the most
adverse condition of the 1 in 75 dry year (it would represent less than 10%
in an average year) this solution would be acceptable to the Bank. An appro-
propriate amendment to the existing bulk sales agreement in a form satisfactory
to the Bank will be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank Loan.
Organization and Management
3.05      EAP&L is well managed and its organization is in accordance with
sound public utility practice. The Government intends that EAF&L continue
to operate on commercial principles. The only change which has taken place
since Government obtained control of the Company is the appointment of a
Kenyan as its new Chairman. Most of the senior management staff are expa-
triates with wide experience in public utilities, and Goverrment has no
intention of replacing them until such time as properly qualified Kenyan
citizens are available to take their place. The new Chairman has had no
previous experience in the electricity supply industry, but is a campetent
administrator.
3.06      The staff of EAP&L on January 1, 1971 numbered 2,h30 of whom 189
are professional staff. The number of connected consumers was about 100,000
and consumers per employee about 41 'see Annex 5 for comparison with the
power sector in other countries). This is reasonable, bearing in mind the
miscellany of installations, the amount of construction carried out by the
company staff, and the distances involved. There were 165 expatriates on
January 1, 1971 most of whom were on two-year contracts.
3.0?      The present management and staff are fully experienced and com-
petent to operate the Companies efficiently. They are also competent to
carry out the Project with the assistance of consultants, and to carry out
other works covered by EAP&L's development program. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that TRDC will continue to employ consultants
satisfactory to the Bank in carrying out the Project.
3.08      The additional responsibilities to be incurred by TRDC if it is
to carry out and successfully operate the Project will necessitate a
revision of the agreement by which EAP&L manages TRDC. The amendment will



provide that EAP&L will make available to TRDC comprehensive management
services, including forward planning, which are not provided under the
present agreement.  It is important also to ensure that EAR&L is under
sound management at all times and is capable of operating efficiently.
These matters were discussed during negotiations and it was agreed that
EAR&L would notify Lhe Bank about any changes in the appointments of the
General Manager, the Chief Engineers in charge of generation and. planning
and the Chief Accountant, and would make changes in these appointments
only after consideration of the views expressed by the Bank.  It was also
agreed during negotiations that EAR&L would enter into the covenLants usually
made by a beneficiary of a Bank Loan with respect to operating in accordance
with sound business, public utility and financial practices, insurance, and
exchange of information with the Bank.  The revision of the management
agreement in a form satisfactory to the Bank will be a condition of effec-
tiveness of the Bank Loan.
Training
3.09      EAP&L envisages filling all posts with Kenyans as and when appli-
cants with suitable training and experience become available.  Training
is given to employees who have basic qualifications and abilities to fit
them for senior posts.  Students are sponsored for university training in
Kenya or abroad, or for training at the Kenya Polytechnic. At the time of
the appraisal, six Kenyan citizens had obtained engineering degrees and a
further three were scheduled to graduate during 1970. EAP&L plans to sponsor
six undergraduates per year from 1971 if suitable candidates can be found,
and will be sponsoring eleven out of a total of 54 higher technician,
electrical and mechanical trainees who are expected to graduate with a Higher
National Diploma from the Polytechnic during the next four years. EAP&L has
sponsored two accountants who have recently completed degree courses, and
three more who are studying for a degree at University College, Nairobi.
Seventeen accounting staff are involved in part-time or correspondence courses.
Existing Installations
3.10      Electricity is distributed by EAP&L in four areas of Kenya, namely
the Nairobi districtb and the Rift, Coast and Western areas (see map). Generat-
ing plant operated by the three companies (shown in detail in Annex 6) con-
sists of:
Interconnected System      Isolated Stations

Steam                                70 MW
Diesel                               27  MW                     3.7  MW

Total                         176  MW                        8 NW



-7-
3.11      Plant overdue for retirement or no longer used has been excluded
from these totals.  A 30 MW steam unit now under construction at Kipevu and
scheduled for commissioning this year is included. TRDC's Kindaruma hydro-
electric station (40 MW) on the Tana River some 68 miles from Nairobi and
EAP&L's 70 MW Kipevu steam station at Mombasa some 300 miles from Nairobi
are the largest installations. Each is interconnected with the Nairobi
area by 132 kV single-circuit transmission lines. Other installations
include seven hydroelectric developments. The largest are Tana (14.4 MW)
and Wainjii (7.h MW), both run-of-river schemes on the Tana River, owned
by KPC. The remaining five hydroelectric installations together with
thirteen diesel-electric power stations and the gas turbine generating plant
are owned by EAF&L. The Kenyan system is also linked to Uganda by a 132 kV
double-circuit transmission line (see paragraphs 2.03 and 3.01). The bulk
supply from UEB can be increased from 30 to 45 MW if the plant in Uganda is
available, according to the terms of a supplementary agreement.
3.12      All major load centers are interconnected by 132 kV and 33 kV
transmission lines. Distribution voltages are 11 kV and 415/240 V. The
supply is reliable and losses are reasonable.
Future Development
3.13      In addition to the Project, Kenya's development program until
1980 (see Annex l) includes, for commissioning in the years listed:
(a)  1976.   The second stage of Kamburn:  one 30 MW set (No. 3),
and a second transmission line to Nairobi.
(b)  1977.   Thermal set No. 7 (30 MW) at Kipevu.
(c)  1979.   TRDC's hydroelectric scheme at Gtaru (94 MW).
(d)  1980.   A gas turbine unit (12 MW) to be installed by EAF&IL.
It may also be necessary to install a 12 MW gas turbine unit in
1973, before the Project is completed, to meet a need for peak capacity.
EAP&L will decide on this late in 1971.
3.14      Future development should take advantage of the economies of
cooperating with Uganda, through use of the 132 kV transmission line which
interconnects the two national power systems. The development program in
paragraph 3.13 is based on limited cooperation between Kenya and Uganda
involving a continuation of the 30 MW bulk supply from Uganda throughout
the period. Full cooperation could defer either Kenya's next large hydro-
electric development at Gtaru, or Uganda's next large hydroelectric deve-
lopment at Murchison Falls.
3.15      EAP&L has made generous provision for expansion of secondary
transmission and distribution in step with the developing load. It is
unlikely that EAP&L will be able to spend as much as forecast on these
facilities.



3.16      It is uncertain whether the geothermal investigation (paragraph 2 .04)
will be sufficiently conclusive to affect developments during the next few
years. The proposed No. 7 set at Kipevu, scheduled for commissioning in 1977
and the gas turbine in 1980 could be affected if an economic source of
geothermal energy were discovered by 1974. This plant, or the geothermal
energy which might replace it, constitutes part of the thermal back-up for
Kenya's hydroelectric installations, where output is dependent uponI seasona-1
variations in river flow. It would be required regardless of the extent to
which cooperation with Uganda is ultimately achieved.
Rural Electrification
3.17      EAP&L has devoted a small portion of its development expenditure
to supplies in rural areas. Schemes likely to become financially reimnera-
tive in time have been selected from a list of townships nominated by the
Government.  These arrangements, which have worked well, will continue and
additionally the Government is considering a suggestion that the surplus
created in Government accounts by the difference between the soft terms of
the SIDA credit and the harder terms on which the Government will relend to
TRDC, would be used to finance an expanded rural electrification program.
Swedish consultants appointed by SIDA have prepared a preliminary report on
this subject which envisages the electrification of some 25 to 30 small
country towns and villages, with populations ranging from 2,000 to 5,000,
some of which would not be financially remunerative. The proposal made by
the consultants is that the capital cost of the schemes and the operating
losses should be financed from the above mentioned surplus created in
Government accounts. This subject was discussed during negotiations, and
Government indicated that this matter must be further studied before a
decision can be reached on the use of the surplus thus created, and the
method of implementing an expanded rural electrification program.  In any
event, it is unlikely that any such expansion would have any material effec-t
on EAP&L.

4.  THE PROJECT
Description
4.o0      The Project is described in detail in Annex 7; it consists of:
(a)  A rock-fill dam forming a reservoir on the Tana River for
daily regulation, with an intake close to the dam;
(b) an underground power station, designed for three 30 MW
generating sets driven by Francis turbines, with two sets
to be installed under the Project;
(c)  an unlined tailrace tunnel about 3 km in length; and
(d) a 220 kV single-circuit transmission line from Kamburu to outside
Nairobi (105 km) and a 132 kV single-circuit transmission line
from Kamburu to Kindaruma hydroelectric station (15 km).
4.02      Kamburu is a run-of-river scheme and the station will produce
energy at varying weekly load factors dependirg not only upon the river
flow but also on the ability of the power system to absorb the energy
produced. In the wet season the average weekly output is expected to be
about 42 MW, and in the dry season of the 1 in 10 dry year this would drop
to 23 Md. The estimated average annual output would be about 355 GWh.
Estimated Cost
4.03      The estimated cost of the Project excluding interest during
construction is K, 13.4 million (US$37.5 million) of which KE 9.3 million
(US$26.1 million) would be foreign exchange. The estimated costs of the
principal features of the Project are shown in the following table, and
in more detail in Annex 8.

Amount of Loan
4.o4      The proposed Bank Loan of US$23 million equivalent and SIDA
Credit of US$6 million equivalent would jointly cover the foreign exchange
requirements of the Project including interest during construction on the
Bank Loan.
Basis for Estimates
4.o5      The consultants based their initial estimates upon experience
with the Kindaruma hydroelectric station which was commissioned in 1968, and
the 132 kV Mombasa/Nairobi transmission line which was commissioned in 1970.
As a check estimates were then obtained where possible from manufacturers
and contractors for the electrical and mechanical and main civil engineering
works, and estimates were recalculated on 1971 costs.  A physical conti>gency
of 15% has been allowed for the civil works and 10% for the mechanical/elec-
trical works and the transmission line, to provide for any increases in costs
due to unforeseen difficulties and extras which might arise during construc-
tion. An allowance for other contingencies (price escalation of 7% per annum)
is included. These estimates and allowances are considered reasonable.
4.o6      There are no permanent human habitations or cultivation in the area
which would be inundated by the Project, and consequently no provision for
resettlement costs has been included in the estimates.
Status of Engineering and Construction
4.07      The Project is being designed by Engineering and Power Development
Consultants of England.  This firm or its affiliate, Balfour, Beatty & Com-
pany Limited,have been associated with EAP&L since that company was formed
in 1921, and have been responsible for designing and constructing all EAP&Lts
major development projects and for TRDC's Kindaruma hydroelectric power
station. The consultants will also supervise construction of the Project.
Initial contracts are expected to be placed in June 1971.  Documents have been
prepared by the consultants who will also evaluate the tenders.  The target
for completion by July 1974 is tight. The consultants consider, however,
that it can be achieved if there are no unforeseen delays.
4.08      The Project must be commissioned by 1974 if the expected demand is
to be met. This is illustrated in Annex 9 which shows the projected maximum
demand together with the installed and firm capacity. If it becomes apparent
that the plant is to be delayed substantially beyond July 197Th, EAP&L proposes
to bring forward the 12 MW gas turbine scheduled for 1980 (see paragraph 3.13(d)).
Procurement and Disbursement
4.09      Procurement will be on the basis of international competitive
bidding for all equipment and works which are to be financed in whole or in



- 11 -
part from the SDA Credit and the Bank Loan. Procurement which is not on
the basis of international competitive bidding would be classified as local
expenditure. Disbursements under the Bank Loan and the SIDA Credit would
be made against the actual foreign exchange component of supply, erection,
construction and engineering costs as specified in the contracts, in the
proportion of 77% for the Bank Loan and 23% for the SIDA Credit. In
addition, interest during construction on the Bank Loan would be credited
to the Loan account. These proposed arrangements were confirmed during
negotiations. Because of the need to start construction by mid-1971, expen-
diture not exceeding US$600,000 will be incurred on engineering design prior
to signing the loan, and should be eligible for reimbursement from the
proposed Loan. Any balance of the Loan not used on completion of the Pro-
ject should be cancelled. A disbursement schedule is given in Annex 10.
Ecological Aspects
4.10      Experience at Kindaruma, 19 km downstream of Kamburu, indicates
that the Project should not cause major ecological problems. Notwithstanding,
it was recommended that a study should be carried out to determine if ecolo-
gical changes are likely to follow from the Project, and to determine what
steps, if any, need to be taken to avoid or mitigate undesirable side effects.
SIDA agreed to finance this study by a direct grant of US$50,000 to the
Government which intended to appoint consultants as soon as a preliminary
reconnaissance had been completed. The Bank assisted in the selection of an
expert for the preliminary reconnaissance which was carried out by Dr. L.
Blankenship of the East African Agriculture and Forestry Research Organiza-
tion. The findings of this preliminary investigation indicated that there
are not likely to be any undesirable side effects on the ecology of the area.
However, it is considered possible that the change of land use patterns
resulting from movement of population into the area may have an effect on
the Project, and the SIDA grant is to be used to finance a study, which is
to be designed with the help of the Bank, to evaluate the impact of changing
land use patterns.  The findings of such a study are expected to assist the
Government in the control of land use in this and other areas.
Agricultural Aspects
4.i1      The installed capacity of the several existing developments on
the Tana River is 63 Md, and arnnual production based on average flow is
390 GWJh, or about 50% of present EAP&L requirements. The Kamburu sbheme
will be operated as a run-of-river development shortly upstream of Kirndaruma,
and will use the same water which Government has already allocated to the
downstream facilities.
4.12      In investigating its land resources for agricultural purposes, the
Government has employed agricultural consultants to review the possibilities
for irrigation developments in the Tana River Basin. On authorization of



- 12 -
the Government an advance copy of the consultants' draft report was made
available to the Bank (this report has not yet been submitted to the
Government, which has hence taken no position on its conclusionls and
recomnendations).  The draft report indicates that about 258,000 acres in
-the Upper Tana Basin are suitahle for Bn2provement  by irri,atLi.on.  Of this
area the draft repoct proposes the development over 30 years of 225,000
acres of which 170,000 acres are upstream of Seven Forks.
4.13      The consultants' draft report does not give details of monthly
abstractions for irrigation, but on the basis of the cropping pattern
illustrated in the report, it is estimated that in an average year, loss
of power due to irrigation when the proposed development is completed could
amount to about 73 million kWh (see Annex 11). If monthly abstractions
upstream of Seven Forks exceed the assumnptions based on the consul1 tanltLs'
estimates by as much as 25%, this would result in a further loss of power
of about 23 million kWh. This lost hydro power would have to be replaced
by thermal power at an annual incremental cost of about KE 126,000 in the
first case and about IG 166,000 in the latter case.
4.14      During the driest periods of the 1 in 10 dry year, the capa-
bility of Kamburu and Kindaruwa would be limited even wi-thout upstream abs-
traction and they would be operated as peaking installations, at less than
installed capacity, by running down the reservoir. The thermal capacity
which would have to be available to meet this eventuality would also be
adequate to meet the loss in capacity due to abstraction for irrigation.
4.15      The effects of possible irrigation developmen-ts on the justifica-
tion of the Kamburu scheme would differ with the rate of development assumed.
The consul-tants' draft report assumes that development will commence around
1973, that it will build up gradually to a rate which is commensurate with
Kenya's ability to implement and that development would be spread over 30
years with completion around 2003 . On this basis, the effect on the
economics of the Project is slight, reducing the equalizing discount rate
compared with the thermal alternative (see paragraph 5.02) from about 11%
to about 10%. It should be noted that Kenya's current development plan
does not provide for irrigation in the Upper Tana area and it is therefore
unlikely that the development proposed by the consultants, even if accepted
by the Government, could be started as early as 1973. Even under the more
severe and improbable assumption that development could be completed in
15 instead of the 30 years es-timated by the consultants -- there is no
evidence at the present time of any economic justification for such a large
and rapid development or, for that matter, the presence of institutiornal
capacity to undertake such a development -- the equalizing discount rate
would be further reduced by only about one half of one percentage point.
4.16      The consultants' draft report concludes that with full development
of the irrigation potential, developing the Tana hydro-power resources to
the maximum extent is still to be preferred to a reduced hydro-power



- 13 -
development. It further states that this conclusion is highly insensitive
to changes in the estimated water requirement for upstream irrigation, and
that interference of the proposed upstream agricultural development with
the planned development of hydroelectric power stations would lead only to
a change in the mode of operating the national power system.
4.17      DLring negotiations, it was agreed that any decision to embark
on a large scale agricul-tural development and the determination of the
pace of that developmen-t would await the outcome of an integrated basin
survey which, following a pre-investment study mission in November 1970,
the Bank recommended should be included in a program of pre-investment
studies. The Government has agreed that, except as Kenya, Sweden and the
Bank shall otherwise agree, Kenya shall not commit itself to a development
program which involves abstraction of water from the Tana River or its
tributaries upstream of Seven Forks to an extent which would in-terfere
substantially with the ability of the Borrower to generate power at the
Kamburu power station. It was understood that should Kenya, after com-
pletion of studies, conclude that an agricultural development program
upstream of Seven Forks was in its best economic interests, taking into
consideration the cos-t of replacing by thermal generation the hydro-power
thus lost, the Bank and Sweden would not unreasonably withhold agreement
to such a program of development.

5. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Market Growth
5.01      Economic  ustification of the Project is n-ot very sensitive to
the rate of growth which is assumed for the future.  Past trends of EAPtuL's
sales have been described in paragraph 2.05.  The latest (1970) EAP&N
forecast assumes an average annual rate of increase of 9% thrw4rh 1 976
(see Annex 2), taking into account all known major deve-Lopments (see
Annex 12) and assuming that the Government's target of G.7% per numiun in
growth of GDP over -the period to 1974 will be achieved. EAP&L's forecast
was checked by making independent projections based on regressIon analysis
of electriciuy sales against the monetized comaponent of GDP, industrial
output and urban population for the period 1964-1968 (see Annex 13).  This
analysis suggested a possible lower limit to the average growth rate of
just over 7% per annum.  The influence of different rates of growth on the
economic justification of the Project was considered (paragraph 5.02 and
Annex 14).
Comparison of Alternatives
5.02      The next best alternative to the Project would be a thermal-
electric power development on the coast, burning fuel oil from .Mombasa
refinery. A comparison based on the discounted cash flows of tbe alter-
natives over the life of the Project showed that, with the assuwptions
made for the key variables (load growth, capital costs, oil price), the
Project was the lower cost for discount rates up to about 11%. The sensi-
tivity of this result was tested as decribed in Annex 14 for variations in
the values assumed for the main varlables (capital costs, operating costs,
oil price and load growth). The analysis indicated a range of 9-13% for
the equalizing discount rate, the most likely value being about 11%.  The
estimated range of the opportunity cost of capital in Kenya is 10-12%.
The decision therefore is a close one but the choice of Project is reason-
able,particularly since the discount rate is 15% if the hydroelectric deve-
lopment is credited with the multiplier effects of the extra local expendi-
ture which it involves and if, because of widespread unemployment and under-
employment, unskilled labor is valued at only half its money wage. This
favors hydro because of its much higher unskilled labor requirements during
construction (3,400 man-years against 950 for the thermal development).
Internal Financial Rate of Return
5.03      The internal financial rate of return would be within the range
13%-20% with a likely rate, based on the best estimate, of about 16%. The
assumptions underlying this calculation are described in Annex 15.                         *

6. FINANCIAL A3PECTS
Introduction
6.01      The financial situation of the borrower, TRDC, must be analyzed
in relation to KPC, with which it may be merged (see paragraph 3.03), and
to EAP&L from which it derives all its revenues. The published financial
statements of KPC and TRDC are prepared on the basis of debt retirement
accounting, consistent with the definition of ascertained cost on which
their revenues have been determined. It is necessary, therefore, to pre-
pare pro forma statements for them which assume the use of conventional
deprecFTation accounting, so that their earnings and financial position
can be compared with EAP&L's and with the norms customarily applied by
the Bank to public utility projects in other countries. Accordingly, both
actual and pro forma financial statements have been prepared and are
attached as Annexes 16 to 20 covering the period 1966-1969 (actual) and
1970-1976 (estimated).
Definition of Ascertained Cost for Determining Revenues of KPC and TRDC
6.02      The bulk supply licenses of KPC and TRDC define ascertained cost
(on the basis of which their revenues are determined) as the actual audited
cost each year for the following items:
(a) operations and administration. For KPC this also includes
the costs of purchasing power from Uganda;
(b) interest and redemption payments for debt;
(c) income or other taxes. Neither KPC nor TRDC has yet paid
any income tax; neither company has had any taxable income
because of the large depreciation allowances deductible for
tax purposes (see footnote 2 to Annex 18(b)); and
(d) such other charges as the Government shall consider proper
to be allowed. Use of this authority is now proposed to add
a development surcharge (see paragraphs 3.04, 6.15 and 6.16).
In addition, ascertained cost may and does include small annual appro-
priations to a Reserve and Equalization Fund which, with the interest on
the securities in which it is invested, is available for future capital
expenditure, or to cover deficiencies in income and to pay for abnormal
expenses (see footnote 3 to Annex 18(b)).
EAP&L's Tariffs
6.03      Changes in EAP&L's tariffs require Governmental approval.  Under
the Electric Power Act of Kenya, tariffs must be reduced when net operating
income before income tax for any year exceeds 121g of the "capital expended
on the undertaking". Briefly, the base for measuring rate of return for
Lhis statutory standard is equivalent to the gross fixed assets, including
work in progress, plus inventories. The logic of the statutory standard
is not apparent. Since the income used in measuring the return is net of



- 16 -
the allowance for depreciation of fixed assets (considered as an expense
chargeable to consumers) one would expect that the assets base would also
be net of the accumulated provision for depreciation. Also, since the
Act allows capitalization of interest during construction of works for
generation and transnission, on the capital "tsubscribed, borrcwed, or ap-
plied" for such wu&-ks, one would expect the assets base to exclude work
in progress and that the return would be related to fixed assets in service
plus working capital as is usually the case for public utilities. EAF&L's
earnings have never exceeded the statutory limit, and in recent years the
highest statutory return actlieved was about 10% in 1968.
6.o4      F.AP&L increased its tariffs in August 1966 by about 15% in Nairobi
and the Coast areas, and by a smaller percentage elsewhere.  After a con-
sultant's study had been completed, new uniform tariffs were introduced
throughout the country in May 1968, which resulted in a small further
increase averaging about 1%. The tariff structure, in its differentiation
between classes of consumers, appears to be reasonable. Although uniform
national tariffs exist, these contain a fuel surcharge with the result that
the charges in areas served by isolated diesel stations are higher than
elsewhere because of higher fuel costs.
Capital Structure and Financial Conditlion
6.o5      As will be seen from Annex 16 (a), on the basis of the debt
retirement accounting used in published reports rather than conventional
depreciation accounting, TRDC had net assets of about Ki 5 .5 million at
the end of 1969.1/  While virtually all of these assets had been financed
by borrowing, most of the debt was payable in pounds sterling and the gain
from the devaluation of the pound in 1967 is now reflected as equity. Thus,
the debt/equity ratio at the end of 1969 was 89/11. By the end of 1974,
after completion of the Project, net assets would be about KS 20.3 million
and the debt/equity ratio would be 92/8, which is higher than normally would
be considered desirable (but see paragraph 6.09).
6.06      KPC also has benefited from devaluation of sterling.  In addition,
as shown in Annex 17, KPC's equity capital has increased by repurchasing
debt for sinking fund requirements at substantial discounts, and through
the provision for the Reserve and Bqualization Fund. At the end of 1969
KPC's net assets were about KE 53½ million and its debt/equity ratio was
69/31. The net assets would be &X 4.6 million at the end of 197a'> and the
debt/equity ratio would have improved to 61/39.
6.07      If depreciation accounting were used (see Annex 18(a)), there
would be an additional accrual to the equity capital of TRDC, in the form
of retained earnings representing the extent to which the provision for
1/ Net assets, as shown in the financial Annexes, equals the sum of net
fixed assets in service, work in progress, investments and net current
assets.



- 17 -
debt redemption used in determining ascertained costs would exceed the
provision for depreciation. This would also be true of KPC by 1975. On
this basis the two companies combined would have net assets of Kb 10.8
million at the end of 1969 and a debt/equity ratio of 81/19, and at the
end of 1974 they would have combined net assets of KS 25.6 million and a
debt/equity ratio of 84/16.
6.o8      EAP&L uses depreciation accounting, and as will be seen from
Annex 19 (a) it is conservatively capitalized. At the end of 1969 its
total net assets were about Kb 15.3 million and its debt/equity ratio was
9/91. By the end of 1974 EAP&L's net assets would be about KS 23 million,
and its debt/equity ratio would be 19/81.
6.09      It is more realistic to view the capital structure of the three
companies on a combined basis, using conventional depreciation accounting
for KPC and TRDC as well as EAP&L. The pro forma combined balance sheets
contained in Annex 20 (a) show that, at the end of 1969, the total net
assets of the three companies were KS 25.3 million and the debt/equity
ratio was 37/63.   By the end of 1974 the total net assets are estimated
to be KE 44 million and the debt/equity ratio 48/52. It is apparent, there-
fore, that on a combined basis the three companies are conservatively
capitalized.
6.10      The fixed assets of all three companies are generally recorded
at cost. Since prices in Kenya have been quite steady, the book values of
fixed assets can be accepted as reasonable. It was agreed during negotia-
tions, however, that the rate of return covenant (see paragraph 6.24) would
make provision for revaluation of assets in accordance with methods satis-
factory to the Bank, if in the future the book value of assets becomes
unrealistic as a result of currency revaluations, changes in prices, or
similar factors.
6.11      Annex 20 (a) indicates that the three companies have ample
working capital and satisfactory cash positions except in 1973 when some
use of overdraft facilities may be required. The cash forecasts have been
made on a conservative basis and are probably urderstated. There has been
good control of debtors; accounts receivable amunted to only a little more
than one month's billings at the end of 1969.
Historical Earnings
6.12      As prepared on the basis of debt retirement accounting, the
revenue accounts of TRDC are contained in Annex 16 (b) and of KPC in
Annex 17. In view of the Government's plans to acquire all of the out-
standing shares of KPC as well as of TRDC, and to rationalize the structure
of the power industry by merger, the earnings of TRDC and KPC are best con-
sidered on a pro forma combined basis assuming conventional depreciation
accounting, as set forth in Annex 18 (b).
6.13      In the period 1966-1970 when the revenues of the companies were
limited to ascertained cost, the rates of return realized were low. Using
the test usually applied by the Bank (net operating income as a percentage
of average net fixed assets in service), the rate of return ranged from
5.8% to 6.3%.



- 18 -
6.14      During the period 1966-1970, the earnings of EAP&L were satis-
factory, particularly since 1968. As will be seen from Annex 19 (b),
measured in terms of net operating income as a percentage of avrerage net
fixed assets in service, and assuming no overprovision for depreciation,
the rate of return improved from 7.6% in 1966 to ll%-12% in 1968-1970.
The net income applicable to ordinary shares as a percentage O f the average
equity applicable thereto was 6.4% in 1966 and 8% in 1967, and improved
to 11%-13% for 1968-1970.
Proposed Financing Plan
6.15      The financing plan includes a proposed development surcharge
which EAP&L would pay to TRDC to provide it with some of the funds re-
quired to pay the local currency costs of the Project. The proposal to
employ the development surcharge was evolved during discussions in Octob-cr
1970 among the Government, EAP&L and the Bank as a means of accomplishing              0
a redistribution of some of EAP&L's revenues to TRDC, in a manzer mnore ap-
propriate to their future roles and so that each would earn reasonable amounts
for development. In connection with this proposal, Government stated it
would not wish consumer tariffs to be increased solely as a result of the
revised arrangements, and Government agreed that TRDC's income from the sur-
charge would be exempted from taxation.Y/ EAP&L indicated it had no objection
in principle to a redistribution of revenues through the development sur-
charge, provided it were done in an equitable manner which would not seriously
affect its financial interests. The Bank indicated it would want the
Government to agree that EAP&L would be allowed to earn a reasonable minimum
return on its net fixed assets in operation. This was necessary to assure
the financial health of EAP&L, on which in turn TRDC is dependent, and to
guard against the possibility that EAP&L would be squeezed between Govern-
ment's control of EAP&L tariff changes and increasing development surcharges
for TRDC.
6.16      It was agreed during negotiations that during the period of
construction of the Project, and for such other periods as the0jovernment,
deemed fit, EAP&L would pay as part of the cost at which it purchased                   0
electricity from TRDC a surcnarge in amounts to be determined each year so
that the rate of return on average net fixed assets in service of TRDC and
KPC combined would be the same as that earned by EAP&L.  On this basis,
present estimates indicate that the surcharge would make available about
KX 1 million during the period 1971-1974. It was also agreed during nego-
tiations that the balance of the Thnds required for the local currency costs
of the Project would be loaned to TRDC by EAP&L.
2/ The surcharge would be part of the ascertained cost which FAP&L pays for
purchasing power and therefore would be a deductible expense on EAP&L's
tax return. Since the income tax rate is 40%, the net effect of the sur-
charge on EAP&L would be a reduction of its income by 60% of the surcharge
amount.

6.18      Looking at TRDC's situation separately, as summarized in the
preceding table, 7% of its requirements in 1971-1974 would be provided by
net internal cash generation, representing principally the amounts made
available through the development surcharge (see paragraph 6.16). The
balance would be provided by borrowings:  51% by the proposed Bank Loan
which it has been assumed would bear 74% interest per annum and have a term
of 25 years including a grace period of 3½ years; 15% by the proposed SIDA
1/ Including KL 213 thousands of preliminary expenditure in 1969 and 1970,
the total estimated cost of the Kamburu I Project is K1S 15,251 thouisands.

loan which would be made to the Governent on IDA terms and relcoaned to
TRDC on tenrs similar to the Bank Loan; 23% from an E;AP&L loan which would
bear interest of 9% per annum and be repayable over the same period as the
Bank Loan; 2% from another loan from EAP&L to cover settlement of contractor
claims on the Kindaruma project, such loan to be made pursuant to AP&L' s
overrun financing commitment for that project; and 2% from an a csumed
future foreign loan for the second stage of the Kamburu project. As under
the proposed Bank loan, the agreement for relending the SIDA loan to TRDC
and the EAP&L loan agreement would provide for the capitalization of interest
charges during construction. The EAP&L loan commitment would be for an
amount equal to the estLmated local currency costs of the Project (KS 4,065,000),
plus capitalized inter-as'. during construction, and less the amount paid by
EAP&L to TRDC as de-elopment surcharge during construction of the Project.
If additional funds are required to complete the Project because of cost
overruns, the Government has agreed to provide or cause to be provided the
additional financing required in accordance with arrangements sEttisfac-tory
to the Bank.
6.19      In the period after 1974, on the asswfption that TRDC would continuo
to exist as a separate company and that the surcharge would cont,inue to be
paid on the same basis as agreed for the construction period of the Project,
Annex 16(b) indicates that TRDC should be able to finance the construction of
the second stage of the Kaamburu Project by arranging a loan for the foreign
currency requirements and meeting the local currency costs out of the proceeds
of the surcharge. To finance the Gtaru project, assuming its construction
would be begun in 1975 if a decision is made to proceed with it for commis-
sioning by early 1979 (see footnote 3 to Annex 16(b)), it would be necessary
to arrange both a foreign loan and one from EAP&L.
6.20      Forecasts of the sources and applications of funds for EAP&L for
the period 1970-1976 are presented in Annex 19(c), and the finarncing plan for
EAP&L for the period 1971-1974 is summarized in Annex 21. EAP&L should have
ample resources to meet its requirements for its own construction program
and loans to TRDC. In the period 1971-1974, 66% of these requirements would
be met from net internal cash generation of the period; 24% from other sources,         0
of which 15% would represent use of surplus cash available from past earnings
and 9% proceeds from the payment of notes received for the sale of the
Company's Tanzanian properties and the repayment of loans to TRDC; and 10%
from loans already arranged to finance the additions to the Kipevu thermal
generating station.
6.21      It is more significant to consider the financing plan on the basis
of the combined sources and requirements of the three companies, eliminating
intercompany payments, as though they were merged into one company. Viewed
in this context, as shown in the table on page 21, of the total construction
and working capital requirements for 1971-1974, 37% would be firanced by net
internal cash generation after payment of debt service and dividcends, 10%
from other sources, and 53% by borrowings, of which 36% would be provided by
the proposed Bank Loan and 11% by the SIDA Loan.  This financing plan is
quite satisfactory. As indicated in Annex 20(c), the internal cash genera-
tion covers the annual debt service requirements by an ample margin, ranging
from an estimated 4.7 times in 1970 to over 2 times in 1975 and 1976. The
reduction ref'lects the relative increase in the debt/equity ratio but the
coverage is still good at the end of the period.

Future Earnings
6.22      Forecasts of revenues and expenses are attached for TRDC (Annex 16(b)),
for THDC and KPC coibined on a pro forma depreciation basis (Annex 18(b)),
for EArL (Annex 19(b)), and foFthe Three companies combined on a pro forma
depreciation basis (Annex 20(b)).  The revenues for TRDC and K!C are fore-
cast on the basis of ascertained cost plus the development surcharge, and
for EAP&L on the basis of the sales forecast (paragraph 5.01) and existing
tariffs.  Allowances have been u-ade for annual increases in operating costs
at the rate of 5% for geneyr: on and transmission and 7% for distribution
and administrations  Frl  costs are based on existing prices and the estimated
generating program. Thes&e are reasonable assumptions.
6.23      The development surcharge has been estimated in ex anount which
would result in the same rate of return, measured in terms of net operating
income as a percentage of average net fixed assets in service, for TRDcI'KPG.
combined and for EAP&L. This returm is estimated to average 10% during
1971-1974 and 9% in 1975 and 1976. The return on average equity capital
for TRDA/KPC combined is estimated to average about 16% during 1971-1974,
fall to about 12% in 1975, and recover to 16% in 1976 (see Annex 18(b)).
For EAP&L, the net income applicable to ordinary shares as a percentage of
the average equity investment of these shares would average about 11.5%
in 1971-1974 and about 9.5% in 1975-1976. The differences in the rates of
return on equity for 'TRDC/KPC combined and for EAP&L reflect their different
capital structures, the former having about 80% debt and therefore more
earnings leverage than the latter which has a smaller debt,
6.24      It was agreed during negotiations that EAP&L would take all
necessary steps within its power so that its net operating income wiould be
not less than 9.5% of its average net fixed assets in operation for the
years 1972-1974, and not less than 8% at other times. The Government agreed
that it would take or cause to be taken all action necessary to permit EAP&L
to obtain revenues sufficient to yield this rate of return.
Dividends
6.25      EAP&L has been paying dividends on its ordinary shares at the
rate of 9% of the par value since 1967, when it was raised frcom 8%. The
financial forecasts assume that the 9% rate would be maintained unchanged
through 1976. As shown in Annex 19(b), when retained earnings are taken
into account and the dividend return is related tr' the average equity
investment in the shares, the return was about 6% in 1969 and is projected
to decline to about 4% by 1976.
Accounti  and Auditing Arrangements
6.26      It was agreed during negotiations that, beginning wi.th 1971, TRDC
and KPC would prepare a set of accounts and financial statements on a depre-
ciation accounting basis; that TRDC would prepare pro forma statements



- 23 -
combining the financial statements of TRDC and KPC as so prepared; and
that EAP&L would prepare pro forma statements combining EAP&L's statements
with those of TRDC and KPC as so prepared. It was also agreed that the
annual accounts of TRDC, KPC and EkP&L, including the pro forma accounts on
a depreciation basis for TRDC and KPC, would be auditedyIindependent
auditors satisfactory to the Bank, and that copies of the certified finan-
cial statements and of the auditors' reports would be submitted to the Bank
within four months of the close of the financial year. The firm of
Chartered Accountants which now audits the accounts of the three companies
is satisfactory to the Bank.
Debt Limitation
6.27      Debt service coverage is meaningful only in relation to the
combined situation of the three companies. Agreement was reached during
negotiations on a covenant which would limit the amount of long-term debt
which may be incurred by EAP&L, TRDC, KPC, or any similar company which may
be established in the future as a bulk supply licensee selling power to
EAF&L. Generally, under this covenant, no long-term debt would be incurred
without prior Bank approval, unless, for the fiscal year or a later 12-month
period ended prior to incurring the debt, cash earnings before provision
for depreciation were at least 1.5 times the maximum debt service for any
succeeding fiscal year on all debt including the debt to be incurred. This
test would be made on the basis of pro forma combined revenue accounts and
debt service, eliminating intercompany payments and assuming conventional
depreciation accounting.
Security Arrangements
6.28      Annex 22 describes the security arrangements for the loan capital
of EAP&L, KPC and TRDC. The outstanding debt of TRDC, amounting to about
US$14 million equivalent is secured by a floating charge or lien, on all
present and future assets. The Bank would obtain a pari passu charge on
these assets, and the existing creditors of TRDC have consented in principle
to this. Completion of the legal formalities finalizing the arrangements
would be a condition of effectiveness for the Loan.

KENYA
TANA RIVER DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LIMITED
History of Co-ordination
between Kenya and Uganda in Power Development
EAP&L concluded an agreement with the Uganda Electricity
Board (UEB) in 1955 to take a bulk supply of up to 45 MW from the new
Owen Falls power station.  Co-operation has thus already been practised
on a limited scale for some 15 years. The agreement made it possible
to defer construction of the next major power project in Kenya until
the mid-1960s. The Bank first became involved when the Uganda Minister
of Finance applied on July 4, 1966 for a loan of $59 million equivalent
for building a second hydroelectric power station on the Nile at Bujagali.
In November of that year a Bank Economic Mission which included a power
engineer, went to Uganda and had discussions with the UEB on possible
alternative developments.
The alternative developments put to the UEB by the Bank Econo-
mic Mission are set out in Annex E, Vol. IV, Part Six of Report No. AF 48a
of August 1967 under the headings "Capital Program and Future Strategy".
They amount, in essence, to co-ordination between Uganda and Kenya in
developing sources of power in the two countries, by using the existing
bulk supply line between Owen Falls and Nairobi for interchange of power.
Before the above-mentioned report was published both Governments agreed
that their power authorities should meet on August 15, 1967 to exchange
information and prepare terms of reference for their respective consul-
tants, who would then prepare jointly a report on the benefits which
could be obtained from co-ordination in line with the suggestion contained
in the report.  Agreement on the terms of reference for the joint consul-
tants was reached at this meeting and subsequently agreed with minor
modifications by the Bank. Agreement was also reached on the composition
of the Co-ordination Committee which would consist of two members of each
Government and each power authority nr der an independent chairman to be
nominated by the Bank. Lord Hinton= was eventually selected as chairman
from a list of persons suggested by the Bank.
The joint report of the consultants on co-ordinated develop-
ment was published in June 1968. It showed that over a period of 18
years up to 1986 there could be combined savings of the order of US$60
million (or 16% of total investment) by co-ordination of development
plans and amendment of the bulk supply agreement to permit an inter-
change of power between the two countries over the existing line from
Owen Falls to Nairobi. Further, capital expenditure in Kenya would be

Generating Board.

reduced and in Uganda increased, ever the 20-year period. One month
after the publication of the report, the President of Ugancda publicly
announced his Government's intention to construct the !'urchison Falls
Project, and the Government thereupon issued instructions to the UEB
to proceed with the necessary studies and preliminary works such as
rock drilling at the site.
The load forecasts made by the joint consultants showed that
a new source of power should be available by the end of 1973 and an
initial development at Kamburu on the Tana River in Kenya by 1973, to
be followed by the Murchison Falls Project on the Nile in Uganda by
1977, was proposed. Apart from the fact that the Kamburu Project was
at that time at an advanced stage of preparation, the report showed that
there would be economic advantages in building the first project in Kenya.
The first meeting of the Co-ordinating Committee under Lord
Hinton's chairmanship was held in Kampala in October 1968 to consider
the joint consultants report. The outcome of this meeting was an instruc-
tion from the Committee to the joint consultants to prepare a modified
program of co-ordinated development which would provide for the nost
economic development assuming Murchison Falls could be commissioned in
1975. The modified program suggested by the joint consultants in their
supplementary report published in November 1968, had to be further
modified subsequently due to changes in the pattern of growth of load
in Uganda. In the meantime the power authorities in both Kenya and
Uganda, in accordance with the agreement reached at a second meeting of
the Co-ordination Committee in January 1969, instructed their consultants
to prepare feasibility studies for the initial projects, i.e. Kamburu in
Kenya and Murchison Falls in Uganda.  The text of the aide memoire
exchanged as a record of the agreement reached at this meeting is as
follows:
1.   The Governments and Electricity Authorities in Kenya
and Uganda agree to work together, with good will on
both sides, to develop a co-ordinated supply of
electricity in both countries. Initially the strate-
gical plan for this long-term development shall be on
the lines set out in Scheme 4LB/ prepared by the joint
consultants.
2.   In its tactical implementation this scheme will need
to be modified from time to time and firm contractual
1/Soheme 4B is the table at the end of this Annex.



ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 4 pages
action to secure construcltion of such plants as are agreed
to be necessary will be taken by each country after
consultation with the other, as and when need for such
action arises.
3. Immediate action will be taken by Kenya and Uganda to
ensure that it is possible to complete by the dates set
out in Scheme 4B, all the work scheduled in that scheme
for completion before 1975.
4.   The Uganda Electricity Board will, as a matter of urgency,
proceed with exploratory and design work for the Murchison
scheme in order to ensure commissioning of the first set at
the end of 1975.
5.   Representatives of the Power Companies and Board agree to
meet and continue to meet to prepare a suitable tariff for
supplies in either direction, taking into account the eco-
nomies to be achieved under Scheme hB as compared with
independent generation, the charges being incurred on he
existing transmission lines Kenya/Uganda, and the cost of
additional power generation in Kenya to offset the loss
of Uganda power. They agree to continue to meet at
regular intervals of time to consider and agree the construc-
tion of such extensions to the generating and transmission
capacity of the systems in the two countries as are necessary
and the further tariff arrangements which are required.
The feasibility report for Kamburu was published in July 1969
and formed the basis for this appraisal of the Project. The engineering
volumes of the feasibility report for Murchison Falls have just been
completed, but work on the economic and financial evaluation of the
scheme has been deferred pending the results of discussions between the
Government of Uganda and friendly Governments with regard to the finan-
cing of the project.
The optimum timing for the Murchison Falls project may be
dependent upon the extent to which the two countries are prepared to
co-operate in a Joint development program up to and beyond 1975. An
examination of the combined simultaneous maximum demands of Uganda and
Kenya based on each country's forecast load growth show that with
reasonable co-operation it should be possible, by running down the 30 MW
export to Kenya, for Uganda to defer commissioning the first stage
of the Murchison Falls project until 1978. W4ith a reversal of power over
the inter-connecting 132 kV transmission line after 1978 it might be



ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 4 pages
possible to defer Murchison until 1980/81 or even later. However,
without a new formal agreement on oo-operation it may be difficult for
Uganda to defer the Murchison Falls Project and for Kenya to justify
the timing of some of the later stages of its own development program
for the period 1970/80 shown in the table below:
Proposed Generation Development Program in Kenya 1970/80

1/ 1980 - Thermal Development - Nairobi Industrial Gas Turbine  - 12 144
Notwithstanding the agreement reached by the Co-ordinating
Committee to co-operate inthe development of power facilities in the
two countries, co-operation beyond some minor variation oi' the present
bulk supply agreement may be difficult to negotiate due to the politi-
cal situation and to Uganda's commitment to early construction of the
Murchison Falls Project. Nevertheless the UTED, it is believed, are
contemplating reopening discussion of this question in the light of the
recent changes in control of the Kenya power sector.
1/ The second Industrial Gas Turbine is to act as standby plant and to
replace the diesel plant which will be retired by 1980. The need
for this has yet to be established.

TANA R1ER DEVELOP!ENT CCMPANY LIMITED
Histoy of the Power Companies
The Kenya Electricity Suppiy Industry is presently comprised
of three companies:
(a)  The East African Power 8¢ Lighting Company Limited (EAF&L)
(b)  The Kenya Power Company Limited                     (KPC)
(c)  Tana River Development Company Limited              (TRDC)
The East African Power & Lighting Company Limited
EAP&L, which is the sole distribution company, was incorporated
in 1922 by the amalgamation of two undertakings which had supplied
Nairobi and Mombasa since 1907 and 1909, respectively. It is a local
private enterprise company wi4th authorized share capital of KS 10,000,000
of which KL 9,741,504 is issued and an authorized loan capital of E ster-
ling 6,397,920 of which about E sterling 5,200,000 was outstanding at
the end of 1970. Although formerly operating throughout Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania its activities have been confined to Kenya since 1964 due
to purchase of the Uganda and Tanzania undertakings by the respective
Governments. The Company is primarily concerned with the commercial dis-
tribution of electricity throughout Kenya, but presently it also generates
the entire power requirements of the Coast System, provides the necessary
thermal back-up for the main grid system and operates generating stations
in centers not connected to the grid. It also co-ordinates all sources
of power, and staffs and manages the other two Companies (KPC and TRDC)
In 1970 the Government acquired a controlling interest in
EAP&L when it made a successful bid for all the shares on the Londqn
Register. It now owns about 51% of the issued share capital and
intends to continue its policy of purchasing shares as they come on
the East African market until it fully owns the Company.
The Kenya Power Company Limited (KPC)
In 1955 EAP&L was faced with the problem of financing the
construction of a 132 kV transmission line to interconnect the power
systems of Uganda and Kenya as well as other expansion requirements.
The Company did not consider it practicable to raise the required

finances through new equity issues because of conservative dividend
policies due to politicsal pressures and the need for increased self
financing. There was also revived political pressures for nationali-
zation, and the Company concluded it was inevitable and desirable to
increase publio ownership and direct Government participation in the
power industry. Accordingly it was decided to form a new company,
KPC, in 1955, with an issued nominal capital of K£ 100 held equally
by EAP&T, the Government, and Power Securities Corporation Limited
(PSC).-/ KPC's function was to construct the transmission line and
to take over two hydroelectric stations belonging to EAP&L on the
Tana River. The assets of KPC revert to the Government on expiry of
its bulk supply license which was issued, initially for 50 years, in
1955. KPC financed its requirements through issuance of £ Stg. 7.5 million
of debenture stock, the payment of the debt service on which was
guaranteed by EAP&L's undertaking to purchase KPC s bulk supply at
ascertained cost.
It is Government's intention to acquire 100% of KPC's issued
share capital at the earliest opportunity and it has entered into
negotiations with the Power Securities Corporation who are not expected
to raise any difficulties.
The Tana River Development Company limited (TRDC)
A forecast of load growth after Kenya's achievement of inde-
pendence in December 1963, indicated that it would be necessary to
commission further major generating capacity by 1967-68 and a re-
appraisal of the Seven Forks Scheme (the harnessing of the hydro poten-
tial of the Upper Tana) established Kindaruma as the most economical
first stage development. TRDC was formed in 1964 to finance the
Kindaruma hydroelectric development for much the same reasons as led
to the formation of KPC. The share capital of TRDC is a nominal
K£ 100 held equally by EAP&L, the Government, Power Securities Corpo-
ration and the Commonwealth Development Corporation which supplied
£ Stg. 3.5 million of a total of about £ Stg. 6 million of loan capital which
was arranged for the Kindaruma project. It is Governments intention that
TRDC should undertake the construction of the remaining Seven Forks
projects, the first of which is Kamburu Stage I.  Stage II will follow
in 1976 and the next major project, Gtaru (84 MI initial capacity), is
scheduled for commissioning in 1979. Like KPC, TRDC sells its output
to EAP&L at ascertained cost, and the assets would revert to the
Government either wmhen the loan capital has been repaid or in the year
2015, on the expiry of its Bulk Supply License No. 3. In February 1971
the Government aquired all of TRDC's issued share capital.
1/ PSO is a U.K. finance boude which arranged the financing of most of
EAP&L's development in the past. It is also the parent company of
EAP&L's engineering consultants.

KENYA
TANA RIVER DEVELOMENT COMPANY LIMITED
Detailed Description of the Kemburu Project
1.        That stretch of the River Tana which lies between existing hydro-
electric installations at Low Tana, (upstream) and Kindaruma (downstream)
falls about 270 m over a distance of 94 kilometers. The steepest gradients
are however, concentrated in the downstream region of this stretch, and it
is here that most of the power potential lies. A study of this potential
and of future demands for power, indicated that it would be advantageous
to develop the river in two stages, stage I between kms 64 and 80 (measured
down the river), and stage 2 between kms 80 and 94, and to consider the
upstream region as a site for a major reservoir, with limited power.output,
possibly for development later on. Stage 1 of this arrangement, the Kamburu
development, constitutes the Project. Stage 2, the Gtaru development, would
be similar in general layout but would utilize a larger head, namely 143 m,
as against 82 m at Kamburu.
2.        The Project thus consists of a dam and intake on the river, a
shaft descending to an underground power station, close to the dam, and
then a long tailrace tunnel leading back to the river about 7 river kilo-
meters further downstream. During construction of the dam, the river would
be temporarily diverted through the spillway channel and the site of the
dam enclosed by cofferdams. Principal data for the Project are listed in
the table at the end of this Annex. The installation of two 30 MW generating
sets in the power station is included in the Project, but the constructional
works include provision for a third set. The third set and the transformer
associated with it are not part of the Project; they are scheduled for instal-
lation in 1976.
Geology
3.        The geology of the area has been thoroughly investigated and is
the subject of a special report by the Consultants. Copies of this report
have been received by the Bank. An extensive drilling program has been
carried out at the dam and power station sites and along the route of the
tailrace tunnel. The predominant rocks are gneisses, forming part of a
geological structure known as the Basement Complex System.
4.        The dam site is a comparatively narrow section of the river between
rocky banks 18 to 21 m apart. River sand overlies bedrock to a maximum
depth of 5 m at this site. A zone of weathered and decomposed rock which
occurs in the deepest portion of the dam foundation would have to be sealed
against percolation of water under pressure.
5.        The site of the underground power station has still to be deter-
mined so that it would be favorably placed in relation to the fractures and

fault zones which have been located by geological exploration. Alignment
of the access tunnel will be finalized when the power station has been
located.  Investigations indicate that conditions during construction of
the tailrace tunnel should generally be good; rock cover will be not less
than 20 m to within about 75 m of the tunnel portal. Some small zones of
shearing and fractures have been located during exploration but it is
thought that none of them are sufficiently significant to affect the sta-
bility of the tunmel, which would thus be generally unlined.
Hydrology
6.        The River Tana is a typical tropical river having two flood.
seasons and two dry seasons per year. The largest flows generally occur
in April-June as a consequence of the "long rains"; high flows occur aga§c
in November-December from the "short rains"  The low-flow periods a-
February-March and September-October.  The m.nimum discharge! of 1,40h( cuse&S
from Kamburu reservoir shown in the table was derived from flow-duration
curves for the 1 in 10 dry year, and is taken as the firm discharge for the
purpose of determining firm continuous outputs of power.
Installed Capacity and Energy Output
7.        The storage afforded by Kamburu dam is insufficien,t to control
the river, so the flow available for power generation would not be constant
throughout the year. During the dry season the reservoir wculd be drawn
down, but it would normally be kept full at other times. The station would
therefore generate energy at varying weekly load factors, depending not only
upon the river flow but also on the ability of the power system to absorb
the energy generated. In the wet season the average weekly power output i+
expected to be about 42 AW (with two sets) rising to 64 MW after the co=mis-
sioning of the third set. In the dry season of the 1 in 10 dry year, the
average weekly output will drop to 23 MW.
Description of Pr     21Wrks
8.        The dam would be a rock-fill structure but it would have a spillway
section, with four gates controlling the reservoir level, constructed of
concrete.
9.        The intake would be on the right bank Just upstream from the dam,
and would be of reinforced concrete.  A head gate at the intake would con-
trol flow into the concrete-lined intake shaft. The shaft would turn
through 90 0 at its foot, where a steel-lined tunnel of the same diameter
as the shaft would lead to a three-legged branch pipe supplring each of
the turbines at the power station.
10.       The turbines would be vertical-shaft Francis machines.  The un-
loading and maintenance bay would be at the access end of the power station



ANNEX 7

at generator floor level with the air-conditioning and store rooms under-
neath it. Power would be conveyed at generated voltage by cables to the
switchyard at the surface, where it would be transformed to transmission
voltage.
11.       The surge chamber would comprise an inclined tunnel which would
combine with the power house access tunnel 200 m from the power station.
Transmission Lines and Substations
12.       The transmission system would include a 220 kV transmission line
from Kamburu to a terminal structure about 1 km from the existing Juja Road
substation just outside Nairobi (a 220 kV substation will ultimately be
established at this point) and a 132 kV "lead in" to Juja Road substation.
This would be a single-circuit line on stayed steel towers, with steel-
reinforced alluminum conductor.  Switching at Kamburu and Juja Road substa-
tions would be at 132 kV and the line would be operated initially at 132 kV.
The Kanburu power station would be interconnected with the existing Kindaruma
hydroelectric power station by means of a 132 kV single-circuit transmission
line. The Project includes provision for extending the substations at Juja
Road and Kindaruma to accommodate the new incoming transmission lines, and
also for a 10 MVAR bank of static capacitors at Juja Road substation.

APPRAISAL OF THE KAMBURU HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Alternative Sales Projections
1.       Erratic fluctuations in the growth rate of sales in the EAP&L
system in recent years make it particularly difficult to forecast the
future trend. As a check on EAF&L's projection based on 9% annual growth,
independent projections have been attempted using regression analysis.
The method adopted was to establish the past relationship between electri-
city sales and the three variables of monetary GDP, industrial output and
urban population.
2.       Continuous series for these variables on a consistent basis were
available only for the period 1964-68 but statistical analysis Y/ of the
data available showed good correlation with electricity sales: between
total electricity sales and monetary GDP the correlation was 0.98; between
domestic and comnercial sales and urban population it was 0.92; and between
industrial sales and industrial output it was 1.0. The calculated correla-
tions also showed a high degree of statistical significance i.e. there is
only a very low probability that they could have occurred by chance. These
tests were considered satisfactory enough to use regression analysis for
forecasting the load.
3.       The following regression equations were derived for the period
1964-68:
(a) log total electricity sales   0.7335 + 0.7924 log Monetary GDP
(b) log (Domestic + Comnercial electricity sales) = 0.0913 + 0.81 log
(Urban Population)
(C) log Industrial electricity sales = 0.34;24+ 1.2369 log (Industrial
Output)
4.        The Bank's economic mission to Kenya in 1969 thought annual growth
rates for monetary GDP and industrial output of 6.5% and 7% respectively
should be feasible up to 1974 and it is thought reasonable to assume that
these rates could be maintained up to 1976. The population of the ten
largest towns in Kenya grew at a trend rate of 6.2% per annum between 1964
and 1968. A 1969 study by the Town Planning Department of the Ministry of
Land and Settlement gave projections implying a somewhat higher rate in the
future of 6.44%, which has been adopted here.
The statistical calculations were done by Mr. Vito Lara, Statistical
Services Division.

5.        On these assumptions, the equations above result in. the following
projections of total electricity sales, with the EAP&L projection shown for
comparison (an allowance for street lighting sales, which are a very small
proportion of total sales, has been included in Projection 2 to make it
comparable with the other projections):

6.        Projection 1 implies an average annual growth rate of under 6%
and Projection 2 a growth rate of 7.2%. These compare with the EAP&L fore-
cast rate of 9% per annum and, although information just received is that
1970 sales were over 12% higher than in 1969, it is not clear how far this
may have been due to exceptional factors. The implications for the economic
justification of the Project of an average growth rate below 9% over the
period to 1976 were therefore examined, as described in Annex 14.

TANA RIVER DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LflIMTED
Comparison of Project with Alternative Thermal Development
1.        For the economic assessment of the Project it is not sufficient
to compare it with an equivalent amount of thermal capacity, since construc-
tion of the Project will make it obligatory to proceed to Stage II of the
Kamburu scheme, consisting of a further 30 MW of hydro capacity, to complete
the development of the site. The alternative thermal development program to
1976 to meet the same demand would consist of three 30 MW sets to be installed
at the coast plus a 220 kV transmission line linking Mombasa to the main load
center at Nairobi.  This would be more economic than siting the station at
Nairobi, owing to the high cost of transporting oil from Mombasa to Nairobi,
a distance of some 300 miles. The first set would be installed at the exist-
ing steam station at Kipevu for commissioning in 1973. The other two sets
for commissioning in 1975 and 1976 would be at a new steam station at Mombasa.
2.        This alternative development program would have a lower capital cost
than the hydro develomment but its running costs (mainly fuel costs) would be
higher. The economic merits of the two programs were compared by finding the
discount rate which equalized the present values of their total costs (capital
plus operating) over the life of the Project, assuming the same system devel-
opment after 1976 for both alternatives. In making the comparison, the con-
sultants' capital cost estimates (including an allowance for estimated escala-
tion of costs during the construction period) were used and the EAP&L forecast
load growth of 9% per annum was assumed. This resulted in an equalizing dis-
count rate between the two programs of 10.5% 1/. This understates the economic
advantage of the hydro alternative since it is based on the money cost of un-
skilled labor (more of which is required for the hydro development) rather than
its opportunity cost, which is lower (owing to the high level of unemployment
and underemployment in Kenya), and makes no allowance for the positive multi-
plier effects of the higher local expenditure associated with the Project. The
economic return on the extra investment required for the hydro compared with
the thermal alternative will therefore be higher than 10.5%, the difference
depending on the values assumed for the multiplier and for unskilled labor.
3.        The sensitivity of the equalizing discount rate to changes in assump-
tions regarding the values of the main variables was tested with the results
noted below:
Capital Costs
The capital cost estimates for the alternative hydro and thermal pro-
grams include adequate contingency allowances and provision for cost escala-
tion at 7% per annum. However, an increase of 10% would lower the discount
rate to 9.7%; a decrease of 10% would raise it to 11.3%.
1/ See Page 4 of this Annex for detailed figures.



ANNEX 14
Page 2 of b pages
Operating Costs
If operating and maintenance costs (other than the cost of fuel
oil for the steam station) are assumed to increase by 3% per annum, the
effect is to increase the advantage of the hydro development, the equaliz-
ing discount rate rising to 10.9%.
Oil Price
The oil price assumed is KSh 75 (US$10.50) per long ton delivered
for residual fuel oil from the Mombasa refinery, which is broadly in line
with the price currently payable by EAP&L (KSh 73). The consultants used
a price of KSh 65 (US$9.10) on the assumption that EAP&L would switch to oil
of 3,000 seconds viscosity Redwood No. 1, instead of 1,500 seconds viscosity
as at present, and that a lower price would be obtainable for the much larger
quantity that would be required if the thermal alternative were adopted. The
consultants made this price assumption early in 1970 and since then there has
been the new agreement between the major oil companies and the oil producing
countries which is expected to lead to significantly higher prices for crude
oil. Since Kenya is dependent on imported crude oil for its refinery, it
does not seem realistic in these circumstances to maintain t.he assumption
that oil would be available at KSh 65/ton.  However, with oi1 at this level
the equalizing discount rate would fall to 9.6%; at KSh 85/ton (US$11.80)
it would rise to ll.b%.
Load Growth
The equalizing discount rate is not very sensitive to the load
growth assumed.  At 7% per annum it is 10.0% and at 10% per annum it rises
only fractionally to 10.6%.
4.        For the purpose of the economic comparison, it was assumed that,
except at the flood season (when there is more water than can be used),
Kamburu would use all the water available in the river after existing irri-          0
gation usage had been met. This implies maintenance of the water allocation
for power generation at present levels.  As a measure of caution, however,
the effect on the economics of the Project if its water allocation were subse-
quently reduced by diversion for irrigation was examined. This is on the
hypothesis that the integrated basin survey referred to in paragraph 4.17
might indicate benefits of irrigation sufficiently attractive to justify re-
ducing the flow of water to the hydroelectric stations on the Upper Tana,
even after allowing for the costs of replacing the resulting loss in their
output by increasing generation from thermal stations. According to the
draft consultants' report referred to in paragraph 14.12, 17(,000 acres of
land upstream of Kamburu would be suitable for irrigation. It is estimated
that completion of this development would result in a reduction in output at
Kamburu in an average year of about 73 million kWh (see Annex 11). This lost
hydro output would have to be replaced by thermal generation at an annual
incremental cost of about K; 126,000. If the total area of 170,000 acres
were brought under irrigation over 30 years commencing in 1973, as assumed
by the consultants, the effect is to reduce the equalizing discount rate



ANNEX 14
Page 3 of 4 pages
from 10.5% to 9.9%. On the improbable assumption that the development
could be completed in 15 instead of 30 years, the equalizing discount
rate becomes 9.4%.
5.        The effects on the comparison of taking into account the positive
multiplier effects of the local expenditure associated with the alternative
hydro and thermal developments, and of shadow pricing their respective re-
quirements of unskilled labor, were also examined, with the following
results:
Multiplier Effect
The hydro development requires appreciably higher local, as dis-
tinct from offshore, expenditure during construction compared with the
0            thermal alternative, but somewhat lower local expenditure for operation
and maintenance. Depending on the value of the multiplier, the local ex-
penditure associated with each alternative will result in the generation
of additional income within Kenya which may be credited as a benefit. No
precise calculation of the value of the multiplier in Kenya was available
but a rough estimate of 2.6 was provided. Adopting a conservative value of
2, and crediting each alternative with the resulting extra income to which
it gives rise, the equalizing discount rate rises to 14.6%.
Unskilled Labor
Unemployment in Kenya is over 20% at present and is likely to re-
main high overthe construction period for the hydro development. In this
situation, the money wages of unskilled labor overstate its real cost to
the economy in terms of alternative output foregone if it is employed on the
Kamburu development. The use of a lower shadow price for unskilled labor is
more favorable to the hydro than to the thermal alternative since the hydro
construction program requires an estimated extra 2,450 man-years of unskilled
labor.  If unskilled labor is valued at half its money wage, the equalizing
*            discount rate rises to 11.0%.
6.        The sensitivity analysis indicated that with the combination of
assumptions least favorable to the hydro scheme (7% load growth, 10% higher
capital costs, oil price KSh 65) the equalizing discount rate would fall to
B.6%. On the most favorable combination of assumptions (10% load growth,
10% lower capital costs, 20% higher oil price, 3% escalation of operating
and maintenance costs) it would be nearly 13%. It is unlikely to be below
o10.5%.  This is without crediting the hydro development for the positive
multiplier effects of the extra local expenditure associated with it, or
valuing unskilled labor at its opportunity cost; if these additional bene-
fits are taken into account, the discount rate rises to about 15%.

Method and Assumptions Made to Determine the
Internal Financial Rate oE Return for the Project
1. *The internal financial rate of return for the Project is
defined as the discount rate at which the present worth of the estimated
capital and operating costs of the Project plus the third 30 MW set at
Kamburu, over the life of the Project, equals the present worth of
attributable revenues.
Capital Costs
2.        The capital costs are assumed to comprise estimated expendi-
tures on the Kamburu hydroelectric power station (3 x 30 91 sets) and
associated civil works., the Kamburu-Juja Road substation, the 220 kV
and 132 kV transmission lines and associated substations, the 12 MW
gas turbine, and the estimated cost of distribution and secondary trans-
mission extensions to cope with the increase in generating capacity.
Consultants' estimates were used throughout but in the case of the
distribution and secondary transmission extensions, it was assumed that
75% of forecast annual expenditures from 1973 through 1976 would be
related to the increase in generating capacity at Kamburu, 50% in 1977
and 25% in 1978. It was further assumed that from 1977 Kamburu would
be operating at its maximum plant factor within the plant operating
program.
3.        For the purpose of this exercise the power.-tation, the dam and
other civil worka were depreciated over 80 years, and all other parts
of the Project, i.e. electrical and mechanical plant and transmission
and distribution system8, were depreciated over 30 years. Plant
renewal costs per item were assumed in all oases to be the same as
original costs.
Operating Costs
4.       The consultants' estimates of operational and maintenance
costs were assumed, and were held constant from 1976 over the balance
of the 80 year period considered, To these costs were added fifty per
cent of the annual increase in the distribution, operation and mainte_
nance, and management costs shown in FAP&L's forecast, i.e. the increase
in those costs which can be attributed to the Project. The cost of fuel
for the 12 MW gas turbine was also added,eetimated on the basis of



ANNEX 15
Page =of 3 pages
operating at 60% load for 700 hours per year. Distribution and manage-
ment costs were held oonstant after 1976.
Benefits
5.        The consultants' estimates of annual outputs of kwh from
Kamburu were assumed, and due allowance was made for transmission and
distribution losses when calculating sales.  The average of US cents
3.109 per kWh sold in 1974 was taken from EAP&L's income statement,
and this was reduced to an average of US cents 3,0 per klWh sold by 1980.
This rate was then assumed to be constant throughout the 80-year period
considered.
6.        The streams of costs and benefits based on'the above assump-
tions are shown in the table on page 3 of this Annex. An incremental
rate of return of 16% tjas obtained. To examine the effect of uncer-
tainty in the main assumptions a sensitivity analysis was carried out,
taking 10% variations in the estimated costs and revenues. This showed
that the rate of return was not unduly sensitive to variations of this
magnitude in costs with no ohange in the benefits assumed, and vice versa.
The most pessimistic estimate which assumed a 10% increase in costs and
a 10% decrease in benefits resulted in a rate of return of just over 13%;
the most optimistic estimate which assumed a 10% decrease in costs and
a 10% increase in revenues resulted in a rate of return of just over 20%.

1/  TRDC does not use depreciation accounting but instead charges as an expense the amount spent each year to repay loans.  The provision
for debt repayment represents the cumulative amount spent for this purpose; it substantially exceeds the amounts which would be
provided for depreciation under conventional accounting practices. Thus, net fixed assets after debt repayment are substantially
anderstated, and correspondingly the amount of retained earnings included in equity capital is also understated, compared to what
would be shown if depreciation accounting were used.
TRDC has a nominal share capital of KL 100.
3/  The "A", "B" and 'C" debenture stock have been issued at annual interest rates ranging from 7-3/41 to 9-5/8%  and are repayable in
equated annual installments of principal and interest over the period 1971-1987. Ihe "D" stock is repayable in equal semi-annual
installments beginning December 15, 1967 and ending December 15, 1976. The proposed Bank and SIDA Loans for Kasisuru I are assumed
to have an interest rate of 7,4, a grace period of 34 years, and to be repayable in equated semi-annual installments of principal
and interest over a period of 214 years.  The EAP&L loan for XKmburu I is assumed to have an interest rate of 9%, a grace period of
4 years, and to be repayable in 21 equated annual installments of principal and interest beginning December 1975. The future foreign
loans for Kamburu II and Gtaru projects are assumed to have annual interest rates of 74%; repayments on them would start after 1976.

'/  Revenues and ascertained costs for 1968 cover the period from June 23, when the Kindaruma Project began commercial iperations to December 31.
2/  Prier to 1968, construction expenditures on the Kindarsea Project totalled PK  4,946 thousands.  Since cemmissioning of the Kindarmsa Project in
June 1968, there have been minor capital expenditures for it, including some payments ir partial settlement of claims submitted by the civil
works contractor.  The unsettled claims amount to about KP  900,000, and the contractor has indicated that it intends to refer these claims for
arbitration by the International Chamber of Commerce, but no formal proceedings have been initiated as yet. EAP&L is to provide any sums
necessary to complete the financiag of the Kindaruma scheme.  The estimates assume that the claims will be settled for Pr 250,000 in 1971, with
overrun finance in this anount provided by EAP&L.
3/  The Gtaru project is estimaned to have a total cost of about Pr 20 million, including provision for es-alatiou of 77 p-er annum, and eccluding
interest during construction. For illustrative purposes, the financial forecasts include provision for the estimated expenditures which may be
made on this project in 1975 and 1976, if it is to be commissioned by early 1979.  No decision has yet been made to proceed with this projec:
on this schedule; this will depend on further studies to be made in the future, including comparison with less ca-ital intensive alternatives
which may be available. The timing will also depend upon the extent to which cooperation with Uganda in the development of each country's
power resources can be achieved.
4' The estimated amounts of development surcharge are somewhat understated (see footnote 4to tAnex 19(b)j.

1/  Fixed assets in service includes the net value of generating spares (KL 34 thousands), after deducting the accnmulated provision for depreciation
of susch spares (Ba 22 thousands) which had been charged to ascertained cost through 1966.  This was the last year when such a provision (amounting
to KL 3 thousands) was included as part of operating expenses; no further such provisions were made after 1966 because they were disallowed for
inccme tax purposes.
2/ KPC does not use depreciation accosnting but instead charges as an expense the amount provided annually for redeeming its outstanding loan capital
(the 57-7 debenture stock) in accordance with the sinking fund requirements of this debt.  The amount of this requirement is the difference between
KL 450 thousands and the interest payable on the outstanding debt each year, and this was calculated to be sufficient to retire the debt by ios
maturity in 1985. In fact, the amounts set aside have been applied to repurchase the outstanding debt at substantial discounts and the sinking
fund should accomplish the complete redemption a few years early.
/  Compared to the provision for depreciation which would have been charged as an expense under conventional accounting, the annual amounts set aside
for debt repayment were substantially smaller through 1965, and since then they have been larger. The accmulated provicien for debt repayment at
the end of 1966 was 19% lower than the accumulated provision for depreciation would have seen, and this difference will not be made up until 1975.
Prior to 1975, accordingly, both net fixed assets and the equity capital are more than woalcd be reported under depreciation accounting.
KPC has a nominal share capital of Ba 100.
5/  The estimates do not allow for the realization of any further discounts on debenture stock to be redeemed after the end of 1969.  At that time, of
the KL 3,844 thousands outstanding, only KB 844 thousands remained subje ct to market purchases; the balance of Kn 3,000 thousands was owned by
tn-nonweaith Development Corporation and could only be redeemed through call for the sinking fund at a price of 101% of face value.
6/  The estimates do not allow for any interest income, gains or losses which may be realized on Reserve and Equalization Fund investments.  The
provisin sho-wn as charged to ascertained east fee 1968 represents the normal a-naal charee of K; 23 thousands rlus  KL 6 tl:ucaand, of deco] c-ton
losses less KB 17 thousands transferred to Capital Reserve.

iep-xrsestiaxx ch-s7astle under generally accepted accounting practice rather than the provision for debt repayment used in determining "ascertained
cost".  Sirce ts. rovenues of the companies arc based on "ascertained cost", the difference between the provision for depreciation and the provision
for detb redcmxtion is reflected in net income in this statement. As explained in footnote 3 to Annex 17 until 1965 the KPC provision for debt
,epa.2ment1 was less than the provisior. for depreciatlon chargeable under corrventional accounting; the deficit in retained earnings shown as K1t343
-hosands at ths end of 1966 represents the extent to which the accumulated provision for debt repayment charged to ascertained costs was less than
-hc pro-forna p ovislo. for depreciatiorl. This deficit is gradually reduced and finally eliminated by 1975, due to the fact that from 1966 on the
Krc prevIsion. fxr 2obt redexnptisn exceeds the provision for depreciation. The TRDC provision for debt redemption is always larger than the
ieprecicticn prosion.

1/  In this pro-forma statement, the expenses of the two companies have been restated to show the provision for depreciation which would be made in
reporting income in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice, rather than the provision for debt repayment which is used in
determining "ascertained cost" for purposes of fixing the revenues of the companies. Over the period covered by this statement the provision for
debt repayment is larger than the provision for depreciation and this difference is reflected in net income.
2,1Operating expenses do not include any provision for income taxes.  Because of the large wear and tear allowances on fixed assets allowable as
deductions for tax purposes, KPC and TRDC have not had taxable income through 1970 and instead have accumulated losses which may be carried
forward to offset future taxable income. For this reason, and because the Goveroment intends to take action to exempt 'rom income tax
the development surch-rges to be included in TRDC's revenues beginning in 1971, neither KPC nor TRDC would have any tax-:se insure during the
period covered by this Annex.
3f As permitted under their bulk supply licenses, KPC and TRDC include as part of the "ascertained cost" chargeable to their customers (i.e. EAP8:I)
small anrual appropriations to a Reserve and Equalization Fund equal to .3 of 1% of the cost of KPC's plant and slightly less than 1/2 of 1IV of
the cost of TFDC's Kindaruma plant.  (Appropriations to this Fund for the Kamburu plant will not be made by TRDC  ntil after 1976 when Stage II
is completed). One half of the Fund, including the interest earned on its investments, is available as a reserve for cpital expenditures which
may be made from time to time with the approval of the customers, and the other half is to be held as an equalization fund to be used for covering
deficiencies in income or for recurrent expenditures acknowledged by the customers to be due to abnormal circumstances. Actual use of the Fund
to date has been limited to K183,000 of capital expenditures by KPC, mostly for repair of damage from floods and flood control work in 1964.  In
this pro-forma statement of earnings on a conventional accounting basis, the annual appropriations to this Fund are shown as allocations of net
ince rather than as operating expenses, and the interest, gains and losses earned on investments of the Fund are i                     iol'.sded  in rcone rather than
accounted for directly to the Fund (compare Annexes 16(b) and 17).
4/ As explained in note 6 to Arnex 19 (a), Section 47 of the Electric Power Act limits earnings to 12Qo of the capital expended on the undertaking.
As an approximate measure of the combined earnings of KPC and TRDC under this statutory test, percentage rates of return have bees calculated or.
the basis of the combined net operating income related to the total gross fixed assets in service plus work in progress.

1/  The provision for paymrent of income taxes in 1970 is anusually large because the income tax for 1968, which normally would
have been paid in 1969, was not paid until 1970 due to a delay in the receipt of the income tax bill from the Government.
Also in 1970, the Govermnent accelerated tax collections, and to reflect this the estimates have been prepared to show
that from 1970 ornwards the tax for each year is paid by the end of the year, witl. the tax bill for 1969 paid in four equal
installments in 1970-1973.  In fact, this is a conservative presentat:on, since only about 20% of the income tax for a
given year is to be paid by the end of that year, and the balance is dae in the following year, 75% by January 31, and the
remainder by April 30.  To this extent, the cash balances as of the end of each year are underestimated.  Also see footnote
2 to Annex 19(b).

was subscribed by CDC, and the balance was underwritten for public
sale. The Debenture Stock was secured by a Trust Deed dated June 27,
1956, which, among other things, created a first legal charge and a
floating charge in respect of KPC?s property and assets and stipulated
that KPC was not to create any further charges or incumbrances upon
its undertakings and assets ranking 1n priority to or pari passu with
the charges created under the Trust Deed except in special stated
circumstances. The Trust Deed also provided that any scheme for the
reconstruction of KPC or for the amalgamation of KPC with any other
company should require an extraordinary resolution of the stockholders
which means in efiect the consent of three-fourths of the stockholders.
