Memorandum and Recommendation of the President
of the International Development Association
to the Executive Directors
on the Proposed Credit to the Republic of Uganda for an
Agriculture Sector Management Project
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum  and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Uganda for SDR 12.1 million (US$17.9 million
equivalent) on standard IDA terns with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a project for
agriculture sector management capacity building.
Background
2.    After a prolonged armed conflict, Uganda embarked upon an Economic Recovery
Program in 1987. This was supported by an Economic Recovery Credit from IDA and resources
from other donors. The IDA and the IMF also supported a structural adjustment program, which
was successfully implemented. In the agricultural sector, rehabilitation and reconstruction of the
war-affected regions of the country was carried out with the support of IDA and other donors.
The IDA further supported the Government's efforts to improve agricultural production and
marketing arrangements, focusing on strategic commodities such as coffee and cotton.
Agricultural output, especially of food crops, has steadily increased, but the rate of growth has
been slowing down as the limits set by existing income and technology levels are being
approached.  To extend the technology and income frontier, the support has expanded to
national programs in the areas of research, extension and livestock subsector development, but
the pace of progress is impeded by institutional capacity constraints.
3.    Some of these constraints are common to all sectors of the economy, and the Government
of Uganda (GOU) has undertaken initiatives to remove them. It has implemented projects and
programs directed toward removing administrative weaknesses and strengthening core agencies
of government. It has embarked on major civil service reforms and decentralization programs.
These programs have been supported by structural adjustment and sector adjustment credits
4.    On the other hand, there are institutional capacity constraints that are sector-specific and
that have to be dealt with separately. Major constraints identified as specific to agriculture are
the inadequate sector policy formulation and implementation capacity; ineffective
management/operational systems for provision of public services in the sector; weak internal
systems and procedures; poor agricultural information collation, analyses and dissemination
capacity; and inadequate human resources development. The proposed project, thus, supports
three broad areas, that would address these weaknesses prevalent in both the central agencies and
local governments, namely: development of analytical capacity, management systems reform,
and improvement of the agricultural information systems.



2
Project Rationale
5.    Development of Analytical Capability. Three major chlanges in the last few years make
sector analytic capability strengthening urgent.  First. recent revisions in the Ministry of
Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries' (MAAIF's) and other public agencies' roles and
functions (under the Civil Service Reform and Local Governments Statute, 1993), gives them a
mandate for policy analyses and monitoring of the implementation. The interim arrangement for
policy analyses and formulation through the Agricultural Policy Committee and its Secretariat
(APC/AGSEC) has changed. The APC's role will be limited to coordination and harmonization
of policy reforms and programs, and to the review of seztor strategies.  It would rely on line
ministries and agencies for analytic studies, surveys, and agricultural information.  The line
ministries and agencies are also expected to take initiative and come up with proposals that
would improve sector performance and improve rural poverty.  The full participation of the
private sector in this process is also envisaged.   Therefore, adequate capacity should be
developed within MAAIF, other public agencies and the private sector to discharge these tasks
effectively.   On the other hand, district agricultural and rural development planning and
implementation is now the responsibility of elected Resistance Councils and through them, local
communities.  This has created a need for district-level capacity to provide direction to
agricultural and rural development. A process that would progressively build up a broad data
base on district and community resources (human, physical). The linkages between the Districts
and the Central Ministries, which are at present weak, need to be strengthened to fully utilize
existing capacities at all levels.
6.    Second, as Government involvement in production and marketing is eliminated, the role
of MAAIF will be to address national level sectoral and intersectoral issues and to support and
guide local government initiatives. Provision of information, support of policy formulation, and
the provision of the regulatory framework will, inter alia, be the focus of the Ministry's
activities. The basic thrust of these operations will have to be directed at supporting private
sector involvement in agricultural development and improving public sector efficiency.
7.    Third, GOU is interested in moving towards long-term strategic agricultural sector
investment programs, and seeking donor assistance to finance these programs, which would
extend over a number of years. The Government of Uganda has sought IDA's assistance for
building the capacity of sector ministries and local governments to prepare and manage such a
program. This proposed intervention is, therefore, a forerunner to an overall sector investment
programming approach, and an instrument for strengthening the remaining core functions of the
line ministries and other public agencies relevant to the agricultural sector.
8.    Management Systems Reform.  The Government of Uganda has embarked on a far
reaching economic reform program, of which civil service reform (CSR) is an integral part. The
introduction of a result-oriented management system into the civil service is part of the CSR, and
the agriculture sector would be one of the few sectors where pioneering work in this regard
would be carried out. In view of the size and importance of the sector, a high level of efficiency
in resource utilization and in the delivery of services would be vital for growth of the economy.
The focus on strengthening internal systems is necessitated by the large share of public recurrent



3
and capital budget and donor funded projects managed by the Ministry. Its accounts should be
properly recorded and maintained; procurement has to satisfy government and donor procedures,
and audit reports have to be submitted on time. However, institutional capacity to carry out
these functions is limited and fragmented, resulting in considerable project implementation
delays and mismanagement of financial resources. Because of the size of resources managed in
the sector, an effort to bring about improvement in this regard, is needed within the Ministry.
Another area of focus with regard to institutional strengthening is, staff training.  There are
significant weaknesses at all levels of the public sector in critical technical and managerial skills.
Therefore, there is a need to develop a comprehensive human resources development program to
address the current and future technical and managerial requirements of the agricultural sector.
9.    Improving Agricultural Information. Improving the underlying agricultural statistical
data base is critical for analytical work, policy formulation, private sector participation and
monitoring sector performance. The agricultural sample census that was conducted in 1990/91
has not been released on grounds of an inappropriate sample frame, smallness of sample size and
limited area coverage. The only valid census data available is the one conducted in 1963/64.
Given the outdated information and the history of the country, this information is of little
relevance today. Data such as, total production, area cultivated and yields are estimated today
by working backwards from the household consumption data, a technique which has a lot of
drawbacks and weaknesses.   Furthermore, coordination of the functions of the various
government institutions involved in agricultural statistics, namely, MAAIF, the Statistics
Department of MFEP, and the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT), has to be strengthened.
Their respective areas of responsibility are inadequately defined, and their agricultural statistics
sections suffer from insufficient capacity.
Project Objectives
10.   The three broad objectives of ASMP are: (a) to enhance analytical capacity for policy
formulation in the agricultural sector in general, and within MAAIF, in particular; (b) to improve
the responsiveness, efficiency and effectiveness of the MAAIF in carrying out its redefined role
in agricultural sector management, through reforming management systems and improving
internal procedures; and (c) to strengthen agricultural information systems.
Project Description
11.   The objectives of the project would be pursued through three main components: (a)
policy formulation and strategic planning; (b) management systems reform and training; and (c)
agricultural data and information systems strengthening. These components are briefly described
below.
Policy Formulation and Strategic Planning (US$8.3 million.)
12.   Support for this component would focus on the following four areas. The first would aim
to strengthen analytical capacity to formulate agricultural policy and define strategic priorities
within the agricultural sector in general, and the Agricultural Planning Department (APD) of



4
MAAIF, in particular. It would focus on building analytical capacity through providing selective
technical assistance in policy and strategy formulation and analysis, financial analysis and
business management, and production economics and farm management. Staff skills would also
be strengthened through a limited number of advanced education fellowships in key capacity gap
areas, and short courses in specialized skills and systems. Capacity building would be further
facilitated through a twinning arrangement with the Makerere-based Economic Policy Research
Center (EPRC), an autonomous institution engaged in policy related research.
13.   Second, an Agricultural Policy Research Fund will be established to foster policy related
analytical skills building and to contribute to deepening of understanding of policy related issues
among a wide spectrum of agricultural sector stakeholders. The fund would be administered
through the EPRC under an agreement which would, among other things, specify the procedures
and the criteria to be used for approving grants.
14.   The third area of focus would be to replace the discrete project approach with program
development as the vehicle for promoting investment and growth in agriculture. A medium-term
agriculture sector investment program (ASIP) would be prepared under the project. The ASIP
preparation would be carried out in two phases. The first phase would define sector priorities
and strategies and the roles of the various stakeholders in implementing these strategies. The
second phase would identify and prepare a number of high priority subsector investment
programs, according to the strategies articulated and approved in the first phase.
15.   The fourth area of focus would aim to create district and sub-district level capacity to
plan and implement agricultural development in accordance with community defined priorities.
Districts would be assisted to develop a planning and implementation capacity through training
of individuals and groups; and supporting plan formulation, that would be linked to the
agricultural sector strategy and the ASIP.
Management Systems Reform and Training (US$5.9 million)
16.   This component would aim to enhance the performance of the key public institutions in
the agriculture sector, by (a) improving internal systems; (b) reforming the management system,
and (c) supporting demand-driven training. Managing the transition to a new role calls for
reforming the internal administrative and management systems, including accounting and
financial management, procurement, maintenance and asset management, internal audits,
personnel management, and information management. The improvement of the respective
systems would be designed through a series of studies that would, inter alia, critically examine
the new structures and the information needs for various users, and design systems to meet these
needs. In each case, the studies would develop a time bound implementation plan for the
recommended systems, and would be designed to be compatible with the principles and needs of
result-oriented management and sector investment programs.
17.   The initial preparation for adoption of result-oriented management in a number of priority
Ministries, including MAAIF, would be done under the Institutional Capacity Building Project
(ICBP). Under ASMP, provision would be made for detailed preparation for, and transition to,
the system within MAAIF and the districts. This is intended to maximize the effect of CSR and



5
facilitate a fundamental change in the institutional work culture, both at the center and districts.
Furthermore, the adoption of this system of management would facilitate further rationalization
of roles and functions within MAAIF. The clear definition of the sector strategy under ASIP and
the role of MAAIF and other agencies under the CSR would allow senior management to define
the priority activities, including what MAAIF should or should not be doing, and relationships
between the Center and the districts. Under ROM, the Ministry and districts would focus on
achieving assessable results and tying resource allocation to the achievement of these outputs.
18.   The project would also introduce a demand-driven training scheme. Initially, a needs
assessment study would be carried out to identifv the gaps in technical, implementation and
management skills of senior and middle grade staff of MAAIF, other institutions participating in
the implementation of ASMP and the district agricultural officials. The study would also
develop a set of training modules that are appropriate to fill the skills gaps identified.
19.   A key training activity for improving analytical, monitoring and implementation capacity
would be a wider use of an in-service and on-the-job training schemes. The objective of these
schemes would be to provide work-related, and comparatively low-cost training, and to act as a
change agent for promoting improved work attitudes and discipline. The training under the
scheme would focus on national and institutional needs, encourage group rather than individual
training, bring local training institutions and their instructors in contact with current analytical
needs and into an actual institutional context, and leave behind a capacity for follow-up after
project completion.
Agricultural Data and Information Systems Strengthening (US$3.6 million)
20.   IDA's support for this component would strengthen and expand the country's agricultural,
livestock and fisheries data base. The four main activities that would be supported under the
component are: (a) the establishing of a Primary Agricultural Data Base at the national, district
and community level; (b) the design and implementation of the Annual Agriculture Sample
Surveys; (c) the preparation of a National Sample Census of Agriculture and Livestock; and (d)
the design and implementation of the Integrated Fisheries Surveys. To support this component
the project would finance training, short-term technical assistance, survey design, data
enumeration, data processing and information dissemination.
Project Cost and Financing
21.   The preliminary project costs have been estimated at roughly US$19.9 million including
physical and price contingencies. Base cost estimates are US$17.8 million. The foreign
exchange component of the project is estimated at 54 percent of the total cost.  Price
contingencies are estimated at US$1.2 million, 7 percent of the cost, and is based on domestic
inflation of 5 percent and foreign inflation (Value Index of Manufactured Exports) of 3.5 percent.
The proposed IDA credit of US$17.9 million equivalent will finance 90 percent of the project
costs net of taxes and duties over a five year period. The local contribution made by government
would be for an estimated amount of US$2.0 million, or 10 percent of project cost.



6
Project Implementation
22.   Separate project implementation units would not be created. The MAAIF, through the
Agricultural Planning Department (APD), would be the main executing agency. Local
governments will directly implement components designated for districts, and other agencies
would use their existing structures for the implementation of their respective components. The
GOU would set up an inter-ministerial Project Steering Committee (PSC) to guide overall
implementation, including policy and resource allocation, monitoring implementation progress
and resolving any major implementation issues.  The PSC would be advised by a Project
Management Committee (PMC), chaired by the Head, APD, and whose membership would
include all officials responsible for implementing the various components and subcomponents of
the project.
Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement
23.   IDA has financed several agricultural projects in Uganda. In several instances, project
performance has been adversely affected by inadequate counterpart funding, inadequate salaries
and incentives for staff, weak management and financial systems. The issue of counterpart
funding is being resolved through the prioritization of public expenditures as core and non-core,
and the salary and incentive issues through the civil service reform process. Support to line
ministries to improve the capacity for policy analysis and formulation has been limited to date
and, consequently, policy analysis and formulation remained weak.  Support is now being
directed to ministries and agencies who have the mandate and the appropriate institutional set-up
to ensure sustainability.  The IDA-supported Technical Assistance Projects in Uganda,
Agricultural Sector Management Project I and II in Kenya, Agricultural Sector Management
Project in Tanzania and other technical assistance interventions in the region have also provided
useful lessons for the design of this project. The review of these and several other institutional
development projects by the Bank's Operation and Evaluation Department shows that the
"process" rather than the blueprint approach is the key for the success of most technical
assistance projects.  This approach is better equipped to: cope with uncertainties of the
environment it is applied and enhance flexibility; nurture ownership and build commitment; and
emphasize learning and capacity building. Based on these lessons of experience, the process
approach is applied in the design of the proposed project with the aim to adapt objectives to
changing circumstances. Other experiences incorporated in the project design include fostering
government commitment and ownership, harnessing local/domestic capacities, and striving for
improved project quality at entry into the portfolio.
Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for IDA Involvement
24.   The project is consistent with the Bank's Country and Sector strategies. It is also
consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed by the Board on June 1,
1995. The focus of the Bank's CAS for Uganda is to reduce poverty. One of the key elements of
this strategy is to enhance the provision of public services, through appropriate measures such as
capacity building, with emphasis on ensuring that the services reach the poor. The other is,



7
maximizing labor-intensive economic growth. Support under the proposed project is aimed at
institutional capacity building in the agricultural sector, to address poverty reduction and growth
issues through strengthening the public and private sector. Growth of the economy, particularly,
growth in the agricultural sector, and the reduction of rural poverty would largely depend on the
soundness of policies, strategies and programs that the Government would adapt in the medium
and long-run. It would also depend on the capacity to carry out the policies and strategies.
IDA's support to improve public and private sector capability to formulate strategic polices and
programs would make a significant contribution to achieving the Government's objectives of
growth and poverty reduction. IDA's involvement in the proposed project is also essential to
address in a systematic manner both the institutional constraints (weak personnel, finance, asset
management, poor information systems, weak implementation capacity, etc.) that on-going
projects face, as well as to lay the foundation for future agricultural operations which would
require a sound policy and regulatory framework in order to be implemented effectively. ASMP
has strong linkages with all agricultural sector and institution capacity building operations of the
Bank.  It would improve overall agricultural sector policy formulation and implementation
capacity, strengthen the management and administration of projects, assist the Government to
move towards sector investment programming, and strengthen linkages with other sector.
Agreed Actions
25.   Prior to Negotiations, the Government issued a letter detailing its sector institutional
development strategies, the role of MAAIF in the agricultural sector and MAAIF's mission
statement. IDA also received a draft of the agreement between MAAIF and the Economic Policy
Research Center (EPRC) outlining the administration of the APRF, a draft of the agreement
between MAAIF and EPRC outlining the modalities of the twinning arrangement for technical
assistance, and a draft Memorandum of Understanding between MAAIF and the MFEP,
Department of Statistics for implementing the ADIS component. A draft of the Project
Implementation Plan, including first year work plan and the requisite GOU's budgetary
allocations have been made available for IDA's review and comment.
26.   At Negotiations, the government's assurances were obtained regarding the following: (a)
APD would finalize an annual work agreement, at the beginning of each fiscal year, with each of
the three MAAIF Directorates and other relevant agencies, and the agreement would, inter alia,
specify the principal assignments to be undertaken by APD and the related completion schedule;
(b) ASIP Manager whose qualifications, experience and TORs would be satisfactory to GOU and
to IDA would be appointed no later than thirty days after credit effectiveness, and the
preparation, organization, management and timing of the ASIP would be as detailed in para. 4.7
and Annex 5 of the SAR; (c) the preparation of the guidelines for District Agricultural
Development Plans would be completed no later than thirty days after project effectiveness, and
the preparation of the District Agricultural Plans would be completed by the second year of the
project; (d) the Agricultural Data and Statistics Sustainability Study would be completed by the
end of project year two, under TORs and by consultants satisfactory to GOU and to IDA; (e)
GOU and IDA would jointly conduct a mid-term review for the project within twenty four
months of project effectiveness but not later than December 30, 1998; (f) MAAIF would recruit
the financial, procurement, audit, and training officers no later than thirty days after project



8
effectiveness; (g) agreements between MAAIF and EPRC concerning the administration of
APRF and the twinning arrangement, and between MAAIF and Statistics Department of the
MFEP would be finalized no later than thirty days after project effectiveness; and (h) GOU
would set up the Project Steering Committee and the Project Management Committee no later
than thirty days after project effectiveness.
27.   The GOU agreed on the following conditions of credit effectiveness: (a) completion of
the baseline survey that would provide a basis for monitoring project impact; (b) filling of APD's
vacant posts and new positions with adequately qualified staff; (c) taking steps, satisfactory to
IDA, ensuring that all Districts will carry out the PADB survey; and (d) receipt by IDA of a
revised Project Implementation Manual.
28.   The GOU has further agreed on the following conditions of disbursement: (a) Training
Fund - MAAIF would furnish a training needs assessment study satisfactory to IDA, and would
appoint a training committee; and (b) Agricultural Policy Research Fund - EPRC would submit a
model Grant Agreement, satisfactory to IDA, that would be entered with individuals/institutions
that will carry our policy research.
Environmental Impact
29.   This capacity building project focusing on institutional and policy issues, has no direct
impact on the environment. Therefore it is a "C" category project. However, by integrating
environmental concerns in the process of policy and strategy formulation and implementation, as
well as the capacity building in the institutions, the project could contribute to the use of
Uganda's natural resources in an environmentally sustainable manner.
Program Objective Categories
30.   The project would foster public sector efficiency, and improved provision of services to
the private sector by strengthening the policy analyses and formulation capacity, improving
internal systems and procedures, and strengthening the agricultural information base. This in
turn would improve the policy environment under which the private sector would participate.
The project would also support human resources development in the agriculture sector. In
general, the project supports key elements of the Government's primary objective of poverty
reduction.
Participatory Approaches
31.   Project preparation followed a highly participatory process to ensure full Government
ownership of ASMP. An inter-ministerial Project Steering Committee provided overall guidance
for project preparation. Working groups and sub-groups, with members selected from MAAIF
and other Government agencies, undertook the preparation of the project. RC members and
district officials participated in the various forums organized by MAAIF to identify and discuss
project concept.  Local Governmnents, through a participatory rapid rural appraisal would
continue to participate in the development of guidelines and the actual preparation of the district



9
plans and collection of agricultural statistics.  The donor community in Uganda was briefed
about the project, and their comments and participation solicited at various stages of project
processing.
Project Benefits
32.   The project will support key elements of the Government reform agenda in the areas of
civil service reform, decentralization, and agricultural reform and development. It also supports
the key elements of GOU's primary objective of poverty reduction by improving capacity to
address growth and poverty issues with proficiency, thereby, enhancing the provision of public
services, and maximizing labor-intensive economic growth within the sector. The project would
also assist the Government in setting the general framework for the strategic direction of the
agencies involved in agriculture, and the strategic areas where the Government would like to see
tangible results. Moreover, the project would ensure the strengthening of the capacity to provide
a high standard of policy advice to the Government, improve the economic analysis of alternative
policies and strategies, and forge partnerships with stakeholders through client focus and
collaborative approach.
33.   The following design decisions were made after careful examination of the alternatives.
First, policy analytic capability would be shifted from where it was concentrated in the AGSEC
of the APC to MAAIF, economic policy research centers such as EPRC, local governments and
the private sector. This design strategy would ensure greater participation, take policy analysis
closer to those who implement the policy and would ensure that the issues addressed are a
priority at the time. Second, the administration and the supervision of research funds and
research would be shifted to EPRC instead of MAAIF or the Agricultural Secretariat that in the
past administered resources earmarked for similar purposes. This form of administration, in
addition to being cost-effective, would enable the institution to attract the best people for the job,
allow unbiased focus on key research areas, and would help avoid institutional rivalry and
friction. Third, district agricultural plans, and statistical data collection would largely be the
responsibility of local governments, thus, further strengthening district capacity and devolving
decision making and implementation to the districts. Fourth, the design of the training program
emphasizes on-the-job training, and would be work-related, district-oriented and internally
focused.
34.   Project impact on Government revenue is hard to estimate, and is complicated by the fact
that it would stem from increased sector economic activities due to changes introduced by the
project in the policy, regulatory and incentive framework. For instance, policy advice given to
the Government, based on project-supported research and studies could bring about a positive
change in the domestic business environment, and could result in an increase in the income of
farmers and enterprises, as well as in Government revenue.  Similarly, amendments of
regulatory, infrastructural and institutional arrangements that are no longer cost-beneficial, and
prejudicial to the performance of the agriculture sector could have major financial impact on the
Government and sector stakeholders. It is, therefore, difficult to estimate the fiscal impact when



10
the kinds of policy issues to be dealt with and the changes to be introduced are not readily
identifiable.
35.   The savings to public expenditure will also be difficult to quantify. The implementation
of the internal system improvement component alone would significantly reduce losses and
expenditures arising from financial and asset mismanagement and could release funds for
appropriate purposes. The rationalization of functions of MAAIF and streamlining of procedures
would also result in cost savings.
36.   Another project benefit would be the introduction and implementation of cost-recovery in
MAAIF.  The proposed result-oriented-management system  and the improved financial
management system would create the conditions necessary for putting in place a successful cost
recovery scheme. The MAAIF would open up the traditionally state-provided services for
competition.
37.   Performance indicators that are considered relevant and practical for this project are
developed and attached as Schedule B. The objective is to link project goals with outcomes.
The indicators would allow a reasonable estimate of the attainment of the benefits anticipated
from the project at different stages of implementation, and the sustainability of the operation.
Sustainability
38.   The project would be sustainable because the design is underpinned by a careful
definition of the role of Government in agriculture and assignment of clear functions and
responsibilities to the major stakeholders in the sector. The project further identified the critical
support that stakeholders would need to effectively participate in sector development. It is also
sustainable because it is consistent with GOU's policy of decentralization, civil service reform
and economic liberalization. MAAIF, local governments and participating government agencies
would be strengthened, and their capacity to provide essential services improved.  The
continuation of the activities initiated under the project should not be dependent on external
financing, since both incremental recurrent and development expenditures could be met,
partially, from internally generated earnings. Government agencies would gradually move into
the provision of services that are demand-driven, and private sector participation would be
encouraged. This would enable public agenci-s to be self-supporting, and to finance their
operations on a sustainable basis, with little or no Government support.
Project Risks
39.   The project risks are largely associated with the Government reform programs that are
presently under implementation. The assumption is that GOU's reform agenda would remain
unchanged, and implementation progress would not be unduly delayed. The civil service reform
program, particularly those aspects that deal with the introd'z_.-    of a result-oriented
management systems, improvement of civil service salaries   4 incentives, restructuring and
defining role and functions of government agencies are critical.  Implementation of the
decentralization program is also necessary for effective implementation of the project.



I1
40.   The first risk that the project would face relates to the ability of the government to attract
competent Ugandans to participate in the implementation of the project. In the past, MAAIF
could not attract qualified nor adequate numbers of staff due to inability to pay adequate
compensation. The Government is addressing the problem by moving towards a minimum living
wage, but it would take time before it reaches a level that could attract and retain professionals in
the Ministry. Until the issue of staff emolument and incentive packages are resolved, the
proposed project would assist the Ministry in attracting and retaining good staff through non-
pecuniary incentives, such as the possibility of participating in challenging assignments,
availability of developmental training opportunities, and operating in a much improved work
environment. The project would also aim for limited short-term technical assistance in some
critical areas where local expertise is lacking.
41.   The second risk is the lack of commitment by the Government to support and strengthen
line ministries and agencies to carry out their new mandates without being undermined by
parallel institutions. One such institution in the past was the APC/AGSEC. Although it played a
useful role, it has been mentioned as a cause for the weaknesses of line ministries and agencies in
strategic planning and policy formulation. Since remedying this problem was a condition for
negotiations, the GOU has redefined the future role and functions of the APC/AGSEC with the
view to avoid duplication and to support capacity building in the line ministries and agencies.
Through project supervision, the project would monitor the emergence of new arrangements that
could undermine the objectives and operations of the project.
Recommendation
42.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement of
the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

Project Benefits and Cost
The benefits of the project can not strictly be quantified. It would support key elements of
the Government reform agenda in the areas of civil service reform, decentralization, and
agricultural reform and development. It would have, inter alia, the following specific benefits:
*  support analytic skill building in MAAIF, and improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of public services and regulatory functions in the sector;
*  prepare and implement an Agricultural Sector Investment Program;
*  assist in meeting the changing skill requirements of the sector through a
comprehensive training scheme;
*  ensure availability of reliable and timely agricultural statistical data, and create
capacity to collate, analyze and disseminate statistical data;
* introduce a result-oriented management system, and improve internal systems and
procedures that meet government and donor requirements;
*  introduce cost recovery mechanisms into the operations of the ministry;
Total project cost for five years is US$19.9 million, of which:
*  total investment cost is US$15.4 million;
*  total incremental recurrent cost is US $4.5 million, 23 percent of the total cost;
-  IDA would finance about 69 percent of the incremental recurrent cost on a declining
basis from 80% in Year 1 to 45% in Year 5.
*  the average annual recurrent budget implication during the project life is about
US$0.9 million, and about US$0.4 million is the share of Government;
*  the recurrent cost requirement (after completion of implementation) for the
continuation of some of the activities initiated during the project is estimated at about
US $0.4 million per annum. The Government would have to continue to make capital
expenditures for the training of new staff, data collection and surveys, studies, and
replacement of facilities acquired through the project.

Uganda: Implementation Issues
1.    The IDA portfolio for Uganda as of December 31, 1995 consists of 23 projects, with a
total commitment of about US$1.0 billion. Of these, twenty are investment projects with an
undisbursed amount of about US$ 626 million. The portfolio showed improvement in FY95,
largely as a result of intensified effort by GOU and Bank staff to remove the obstacles to project
implementation. Disbursements have increased steadily in recent years from US$135 million in
FY93, to US$193 million in FY95. Because the approval of additional projects raised the
undisbursed balance in FY94, the disbursement factor declined slightly in FY95 to 13.3% from a
high of 14.5% in FY94.
2.    A number of factors account for the improved implementation performance in Uganda.
A major factor is the increased involvement of Ugandan project managers in solving
implementation problems through a series of CPPRs organized by the GOU in conjunction with
the Bank's Resident Mission. To follow up on the decisions taken at the CPPR, a project
managers' group was formed; the group meets regularly to address implementation problems
common to most projects. Other important factors in the improved implementation performance
are the periodic training and workshops in the areas of disbursements and procurement
procedures, the coordination between the CPPRs and PERs in resolving the counterpart funding
problems, and the intensive project review and restructuring exercise that has taken place in the
last two years. We expect to continue the in-depth reviews of projects and to restructure them as
needed.
3.    While good progress has been made, project implementation is still not satisfactory and
future improvements are needed. Disbursement and procurement are still slow in several
projects, counterpart funding shortages are still common, and accounting and auditing are
deficient in many respects. Consequently, IDA would continue to work with the GOU to
strengthen the CPPR process, including a follow-through on the recommendations made, and
will continue to focus on the unresolved implementation issues. Greater emphasis is being
placed on quality at entry, through increased beneficiary and stakeholder participation in the
project cycle. Closer involvement of beneficiaries and stakeholders in implementation will also
be sought in future projects, including greater use of NGOs, other donor representatives, etc.
4.    On slow disbursing operations, the Second Water Supply Project, FY90, has only
disbursed 38% of the US$60 million Credit; the procurement process for major civil works under
the project was delayed as the procurement documentation had to be revised in order to comply
with Bank procurement guidelines and procedures. In addition, procurement of major works for
the Kampala sewerage system was postponed in order to gather more information before
International Competitive Bidding was instituted. Although construction activities under three of
the four civil works contracts have gained momentum, progress is still slow. However, the
project's implementation performance has now become satisfactory, and the project meets its
development objectives in many respects.

Schedule E
Page 4 of 4
5.    On the Transportation Rehabilitation Project, there was a 15-month delay in procurement
activities/selection of consultants related to the main roads component (a major component of
this project), primarily due to lack of familiarity (and therefore non-compliance) with Bank
procurement procedures, on the part of project staff. In addition, there is a substantial cost
overrun (above the appraisal estimate) of about US$14 million, for the three main roads
contracts. However, the Borrower has been asked to propose a solution, which may require
restructuring or cancellation of some of the lower priority components at mid-term review, early
next year. Training of Borrower staff in contract administration and procurement is being
undertaken, with a view to enhancing their skills. Additionally, a twinning arrangement with the
Finland Road Authority is being put in place. At present, steps have been taken to resolve the
major procurement issues and the project's disbursement performance is expected to improve
over the next few months.
6.    The Power III Project has disbursed some 32% of the US$ 125 million (SDR 86.9
million) Credit. Project effectiveness was delayed by about one year to October 1992, as a result
of delays in fulfilling the Conditions of Effectiveness. Thereafter, delays in meeting
disbursement conditionality have contributed to the slow disbursements under the project. In
order to ensure that the over 40 year old existing dam is adequately investigated and
strengthened, the DCA provides for IDA financing only the advance payment to the main civil
work contract -which has been done- and withholding disbursements until an adequate work
program and associated bidding documents required to ensure the safety of the dam have been
produced. This work program and the associated bidding documents are planned to be completed
by mid-1996; meanwhile the African Development Bank has been disbursing alone to avoid
disruption of construction of the Owen Falls Extension Project.
7.    The effectiveness of Livestock Services Project was delayed because of complexities in
project design. Implementation was also affected by the reorganization of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Animal Industry, and Fisheries, which included the consolidation of crop and
livestock extension, and subsequently the Government's decentralization program, involving a
transfer of responsibilities to districts. Because of slow progress from that point, the project was
classified as non-core for FY94 and received no budget funds. The project was then restructured
and progress has been satisfactory since the restructuring was put into effect.
