I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Republic of Zaire and Gecamines (La GEnerale des
Carriares et des Mines) have requested Bank Group financing of US$110 million
equivalent to finance part of the foreign exchange cost of a US$703 million
medium-term program to rehabilitate Gecamines' facilities and to rationalize its
operations. This rehabilitation program is crucial to maintain Gecamines'
competitiveness on the world market and to ensure its future financial
viability. It is also vital for a stable development of the Zairian economy,
since the mining industry accounts for over 20% of Zaire's GDP and around 65% of
its foreign exchange earnings, and is Zaire's major modern sector employer. As
such, the Government is dependent on metals revenues to finance its investment
programs, to develop other sectors of the economy and to diversify the country's
economic base. The proposed loan would be the third financing extended by the
Bank Group to Gecamines.1/
1.02      The proposed Project addresses the technical, management and human
resource problems which, in conjunction with recent depressed copper and cobalt
prices, have undermined the technical efficiency and the financial position of
the Company. The Project is comprised of three components: (i) a replacement
and rehabilitation program for equipment and spares to rehabilitate Gecamines'
existing mine and plant facilities; (ii) a training program to upgrade skills of
the local technical and supervisory personnel; and (iii) technical studies
including those for preparation of investments after the Project period.
1.03      The Project was identified and prepared during imnlementation of the
Gecamines technical assistance project starting in 1984. It was appraised in
May 1985 by a mission consisting of Messrs. P. Lietard and S. von Klaudy of the
Industry Department and Messrs. R. Rodger, M. Allard, P. Boudreault, and L.
Imbeau (consultants,. The training component was appraised in July 1985 by Mr.
C. Tran-Luu, of the Eastern and Southern Africa Projects Department. Contact
was also maintained during the appraisal process with representatives of the
potential cofinanciers.
II. THE ZAIRIMA MINING SECTOR
A.   Role of the Mining Sector in the Economy
2.01      Mining is a key sector of Zaire's economy.  Between 1981 and 1984,
mining activities accounted for about 20% of the country's GDP, and contributed
an average US$1.2 billion per year, or 65% of merchandise export earnings with
crude oil and agricultural exports accounting for most of the remainder.
Moreover, the sector plays an important role in generating government budget
revenues with an average share of over 25% in the past de.ade, of which
Gecamines accounted for 20%. The sector also contributes substantially to
industrial employment, energy and _.ransportation demand and provides numerous
social services and training. Zaire is the world's leading producer of
1/   In 1975 the Bank approved a loan of US$100 million for the
Gecamines Expansion Project (Loan 1090-ZR, of March 8, 1975 amended
November 16, 1979) and in 1983 approved a credit of US$7 million for
the Gecamines Technical Assistance Project (Credit 1336-ZR, of October
26, 1983).

industrial diamonds and cobalt; the fifth largest producer of copper; and a
significant producer of tin, zinc, and gem diamonds. However, Zaire's mining
activities and potential extend far beyond these principal products, and other
minerals currently mined include gold, tungsten, manganese, silver, cadmium,
columbium-tantalum, and lignite.
2.02       Zaire's mineral production has shown substantial fluctuations over the
past decade as shown in the following table.

The state-owned group, Gecamines, produces more than 90% of the copper, all of
Zaire's cobalt, zinc, and cadmium production as well as small quantities of
gold, and silver. The remainder of the copper production comes from one other
company which is producing about 35,000 tonnes per year.
2.03      The important fluctuations of copper production reflect various
factors which in the past have affected Gecamines' performance, most importantly
the 1978 invasion of Shaba province which resulted in major disturbance of
operations of its main copper production center at Kolwezi. Gecamines'
performance over time is reviewed in more detail in Chapter IV. The fluctuation
of cobalt production reflects largely the ups and downs of the international
cobalt market, including the impact of Zaire's own marketing policy since it
contributes about half of world production. Production of zinc has remained
stable while that of silver decreased largely as a result of the declining
silver content of ores mined by Gecamines. Gold and diamond production has been
subject to wide fluctuations due to the Government's unclear policies towards
small scale mining and marketing, and to supply and logistical difficulties of
the two main producing companies. Since ]983, however, following a complete
liberalization of trade and introduction of a floating exchange rate, recorded
gold and diamond production has surged to considerably higher levels. The
decline in cassiterite production has been due to a lack of investment while
manganese ore production was stopped after the closure of the Benguela railway,
the only economic export route.

2.04      The mining sector, and particularly Gecamines, has been the major
factor in Zaire's recovery following the period of civil unrest and economic
decline between independence (1960) and 1965. The sector was also at the origin
of the economic boom in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when copper and cobalt
prices soared and generated substantial foreign exchange revenues which in turn
helped other sectors, particularly agriculture, to improve their performance and
contribute their share to economic recovery. During the period 1968-73 the
mining sector grew by 7.5% per annum (p.a.) compared to a GDP growth of 7.1%
p.a. The sudden and drastic decline of the copper and cobalt markets in 1975,
the ill-conceived Zairianization and nationalization of many transport,
agricultural, manufacturing, and trade enterprises, and the closure of the
Benguela railway caused a rapid deterioration of Zaire's economic situation
leading into an economic crisis from which the country has so far not been able
to recover completely. During the period 1973-79 the mining sector declined by
2.7% p.a. and total GDP decline was 1.4% p.a. However, the temporary
improvement of copper and cobalt markets during 1979-81 and Gecamines' efforts
to recover from the consequences of the 1978 Shaba invasion have resulted in
restoration of previous copper productior. levels and improved export
performance, and have thus contributed to a slight economic turnaround since
1979, reinforced by a variety of economic policy measures introduced in 1983 by
the Government that aimed at liberalization and at the promotion of
entrepreneurial initiatives. Between 1979 and 1984 the average growth rates of
both the mining sector and GDP have again been positive, at 4.2% p.a. and 1.2%
p.a., respectively.
B. Mineral Resources and Reserves
2.05      Zaire has an area of 2,345,000 km2 (IBRD Map 19112) and is well
endowed with mineral resources. The copperbelts of Zaire and Zambia contain 12%
of the world's copper resources2/, or 131 million tonnes of copper out of the
1,100 million tonnes of copper in land-based deposits, with Zaire holding 73
million tonnes, or 7% of the world's total. In addition, Lhese copperbelt
deposits contain the largest known resources of cobalt: of an estimated 9.9
million tonnes of cobalt in land-based deposits, Zaire has some 3.1 million
tonnes, or 31% of the world's total.
2.06      In the Shaba province of south-eastern Zaire, the copper-cobalt
deposits form one of the richest metallogenic areas in the world and have high
copper (4.7%) and cobalt (0.41%) contents. Unlike the porphyry copper deposits
of North and South America and of the Pacific, which generally average about 1%
or less copper, they are stratiform deposits in sedimentary rocks which have
been considerably folded and faulted. There are generally two ore strata 5 to
20 meters thick, separated by 13 to 22 meters of waste. The ore occurs as
sulfide minerals, whi-h have been altered by weathering in portions of the
deposits close to surface. The weathering varies considerably in depth from one
deposit to another (80 to 450 meters) and results in oxide, carbonate, silicate
and phosphate minerals. This combination of oxide and sulfide ores, together
with a transition zone of mixed ores in between, results in the need for complex
treatment processes.

acquired or may acquire economic value in the future.

2.07      Total geological ore reserves3/ in the Gecamines concession alone are
estimated at 571 million tonnes containing an average of 4.7% copper and 0.4%
cobalt, equivalent to over 40 years of production at present production levels,
as shown in the table below.

Over the past 10 years, discoveries of new ore reserves at Gecamines have added
more copper than was mined during the same period, and indications are that vast
tonnages of ore resources exist within and around the Gecamines concession: for
example, ore reserves at SODIMIZA (para. 2.15) are estimated at 20 million
tonnes of 4% copper, and exploration is currently underway to expand these
reserves.
2.08      While copper and cobalt are Zaire's major mineral resources, there is
a diversity of other known mineral deposits. Tin metal resources are estimated
at 600,000 tonnes, or 6% of the world's total. Manganese, gold and diamond
resources are substantial, and there are significant undeveloped resources of
iron ore, bauxite, phosphate, and uranium. Zaire also has resources of
industrial materials, including limestone which is quarried for production of
cement and lime. Lastly, petroleum is produced offshore in small quantities.
C.   Structure of the Sector
2.09      The technical supervisory agency of the mining sector is the Ministry
of Mines and Energy. However, because of the significance of mining in the
economy and of the predominance of Gecamines in the sector, this ministry is
only one of numerous government institutions that maintain direct or indirect
interest and influence over the sector. Among these, the President's Office had
during a certain period direct supervisory responsibility for Gecamines; the
Ministry of Finance subsequently assumed that role to oversee design and
implementation of fiscal regulations applicable to the sector; the Central Bank
controls most external financial transactions of the largely export-oriented
mining sector; the Ministry of Portfolio holds all government property,
including shares in mining companies; and the Ministry of Foreign Trade oversees
mineral exports as well as the important imports for operations and
investments. The Ministry of Planning also plays an important role in the
design of sectoral investment plans and mobilization of financing.
3/   Reserves are mineral occurrences which are economically and
technically exploitable.



-5-
2.10      The history of mining in Zaire is largely that of copper.4!  Mining
in the Zairian copperbelt was initiated in 1911 after completion of the rail
link with South Africa in 1910. Production of copper grew from 7,400 tonnes in
1913 to a peak of 498,600 tonnes in 1974, after creation of a second small
copper company in 1969. Zaire's total production increased to a new peak of
509,000 tons in 1983. Cobalt production started in 1924 and reached a peak of
17,500 tonnes in 1974. Union MiniAre du Haut-Katanga (UMHK), a Belgian company
and Gecamines' predecessor. was founded in 1906 by the Comite Special du Katanga
and the Tanganyika Concession Ltd. After initially working gold deposits, the
Company started mining copper near Lubumbashi in 1911. Gradually, production
and social facilities expanded to three mining centers around Lubumbashi
(Southern group), Likasi (Central group), and Kolwezi (Western group). By 1960,
the Company had a workforce of 20,000 and was producing annually 300,000 tonnes
of copper, 9,000 tonnes of cobalt, 100,000 tonnes of zinc concentrates, and
small quantities of cadmium, germanium, radium, gold and silver.
2.11      The Congolese Government nationalized UMHK's assets in 1967 and
transferred them to a new state-owned company La Generale Congolaise des Mines
(GECOMINES), which subsequently ir 1971 was renamed La Generale des Carrieres et
des Mines (Gecamines). A technical cooperation agreement dated January 1967 and
amended in February 1969 between the Government, Gecamines, and Societe G&enrale
des Minerais (SGM), an affiliate of UMHK, regulated the compensation question
and provided for continuing technical assistance by SGM and marketing of
Gecamines' mineral products. The nationalization was thus of little practical
consequence for Gecamines' operations since continuity of management and
marketing remained assured. In April 1974, a further step was taken to increase
Zaire's independence in mineral activities through conclusion of a revised
agreement between the Government, Gecamines, and SGM, which provided for (i) a
final compensation payment of about US$100 million to SGM by March 1975; (ii)
increased copper refining in Zaire; and (iii) marketing of Gecamines' production
by a new Zairian marketing company, the Societe Zairoise de Commercialisation
des Minerais (SOZACOM).
2.12      Gecamines production expanded further to reach a present production
capacity of about 470,000 tonnes per year (tpy) of copper; 15,000 tpy of cobalt
and 70,000 tpy of zinc. Apart from cadmium of which about 300 tpy are produced
in Shaba, the remainder of the output (mostly precious metals) has, so far, been
refined primarily under tolling arrangements in Belgium. Gecamines' workforce
has grown to about 36,000 and is the principal economic base of most of Shaba.
The number of employees and their families living directly on its salaries are
estimated at about 250,000 but indirect employment and income creation due to
its mining activities is substantially higher. The Company also plays a major
role in maintenance of transportation, communications ard social infrastructure
and provision of social services.
2.13      Gecamines operated under the direct supervision of the President's
Office until 1981, at which time this responsibility was transferred to the
Ministry of Finance. SOZACOM, however, has operated under supervision of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and its relation with Gecamines has been strained
resulting in frequent frictions because of Gecamines' inability to control the
4/ Zaire's non-copper mining activities are presented in Annex 2-1.



-6-
marketing of its production, SOZACOM's high marketing fees, and financial
irregularities. In mid-1982, a new Marketing Agreement between Gecamines and
SOZACOM gave full ownership of mining products to Gecamines up to the final
sale, with SOZAUOM as its sole sales agent, and gave Gecamines increased
influence in defining the strategy for the marketing of its production. Despite
these rearrangements, however, neither the financial nor the commercial
relationships were completely clarified and disagreements continued. In July
1984, the Government decided to abolish SOZACOM and reestablish Gecamines'
complete marketing authority. Intensive discussions were held thereafter on the
merits of various alternative organizational setups to harmonize production and
b:las. These discussions centered in the creation of a marketing subsidiary to
Gecamines, or the integration of the former SOZACOM as a department of
Gecamines.
2.14      In November 1984, the Government decided to reorganize the Gecamines
group as follows: a new entity, Gecamines/Holding, was constituted to oversee
all Gecamines activities, thus replacing the Ministries of Finance and of
Foreign Trade as direct supervisor of the group. Gecamines/Holding in turn is
supervised by a committee consisting of the ministers of Mines and Energy, of
Finance and Budget, and of Portfolio, and the governor of the _entral Bank.
Gecamines/Holding has three independent subsidiaries: Gecamines/Exploitation,
in charge of all metal production activities of the former Gecamines;
Gecamines/Commerciale, in charge of all the marketing activities for copper,
cobalt, zinc, and other minerals and staffed mainly with former SOZACOM
employees; and Gecamines/Developpement, in charge of all non-mining activities
of the former Gecamines, mostly agricultural activities in Shaba, formerly
organized under a Gecamines subsidiary, the Agro-Industrielle du Shaba (AGRIS).
7airian executives were appointed at the top of each of the four companies,
underlining, as in other sectors, the political will to replace expatriates by
Zairian nationals. The new organization became effective in January 1985.
Details on Gecamines/Exploitation and on Gecamines/Commerciale are presented in
Chapter IV.
2.15      Societe de D^veloppement Industriel et Minier du Zaire (SODIMIZA) is
Zaire's second copper producer with an annual production capacity of about
35,000 tonnes. It was created in 1969, started production from one mine in
1972, and opened a second mine in 1977. Until 1983, SODIMIZA was 85Z-owned by
Japanese interests and under Japanese management with copper concentrates being
shipped to Japan. In 1983, the Japanese shares were sold to the Government.
SODIMIZA concentrates have since late 1984 been processed at facilities of
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd (ZCCM), a short distance across the
Zambia-Zaire border. SODIMIZA is currently managed by a Canadian team
contracted by the Government. It appears to be well run and does not encounter
major problems of equipment and materials availability, or foreign exchange.
D.   Prospects of the Sector
2.16      The mineral sector is dominated by Gecamines, and this dominance can
be expected to continue in the future because the Company's known geological ore
reserves are sufficient for at least 40 years at the current rate of



-7-
production. Nonetheless, the potential of the rest of the sector is very good,
although largely unrealized: for example, tin reserves are estimated at 6% of
the world total, and yet production in recent years has amounted to only 1% of
annual world mine production. Much of the country is relatively unexplored
geologically, and basic geological mapping and exploration for new deposits are
below levels needed to tap the sector's potential effectively.
2.17      Since the mid-1970s, shortages of foreign exchange, skilled labor and
fuel, increasing transport bottlenecks and unstable economic conditions have led
to a decline in productivity as well as to a growing decapitalization of all
mining companies. The performance of the sector has been affected not only by
unpredictable events beyond the control of Zaire (metals price fluctuations,
transport route closings, Shaba invasions), but also by government policies in
the areas of taxation, financial and personnel management and the role of
foreign capital. Although production results do not in all areas reflect the
sector's increasing difficulties, the factors mentioned have prevented its
regular development and have initiated a progressive decline which eventually
has resulted or will result in production decreases.
2.18      In spite of the common factors affecting sector development in the
past, there have nevertheless been substantial differences in the economic,
financial and management environment between Gecamines and the other mining
companies. One difference has been the ability of Gecamines to get relatively
good access to foreign exchange in order to maintain its productive capacity.
Although not continuously sufficient, foreign exchange was never quite as scarce
as for the other minirg companies and for other commercial and state enterprises
in the country in geaLeral. Also, Gecamines' personnel policy has been
relatively less prone to direct government interventions such as tight
restrictions on the number of expatriates employed. Finally, Gecamines has
benefitted in southeastern Shaba from a relatively urbanized area of Zaire with
good climate and acceptable infrastructure and communications, which have
substantially facilitated recruitment of qualified personnel.
2.19      The other mining companies have also been much more seriously affected
by the general degradation of the transport and communications infrastructure
which set in during the rebellion years 1960-1965 and was reinforced by the
Zairianization measures of the early 1970s. This deterioration coupled with
more severe foreign exchange shortage and lower political and commercial clout
of the smaller companies resulted in more pronounced scarcities of materials,
parts and consumables and thus more frequent interruptions of operations. In
addition, the smaller companies suffered during the past 10 years of economic
decline from a policy attaching priority to Gecamines considering its importance
for the country's foreign exchange and budget revenue generation.
2.20      Recent signs, however, of a cautious economic recovery, supported by
government measures to reestablish business confidence and to promote
investments, provide hope for a revitalization of the non-Gecamines sector, and
for an increased inflow of commercial funds and concessional foreign aid, to
support various rehabilitation programs. While the Government's foremost
priority would still be to secure Gecamines' financial needs for priority



-8-
investments, which the proposed Project is designed to support, rehabilitation
of the other mining companies should become a key element of the Government's
future development objectives of diversification of the mining sector. In order
to initiate such a recovery program effectively, various issues will need to be
addressed, including the viability of the different subsectors, the financing
needs for investments and operations, the personnel and management policies, the
ownership options and the possible role of foreign investors, the need for
improved infrastructure and communications, and the required marketing
arrangements for the mineral production. Since the Government's long-term
objective is to reduce Zaire's dependence on copper and cobalt, a crucial issue
today is how to arrest the decline of the non-copper sector and maximize the
sector's contribution to economic recovery and growth. In order to assist the
Government in assessing the sector's prospects and rehabilitation needs, the
Bank organized a sector mission in January 1986 which reviewed constraints as
well as options for the sector's development.
III. THE METALS MARKETS
3.01      The international copper, cobalt and zinc markets are the major
determinant of Gecamines' financial health and its contribution to the Zairian
economy. The uncertainty of these markets is consequently a major source of
financial risk for Gecamines and for the proposed project. This chapter
summarizes the key world market factors, including current and projected prices,
for copper, cobalt and zinc, which together account for 90% of Gecamines'
revenues, and presents an assessment of Gecamines' market position. Details of
the zinc market are presented in Annex 3-1. A presentation of the copper and
zinc markets was made in -Price Prospects for Major Primary Commodities-
prepared by the Economic Analysis and Projections Department (Report No. 814/85,
dated September 1984). A more recent study is -The Changing Structure of the
World Copper Industry and its Future Prospects" Draft, World Bank, November
1985.
A.   The Copper Market
1. International Supply and Demand
3.02      The supply of copper comes from two sources -  primary (mine)
production (85%) and secondary (scrap) production (15%), and was 7.2 million
tonnes in 1984. Copper mine production is concentrated in the developing
countries whereas secondary production occurs almost entirely in the
industrialized countries. Although refining capacity in LDCs has been
expanding, about two-thirds of world copper production is presently refined in
industrialized countries. In 1984, LDCs accounted for 68% of world copper mine
production outside countries with centrally planned economies (CPEs), and 80% of
their production was exported to industrialized countries. Zaire is the third
largest LDC copper producer with 7% of world production in 1984, all of it
exported. Chile contributes about 16% and Zatubia 7%, with Peru, the
Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Mexico and Sou .;. Africa accounting for most of
the remaining LDC production. CPEs are largely self-sufficient in copper
representing about 18% of world mine production and exporting less than 50,000



-9-
tpy to market economy countries. During the 1970s, the developing countries'
share of primary production increased and a structural shift occurred in mine
production away from the industrialized countries, where production actually
declined. Production dropped most sharply in the USA from 1.6 million tonnes in
1970 to 1.1 million tonnes in 1984. By comparison, mine production in Chile
increased from 0.7 million tonnes in 1970 to 1.3 million tonnes in 1984, the
most dramatic increase among developing countries. However, production
increased by different amounts also in other LDCs with the exception of Zambia
where it started declining in 1974 for various reasons including depletion of
deposits. The major factor behind these substantial shifts has been the
discovery and exploitation of new copper deposits with higher ore grades,
favorable production and marketing conditions, or by-products which resulted in
vast differences in production cost up to a factor of 3, and entailed
considerable changes in competitive advantages over time.
3.03      Unlike supply, copper demand is geographically concentrated in the
industrialized countuies which accounted for 83% of world refined copper
consumption in 1984. US consumption represented about 27Z of the total,
equivalent to about 2.0 million tonnes. Copper is easy to use in manufacturing
compared to many other metals requiring higher precision technology. Copper has
important electrical and thermal conductivity and corrosion-resistance
characteristics. The electrical sector accounts for about 502 of copper
consumption, and other important sectors are machinery (20%), construction (14%)
and transportation (10%). World copper consumption grew strongly at 4.2% p.a.
from 1960-70, but the consumption growth rate fell off to 2.4% p.a. during
1970-80, and declined by about 2% p.a. during 1980-83; it rebounded dramatically
by more than 10% in 1984 not only in countries with ztrong economies but also in
depressed countries of the developing world, particularly Latin America. This
overall decline is related, in part, to lower economic growth rates in
industrialized countries, and also to a decline in the intensity of use in
specific applications, reduction in unit weight of finished goods (e.g., smaller
automobiles) ard loss of markets to substitutes (e.g., aluminum and plastics).
In future, some further reduction in intensity of use is to be expected in
certain automotive and information technology applications and additional losses
may occur to aluminum for automobile radiators and plastics in building
construction. Such losses may be partly counterbalanced by gains in new markets
such as solar energy applications and electric vehicles.
3.04      Because of the changing demand patterns described above, the
structural changes on the side of the producers, long lead times in opening of
mines and slow production responses to changing market conditions, the copper
market is subject to sharp fluctuations in the supply-demand balance and has
been characterized by four-to-five year cycles of growth and decline for the
past several decades. During the 1970s, copper booms occurred in 1973-74 and
1979-80. Outside of these years, however, the copper market has been very
depressed. It collapsed in 1975 following the oil crisis and since then has
experienced excessive inventories and oversupply due to the reluctance of many
producers to cut back production in line with poor demand recovery. Today, the
industry is faced with substantial excess production capacity and nearly 1.0
million tonn-s of mine capacity are operating on a reduced schedule or have been



-10-
temporarily closed or placed on a care and maintenance basis due to lack of
demand. Even so, total commercial stocks of refined copper at end 1984 were
estimated at over 1.2 million tonnes down from a peak of 1.7 million tonnes at
the end of 1983, but high compared with normal levels of 0.8-1.0 million tonnes.
3.05      Long-term demand prospects for copper in the mid to late 1980s and in
the 1990s will be determined not only by the world economic outlook but also by
other factors, such as substitution with competitive materials, changes in
intensity of use of copper, the availability of copper scrap and the development
of new applications for copper. Substitution trends from competing materials
are expected to have a major influence on future copper demand. World
consumption of refined copper is projected to grow at 0.7-1.9% per annum during
the period 1985-95 to reach 8.0-9.2 million tonnes in 1995.
3.06       Present primary and secondary production capacity is estimated at
about 9.3 million tpy indicating that the only requirement for additional
capacity is to replace mine closings. According to industry estimates, a large
number of small projects are presently under construction or have a high
probability of being implemented over the next decade. Such projects
could provide up to an additional 1.5 million tpy capacity with a break even
cost in the range of 55-65 cents/lb. Nearly half of these projects (about 0.8
million tpy capacity) would be implemented to replace mines that are expected to
close in the next 10 years due to depleted ore reserves, and the balance would
be net incremental production. While progress will be influe.iced by future
prices and market conditions, much of this capacity is expected to enter
production based partly on the expectation of lower production costs than
existing high-cost producers. It is expected, therefore, that without
substantial further mine closings and a major cutback in industry investment
patterns, there will be continued over-capacity at least until the 1990s.
2. Copper Prices
3.07      The bulk of international copper trade, including Gecamines'
exports, t kes place at London Metal Exchange (LAiE) prices. LME copper
prices ha. historically shown large fluctuations, but with the exception
of upswings in 1973-74 and 1979-80 copper prices have been depressed for
most of the past decade, as shown in the table below.
IME Copper Prices, 1973-85
(US$/lb-cLarrent terms)
1973  1974  1975  1976  1977  1978  1979  1980  1981  1982  1983  1984  1985
UfE Price 0.81  0.93  0.56  0.64  0.59  0.62  0.90  0.99  0.79  0.67  0.72  0.62  0.64
3.08       In 1984, copper prices averaged 62.5 cents/lb, their lowest in
real terms at any time in the post-war period. By comparison, industry
sources estimate that average industry production cash costs in 1984 were
about 58-63 cents/lb (including by-product credits and interest, but excluding
depreciation), and that about 30% of the copper industry in the world (excluding
CPEs) was not able to cover direct cash costs.



-11--
3.09      After a strong consumption upswing in 1984, stocks in LME warehouses
declined from a peak level of 436,000 tonnes in December 1983 to 115,600 tonnes
in July 1985. Nevertheless, during 1984 the copper price remained at a low 62.5
cents/lb, to some extent because of the strength of the dollar. Since the
market is likely to continue being oversupplied through the end of this decade,
the price of copper is not expected to break out of its present historical low
range for a long time. In the face of the depressed market conditions
experienced after 1980, average copper production costs in US dollar terms have
decreased substantially in most countries. Average direct cash costs declined
by about 15 cents/lb between 1980 and 1984. This was a result of (i) drastic
cost cutting measures; (ii) phasing out of high-cost mines; and (iii) various
currency devaluations by major copper-producing developing countries which had
let their currencies appreciate up to 1981 and are now under debt-servicing
pressures. Since, in several of these countries, including Zaire, these
pressures are not expected to ease soon, they are likely to continue to follow
exchange rate policies that will result in maintaining or increasing the
competitiveness of their export sectors, including copper. As a result of
actions taken by Gecamines' management and the Government, the Company's
competitiveness has increased in the past few years: its production costs were
estimated clsse to the industry average in 1982, but now range in the lower
third of all producers. In North America, where international cost
competitiveness has been further eroded by the strength of the dollar, the
high-cost mines are likely to remain closed and many of them may be abandoned
completely.
3.10      There is little consensus regarding the timing or strength of future
price increases until 1990, when the oversupply problem could start to
mitigate. The LME price is expected to fluctuate around an average of 65
cents/lb (in 1985 dollars) and such fluctuations may be quite large. By 1995,
the industry is expected to have adjusted to the slow-growing consumption trend,
with the bulk of the high-cost capacity closed and new additions to production
capacity being efficient and competitive at lower cost levels. Because of an
expected net reduction of capacity coupled with moderate demand growth the
oversupply situation should turn around and the average price can be expected to
rise moderately, reaching 74 cents/lb (in 1985 dollars) by 1995. The financial
projections presented in Chapter VII of this report have been prepared on the
basis of these price forecasts.
B.   The Cobalt Market
1. International Supply and Demand
3.11      Cobalt is obtained as a by-product from primary mine production of
copper, nickel, and other ores, although a small (6%) but increasing quantity is
obtained from secondary (scrap) production. Zaire and Zambia account for two
thirds of the primary production, and five other countries (Australia, Canada,
Finland, New Caledonia and the Philippines) for most of the balance of
production. Zaire holds 60% of the economically and technically exploitable
reserves of cobalt, and has historically supplied half the world mine
production, which was 22,000 tonnes in 1984. By comparison, total production
capacity is currently estimated at about 35,000 tpy.



-12-
3.12      In contrast to supply, cobalt demand is concentrated in the
industrialized countries with the USA, Western Europe and Japan accounting for
94Z of consumption in 1984. Cobalt's properties of heat and wenr resistance and
magnetism make it a strategic metal used in high technology areas. Super alloys
used in aerospace applications accounted for close to 40Z of consumption, wvile
permanent magnets accounted for 12%, cutting tools 15% and chemicals 35%.
Cobalt is most prone to substitution in magnets, where consumption declined
significantly in the late 1970s when prices rose dramatically. In its other
uses, cobalt is practically not substitutable which makes long-term demand
inelastic to price movements but highly reactive to perceived or real supply
shortages which can lead to exaggerated stockpiling and temporary price surges.
3.13      Due to these factors the cobalt market has in the past been subject to
sharp fluctuations in supply-demand balance, with demand highly responsive to
short term business cycle conditions. On the supply side, cobalt production is
more dependent on copper and nickel production than on market conditions.
Nonetheless, Zaire, as the dominant producer, has historically maintained a
balance by adjustments in production and inventories. In recent years, Zaire
has sharply reduced metal production by stockpiling cobalt in hydrate form.
However, the growing number of producers in recent years has weakened Zaire's
influence to a certain extent. Moreover, high price periods provide incentives
for treatment of scraps and residues and other forms of recycling which compete
with established mine production.
3.14      From the trough of 15,000 tonnes in 1981, demand has increased at 8%
p.a. to 19,000 tonnes in 1984. This growth rate is lower than historical rates,
and long-term demand growth is expected to increase at an average annual rate of
3 to 4% to reach about 22,000 tonnes in 1990 and about 27,000 tonnes in 1995.
Given a production capacity of some 35,000 tpy, an oversupply situation is
likely to exist for the rest of the decade. Depending, however, on the
perceived price and supply situation, short-term demand may fluctuate
considerably because of stockpile movements. As an indication, commercial
stocks at the beginning of 1984 amounted to about 15,700 tonnes, or about 82% of
that year's demand, but decreased to about 12,800 tomnes by the end of 1984, or
68% of demand. Stockpile figures, however, are uncertain because of incomplete
reporting and unclear dividing lines between metal and ore stockpiles. In
addition, stock movements may have been influenced by a higher supply certainty,
speculations on price movements, or increase in consumption which could not be
satisfied by increased mine and smelter production.
2. Cobalt Prices
3.15      Historically, the producer price for cobalt has been set by UMHK, and
subsequently SOZACOM, and this price has been utilized by most other producers.
A free market price, covering less than 10% of world production, from smaller
producers and secondary metal, is established by merchants and is quoted in
metals publications. With the apparent supply shortages in 1978-79 and
surpluses in 1980-81, the free market price became dominant. However, in the
past year, Zaire and Zambia have re-established the predominance of the producer
price and the free market price has remained slightly below the producer price,



-13-
where it has been historically.  Cobalt production costs are difficult to
estimate since cobalt is generally considered a by-product without specific
mining costs, although some of the processing costs can be allocated to the
metal. To the extent that estimates can be mgde, costs (up to final delivery)
are considered to be lower for Zaire and Zambia, than for other producers.
3.16      The frequent supply/demand imbalances notwithstanding, cobalt prices
remained quite stable up until the late 1970s. The producer price (in nominal
terms) increased steadily from US$1.50/lb in 1960 to US$4.44/lb in 1976. During
this period, cobalt prices increased by 1.4% p.a. in real terms, which were
comparable to real increases in prices for nickel and other metal substitutes.
With the Shaba invasions in 1977 and 1978, a perceived shortage led to panic
buying, driving the free market price up to US$45/lb at the end of 1978 from
US$6/lb at the beginning of the year and the producer price to US$25/lb from
$6.40/lb during the same period. With the economic slowdown in 1980-81, and
excess supply, the free market prices fell as low as US$4/lb in 1983, and the
producer price system was abandoned temporarily. In 1984, Zaire and Zambia
re-established the producer price at US$6.50/lb increasing it to US$11.70/lb
during 1985. Due to continued oversupply on the international markets, the
producers are unlikely to be able to sustain the current price level.  An
additional dampening effect on cobalt prices would be exerted by implementation
of the recent proposal of the US Government to decrease its strategic stockpiles
by about 11,000 tonnes over a five-year period which would result in an
additional 10% oversupply of the market. A price assumption of US$7 to US$8 in
1985 terms is used in the preparation of the financial projections of Chapter
VII.
IV. THE GECAMINES GROUP
4.01      The companies of the Gecamines group emerged from the recent
reorganization of the Gecamines-SOZACOM group as the successor to the previous
Gecamines with exclusive responsibilities for metals mining and processing and
with a substantial role in the definition of metal marketing strategies (para.
2.14). The recent reorganization has created a uu!que institutional link
between Zaire's copper industry and the political and economic decision-making
centers since a full-time coordinating body (the Holding), reporting to a single
supervisory Committee comprising the ministers of Mines and Energy, of Finance
and Budget, of Portfolio, and the governor of the Central Bank, has now been
established. The Holding is concentrating on external representation of the
Gecamines group, on contacts with the authorities, and on coordination amDng the
subsidiaries of the group, without getting involved in day-to-day management or
presenting a sizeable financial and bureaucratic burden. The Holding operates
under a Board chaired by the President of the Holding, and includes the chief
executives of the three subsidiaries and four representatives of the
Government. The new structure has also permitted improved integration of the
production and marketing functions of the Gecamines group over that of the past



-14-
decade, since the production and uarketing subsidiaries no longer operate
separately under different Boards of Directors and under the supervision of
different Ministries.
4.02      In order for the Gecamines group to continue playing its key role in
Zaire's economy in the short and medium term, it is important that a stable
organizational set-up be maintained to create the clear and rational business
environment that is vital to the group's future performance. In the past,
Gecamines has been affected by repeated reorganizations and frequent
replacements of top level executives, and given the disturbing influence of
these changes, and the suitability of the new holding structure, it appears
essential that it be left in place, unless significant changes in the economic
environment justify adjustments or modifications, and that the frequent turnover
of top executives be avoided. The Government has agreed to consult with the
Bank prior to any decision affecting the organization of the Gecamines group.
A.   Gecamines/Exploitatior
1. Organization and Management
4.03      Gecamines/Exploitation5/ reports to the Holding.  Its Board of
Directors consists of 7 members all appointed by the Government.6/ The Board
meets twice a year, defines the Company's general policy and provides overall
guidance and supervision to the Company's operations. The Chairman of the Board
is the Company's chief executive (President Delegue General) and is appointed by
Presidential Ordinance; the Financial Director and Deputy Director General
(Operations) are also Board members. The remaining members include
representatives of the President's Office, Shaba province, and parastatal
institutions relating to Gecamines.
4.04      The organizational structure is characterized by functional
centralization and geographical separation of tlcee production groups at
Lubumbashi, Likasi, and Kolvezi. The organizatiun of the Company (Annex 4-1)
consists essentially of 3 main departments responsible for all production
activities in the 3 production groups; for finance; and for other activities
such as planning and research, supplies, social programs and personnel and for
the Brussels office. A marketing division, reporting directly to the Director
General, is in charge of defining and supervising all commercial activities.
4.05      As organized under the 1974 Bank-financed expansion project of 1974
(Amended in 1979)7/, Gecamines has used the services of Currie, Coopers and
Lybrand, of Canada to review the adequacy of its organizational structure,
5/ Unless noted otherwise later in this report, Gecamines will be used in
short for Gecamines/Exploitation.
6/ As of March 1986, the Boards of the Gecamines companies had not yet
been appointed.

recommend appropriate changes and establish a framework for improved personnel
practices. The consulting firm indicated in its report of November 1981 a
growing lack of control and information flow within the Company, disparity
between authority and responsibility of various organizational units, an
inadequate delineation between staff and line functions and an unnecessarily
high degree of functional centralization. Furthermore, it emphasized that
non-productive activities were using up valuable financial and human resources.
To overcome these organizational weaknesses, the consulting firm proposed a
major reorganization scheme, which was accepted by Gecamines' Board in December
1981 and is now well under implementation: it includes a complete
decentralization on a cost center basis and the installation of a comprehensive
control system for top management and for the cost centers. The 1983
IDA-financed technical assistance project (Credit No. 1336-ZR)8! is presently
assisting this reorganization effort, particularly in the Finance Department,
and generally to strengthen Gecamines' management in the production, financial,
marketing and legal fields.
4.06      Gecamines' top management has been affected in the past by frequent
government interventions and repeated changes of chief executives. Gecamines
has known 4 Directors General in less than 3 years. It is important that this
rapid turnover of top executives be avoided in the future so that the Company
benefits from the management stability required for effective conduct of its
production, commercial and financial business. The Company also suffers from
increasing number of vacancies in management positions occupied mostly by
expatriates who retired, particularly in the Production and Finance
Departments. These positions must be solidly established on a long-term basis,
which implies both the immediate recruitment and intensive training of Zairian
nationals suitably qualified to fill the vacated positions.
4.07      A major weakness in Gecamines' management structure has been the
absence of an appropriate long-term planning group to help conceive and design
the Company's corporate strategy. While the present planning group, inherited
from the UMHK organization, is handling detailed project planning, the important
area of corporate planning has not been sufficiently promoted since
nationalization and consequently Gecamines has remained dependent in its
strategic decisions on external expertise. Also as a result of the history of
the Company, both expatriate and Zairian staff at Gecamines have to a large
extent been mostly technically oriented, focusing on production and investment
targets, with less concern for analysis of commercial and financial options and
hence without the sufficient flexibility to react quickly to changing conditions
in the Company's financial and commercial environment. In order to initiate
long-term strategic planning, Gecamines has agreed to establish a unit by
September 30, 1986 reporting to the Director General, and for which terms of
reference were submitted for Bank review.
2. Mining and Processing Facilities
4.08      Gecamines' production complex is an intricate matrix of operations
spread over 300 km in the Zairian copperbelt, and grouped in three separate
geographic areas in Kolwezi (West), Likasi (Center) and Lubumbashi (South) (Map
IBRD 19111). A simplified operations diagram is presented in Annex 4-2.
8/ President's Report No. P-3474-ZR, dated March 3, 1983.



-16-
Details of Gecamines' facilities are available in the Project File. Gecamines
has currently a concentrating capacity of 530,000 tpy of copper and a smelting
and leaching capacity of 470,000 tpy; the mining capacity, however, has in
recent years been only about 450,000 tpy because of a lag in overburden removal
resulting from weak management in the open pit mines and low equipment
availability. Also, Gecamines' copper refining capacity is limited to 250,000
tpy, and a good part of Gecamines' copper production is refined overseas. In
addition, Gecamines has production capacities for 15,000 tpy of cobalt and
70,000 tpy of zinc.
4.09      Mining Operations.  The Western Group represented 77Z of the Company's
total ore production of about 16 million tonnes in 1984 and is spread over 8
open pit mines and one underground mine. Ore reserves in five of the open pit
mines will be depleted over the next 3 years, and will be replaced by ore
production from 3 large open pits namely Dikuluwe, Mashamba and a new large open
pit mine (KOV). The ore bodies of the Kamoto underground mine flatten out at
depth, and the mine exploitation is in a transition phase from sub-level caving
and mechanized cut ard fill to a room and pillar mining method. The Central
Group represents 14% of the Company's ore production. The Kambove underground
mine will be closed in 1987 and replaced by the Kamfundwa open pit mine where
mine preparation is well advanced. The Kakanda open pit was exhausted last
year, and ore is now being mined from a series of small pits spread over 30 km.
The rest of the ore (9%) produced comes from the Kipushi underground mine in the
Southern Group, which yields a zinc-copper ore from a massive sulfide deposit.
With depth, the copper-rich ores are expected to be depleted over the next 10
years but reserves of high grade zinc ore are substantial. The average ore
grade in 1984 amounted to about 4.1% copper (with the Western group producing
above the average at 4.4% copper) and 0.3% cobalt.
4.10      Processing Facilities.  Processing the oxide, sulfide, and mixed
copper-cobalt ores requires complex ore dressing and metallurgical operations.
The ores are first concentrated in different concentrators located close to the
mines in each center: 4 in the Western Group handling 13.7 million tonnes of
ore in 1984, two in the Central Group handling 2.2 million tonnes of ore and one
in the Southern Group producing copper concentrates and zinc concentrates from
1.6 million tonnes of ore. Total ore feed to the concentrators has in the past
5 years exceeded ore production from the mines, resulting in reduction of ore
stockpiles (paras. 4.20 and 4.22). The Company's total concentrate production
in 1984 totalled 1.8 million tonnes containing 29% copper and about 2% cobalt,
and 0.13 million tonnes containing 57% zinc.
4.11      Most of the sulfide concentrates are fed to the Lubumbashi smelter, a
pyrometallurgical plant built in 1911 and modified repeatedly thereafter and
whose technology and equipment reflect essentially the 1930s. The concentrates
are sintered, smelted and finally converted, to yield blister copper ingots.
Oxide concentrates, together with small amounts of sulfide and dolomitic
concentrates, are treated in the hydrometallurgical plants at Shituru (Likasi)
and at Luilu (Kolwezi). After leaching by sulfuric acid, the solutions are
subjected to electrolysis to yield electrowon copper and cobalt cathodes. Part
of the copper cathodes (about half of the Company's production) are fire-refined



-17-
at Shituru. Another refinery was constructed under the Gecamines' expansion
project to produce about 100,000 tpy of high grade cathodes, but is now only 80Z
complete. The zinc concentrates from Kipushi are roasted at Shituru to yield a
zinc oxide calcine, as well as sulfur dioxide gas for the production of sulfuric
acid. The zinc calcine is then treated in the zinc hydrometallurgical plant
near Kolwezi to produce zinc metal ingots, with cadmium as a by-product.
4.12      While the concentrators are generally adapted to the ore production in
each production group, both with regard to capacity and ore types, the
metallurgical plants are not: as a result concentrates from the Western group
are shipped to the Center and South for metallurgical treatment and zinc
concentrates from the South are processed in the Center and West. The Western
group accounts for nearly 80Z of the Company's ore output but only for 36% of
metal production.
4.13      With its present facilities, Gecamines has little choice but to try to
maintain the present oxide/sulfide/mixed balance of ores that corresponds to the
characteristics of its processing facilities. This is an important element of
long-term mine planning, since the deposits generally contain oxide ores close
to the surface, and sulfide and mixed ores at greater depths and since the open
pits of the Western group are becoming increasingly deeper. The open pits and
the Kamoto underground mine in the West could continue to produce the present
ore mix for at least 10 years but with the Center mines running out of oxides
within 10 years, a substitute oxide ore source would have to come into
production by 1995, if supply of oxide concentrates is not to become a
bottleneck necessitating a redesign of the metallurgical plants. The most
obvious oxide source which could be developed over that horizon is the Tenke
deposit. The overall composition of Gecamines' ores and in particular of those
of the Western open pits at greater depths will also determine the justification
of the construction of a flash smelter at Kolvezi which could not only decrease
the costs of concentrate transports, but also provide much needed flexibility
for the Company to adapt to higher quantities of sulfide ores.  While Gecamines
produces currently about 70% of its sulfuric acid needs, existing zinc roasting
facilities are obsolete, and a flash smelter at Kolwezi could contribute the
remainder and thus eliminate in the future the need to import sulfur for acid
production.
3. Manpower and Training
4.14      Gecamines is the largest employer in Shaba province, with a total work
force of 36,100, as presented below.

The absorption of a number of companies into Gecamines in 1974, including
METALKAT (operating the zinc hydrometallurgical plant) and Minoterie of Kakontwe
(operating farms and a flour mill), substantially increased Gecamines' workforce
that year. From 1974 to 1981, the increase continued, primarily in service
functions. The implementation of the new organizational structure resulting
from the recent organizational study (para. 4.05) and more effective personnel
control, has reversed this trend and the size of the work force has been
reduced, primarily by attrition, by about 2,000 since 1980.
4.15      The Zairian workers are members of the Zairian Labor Union (UNTZA)
which negotiates a labor agreement every two years, covering wages and other
benefits. Wages have not kept pace with inflation over the past 10 years,
primarily because of Government-imposed wage freezes. The result was occasional
short illegal strikes. The Company provides generous fringe benefits, such as
free housing, schooling, and medical care as well as subsidized food, and total
personnel costs amount to about two to three times the wage bill proper for the
Company's workers. Absenteeism, which had traditionally been low, at about 3%
in the early 1970s, increased to over 10% at present, as the generous fringe
benefits keep workers on the payroll but low wages-have reduced the incentive to
report to work and have led to increased moonlighting, and theft of diesel fuel
and other saleable goods. Lcw salaries have also increased the difficulties in
recruiting Zairians to certain skilled positions, such as mechanical or
electrical engineers and technicians who have alternative employment
opportunities in construction or other industries. Gecamines has agreed to
prepare by December 31, 1986 a plan to implement its stated policy of gradually
increasing wages over the next several years (including incentive scheme) and of
reducing fringe benefits (in particular subsidized food), in order to counteract
the negative effects of low wages and generally reduce absenteeism.
4.16      The percentage of Zairian supervisory staff has increased from 28% in
1970 to 76% in 1984, and is expected to reach 85% in 1988. Although one of the
objectives of the nationalization was to increase the number of Zairian
nationals in higher positions, the policy of replacement of expatriates is still
determined mostly by considerations of continuity and efficiency of operations.
Gecamines' promotion of Zairian nationals has generally met the objectives set
by the Zairianization program of the early 1970s, and was overall better
conceived and implemented, than in other large industrial businesses. However,
accelerated replacement of expatriates at Gecamines followed the 1978 Shaba
invasion: whereas before 1978, the gradual staff changes had little impact on
operations, the events of that year and the quick replacement of expatriates
resulted in increasing problems given the lack of training and experience of the
Zairians who took the vacated positions. This led to poor maintenance practice,
substantial delays in overburden removal from the Kolwezi open pit operations
and decrease in ore stockpiles. The number of expatriates increased again until
1981 to compensate for the insufficient number of qualified local staff and has
since then decreased regularly as Zairian nationals acquired the skills and
experience to replace them.
4.17      Meanwhile many Zairians have been actively promoted and have reached
high positions in the Company including the current Director General. Shortages
in qualified local staff, however, persist and training requirements for the



-19-
future are substantial. While these requirements apply to all areas, they are
more obvious for the middle level technical staff and for the financial staff.
Training of Zairians at all levels will therefore become particularly important
in the next few years as more expatriates at different levels retire and
Zairians are expected to take their positions. Organizing a concerted effort to
identify and train successors for expatriates is therefore an urgent priority
together with preparation and implementation of the manpower and career
development plan. In designing such a plan, the Company should reduce its
over-reliance on engineering as a background for its senior staff, towards a
more broadly varied group of disciplines required to operate the Company.
Manpower and training policies are further detailed in Annex 4-3.
4.18      Gecamines plans to increase the number of Zairian supervisory staff
from 2,300 in 1984 to 3,600 in 1992. During the same period, the number of
expatriate staff is expected to decline to about half its present level of 700.
If these goals are to be achieved effectively, existing staff constraints have
to be taken into accGunt and appropriate training needs defined so that the
planned transition can be achieved without impairment of the Company's
efficiency.  For this purpose Gecamines has agreed to prepare not later than
December 31, 1986 a comprehensive manpower development program for its
supervisory staff that would take account of the stated policy of accelerated
Zairianization. The program should include a detailed plan of retrenchment of
expatriates and at the same time establish a clear recruitment and promotion
policy for its local staff, together with an appropriate merit system.
Gecamines would also be requested to prepare a comprehensive training program
which is a prerequisite for the success of the proposed Company personnel
policy, and should be oriented to improving the skills of Gecamines personnel in
the following three main areas:  (i) management:  to develop management
programs, and adap. the existing center for staff training; (ii) technical and
vocational: to improve technical skills of Zairians to replace expatriates at
technical level and to face the requirements of changing production methods and
different equipment; and (iii) plant training centers: to standardize
curricula, and upgrade training methods and teachers.
4.19      Accident prevention has traditionally been an important part of
Gecamines' personnel policy. Direct responsibility for accident prevention lies
with the Safety Department, which provides training in accident prevention for
workers and supervisors: technical services for monitoring of plant and
equipment; and inspection services to investigate accidents and their causes.
Gecamines' performance has in general been satisfactory and has shown a
significant improvement over the past decade. The change in mining methods at
the Kipushi mine from labor intensive top-slicing to mechanized mining accounts
for much of the improvement in underground mines during the period 1975-78.
Accident statistics over the past decade are summarized in Annex 4-4.
4. Past Performance
4.20      Production statistics for the mines, concentrators and metallurgical
plants are presented in Annex 4-5. The capacity of Gecamines' metallurgical
plants is a nominal 470,000 tpy of copper. The plants have produced close to



-20-
this level over the past 4 years. Production in 1984 was 223,500 tonnes of
copper wirebars (99.95% copper (Cu)), 156,500 tonnes of blister copper (98.5%
Cu), 84,700 of electrovon cathode copper (99.5% Cu). In addition, the plants
produced 9,100 tonnes of cobalt metal in the form of fire-refined granules,
cathode, and refined metal; 66,100 tonnes of zinc ingots, and minor quantities
of cadmium. Small quantities of precious metals were also recovered from
blister copper refined in Europe. Gecamines' mining activities have over the
past decade been affected more than its processing installations by shortages of
spare parts, supplies, inadequate maintenance, insufficient replacement
investments, and poor mine planning, and by shortcomings in management due to
insufficient training. As a result, mine output has hardly been sufficient to
reach the capacity output of 470,000 tpy and mine production had to be
supplemented by stockpiled ore in order to maintain metal production. Moreover,
copper ore grade decreased from 4.9% in 1978 to 4.1% in 1984, necessitating
increasing ore production for the same amount of metal contained. Decreasing
average ore grade was principally due to mining of lower grade ores at Kipushi
and Kambove but also to inadequate mining practices in the open-pits at Kolvezi.
4.21      The open-pits at Kolwezi (Siege Kolwezi Mines-SK1) have encountered
more severe problems than all other operations of Gecamines over the past
decade. Given their complexity they were more seriously affected by lack of
qualified personnel, shortages of spare parts and supplies in the wake of
insufficient foreign exchange availability after 1975, and delays in equipment
and spares delivery after the closure of the Benguela railway. The problems
were aggravated in 1978 after the Shaba invasion, when many expatriates left, of
whom only a part were rehired. The weak link between short-term planning at
Kolwezi and long-term planning at Lubumbashi has presented a further obstacle
to effective mining operations at SKM. Finally, eroding discipline and
motivation because of low wage levels and inadequate incentive systems have
contributed to SKN's mounting technical difficulties.
4.22      The combination of the adverse factors described above resulted in
continued problems of utilization of the truck fleet, which in 1984 spent about
40% of the time in workshops and only 60% on site. Since, however, the truck
fleet is not fully utilized even when available, the overall utilization rate
was less than 50%. This had a detrimental impact on excavation which since 1975
has lagged behind Gecamines' targets of overburden removal and ore production.
As a result, Gecamines' total copper mine production fell behind its total
annual output and the Company had to use its intermediate (buffer) stock of
mined ore in order to maintain copper production at the target levels as in the
following table.

-21-
Gecamines estimates the accumulated shortfall in total overburden removal at SKM
at about 10 million m3. With the mining plan calling for excavation volumes
increasing up to 40 million m3 by 1989, even under assumptions of increasing ore
grades (due to opening of the KOV mine and mining in greater depth) and improved
concentrator recoveries a solution to SKM's problems remains the highest
priority for Gecamines in order to maintain the Western group's contribution to
overall copper production at about 80%. Gecamines has agreed to present by
December 31, 1986 a plan to reorganize its mine planning (short, medium and long
term) at all mining divisions, and particularly at the Kolvezi open-pits.
4.23      The other open-pits and the underground mines have been substantially
less affected by the various problems outlined above. Nevertheless, aging
equipment, insufficient spare part supplies, lack of training and poorer ores in
parts of some deposits also hampered overall production of the Company.
4.24      The problems Gecamines faced in mining were compounded by low and on
the average decreasing copper recovery rates in the concentrators, particularly
at Kolvezi and Kamoto in the Western group. In order to reduce ore feed
necessary for these concentrators, a study was carried out by Lakefield
Research of Canada in 1982-83 on improving recovery rates at the concentrators
of the Western group. Modifications requiring minimal investment implemented
after that study have already increased copper recovery at the Kolwezi
concentrator from 71% in 1982 to 76% in 1984 and by smaller percentages at the
Kamoto concentrator. Further increases in recovery would contribute
substantially to relieving SKM's constraint and to cost reductions in mining in
general, since production of one tonne of copper requires some 30 tonnes of ore
and 90 m3 of ex,avated volume in open-pit mines. Every increase of 1% in
concentrator recovery rate thus reduces the required volume of excavation by
about 0.7 million i3, or 2.5% of the current volume. Given the problems in
open-pit mining and the possibilities for reduction of ore feed, the
concentrators are also a high priority area for Gecamines.
4.25      The decline in metal recoveries in the metallurgical plants has
paralleled the experience in the concentrators. At Luilu, copper recovery has
averaged 89% over the past three years, a marked improvement from 83% during
1977-80 but still far from the 93U level in 1972-74. Similarly, copper
recoveries at Shituru were 89% in 1984 after a low 86% in 1976 and a subsequent
improvement to 94% in 1979. The decline at the Lubumbashi smelter has been
virtually uninterrupted from 95% in 1972 to 90% in 1982, but recovery improved
to 92% in 1984. Additional investment would serve to eliminate bottlenecks, to
replace old, obsolete equipment and to reinforce weak sections of these plants.
While moderate improvements in copper recoveries could be expected, the most
significant benefit would be to assure the metal production.
5. Production Costs
4.26      Production cost figures prepared by Gecamines have to be considered
with caution as Gecamines does not yet have an accurate and comprehensive cost
control system and information on cost developments is based solely on
approximate data. Moreover, the zaire currency has been overvalued most of the



-22-
time until 1983. Under these conditions, cost control and calculation is very
difficult and comparisons over time and with other companies become skewed.
However, certain recent developments have already improved the situation.
First, the monetary reform of 1983 virtually liberalized the exchange rate
regime and as a result Gecamines' income statements and cost figures in 1984
provide a considerably more realistic picture of Gecamines' cost performance.
Second, since 1984, IDA-supported technical assistance to Gecamines' Finance
Department (Credit No. 1336-ZR) has been put in place and includes a complete
reorganization of its Accounting Division and the introduction of revised
accounting systems, including appropriate cost accounting as well as design and
implementation of effective cost control systems. A fully comprehensive cost
data base should be completed by 1986 and, by the end of that year, the revised
systems should essentially be in place. A training program for local accounting
staff is also planned but is expected to take longer in implementation than the
design of systems because of the low level of primary and secondary education.
Third, the highly variable and arbitrary tax regime applied to the Company
until 1982 resulted in tax charges in very substantial amounts and large
variations, even if this was also coupled with a variety of arbitrary rebates
(mostly in the form of tax reimbursements).
4.27      Based on Gecamines' accounting information and on average official
exchange rates, the Company's cost structure and unit costs per pound of copper
have been calculated over the last six years. Costs have been allocated to
copper on the basis of its share in metal revenues since a breakdown of costs
into those for copper and for other metals is artificial for certain production
steps (up to the metallurgical treatment) and is not well monitored for circuits
thereafter where the distinction could be made. The results are summarized in
the following table.

4.28       Until 1982 costs were poorly controlled and Gecamines's production
costs were adversely affected, when expressed in US dollar terms, by the
continuous overvaluation of the zaire currency. It is true also that lack of
proper cost control in the operations and at head office resulted in increasing
unit production cost, even with the benefit of increasing production between
1979 and 1982. Cost cutting measures introduced by Gecamines' management in
1982 reduced costs significantly by 1983, particularly at head office. Also,
the IDA-financed technical assistance to the Finance Department has permitted
improved knowledge of cost levels and trends by operations; the cost accounting
introduced, following a consultant study, to measure cost for the Kamoto
underground mine has been implemented and is being introduced to all Company
operations to permit immediate actions to reduce costs by managers and
supervisors at all levels. These measures, as well as the zaire currency
realignment, engendered a considerable reduction in unit costs (both total
production and cash costs) between 1982 and 1984.
4.29       Gecamines' total copper production cost for 1984 amounted to about 55
cents/lb, including depreciation, finance charges and marketing costs up to-
delivery in Europe. About 80% of this is production cost up to the final
product at the metallurgical plants, and 20% is marketing cost of which about



-24-
two thirds transport and one third commissions and refining charges in Europe.
Cash operating costs excluding depreciation and provisions but including debt
repayment, amount to 47 cents/lb. The total foreign exchange component of about
451 of production costs makes Gecamines vulnerable to shortages in foreign
exchange allocations by the Government, as happened in the periods 1975-76 and
1980-81.
4.30      The most important cost item is materials and consumables,
representing over a third of the Company's costs and over half of its foreign
exchange costs. Further discussion of this cost item is presented in paras.
4.55-4.58 in the context of the creation of SONATRAD. However, Gecamines' cost
breakdown does not reflect the importance of total personnel costs which are
estimated to amount to about double the wage bill when various fringe benefits
such as health care, housing, education and subsidized food are included. These
items appear in Gecamines' accounts as services. A more realistic cost
allocation would show total personnel costs, at about 302 of total costs. The
share of wages and salaries has fluctuated little over time ranging between 15%
and 18% during the period 1979-84 with total personnel cost estimated to be
fairly constant at around 30Z. With the exception of 1979 (i.e., after the
Shaba invasion), the share of materials and consumables ranged between 32' and
35% and that of transport ranged between 8% and 18%. The share of depreciation
charges has increased from 81 in 1979 to 17% in 1984 after the 1982 asset
revaluation and its impact on depreciation (para. 4.36).
4.31      The cost item which changed most drastically is that of taxes
reflecting the erratic and often arbitrary fiscal burden imposed in the past on
the Company. To improve on the situation, the Government agreed at the
Amendment of Loan 1090-ZR in November 1979 to carry out a study on a tax
reform. As a result of the study's recommendations, Gecamines' tax regime was
changed in September 1983. The new tax regime involves, in addition to the
corporate profits tax of 50%, two ezport levies:  a basic royalty at a
proportionate ad-valorem rate of 7% on the total of Gecamines' exported
production deductible from the c- porate tax, and a progressive export duty on
sales of copper based on a threshold price, fixed so as to permit a reasonable
profitability for the Company without overtaxing it in periods of low prices;
the surtax is deductible from the taxable base. The new system has worked well
and has stabilized Gecamines' tax payments, and ensured regular tax income for
the Government. The Government has agreed to consult with the Bank before
making any changes to the tax regime governing Gecamines' finances. In
addition, Gecamines' costs include other substantial indirect tax payments,
principally import duties. The Company's total tax payments broken down by
major category are shown in the following table.

4.32      Variable (direct) costs represent about 45% of Gecamines total costs.
Ore production from mining operations account for about half of such direct
production costs and as Gecamines' mines become progressively deeper, mining
costs per unit of ore have a tendency to increase, and hence mine planning and
mining methods have to be adjusted to help contain operating costs. Ore
concentration accounts for 22Z of direct production costs and the metallurgical
treatment for the remaining 28%. While plant costs are less significant than
mining costs, plant performance can have a significant impact since improved
recoveries can be achieved at little additional cost, but with substantial
impact on mining unit costs. Fixed (indirect) production costs have increased,
both as percentage of total cost (from about 33% in 1974 to about 55% in 1983)
and in real terms, and became the obvious target for the cost reductions
Gecamines started in 1982. A breakdown of costs by geographical production
center is not available but would be essential for the future in order to direct
effectively the Company's cost control measures to the areas of high priority.
Given the importance of cost cutting measures and the reorganization of the
accounting system currently under way Gecamines has agreed that it would submit
for the Bank's review by December 31, 1986 a program for cost control and cost
reduction by production center.
6. Past Financial Results
4.33      Audited financial statements for Gecamines during the period 1978-84
are presented in Annexes 4-6 and 4-7 and are summarized on the following page.
Gecamines' accounts are audited annually by an international audit firm (Coopers
& Lybrand), and auditing arrangements and procedures are satisfactory.



-26-
4.34      Gecamines' metal revenues have been subject to large fluctuations over
the past few years following the ups and downs of copper and cobalt prices.
Favorable cobalt and copper prices resulted in revenues from metal sales around
US$1.4 billion p.a. between 1979 and 1981 while sharp decreases in copper and
cobalt prices caused a drop in metal revenues which declined to below US$1
billion p.a. in 1983 and 1984. Copper is now the predominant product
representing 70% of total revenues, although cobalt has in the past during the
cobalt boom period played a greater role in Gecamines' revenues, as presented in
the following table.
Gecamines - Shares in Metal Revenues, 1978-84 (in %)
1978    1979    1980    1981    1982    1983    1984
Copper          43       40      64      58       77      77      68
Cobalt          54       54      32      36       14      13       26

These shares are unlikely to change substantially in the medium term given the
relatively stable outlook for the copper and cobalt markets.  Over a longer
period, however, the contribution of other metals is expected to decline because
decrease in production of precious metals.
4.35      Between 1978 and 1981 Gecamines' financial situation was characterized
by high metal prices, increasing copper production and high cobalt production,
as well as relatively low levels of depreciation due to inadequate assets
valuation, showing good levels of net income and internal cash generation.
In 1981, with copper prices starting to decline and the cobalt market collapsing
(in quantity and price), even with a stable copper production Gecamines'
revenues decreased by about one third. At the same time, costs were allowed to
increase and the overvalued zaire currency continued to exert its distorting
effects on Gecamines' accounts. These combined factors resulted in a sharp drop
in the Company's profitability. After the 1982 assets revaluation and its
impact on depreciation, Gecamines showed substantial net losses of about US$316
million in 1982 and US$111 million in 1983. The combined effect of cost cuttlng
measures, recovery of the cobalt market, and stabilization of the tax regime in
1983 improved the Company's financial result substantially in 1984, showing a
net income of about US$42 million and an intern.l cash generation of US$210
million.

4.36      In the past, allowances for depreciation provisions were limited by
the method of assets valuation on a historic cost basis (although a limited
revaluation of assets was carried out in March 1976), and Gecamines was unable
to set aside sufficient funds for the replacement of its fixed assets. This
necessarily led not only to high levels of profit tax obligations but over the
long run threatened the capital structure of the Company. Effective 1982,
Gecamines' assets were revalued on the basis of full replacement value.
4.37      Gecamines' balance sheet has in general been sound in the past.
The main feature has been the low long-term debt to equity ratio which
despite inadequate assets valuation remained under 30:70 until 1981. The
asset revaluation of 1982 resulted in a corresponding adjustment of the
Company's equity and a reduction of the debt to equity ratio to less than
10:90 in 1982, even with the new debts contracted that year. The Company's
equity, including reserves, representing more than 70% of total liabilities and
equity, reflects a sound capitalization. The current ratio has been
satisfactory, ranging between 1.9 and 3.5 although with a declining trend since
1980, mostly on account of a reduced accounts receivable as marketing and cash
management improved. The quick ratio has been fluctuating between 0.7 (1982)
and 1.8 (1980) and was 1.4 in 1984, which is above 1.3, as stipulated by the
Loan Agreement for the expansion project. However, improved cash management
measures mentioned earlier are expected to maintain it at a satisfactory level
thereafter.
4.38      Although the income statements have until 1981 shown high profits,
Gecamines has throughout encountered grave liquidity problems. The major
reasons behind these have been the inefficiencies in marketing and sales
receipts management to a large extent caused by difficulties of coordination
between Gecamines and SOZACOM and weaknesses of the latter in cash management.
At the time of appraisal of the expansion project in 1974, the typical lag
between copper shipments F.O.B. African ports and sales receipts was 3 months
for copper and 9 months for cobalt. Since then these lags increased to 9 months
for copper and 30 months for cobalt and resulted in a near trebling of accounts
receivable in real terms 1980.  While some of the delays, particularly in the
case of cobalt, were due to market conditions, they were attributable to a large
extent to: (i) SOZACOM's inefficient handling and follow-up of sales; (ii) slow
inter-bank cash transactions; and (iii) non-Company demands on the foreign
exchange due Gecamines. These liquidity problems coupled with decreasing
profitability reduced Gecamines' ability to reinvest at adequate levels between
1981 and 1983 and aggravated the existing operational problems. Following the
marketing agreement between Gecamines and SOZACOM in 1982, Gecamines' liquidity
situation improved substantially even if its cash flow was not sufficient to
permit adequate levels of re-investments. Moreover, in the context of the
IDA-financed technical assistance project, a major effort has been initiated to
improve the Company's cash management and substantial savings are expected to be
achieved, from better management of sales receipts as well as from a reduction
of short-term credit in particular for prefinancing of metal sales. On the
other hand, the performance of Gecamines/Commerciale (para. 2.14) and its impact



-29-
on marketing delays and short term financing needs cannot be fully assessed yet,
but streamlining of the relationships between Gecamines/Exploitation and
Gecamines/Commerciale is already taking place under the supervision of the
Holding Company.
4.39      In addition to marketing and payment delays, inefficient liquidity
management, and high prefinancing charges, insufficient foreign exchange
availability created particular liquidity problems for Gecamines in the past.
The Government agreed in 1977 to establish an allocation system under which the
Company would receive 45% of its net sales in foreign exchange. In practice,
however, the actual allocations remained lower until 1981, ranging between 38%
and 41X. Since 1982, they have been kept at the agreed level of 45% partly
because the implementation of the Gecamines/SOZACOM marketing agreement gave
GecAmines fuller control over its accounts. Assurances were given during
negotiations that Gecamines would continue to be allowed to retain from the
Government 45% of its receipts from metal sales net of marketing expenditures.
4.40    Gecanines has in the past been subject to repeated interventions by the
Government resulting in uncompensated sales and barter operations without prompt
and adequate reimbursement and payments made or services rendered upon the
Government's request became a substantial burden. The prominent item is debts
due by the Governmeut to Gecamines from uncompensated sales which have
accumulated to an amount of US$125 million until 1984 and now amount to about
US$57 million. In 1983, the Government agreed on repayment of these debts along
a definite schedule. The schedule has not been strictly respected, but
quarterly commercial audits imposed by the Bank in June 1984 to keep track of
financial irregularities in the commercial operations have shown that no further
uncompensated sales took place after June 1984. In order to prevent future
irregularities of similar nature, the Government has agreed that the financial
relations with the Government would be governed exclusively by the existing tax
regulations and the dividend policy agreed upon between the Company and
Government, and that no sales without proper and prompt compensation would take
place. This would continue to be monitored through regular external commercial
audits.
B.   Gecamines/Commerciale
1. Background and Organization
4.41      Gecamines/Commerciale was established in November 1984 to take over
the activities and part of the staff of SOZACOM, which had been the sole
marketing agency for Zaire's mineral production since 1974. Gecamines/
Commerciale reports to the Holding, and acts as an agent for sales of
Gecamines/Exploitation's products. This arrangement is the continuation of the
Marketing Agreement signed between Gecamines and SOZACOM in August 1982.
Gecamines/Commerciale is based in Kinshasa with 510 employees, and also operates
an office in Brussels. Its policy is to locate as much cf its activities as
possible in Kinshasa. However, the Brussels office will continue in a key role,
because of its proximity to the major European markets with easy contact to
metal buyers and sellers.



-30-
4.42      The history of SOZACOM and its troubled relationship to Gecamines was
presented in detail in the President's report for the Gecamines technical
assistance project (Report No. P-3474-ZR). This history was characterized by
high commissions, slow payments to Gecamines or incomplete transfers of sales
receipts, and a poorly designed cobalt marketing and pricing policy which
resulted in the collapse of the cobalt market in 1980. The critical change in
that relationship came about with the signature of the Marketing Agreement in
1982 which gave Gecamines/Exploitation ownership of its mineral production until
final sales, full control over its sales receipts, and a say in the design of
the group's commercial strategy. SOZACOM's sales accounts were in effect
transferred to Gecamines, a Gecamines representation was established in
SOZACOM's offices, both companies have started to define a marketing strategy in
common, and Gecamines participated in new contract negotiations since 1983.
Gecamines/Exploitation has also established satisfactory control mechanisms that
monitor the strict respect of the Agreement, and since the abolition of SOZACOM
in July 1984, external commercial audits report quarterly on the functioning of
the controls as well as on irregularities. Since the Marketing Agreement is
essential for maintenance of Gecamines' financial autonomy and for its effective
financial management, as well as for design of a rational marketing policy,
Gecamines/Exploitation has agreed that the 1982 Marketing Agreement between
Gecamines and SOZA0OM would continue to govern the relationship between
Gecamines/Exploitation and Gecamines/ Commerciale, and would not be amended
without prior Bank approval. Assurances were also obtained that Gecamines/
Exploitation will maintain its controls and that half-yearly external commercial
audits would continue to apprise Gecamines/Exploitation, and the Bank, of
irregularities in the implementation of the Marketing Agreement.
2. Activities and Sales
4.43      Gecamines/Commerciale is responsible for sales of all of
Gecamines/Exploitation's export production (the mining company sells small
quantities of copper and zinc to local customers). Gecamines/Commerciale deals
directly with buyers and signs contracts as Gecamines/Exploitation's agent. It
assumes responsibility for metal shipments at the port of export, and as such
deals with ocean freight, insurance, sales documentation, and handling to
receipt by foreign customers - usually on arrival at the receiving port.
Gecamines/Commerciale's income derives from fees of slightly above 1% of sales
receipts for copper, 3% for cobalt, 1% for zinc and cadmium and 0.5% for gold
and silver. In addition, Gecamines pays 0.4% for copper sales and 3.0% for
cobalt sales to other agents. These commissions are substantially lower than
those charged by SOZACOM; they are still higher than charges by other marketing
ccmpanies. Since the transition from the SOZAC0M conditions is taking some
time, the target fees mentioned above are expected to be acihieved by 1988, which
is reasonable. Gecamines/Commerciale has agreed to market its products in
accordance with regular commercial practice and on the basis of arm's length
arrangements, ensuring that at no time, Gecamines/Exploitation will receive less
than full ex-works commercial price (subject to normal trade discounts) for its
products.



-31-
4.44      Gecamines' copper sales have been heavily concentrated in Europe, but
also extend to several North American, Asian, and CPE countries, as shown in
Annex 4-8. The concentration of sales in Europe (about 85%) represents a
potential weakness because of lack of diversification and absence in other
expanding markets. Copper cathodes and blister copper require additional
processing, whsich traditionally has been done at SGM's Metallurgie Hoboken plant
in Belgium. After 1982, there has been a cautious start of diversification to
other refining companies, and of a total of 240,000 tonnes refined in Europe in
1985, about 50,000 tonnes were refined outside Belgium.
4.45      Gecamines produces more than 200,000 tpy of refined copper in the form
of wirebars and with the phasing out of production of that particular shape in
other countries, Gecamines has become a major wirebar producer in the world.
Traditionally, wirebars have been the standard copper product and the basis for
price quotations at the LME, but high grade cathodes have increasingly replaced
wirebars in LME contracts. Although an official decision has not been taken yet
to replace wirebars completely by high grade cathodes at the LME, this product
will increasingly be limited to a relatively small market with small customers
and short to medium term contracts. While the market for wirebars is not
expandable, Gecamines could for a period of time maintain a safe and dominant
position if it pursues an active customer-oriented marketing policy.
4.46      Cobalt sales are more broadly diversified among European, North
American, and CPE countries, as shown in Annex 3-8. The USA is the sinqle most
important buyer of Zairian cobalt, accounting for over 95% of sales in North
America. Japan is also an important purchaser, despite the fact that it is a
seller in world markets of metal refined from concentrates and matte purchased
from Australasian countries. Audited financial statements for Gecamines/
Commerciale during the period 1980-84, are presented in Annexes 4-9 and 4-10.
4.47      Production and sales of zinc and cadmium are relatively small, but the
grade specifications are high and no difficulty is encountered in marketing of
these metals. Nearly half of Gecamines' zinc production is sold to the USA and
about one quarter to Asia. Gold and silver are recovered as a by-product in the
refining of blister copper that takes place in Belgium.
3. Sales Strategy
4.48      The marketing of copper does not present major difficulties.  Normally
annual sales contracts are signed in October/November of each year and indicate
maximum/minimum purchase volumes. Price is based on the prevailing LME
Settlement Price at the time of delivery subject to certain premiums and
charges. Major buyers place orders generally on a monthly basis and provide a
mid-year estimate of total purchases for the year. The sales contracts are
negotiated by Gecamines/Commerciale with the participation of Gecamines/
Exploitation's Marketing Department, in accordance with policies established by
Gecamines/Exploitation, and are signed jointly by Gecamines/Comerciale and
Gecamines/Exploitation. In spite of declining demand for wirebars, Gecamines/
Exploitation has maintained its sales of this shape by reaching longer term (3
years) understandings with certain consumers of wirebars in Europe. It has also
diversified the refining of blister copper and electrowon copper cathodes, and



-32-
has initiated direct sales of small quantities of electrowon cathodes to brass
mills and other consumers of copper for alloying where mechanical strength and
electrical conductivity are more important than high grade. Gecam.nes/
Exploitation has also initiated sales of high grade cathodes, presently
toll-refined in Belgium in view of their eventual production at the
electrorefinery at Luilu. Gecamines/Commerciale has agreed to present by June
30, 1987, a plan defining its strategy for marketing wirebars in the medium
term, and of progressive replacement of wirebars.
4.49      Unlike copper, cobalt marketing involves critical judgments both in
terms of setting selling prices and in terms of finding market outlets. Zaire
sells mostly refined cobalt in the form of cathode chips. A high-quality,
vacuum-refined cobalt, suitable for super-alloy applications is also marketed.
In addition, Zaire sells lower quality cobalt cathodes from Shituru to
Metallurgie Hoboken in Belgium for refining into high quality refined metal and
for production of special products such as cobalt salts. Since the cobalt
market is in a condition of severe oversupply, many producers, including Zaire,
are holding large inventories of cobalt. Gecamines/Commerciale has agreed to
present by June 30, 1987, a plan defining its strategy for marketing cobalt in
the medium term.
4.50      Zaire has historically followed a policy of selling cobalt at a
producer price set by SOZACOM. But in recent years the market price has been at
a large discount to the producer price causing both Zambia and Zaire to lose
their competitiveness. The sharp drop in market share during 1980-82 was
largely due to losing customers to marginal suppliers from Japan and Canada who
were selling cobalt at very low prices on the market. With Gecamines' finances
ext-emely sensitive to cobalt prices, and to the extent that these are generally
concrollable, it is important that Gecamines' cobalt pricing policy take account
of the risks that go with unreasonable producer prices and of the need to
maintain the client confidence which took several years to reestablish after the
excesses of 1980. It must be recognized that any increase in market share can
only come at the expense of either Zambia or the marginal producers and, while
genierally pointing in the right direction, Gecamines' strategy is not yet
comprehensive in terms of dealing with the overall mix of pricing, sales terms,
inventory policy, and quality considerations and may well be less effective in
increasing market share than the Company presently anticipates.
4. Transportation Routes
4.51      Three main routes are available for the export of Zaire's mineral
products: (i) the Voie Nationale, a multimodal chain of transport comprised of
the railway line from Shaba to the Ilebo port on the Kasai river, barge
transport from Ilebo to Kinshasa on the Zaire river, rail transport from
Kinshasa to Matadi, Zaire's main seaport; (ii) the Southern route which connects
Shaba to the Southern african ports of London and Durban through the railways of
Zaire (SNCZ), Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa; and (iii) the Eastern
route via SNCZ, water transportation on Lake Tanganyika and the Tanzanian
railways to the port of Dar es Salaam. Traffic has been allocated as follows:

Sources:  Gecamines Annual Reports; Zaire Dept. of Mines Annual Reports.
4.52      The above routes are also used for the imports of equipment, spare
parts, consumables and reagents for the mineral industry, as well as general
goods for the mining communities. Until its closure in 1975 the Benguela
railways to the port of Lobito in Angola was the main foreign route for Zaire
and accounted for 50% of total mineral exports. The road from Dar es Salaam is
also important to Gecamines because it is the only route with sufficient
clearance to permit transport of large mining equipment used in open-pits.
4.53      The Voie Nationale has experienced difficulties because of the age
and poor condition of railway, port and river transport equipment; deterioration
of the road bed and track on the railway portion, and low water levels on the
Kasai river. The shortage of operational railcars has become an increasingly
serious problem on SNCZ affecting all users of the railways, including
Gecamines. As a result total transit time on the Voie Nationale is about 25%
longer than on the Southern route. Despite these shortcomings, Zaire's policy
is to export through the Voie Nationale on a priority basis, 1e'zause it is the
cheapest available route in terms of foreign exchange and is free from possible
closure due to political and security conditions in foreign countries. This
policy is supported by Zaire's major donors. Some key figures on Gecamines
export routes are summarized below.

-34-
4.54      Improving the performance of the Voie Nationale has been one of the
Government's main goals in the transport sector over the recent past. This
requires that Infrastructure and equipment be rehabilltated and the institutions
responsible for the Voie Nationale be strengthened. Much work is currently
going on along these lines under 3 Bank assisted projects, the ONATRA
Modernization, Ports Rehabilitation and Second SNCZ projects9/, for a total
cost of US$247 million equivalent, of which US$171 million in? foreign exchange
financed by various donors (IDA, AfDB, KfW, CCCE and Belgium). Substantial
improvements in the Voie Nationale's performance should follow the
implementation of these projects, which will last until early 1987 to late
1988. Au additional project with Regie des Voies Fluviales, the public agency
responsible for maintenance of Zaire's river network is expected to start in
1986. Transport infrastructure and equipment on the Voie Nationale has
deteriorated to such an extent since 1960, however, that continued support from
external donors will be required co ensure satisfactory performance in the long
term.
C.   Societe Nationale de Trading
4.55      An important element in the success of Gecamines' cost reduction
effort is the Company's ability to improve its procurement process, with a view
to obtaining the best possible conditions, minimizing delays, and optimizing
cash management. Materials and consumables costs amount to over US$300 million
equivalent annually, or 35% of Gecamines' production cost. When equipment for
investment is added, Gecamines spends about US$250 million in foreign exchange
annually, or 55Z of its total foreign exchange expenditures, for consumables,
equipment and spares. This expense category is thus an obvious target for
introduction of increased efficiency and reduced costs, through the introduction
of new procurement procedures and purchasing methods. At present virtually all
procurement is done through restricted consultation of supplers, with no or
ineffective ex-post audit; Gecamines' procurement staff is weak in ability to
prepare the technical specifications, in their knowledge of their suppliers, and
in their negotiating skills.
4.56      The Government, aware of procurement problems in all its public
enterprises, addressed them through the creation in March 1985 of a central
procurement agency, the Societe Nationale de Trading (SONATRAD), to serve all
large public enterprises, including Gecamines.  SONATRAD's mandate is to permit
substantial improvements in procurement through improved negotiation techniques;
grouping orders from several public enterprises; standardization of common
equipment; elimination of certain purchasing intermediaries, diversification of
the sources of supply, and promotion of competitive local producers.
4.57      Extensive discussions have taken place since March 1985 bt.een the
Government, Gecamines, SONATRAD and the Bank to develop SONAIRAD into an
institution that can effectively play its role of improving Gecamines'
procurement practices, and to have the respective roles and responsibilities of
Gecamines and SONATRAD clearly spelled out in an acceptable bilateral contract.
9/ Credits 1180-ZR, of March 10, 1983; 1335-ZR, of April 28, 1983; and
1475-ZR, of August 7, 1984, respectively.



-35-
A draft Purchasing Agreement was agreed as a restt of these discussions, which
elaborates SONATRAD's role in the following areas: (i) to serve as ' Gecamines'
purchasing agent for a limited number of large contracts (above US$1 million for
1986) and for contracts of equipment common to several public enterprises and
where substantial savings can be expected from grouping of orders; (ii) to
control and audit Gecamines' purchasing practices, with particular emphasis on
commercial intermediaries, standardization, and monopoly situations; and (iii)
to advise Gecamines on purchasing procedures, knowledge of equipment market, and
generally upgrade Gecamines' purchasing skills. The Government has agreed to
a review of the threshold every six months and for assurances that it could not
be changed without prior Bank's approval.
4.58      The Purchasing Agreement between Gecamines and SONATRAD which was
approved by the Zairian Government is a satisfactory document which adequately
addresses the weaknesses of the present system. The Government has agreed that
the Purchasing Agreement would not be amended without prior Bank approval. The
Government also agreed that Gecamines will monitor SONATRAD performance as its
purchasing agent and that quarterly external audits would apprise Gecamines, and
the Bank, of the quality of implementation of the Purchasing Agreement.
D.   Rehabilitation Program
4.59      As discussed throughout this chapter, the Gecamines Group has faced
difficult commercial, technical, financial and manpower conditions, that have
damaged considerably its ability to produce copper economically but have also
provided the shock necessary to start a serious series of actions to improve on
its technical efficiency, its financial performance and its labor productivity.
Several such actions were started in 1982 and are well under implementation,
others are under preparation and are part of Gecamines' proposed rehabilitation
program.
4.60      The necessity for a substantial rehabilitation program arose from the
increasing vulnerability of Gecamf  s to operating difficulties.  In the past 10
years, the Company has been able to maintain fairly high production and sales
levels in spite of numerous obstacles, to a large extent because important
intermediate stockpiles had accumulated which provided the Company with unusual
flexibility and the ability to withstand much buffeting without major
consequences. This flexibility is fast disappearing. On present trends, it
will not be possible to draw much longer on such stockpiles when mining or
concentrate production is lagging. In 1974, Gecamines had 19 months of
production in banked ore: this has dropped to 9 months in 1984 and the ore
grade has decreased from 4.8 to 3.9%. Similarly, the concentrate cushion
provided by the startup of the DIMA concentrator in 1980 has now been used up.
The operating flexibility of Gecamines may thus have completely disappeared by
1987 or 1988 and serious production mishaps will then affect sales almost
immediately. Any significant additional delays in either the Kolwezi stripping
program or the implementation of the critical components of the Rehabilitation
Program would have a deep and permanent impact on the Company.

4.61      At the same time, with the essential constraints in Gecamines'
operations being the low operating availability of mining equipment in the
Western open-pit mines and low metal recovery rates in its concentrators, a
large part of Gecamines' investment effort has to be devoted to addressing those
two main constraints, and to concentrating on sufficient reinvestments at the
open-pits, improvement of spare parts and fuel supplies, decentralization of
mine planning, as well as implementation of investments to increase recovery
rates in concentrators.
4.62      As part of the preparation of its rehabilitation program, Gecamines
prepared in 1984 a five-year investment program, which covered its investment
requirements during the period 1984-88, and which directs investments to (i)
projects increasing metals recovery in the concentrators and in the
metallurgical plants and (ii) replacement of worn and obsolete equipment to
improve performance and reduce cost, mainly in the mines. This program is
reviewed in Chapter V. To ensure optimum use of the investments proposed,
policy actions are required in a number of areas. These actions have been
discussed in the preceding paragraphs and their key elements are summarized
in the preceding two pages.
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Gecamines' Long-Term Strategy
5.01       In view of the changing market and price trends, Zaire must develop
the marketing, production and investment strategies that make optimal use of its
large copper reserves and its good ore grades. In an increasingly competitive
market, Gecamines has little choice but to improve its cost competitiveness and
aim at remaining within the lower third of world mining operations in terms of
copper production cost, including transportation and financial charges. In
practice, this means (i) improving the management of each sub-component of its
operations, (ii) increasing the efficiency of its existing facilities, (iii)
improving its overall cost effectiveness, and (iv) diversifying its product mix
into higher grade products. Appropriate cost consciousness should in the longer
term give Gecamines the financial means to adapt its level of production to
market opportunities, and restructure its facilities to take account of the
closing of old mines and opening of new ones.
5.02      Gecamines' present strategy is oriented towards maintaining its
present production levels of about 470,000 tpy of copper, 10-12,000 tpy of
cobalt and 70,000 tpy of zinc, while improving its cost competitiveness through
further integration of mining and processing within each of the three
geographical production groups (West, Center, South) with the objectives of more
efficient use of the Company's total physical assets, improvements in
productivity and quality, and reduction of inter-group transport costs. The
principal components of the long-term plan are the following:
(i) completion of the electro-refinery and construction of a flash smelter
at Luilu (West), to permit more than two thirds of mine production in
the West to be processed up to electrowon or high-grade cathodes;



-38-
(ii) opening of new mines (Tenke) in the Center and replacement of current
concentration capacity at Likasi (Center) by new concentration
capacity commensurate with the requirements of these mines, to
maintain Gecamines' balance of oxide/sulfide/mixed ores because of the
high oxide content of ore from the new mines;
(iii) decreased processing of concentrates from the West at the Lubumbashi
smelter (South) and use of part of its capacity for processing of
concentrates from SODIMIZA; and
(iv) installation of a zinc roasting plant, a sulfuric acid plant, and a
zinc metallurgical plant at Kipushi (South), which is expected to
produce zinc exclusively in about ten years, to supplement present
installations in the Center and West.
5.03      Although the long-term plan would add about 100,000 tpy of copper to
Gecamines' metallurgical capacity, actual net copper metal production by
Gecamines is expected to increase by only 20,000 tpy of copper since processing
of Gecamines concentrates would be reduced at Lubumbashi by an amount close to
the capacity of the new flash smelter, while Lubumbashi would principally treat
SODIMIZA's ore production. Another feature of the long-term plan would be
expected self-sufficiency of Gecamines in sulfuric acid production because of
the expected production from new acid plants Unked to the new zinc processing
facilities and to tne flash smelter.
5.04      The Tenke deposit has been retroceded to Gecamines, and perhaps
eventually the Fungurume deposit. These new opportunities raise several
questions about the Company's longer term choices: first, whether as proposed
earlier by Gecamines and as implied in the present plan, Tenke should only be
developed to replace costlier deposits presently in production, within the
existing capacity limit of 470,000 tpy of copper, or whether a production
potential of at least 100,000 tpy of copper should be added to such capacity;
and second, whether Gecamines should sell concentrates or increase its own
metallurgical plant capacity in order to market the additional blister or
electrorefined cathodes. Finally, the prospects of expanding Zaire's copper
production raise a number of issues about the role of Government in the
development of Zaire's copper industry. On the one hand, expanding existing
Gecamines' mines would offer prospects of quicker and larger returns than
opening new private mines (Gecamines' cash generation would allow it to sustain
a substantial investment program); on the other hand, Zaire's large copper
reserves and high ore grades would give the Government an excellent bargaining
position in negotiating at the appropriate time with international mining
companies so as to allow the private sector to become a motor of expansion and
development in the sector. In the short term, and in view of the poor past
performance of foreign investment in copper in Zaire, Gecamines constitutes an
irreplacable source of investment for the copper sector. In the long term,
however, Gecamines should seriously consider the option of associating private
foreign partners which would bring not only financial resources but also their
technical, managerial and marketing know-how, to its mineral diversification or
other new projects.



-39-
5.05      Substantial work has been done already by Gecamines to define its
strategic options, particularly to prepare scenarios for the next 10 years, but
many longer term alternatives have yet to be imagined and analyzed. While in
the end it is the Government's responsibility to define an overall long-term
strategy for the development of Zaire's copper sector, Gecamines will also build
up within its organization a corporate planning capacity to keep track of
developments in the world metals market, to identify marketing opportunities for
Zaire, to organize coordination between the various functions of the enterprise
(notably commercial, production and finance), and to guide Gecamines' management
in deciding on medium- and long-term investment and production options within a
longer term context (para. 4.07). The Government and Gecamines have agreed to
discuss with the Bank its expansion investment plans and the structure of the
partnership (including foreign private investors) envisaged for its new
investments.
B.   Objectives of the Rehabilitation Project
5.06      Gecamines' rehabilitation program which has been extended to 1990
because of the low level of execution in the 1984-85 period (the object of the
proposed Rehabilitation Project) is an important link to its long-term strategy;
its main features and conditions of success were presented in Chapter IV. The
main objectives of the Project are to improve Gecamines' efficiency throughout
the whole chain of production and commercialization of its metals products, to
raise the Company's productivity at the mines and in the surface plants and
hence, while maintaining production capacity at its present level of about
470,000 tpy during the 1986-90 period, assure the continued f JW of the
principal source of foreign exchange earnings to Zaire. The Project also aims
to increase Gecamines' profitability and ability to transfer resources to the
Treasury, consolidate its position in the world copper market, and to integrate
its operations with other economic activities in Shaba. As such, it would be a
main ingredient into Zaire's economic recovery program. Specifically, the
Project would aim at:
(i)   maintaining metals production at the Company's nominal capacity to
achieve optimal use of existing installations;
(ii)   increasing metal recoveries at concentrators and metallurgical plants
to reduce quantities of ore to be produced at the mines;
(iii)   reducing operating costs at the level of concentrators and
metallurgical plants, and containing mining costs;
(iv)   diversifying the Company's product mix through production of high
grade cathodes;
(v)   improving the Company's management and efficiency of operation; and
(vi)   preparing Gecaminest long-term strategy through various exploration,
research and study works.



-40-
5.07      Gecamines' 5-year Investment Program covering the physical invegtment
of the rehabilitation program was first discussed with the Bank in February
1984, and after several amendments, was formally presented to the Bank in
October 1984. It consisted essentially of overdue investments which Gecamines
had not carried out in recent years or investments which would be part of a
normal program of replacement to preserve good operating conditions of its
production facilities. A Bank mission visited Zaire in May 1985 to conduct,
with the help of outside consultants, a full technical audit of Gecamlones'
Investment Program in order to (i) verify that Gecamines 100-odd sub-projects
were consistent with the overall objective of maintenance of production,
improvement of productivity and reduction of cost and with its medium- and
long-term investment plans; and (ii) review and assess the technical and
economic justification of each sub-project. The auditing team visited all
Gecamines' production units to assess the production performance and physical
state of the facilities, as well as the units' ability to implement their
proposed investments. Also, particular attention was given to intra-unit
relations, and to the consistency of their proposed investments and hence to the
optimization of Gecamines' total physical assets. The proposed Project takes
account of all reviews that took place and changes that have been introduced to
further optimize Gecamines' investment over the coming years.
C.   Project Description
5.08      The Project would cover high priority investments during the period
1986-90 for replacement of old equipment and rehabilitation of components of
plant facilities, required to improve Gecamines' performance. The Project would
also include reinforcement of the Company's training department to upgrade
management and supervisory personnel; and technical assistance and studies to
improve weak performance in certain areas (supply organization, truck dispatch,
short-term mine planning) or to carry out measures necessary for preparation of
investments after 1990. The Project consists of three major components: (i)
investments in existing mining and plant facilities for equipment replacement
and rehabilitation, aiming at improved maintenance, productivity increases and
reduction of operating costs; (ii) a training program to upgrade skills of
technical supervisory and managerial personnel; and (iii) pre-investment and
technical studies including those for preparation of investments after the
Project period.
1. Mining and Plant Replacement and Rehabilitation Component
5.09      The mining and plant investment component would consist of a number of
projects designed to maintain the productive capacity of the existing
facilities. It would include replacement of worn and obsolete plant and mining
equipment, and rehabilitation of sections of large plant facilities, in order to
eliminate bottlenecks or improve efficiency. This would include:
(i)   in the mining operations:  replacement of equipment and provision of
spare parts used in drilling, loading and transporting ore, including
loaders, shovels, trucks, drills, bulldozers, graders, cranes and
forklifts; improvement of communications and truck dispatch in
open-pit mining; partial electrification of trucks; installation of
in-pit crushing and conveying equipment in the KOV open-pit; and
renewal and improvement of dewatering and ventilation equipment;



-41-
(ii)  in the concentrators:  rehabilitation of grinding and classification
sections, flotation sections, and tailing retreatment and disposal
systems;
(iii) in the metallurgical plants: rehabilitation of concentrate handling
systems, leaching circuits, and tailings and solutions treatment
sections, as well as completion of construction of the Luilu
electrorefinery;
(iv)  in transport and workshops:  acquisition of rail cars for concentrate
transport; replacement of worn rails; replacement of light vehicles,
trucks, and buses; renewal of workshop machines; rehabilitation of the
foundry at the Central Workshop in Likasi; and
(v) at central services: replacement of data processing equipment;
improvement of telecommunications systems; acquisition of medical
equipment; and investments for social services and administration.
2. Training Component
5.10      ThL training component would consist of:
(i) strengthening of the Company's training capability at the head office
through the creation of two new units: the Training Planning Unit,
which would be responsible for collecting and processing all data on
training needs and investigating the need to boost and assign
manpower, equipment and financial resources in order to accomplish the
Company's established goals; the Managerial Level Technical Training
Unit, which would be responsible for studying and proposing a policy
and plan for the technical training of managerial level personnel and
for coordinating all managerial level training activities both abroad
and in Zaire;
(ii)  at the Training Center for Managerial and Supervisory personnel:
evaluation and reorientation of its activities; training for trainers
abroad; strengthening of practical training; organization of specific
courses on technical and commercial subjects in Zaire and abroad; and
study on the creation of a Technical Training Center for managerial
and supervisory personnel. Over a period of five years, there will be
1,350 man-months of training for managerial and supervisory personnel;
12 seminars a year, each lasting on average of 15 days for 15
management staff and 24 seminars each lasting an average of 15 days
for 15 supervisors. For the training of top management personnel
abroad there will be 25 three-month fellowships per year for five
years;
(iii) review of on-the-job training and plant training programs to introduce
modern training methods and to standardize courses in centers
throughout the Company; training which will be given to about 3,000
staff a year would require additional staff and materials. The
teaching materials and equipment will be renewed, particularly in the
case of hydraulic and pneumatic equipment and electric controls;



-42-
(iv) on-the-job training for supervisors in the open-pit mines under the
program developed by the technical assistance team; and
(v) on-the-job theoretical and practical training for staff in the
procurement and purchasing departments.
Background and details o. the training component may be found in Annex4-3.
3. Pre-Investme'nt, Studies and Technical Assistance
5.11      The pre-investment and technical studies would supplement and complete
the changes initiated under the organizational study and the mining assistance
carried out under the IDA-financed technical assistance project (Credit No.
1336-ZR) to prepare for longer term developments and to analyze specific
activities with cost reduction potential. This would include:
(i) provision of inventory management specialists, review of the
requisitioning/ordering and warehousing systess and implementation of
resulting action plan to reduce lead times in ordering and to improve
inventory control;
(ii) provision of purchasing and procurement specialists, review of
purchasing practices, and implementation, in cooperation with
SONATRAD, of resulting action plan to improve on preparation of bid
documentation, relations with suppliers, and negotiating skills;
(iii) optimization of open-pit mining operations in selected areas such as
truck dispatching and short-term (up to two years) planning;
(iv) exploration work within Gecamines' concession and feasibility and
engineering studies for future orientation of the Kipushi mine and
development of the Tenke deposits;
(v) a comprehensive review of the Company's social activities, costs and
their links to operations; and
(vi)  a comprehensive review of the copper wirebars and cobalt markets, and
preparation of a plan of progressive wirebsr replacement.
Draft terms of reference for these studies prepared by Gecamines were submitted
to the Bank for review at the time of negotiations.
D.   Project Implementation and Schedule
5.12      The various components of the Project will be implemented by
respective departments in Gecamines. For the replacement and rehabilitation
component, the managements of the different operating departments will provide
technical specifications, assist in bid evaluation and sanage all on-site work,
while procurement will be handled by the purchasing division of Gecamines in
coordination with SONATRAD (paras. 6.12 and 6.13). For the training component,



-43-
the Department of Training will be responsible. The technical assistance will
also involve the Supplies and Services Department and the Kolwezi production
group and would generally be coordinated by the Department for Planning and
Research. While in a Project of this nature, It is unavoidable that
implementation responsibilities be disseminated throughout the Company,
Gecamines has the ability to carry out all tasks without undue burden on its
organizational structure. However, the Project is relatively ambitious and
exceeds past implementation levels achieved by Gecamines, and the Company will
have to rely more heavily than in the past on outside contractors for
construction and installation. In order to assure implementation of the Project
according to schedule Gecamines has reviewed the impact of outside contracting
on the basis of its own implementation capacity with particular emphasis on
manpower requirements, and has submitted a proposal for allocation of
implementation responsibilities to different departments of the Company and to
contractors.
5.13      The Project activities described above represent about 5 years of
Gecamines' rehabilitation effort. An implementation schedule for the 3 project
components is given in Annex 5-1. The training component would be initiated in
1986, and the pre-investment and technical studies component would be concluded
by December 1988. The replacement and rehabilitation component would be carried
out between 1986 and end of 1990.
E.   Safety and Environmental Aspects
5.14      General worker protection in underground and open pit mines is
governed by legislation concerning occupational health and safety. Specific
hazards, such as noise, dust and gases, and mine hoisting cables, are the object
of Gecamines' regulations based on standards in Europe and the USA, and are well
controlled from health and safety perspective. In the surface facilities the
standard of control is not as high and working conditions in the old
pyrometallurgical plants are poor.
5.15       Solid Residues.  Significant quantities of gaseous, liquid, and solid
wastes are generated in the large-scale recovery of metals from ores. Gecamines
utilizes conventional technology in the application of tailings ponds to remove
fine particulate matter and soluble organic residues from tailings slurries.
Some of these tailings ponds cover large areas particularly in the Kolwezi
region, but are very effective solids retention basins.  Gecamines has done very
little so far to reclaim open pits, waste rock dumps and tailing disposal
areas. The major mining area at Kolwezi suffers from severe dust storms during
the dry months which present a health hazard to people in the region. Gecamines
will be requested to submit by December 31, 1986 to the Bank a plan of action to
help alleviate this problem.
5.16      Gaseous and Particulate Emissions.  The sulfur in the concentrates is
almost totally oxidized to sulfur dioxide. In Gecamines' operations, about one
quarter of this sulfur dioxide is captured as sulfuric acid and eventually
reports in solid wastes as calcium sulfate. The other three quarters are
discharged from the stacks at the metallurgical plants. The gases and dust



-44-
particles from these stacks disperse over the entire district but of course are
strongest within the plant and nearby town areas. The major air pollution
problem is encountered in Lubumbashi due to low level emissions of sulfur
dioxide and dust from the blast furnaces. A project currently underway will
greatly reduce this impact by use of cyclones and scrubbers and high level
discharge of cleaned gases.
5.17      Liquid Effluents.  Large quantities of water and chemicals are added
to the finely ground ore during concentration and to concentrates during the
leaching operations. This water, containing both soluble and insoluble matter,
flows into neighboring streams after it has been discharged into tailings ponds
or dams. Since 1974, Gecamines has monitored the effluents from their
operations. Typical results of monitoring the flows which discharge directly
from operations or which drain mine and plant areas, and the river above and
below the operations, indicate that pH is within standards but total suspended
solids are well above. At the Luilu hydrometallurgical plant proposed plant
improvements will greatly reduce acid and metal losses. Until plant
improvements are made at the zinc and acid plants it will be necessary to add
lime tc a pH of about 10 to neutralize acids and remove soluble metals.
Ignoring the metal content of these suspended solids, while discharges from
plants and mines do not meet US and Canadian standards, the streams and rivers
do.
5.18      While monitoring of pollution levels by Gecamines is generally
adequate, in practice the quantities of effluents exceed the limits accepted in
the industrialized countries. Gecamines has agreed to meet these standards in
the future and submit to the Bank regular reports on pollution control and
effluent discharge monitoring, and to discuss with the Bank any further
corrective measures required.
VI.  CAPITAL COSTS, FINANCING PLAN, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
A.   Capital Costs
6.01      The total financing required for the Rehabilitation Project is
estimated at US$703 million, excluding incremental working capital and interest
during construction, of which US$436 million, or 62Z in foreign exchange. Of
the total base cost of US$567.6 million about US$532 million (94%) will be
needed for the investments in physical facilities, US$31 million (5%) for
pre-investment and technical studies component, and US$5 million (12) for the
training component. Detailed Project costs estimates are presented in Annex 6-1
and summarized below.

6.02      The capital cost estimates were prepared during 1984 by Gecamines'
Planning and Research Department based on previous experience with procurement
of similar equipment, updated suppliers' quotations and engineering studies.
Both base costs and the Project's implementation schedule were reviewed and
updated to end-1985. The difficulty in the cost estimation has been to
determine which equipment items can be considered as rehabilitation and
replacement equipment, as compared to consumables and spares. Overall,
estimating methods have been adequate and the capital costs estimates reviewed
extensively during the May 1985 audit (para. 5.07), are considered reliable
particularly since many of the items are equipment used regularly by Gecamines.
Physical contingencies of 5% have been assumed for mobile equipment and
equipment with little installation requirement while 10% was estimated for
investments with high installation content. Price contingencies are based on
escalation of 7% each in 1986 and 1987, and 7.5%, 7.7% and 7.6% in 1988, 1989
and 1990, respectively, both for foreign and local costs since the exchange rate
of the Zaire currency has been assumed to adjust in accordance with the
differential between local and foreign price escalations as a result of
continued Implementation of the Government's floating exchange rate policy.
Consultant services for technical studies are estimated on the basis of 160
man-months.



-46-
6.03      About 33% of the investments are maintenance investments; 59%
represent investments designed to improve productivity and reduce costs, and the
remaining 8% is mostly related to the completion of the electrorefinery aiming
at diversification into higher grade products. In response to the priority
needs of the Western group and its importance for the future of the Company,
about 62% of planned investments are allocated to this group, against 16% for
the South, 11% for the Center and 11% for not directly allocatable investments
(e.g., social services, telecommunications).
B.   Financing Plan

a/  Additional financing from bilateral sources in the amount of about US$30
million is expected to F'e available.
6.05      The Project would be financed about 59% by internal cash generation
and 41% by external sources. The proposed Bank financing from IBRD would cover
about 16% of the Project's total cost, and 25% of the total foreign exchange
requirements. The European Economic Community (through their Hinerals Systems
facility--SYSMIN), the African Development Bank (ADB), the European Investment
Bank (EIB) and the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) would
cofinance the Rehabilitation Program. The effectiveness of all loans/credits
would be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan. Gecamines is considered
capable of meeting its share of Project cost in local and foreign currencies
from internal cash generation (para. 7.05). Should the Project experience a
cost increase, Gecamines has agreed to finance this increase by borrowing within
a maximum overall 50:50 debt to equity ratio which should not pose any major
problem given G.camines' profitability and ability to service debt.



-47-
6.06      The proposed Bank loan of US$110 million would be extended to
Gecamines for a period of 15 years, including 3 years of grace aud at the IBRD
interest rate plus a 10% premium -hereof as guarantee fee to the Government.
Gecamines will bear all foreign exchange risk and reinburse to the Government
the commitment and service fees.
6.07      Although debt service for external financing for the Project would be
guaranteed by the Government, special trust arrangements would be made for the
Bank loan and other loans made directly to Gecamines on commercial terms,
considering the substantial amounts of financing involved. These would be
similar to the set-aside arrangement established under the Gecamines expansion
project that have worked well since 1975. They provide for debt service to be
paid out of a special fund managed by an independent commercial bank outside of
Zaire, the Union des Banques Arabes et Frangaise (UBAF), of London. The fund is
replenished by Gecamines by monthly allocations of 1/6 of the aggregate amount
of debt service due semi-annually, directly from export sales proceeds, and
contain at all times at least half of the following semi-annual debt service
payment due. Satisfactory arrangements on the second trust fund would be a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed Bank loan.
C.   Procurement
6.08      Procurement for all Bank-financed items will follow the Bank's
procurement guidelines. Procurement of items financed by the other colenders
will follow the respective procurement procedures of these institutions. The
specific allocation of procurement packages was established during the
colenders' meeting of March 1986.
6.09      The in-pit crushing and cor.veying unit, the anode preparation module,
and the equipment and spare parts, including transport to Zaire, will be
procured primarily through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance
with Bank's procurement guidelines. However, equipment and spare parts
amounting to about US$10 million, or about 9% of the proposed Bank loan amount
is to be procured through Limited International Bidding (LIB) from at least 4
suppliers from at least 3 different countries, to replace or serve existing mine
and plant equipment. This would include packages costing less than US$300,000,
up to US$3 million. In addition, approximately US$10 million, or about 9% of
the proposed Bank loan amount will be used for direct purchase of proprietary
equipment which will replace or add to proprietary equipment already operating
in the mines and plants. Equipment items are grouped into packages designed to
achieve maximum efficiency and economy under a complex financing package.



-48-
6.10      Training and technical studies.  Contracting for training staff will
be handled by the Training Department of Gecamines and will be done following
procedures acceptable to the Bank. All technical studies will be contracted
under Bank Guidelines.
6.11      Contract Review.  On the basis of Gecamines' list of procurement
packages, the Bank would do a prior review of bidding documents for packages
estimated to value more than US$300,000 each (representing about 98% of
equipment financing). Packages below US$300,000 would be subject to post review
by the Bank.
D.   Allocation and Disbursement of IBRD Loan

All expenditures will be fully documented except expenditures In respect of
contracts, purchase orders, or training programs valued at less than US$50,000
whlch should be covered by Statement of Expenditures. In order to ensure that
funds for the proposed Project would be made available when needed, a Special
Account to be operated by Gecamines would be established with an initial deposit
of US$5 million, which would be withdrawn after effectiveness. The account
would be replenished on the basis of documentary evidence, to be provided to the
Bank by Gecamines, of payments made from the account for goods and services
required for the Project. It is expected that the account would be used mainly
tor rcyments against the training and technical studies categories, and for
equipment packages costing less than US$1 million.
5.13      The disbursement profiles for the Project (Annex 6-3) are based on
estimates of order placements, payment schedules, and expected delivery times.
It differs from the standard country and industry profiles as the Project is a
rehabilitation project with limited erection work and an implementation period
considerably less than a greenfield project. The loan and credit are expected
to be fully disbursed by June 1992.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
7.01      Financial projections for Gecamines have been prepared in current
US$ terms based on (i) assumed copper production levels of 470,000 tons; (ii)
forecast capital and operating costs taking into account the productivity
Improvement and cost reduction impacts of the investment program; and (iii)
expected metal prices. The projections are based on a prevailing exchange rate
of Z 55 to the US dollar (Feb. 1986) and the following international inflation
assumptions.
International Inflation, 1986-95
1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991-95
Inflation Rate (Z p.a.)        7.0    7.0    7.5    7.7    7.6        4.5
The exchange rate of the Zaire currency to the US dollar is expected to develop
in line with the differential between international and local iu'iation, based
on the assumption that the Government will continue to implement its liberal
exchange rate policy.
A.   Revenues
7.02      The following copper, cobalt and zinc sales volumes are expected:



-50-
Gecamines - Metals Sales, 1985-95
(000 tonnes)
1985    1986    1987    1988    1989   1990 and after
Copper Sales       463     473      470     472      470      470
Cobalt Sales        10      10       10      10       11       12
Zinc Sales          64      65       65      65       65       65
Copper and zinc sales are based on the assumption of Gecamines' full capacity
production while cobalt sales are expected to remain at the relatively low level
of 10,000 tpy until 1988, given the depressed cobalt market, and to increase to
and remain at 12,000 tpy after 1990.  Sales revenues are the result of the
projected sales volumes and average metal price levels presented in Chapter
III. The price forecasts used for the projections are summarized below.

B.   Operating Costs
7.03      Operating cost projections are based on Gecamines' present cost
structure, and the expected development of the different cost categories as a
result of the Project. The principal assumptions are (i) reduction of
expatriate labor to about half its current level; (ii) increases from 2,500 to
3,600 of local supervisory staff and reduction of the local labor force by about
8Z over the next 10 years; (iii) increases of wages and salaries of supervisory
staff by 25% in real terms, and of the labor force by 50% over 10 years, coupled
with a reduction of fringe benefits reflected in a 15% decrease in costs for
services; (iv) an increase in consumables and spare parts costs in real terms by
10% over 5 years because of the impact of opening of new open-pits and mining at
increased depths; and (iv) increases In electricity rates by 5% in real terms
over the 10-year projection period. Although the Project includes measures for
cost reductions and productivity increases in concentrators and metallurgical
plants and for more efficient mining, average production costs in real terms are
expected to vary only little because of the cost increasing impact of opening of
new pits and of mining at continuously greater depths. Without the Project,
however, the production costs would have increased in real terms by about 2-3%
p.a.



-51-
C.   Financial Projections
7.04      Projections of Gecamines' financial performance for 1986-95 have been
prepared on the basis of detailed assumptions presented in Annex 7-1. Projected
financial statements are given in Annexes 7-2 through 7-4 and summarized
overleaf.  Gecamines is expected to remain a profitable operation throughout the
period, with profits after taxes increasing from US$36 million in 1985 (or 4% of
sales revenues) to US$105 million (or 7% of sales revenues) in 1990, and net
cash generation increasing from US$152 million in 1985 to US$258 million in
1990. Financial charges would increase moderately as a result of the financing
arrangements for the Project from US$21 million in 1985 to a peak of US$34
million in 1991. The projections also show continued strong capital and
liquidity positions, with debt to equity ratio remaining at all times below
15:85, the current ratio equal or higher than 3.0 and the quick ratio equal or
higher than 1.2. Debt service coverage ratio after taxes is expected to be
higher than 3.5 at all times; in addition, security arrangements outlined in
para. 6.07 establish a debt repayment mechanism which improves overall debt
service coverage.
7.05      Gecamines is expected to generate a substantial amount of cash, after
adequate levels of reinvestments and debt repayment, accumulating over US$305
million over the period 1986-90. While Gecamines has never paid dividends in
the past (except for 1984), Gecamines cash flow prospects indicate that it
should be, largely as a result of the investment proposed under the Project, in
a position to distribute dividends again in the coming years while maintaining a
sound financial structure. Dividend payments should take place only after
satisfactory liquidity, indebtedness and debt service ratios are met, and after
taking into account the copper and cobalt market risks, the Company's future
investment program, and the requirements to build up proper reserves for
long-term expansion plans. The Government and Gecamines have agreed to have a
study carried out and propose to the Bank by December 31, 1986 on appropriate
policy of dividends distribution which would, inter alia, determine (i) the
appropriate levels of capitalization and liquidity ratios; (ii) the appropriate
levels of statutory reserves; and (iii) the dividends (and form thereof)
payments allowable after taxation and creation of reserves. The proposal, after
Bank and Government approvals, should be implemented starting in fiscal year
1987.

D. Breakeven Analysis
7.06      Profit and cash breakeven prices have been calculated for copper on an
annual basis and are presented in the table below.

Note:  (a)  Under (a) the cash breakeven copper prices are calculated on the
basis of a prorata allocation of costs in accordance with the
products' shares in revenues.
(b) Under (b) the cash breakeven copper prices are calculated with full
crediting of co-products sales to copper.
Throughout the forecast period, Gecamines is expected to realize copper prices
above its profit breakeven point, providing a satisfactory cushion in the event
of a downturn of copper prices. Cobalt also plays an important role, since, as
a co-product, it considerably improves the Company's ability to sustain low
copper prices; this has been Gecamines' experience in the late 1970s (para.
4.36), when low cobalt sales levels and prices compounded an already difficult
copper situation and Gecamines was losing money as a result. It also emphasizes
the need for the Company to define a cobalt production and marketing strategy
that preserves this situation (para. 4.50).
E.   Sensitivity  Analysis
7.07      The favorable situation presented above would, of course, be
compromised if (i) the productivity increases and cost savings do not take place
as expected as a result of the Project, or take place with considerable delays;
(ii) copper revenues do not materialize because the targeted copper production
levels cannot be met or copper price decrease further in real terms; (iii)
Gecamines' cobalt sales revenues decrease as a result of uncarefully planned
marketing approach. Gecamines' future financial position has been examined
considering (i) a possible increase in production costs in real terms by 10%;
(ii) a decline in copper prices by 5 cents/lb until 1990; (iii) a production
decline by 35,000 tpy (from 470,000 tpy); (iv) a stabilization. of cobalt
production at 8,000 tpy (instead of 12,000 tpy); (v) and an increase in cobalt
prices by US$3/lb. The results are summarized below.

7.08      These indicators confirm  that the Company's financial situation is
likely to remain healthy even under difficult operational or market conditions.
The only exception is that of the sharp increase in production cost which would
seriously affect the Company's financial situation. It also highlights the need
to keep strict track of the parameters it controls most, namely its production
costs and its cobalt sales.  However, even if copper prices failed to recover as
expected during this period or if the cobalt market remained depressed, the
Company's internal cash generation would still be sufficient to finance its part
of the Project investments, as well as replacement investments, and maintenance
after the Project period.
F.   Financial Covenants
7.09      In order to ensure the necessary financing for the Project and
its completion in a sound manner, agreement was reached on the following financial
covenants.
(a)  from the Government
(i)  that it would ensure that Gecamines has adequate access to
sufficient foreign exchange to complete the Project and to
operate the Company (para. 4.39);
(ii)  t.at the financial relations between the Government and Gecamines
would be governed exclusively by the existing tax regime and by a
dividend policy acceptable to the Bank (paras. 4.31 and 7.05); and
(iii)  that it will abide by the financial covenants to ensure
Gecamines' viability and ability to implement the Project.



-55-
(b)  from Gecamines
(i) that it will prepare every year (a) 5-year financial projections,
including its foreign exchange and local currency requirements,
and (b) foreign exchange and local currency budgets on an annual
basis;
(ii) that, in any given year, it will not make capital investments,
i.e., additional to the slready approved Investment Program,
exceeding in aggregate US$15 million without prior Bank approval;
and
(iii) that it will maintain a current ratio of at least 1.3 and a Latio
of debt (excluding short-term maturities thereof) to equity of
not more than 40:60.
G.   Auditing and Reporting Requirements
7.10      All Gecamines companies would be requested to submit to the Bank
annual reports audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank within 4
months of the end of the accounting year. Gecamines has in the past been
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and no special
arrangements for selection of auditors have to be made. In addition to the
annual audit reports, Gecamines will submit quarterly financial statements
within 45 days after the end of each quarter and monthly project progress
reports and procurement status reports within three weeks of the end of each
quarter. Finally, within 6 months after the closing date for the Project,
Gecamines will prepare and furnish to the Bank a completion report on the
Project dealing with its Implementation, and the costs and benefits derived and
expected to be derived therefrom. Gecamines record of the last 10 years on
reporting to the Bank and alerting the Bank on potential problems has been
excellent and no problem is expected to comply with the Bank's requirements.
H.   Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Tests
7.11      The financial rate of return for the Project has been calculated on an
incremental basis in real terms. For assessment of the Project's results it was
assumed that without the Project, output even from viable and competitive
operations would decrease. The specific assumptions on production and cost
development without Project are subject to a considerable margin of uncertainty
depending on the adjustments to low investment levels by management, the
repercussions on Gecamines finances, and the impact on Zaire's balance of
payments and creditworthiness. The main assumption made here is that, should
the Project not be implemented, Gecamines' copper production would decrease at
1.5% p.a. from 465,000 tonnes in 1985 to about 437,000 tpy in 1990.
7.12      The cost and benefit streams in real terms have been prepared on the
basis of the financial projections presented, and are given in Annex 7-5. Based
on these assumptions, the incremental financial rate of return is 21% before
taxes and 16% after taxes.



-56-
7.13      Sensitivity Tests.  As could be expected from an incremental analysis,
the return is mostly sensitive to the assumptions made on the percentage decline
in production expected should the Project not be implemented. If this
percentage varies from 1.5% p.a. to 1% p.a. (447,000 tons in 1990), the return
decreases from 16% to 12%, demonstrating both the financial risks of the Project
and the limited validity of an incremental analysis when applied to a Project of
this nature. The return is less sensitive to copper price variations, operating
costs or investment costs.  Switching values have been calculated to equal the
return to 12% after tax for the most sensitive variables, and are presented
below in order of declining sensitivity.  The most critical variable is the
production level to be attained; with this clearly the main emphasis of the
Project and to a large extent under Gecamines' control, and on the basis of
Gecamines encouraging record of the last 3 years, the probability of the
switching values being reached is small in the 10-15% range. The Project's
return is also sensitive to metals prices over which Gecamines has little
(copper) or reasonably good control (cobalt). Because of this favorable
copper-cobalt mix, and assuming a rational approach to cobalt sales the overall
downside risk on sales receipts is also small in the 15-20% range, a very
favorable and in fact rather unique situation for a copper producer.

tax to 12%.
I.   Major Risks
7.14      The technical risks to the Project are small.  The rehabilitation and
replacement component is relatively straightforward in terms of teehnical design
and operation; it forms part of Gecamines' recurrent investment needs and has
taken adequately into account on-going operating arrangements.
7.15      As discussed in Chapter IV, while Gecamines is not expected to
encounter difficulties in marketing its copper production, it cannot be excluded
that copper prices decline more than has been assumed in the sensitivity
analysis in this Chapter and that cobalt prices and sales remain depressed.
Future copper price projections are subject to considerable uncertainty, and
while most experts expect some improvement, there remains a non-negligeable
probability (in the 20-25% range) that prices remain below the low copper price
scenario presented in para. 7.08. The risk on cobalt sales is to a greater
extent controllable by Gecamines and a prudent marketing strategy should
minimize this risk. However, given Gecamines' competitive cost structure and
generally high profitability, it is not considered to present a major problem
for Project implementation. The Project is not expected to influence the general
level of copper prices, as Gecamines is expected to maintain its present share
of around 7% of the international copper market.



-57-
7.16      One of the main financial risks for Gecamines is the resumption of
undue government interferences in marketing, introduction of additional tax
burdens, and demands for transfer of maximum amounts of net profits as dividends
without due regard to the Company's cash needs for operations and investment
financing. In order to minimize this risk, assurances would be sought from the
Government on clear financial relations with Gecamines governed by the existing
tax regime and a suitable dividend policy (paras. 4.3 and 7.05). In order to
provide an adequate base for assessment of its financial needs, the Company
would revise its financial projections annually and submit them to the
Government and the Bank for review (para. 7.09 (b)(i)). The risk of
insufficient access to foreign exchange is low because of the right of Gecamines
to retain 45Z of its sales revenues net of marketing expenditures from metals in
foreign currency to service its debt and cover its foreign exchange requirements
for operations and investments (para. 4.39). Lastly, the risk of inefficient
purchasing activities would be minimized through the creation of SONATRAD
(para. 4.58).
7.17      Finally, there is also a managerial risk in this Project.  The success
of the rehabilitation program depends heavily on the management whose task is to
implement the Project successfully and correct past practices that had led to a
deteriorating situation. In order to assure effective management, assurances
would be sought on Bank consultation before changes in the organization are made
(para. 4.02). Moreover, the training program should improve technical skills of
local employees and thus lay the basis for improvement, and for the successful
introduction of cost effective production methods. Finally, the Project's
success depends heavily on the Government's and Gecamines' commitment to
transform the agreed upon long-term objectives in a consistent action program.
Gecamines has agreed to prepare during the Project implementation period and
submit by December 1989 a draft of its next 5-year investment program for the
period 1991-1995, including the principal features of its program after 1995.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
8.01      The Project is an important element of the Government's objective to
improve Zaire's balance of payments through continuing export and foreign
exchange earnings. Gecamines' continued ability to generate foreign exchange is
essential to support the Government's strategy of diversification of its
economic structure, attract foreign capital, and permit economic growth.
Gecamines is expected to generate in current terms a total of US$5.8 billion
gross foreign exchange over the next 5 years (or US$1.2 billion p.a. on the
average), which is expected to continue to represent over 55% of the country's
foreign exchange earnings. On a net basis, the net foreign inflow would amount
to US$3.2 billion over the next 5 years (or US$0.6 billion p.a. on the average),
after taking into account on the one hand foreign loan disbursements (US$0.3
billion), and, on the other, foreign exchange expenditures for capital
investments (US$0.4 billion), operating costs (US$2.3 billion), and debt
servicing (US$0.2 billion).

A.   Economic Rate of Return
8.02      The economic rate of return of the Project has been calculated in real
terms, on an incremental basis based on the streams given in Annex 8-1.  The
economic cost and benefit streams are measured from the viewpoint of the economy
as a whole, and have been adjusted to reflect distortions in the market prices
of the project inputs and outputs. They have been based on the same assumptions
used for the financial return, except for the exclusion of all identifiable
taxes, as a standard conversion factor of 1 was applied, which assumes that the
Government would continue to apply exchange rate and tariff policies which would
eliminate distortions between international and domestic price levels. As
expected for a project of this nature, the economic rate of return is high
amounting to 24%. As in the case of the financial return, the economic return
is most sensitive to the without-Project production levels. Should the Project
prevent a drop in production of only 1% p.a. during 1986-90, instead of 1.5Z
p.a., the return would still be acceptable at 17%. As the financial return, the
economic return is less sensitive to variations in revenues, operating costs,
and investment costs.
B.   Foreign Exchange Benefits
8.03      The net foreign exchange benefits of the Project are high since
Gecamines generates 10OZ foreign exchange from export sales of copper, cobalt,
and zinc; and about 45% of its cost, in addition to the service of foreign debt,
is in foreign exchange.
8.04      Incremental foreign exchange benefits have been calculated based on
the streams for the incremental financial rate of return plus debt-service on
foreign financing. Metal revenues have been calculated as 100% foreign
exchange, as practically all incremental production will be exported. The
foreign exchange portion of operations and capital costs include the direct and
indirect foreign exchange costs. The total foreign exchange portion for
operating and capital costs are about 45% and 60%, respectively. The resulting
incremental net foreign exchange benefits of the Project are considerable,
averaging about US$66 million p.a. in current terms over the next 5 years (Annex
8-2).
C.   Other Benefits
8.05      Other macro-economic benefits are the financial revenues which will
accrue to the Government (income and other taxes). On the basis of the present
taxation system, during the next 5 years, Gecamines is expected to pay about
US$0.9 billion in direct and indirect taxes, (or US$180 million p.a.), of which
US$0.4 billion in export and corporate taxes and US$0.5 billion in other taxes
including import duties. Substantial additional benefits could accrue to the
Government from dividend payments.
8.06      As a part of the institution building effort, training programs
will be instituted for Gecamines.   The unquantifiable economic benefits of
training add to the attractiveness of the Project. Finally, the Bank will be
working closely with Gecamines to help prepare a sound investment program for
its long-term development.

ZAIRE - GECAMINES REHABILITATION PROJECT
NON-COPPER MINING ACTIVITIES
Diamonds
1.        Zaire is the world's leading industrial diamond producer, accounting
in 1984 for 29% in volume of world mine production.  This industry has been an
important earner of foreign exchange, contributing between 4X (1981) and 13%
(1984) of Zaire's foreign exchange earnings over the past decade. Diamond
extractiot is carried out in two ways: industrial production by the Societe
Niniare de Bakwanga (MIBA), a state-owned company managed by the Societe
d'Entreprise et d'Investissements which also owns 20Z of MIBA.1/ Between 1978
and 1982, exports from MIRA deposits at Mbuji-Mayi in the Kasai Oriental
province represented approximately 881 of Zaire's total officially recorded
diamond exports. Individual prospectors account for the rest of Zaire's
diamonds production: artisanal diggers operate near Tshikapa in Kasai Oriental
and illicit mining on the MIBA concession also occupies some 15,000 people.
Officials of that company estimate that in the past up to 5 million carats of
industrial diamonds have been smuggled out of its concession area annually and
sold illegally. Total recorded production more than tripled from 6 million
carats in 1982 to 18.5 million carats in 1984, with MIBA's production growing
from 5.7 to 7.0 million carats during that period and the remainder being
produced by artisans.
2.        Although diamond mining is by far not as important overall as copper,
its impact on the regional economy in Kasai Oriental is substantial as it
provides the base of living for at least 100,000 people. Although MIBA's
activities declined until 1982, small-scale mining induced by illicit trade and
subsequently the Government's liberalization of private diamond purchases may
well have couLterbalanced this company's decreasing importance and contributed
to maintaining an economic boom in the area around Mbuji Mayi which is estimated
to be among Zaire's fastest growing cities.
Gold
3.        A state-owned company, the Office des Mines d'Or de Kilo-Moto, is the
most important gold producer in Zaire. Other producers include Societe Miniere
et Industrielle de Kivu (SOMINKI) and Gecamines. Kilo-Moto operates several
mines in a remote area near the Uganda and Sudan borders in the Haut-Zaire
province, and faces serious logistical problems. Its output has declined
steadily from about 4 tonnes in 1968 less than one tonne in 1980, mostly on
account of management weaknesses, departure of expatriates, obsolete equipment,
1/   This public limited liability company registered in Belgium, is
controlled by Societe Generale de Belgique, which owns 53% of the
share capital; De Beers Consolidated Mines owns 19%.

-63-                           Page 2 of 2
and lack of imported raw materials and spare parts, but admittedly the
production may have been higher and exported illegally. The gold produced by
Kilo-Moto is refined at Hoboken (Belgium) and sold by Its own office in
Brussels. Kilo-Moto's reserves are estimated at approximately 90 tonnes, or 2.9
million troy ounces of gold. A reversal of the sharp decline in Kilo-Moto's
output calls for the development of new reserves; the replacement of the
obsolete processing facility; and changes to the marketing arrangements
presently in effect.
Manganese
4.        Since the closure in 1975 of the Benguela railways, its sole viable
export route, the state-owned company, Soci&te Miniere de Kisenge (SMK) has
considerably reduced manganese ore production and stopped ore shipments, in
effect building up ore inventories. Since the technical reopening of the
railways in July 1979, a few tonnes of manganese have been shipped: some 21,000
tonnes arrived at Lobito (Angola), between April 1979 and April, 1981. At the
beginning of July 1984, the company had a total stock of over 1 million tonnes
of manganese ore awaiting export. The 500 workers still on the payroll of the
company are subsidized by the Government. The company is reportedly considering
building a refinery which would convert the manganese carbonate into electrolyte
manganese oxide for battery manufacture.
Tin
5.        Societe Miniare et Industrielle du Kivu (SOMINKI), a joint venture of
the Government of Zaire (28%) and Cogemin (72%), of the Belgo-French Empain
group, is a company based in the Kivu province which produces mainly
cassiterite, but also some gold, wolframite, columbo-tantalite and monazite.
The company is also acting on behalf of SOMIKIVU (90% owned by the U.S.-based
Metallurgy Mining Group and 10% by the Empain group) in order to exploit
deposits of niobium (used in nuclear reactors) in Kivu.
6.        Societe ZAIRETAIN is a tin and tungsten producer in the Northern Shaba
province which is owned 50% by the Government and 50Z by Geomines Cie, of
Belgium. ZAIRETAIN has encountered increasing difficulties in recent years
because of lack of exploration work, depletion of secondary, weathered ore and
technical difficulties in crushing and grinding the underlying primary ore, and
insufficient availability of foreign exchange for operational equipment supplies
and spare parts, and investments. Additional adverse factors have been
increasing restrictions in expatriate employment, insufficient training of
Zairians to take over their positions, and low attractiveness of the company's
location.

THE ZINC MARKET
1.        World reserves of zinc are estimated at 162 million tonnes
(contained metal), of which 61 million tonnes (38Z) are located in Australia,
Canada and the USA. The remaining reserves are w:dely distributed in many
countries. In addition 163 million tonnes of resources are known. Zinc is
commonly found in association with other metals, with 60X and 10% of mine
production obtained from zinc-lead ores and zinc-copper ores, respectively.
2.        The following table summarizes the recent development of zinc

As shown in the above table, Canada, Australia, and the United
States accounted for 43Z of world mine production in 1983, and other
industrialized countries accounted for another 25%.  Developing countries
accounted for 32%, with Peru contributing the major share of 11%. Three
countries - Australia, Canada, and Peru accounted for 55% of the zinc ore
export trade. Secondary production from old scrap is relatively small
compared to other metals, estimated at 5Z of refined production.



ANNEX 3-1

3.        World zinc production grew strongly in the 1960's but stagnated in
the 1970's. New capacity came on stream, particularly in the Tara mine in
Ireland and the Rubilas in Spain, in the mid-seventies, resulting in lower
overall capacity utlllzation (80-85%) in the late seventies. However, mlne
production was limited by strikes in North America and Ireland from 1979 to
1981, preventing a build-up in concentrate stocks. Zinc mining capacity is
largely controlled by eight companies holding directly and indirectly over
fifty percent of mining capacity.  During periods of low prices, mine
production is as a result more readily adjusted to demand than is the case
for other metals. Discoveries of large zinc deposits, in recent years should
assure an adequate supply, although some of these deposits require prices
which are considerably higher than recent levels, to be viable.
4.        There has been a shift in zinc refining to producing countries away
from consuming countries, resulting in a surplus of refining capacity and
closure of older facilities, particularly in the USA. Host of the newer
plants are based on electrolytic processes, which now represent 75% of
refining capacity, as opposed to 25% for pyrometallurgical plants.

5.        The major uses of zinc are in galvanizing (40% of consumption) aa a
protective coating for steel products; die castings (20%) for automotive and
other hardware; and brass products (20%) In plumbing, electrical, and other
applications. Use in galvanizing has expanded but growth has been restrained
by development of new processes, such as electrogalvanizing which permit more
efficient use of zinc. With downsizing of automobiles during the seventies,
zinc lost market share to plastics, but development of thin wall diecastings
which are lighter and of higher quality than plastics arrested the
downtrend. Other uses of zinc include zinc oxides in rubber products, and in
other chemicals, rolled zinc in dry cell batteries, and recently in coinage.
6.        Zinc consumption grew strongly during the sixties, but stagnated
from the mid-seventies to the early eighties due to lower consumption in
automotive uses, and more efficient use of zinc in many applications. Zinc
consumption is concentrated in the transportation and construction
industries, and their cyclical nature makes for volatile demand on a year to
year basis. Growth in demand is projected to average 2.3% during the
1985-1995 period.

ANNEX 4-3
ZAIRE - GECAMINES REHABILITATION PROJECT
GECAMINES/EXPLOITATION MANPOWER AND TRAINING
I. Gecamines' Staffing Situation
1.        Number of staff.  In May 1985 GCM had a staff of 36,787, made up
of 162 directors (directeuro), 1,248 managerial staff (cadres), 1,779
supervisory staff (agents de analtrise) and 33,598 workers (agents
d'execution) (Table 1). Expatriate staff numbered 648, i.e. 1.8% of the
company's total staff. This number was made up of 81 directors compared to
81 Zairian, 368 managerial staff compared to 880 Zairian, and 199
supervisory staff compared to 1,580 Zairian. In 1984 expatriate salaries
(before tax) and benefits accounted for 27.69% of total labor costs. This
created a serious problem at GCM, which came under heavy Government
pressure to cut back rapidly on the number of expatriates, not to mention
the internal complications of having two quite different salary systems for
the same level of responsibility.
2.        The GC4 Management plans to cut the number of expatriates by 5-6%
each year. As most of them occupy key posts their replacement with
Zairians is proving extremely difficult. In order to carry this out with
as little upheaval as possible, steps should be taken to identify Zairian
staff who show potential, organize virtually -tailor-made' training for
them, and conduct periodic evaluations of their performance, which could
perhaps be done while the expatriates are away on leave. So far there has
been no sign of such a program. Most expatriate departures seem to have
been decided on in a hurry and in response to political pressure rather
than in accordance with a pre-established plan based on service
priorities. There has therefore been a feeling of insecurity and
bitterness among expatriates, many of whom have helped to ensure the smooth
running of the Company for years.
3.        Salary structure.  GCM staff are, in general, by far the best
paid compared with other public or private sectors in Zaire. Because of
the austerity measures imposed by the Government, however, basic salaries
have not kept pace with the rate of inflation in the past five years.
Following the example of other State corporations, the GC4 Management has
therefore had to increase its contribution in the form of allowances and
benefits paid and provided. Total monetary pay accounts, on average, for
only 47.7% of total labor costs compared to 52.32 for benefits paid and
provided by the Company. For workers, in particular, monetary pay
represented 30% of total pay for this category of staff in 1984, while
social benefits accounted for 70Z.  Aware --f this siLuQ_inn, the Management
wanted to correct these distortions, the harmful consequences of which have
already begun to appear. In several cases there are reports of a decline
in motivation, an increase in absenteeism, a relaxation in discipline and
less respect for the production equipment. A new pay system is under
study, which would be based on the responsibilities of the post occupied,
production performance and respect for the equipment. Because of political



ANNEX 4-3
-71-                         Page 2 of 9
constraints, however, GCH's room to maneuver in terms of wage policy will
remain extremely limited:  motivation for better productivity cannot be
translated into substantial increases as long as the social benefits
received constitute the bulk of total pay.
4.        Training level of workers. In July 1984 the operating personnel
(main-d'oeuvre d'execution - MOE) or workers comprised 7,915 laborers
(241), 19,211 semi-skilled workers (57Z), 5,137 skilled workers (15X) and
1,281 highly skilled workers (4Z), i.e. 33,544 workers in all; 11% of these
were trained at technical schools, 89% were trained either on the job or at
company training centers (Table 2). Semi-skilled workers therefore account
for the bulk of the operating personnel. To upgrade the skill level of
these workers the concept of in-house training would have to be radically
revised, since it is not at present geared to technological development or
to the labor structure of a company expected to compete wi-. other
international companies. Such a revision would have' to meet the following
criteria: (i) comply with long-term production goals; (ii) establish
cohesion among the different training courses within a trade or group of
trades; and (iii) encourage young staff with a certain level of training to
take part in advanced training courses through a realistic motivation
policy, guaranteeing them career development opportunities.
5.        Age of staff.  Most of the Zairian managerial staff are in the
31-40 age bracket; there are 23,500 staff under 41, i.e. 651 of the total
staff (Table 3). If retirement age were set at 59 there would be ?0
departures of African managerial staff, about 2,000 departures of workers
and 114 departures of expatriate managerial staff between now and  .89.
The departures of Zairian staff will not cause much of a problem. n fact
the departure of those in the worker category is even desirable, since this
will enable GCM to replace poorly trained workers with low productivity
with young people who are better educated and more adaptable to
technological change. According to labor legislation in Zaire, however,
employees who reach the age of 59 are entitled to retire but cannot be
forced to retire without their consent. GCH has approached the Department
of Labor and Social Welfare with a view to obtaining the right to terminate
staff whose work is no longer satisfactory at age 59. There is little hope
of these steps proving successful, given the large package of social
benefits offered to active staff and the difficulties encountered by the
State-run Pension Fund (Caisse de Pension) in meeting its commitments
vis-A-vis pensioned workers.
II. Personnel Management
6.        The Personnel Directorate, which was reorganized in 1982, is
divided into two departments: the Personnel Management Department and the
Staff Training Department. This new structure is characterized by: (i) the
addition of two new divisions, i.e. the Manpower Planning and Control
Division (Division de la Planification et du Contr8le des Effectifs) and
the Professi.2nal Qualification and Promotion Division (Division de la
Qualification et de la Promotion Professionnelles); (ii) the



-72-                          ANNEX 4-3
Page 3 of 9
decentralization of decision-making with regard to personnel management at
the different levels of responsibility, in accordance with a set of
regulations prepared for the purpose; and (iii) the incorporation of
training within personnel management through the establishment of the Staff
Training Department.
7.        Manpower planning is now an integral part of the Company's
overall planning and management. Managers at the production unit level are
required to forecast their manpower needs and to prepare their manpower
plans, in terms of activity and production programs, in accordance with the
policies and rules governing the creation or elimination of posts. At the
central level the Manpower Planning and Control Division studies and, if
necessary, revises the manpower plans proposed by the production units and
is in charge of monitoring and supervising their implementation.
8.        The Professional Qualification and Promotion Division is
responsible for conducting qualitative staff evaluations. It is
responsible for: (i)'updating job classifications, (ii) establishing
standards for professional qualifications for each category of staff, (iii)
organizing evaluation tests for switching from one category to another, and
(iv) ensuring the best possible match between staff and jobs.
9.        Based on a comparison of the internal supply of staff and the
Company's quantitative and qualitative needs, the central personnel
departments are able to prepare recruitment, training, career development
and succession programs. Training is therefore no longer an isolated
activity; instead, it is incorporated within production, plays a role in
improving productivity and, at the same time, aims at giving every employee
the opportunity to progress in his career.
10.       The existence of the new structure undoubtedly makes it easier to
control the staffing situation and ensure a fairer and more rational use of
human resources. Some major moves have also been made by the Management,
viz: (i) the establishment of the Manpower Committee chaired by the
President/Managing Director of the Company, whose mandate consists of
formulating general policy for training and retraining and examining key
strategies and policies for personnel administration and management; (ii)
the adoption of new rules and procedures and the assignment and hiring of
staff to make management more clear-cut and less arbitrary; (iii) the
appointment of personnel management department heads to all operating
centers and to the main functional departments.
11.       These efforts are indicative of the desire of the Directorate to
give the Company a personnel management system that is both coherent and
effective. At the organizational level the results are visibly
significant. It will take another two years at least, however, before the
system which has been put in place can really become operational.
Procedures for the processing of personnel statistics have not yet been
fully mastered, since the data are not yet being presented in a usable
format, which could periodically provide managers with an accurate and
complete set of performance indicators. The manpower plans have been



-73-                          ANNEX 4-3
Page 4 of 9
prepared on the basis of the annual needs of each production unit but the
quality of this work varies from one unit to the next and the 12-month time
frame does not give sufficient scope to prepare a long-term training plan
aimed at the supervisory staff and the highly skilled staff. The personnel
department heads do not all have the necessary training or the experience
and know-how needed to handle the role of manpower planner and training
coordinator. The job classification prepared some twenty years ago is also
in the process of revision. The Professional Qualification and Promotion
Division, led by a top-level expatriate expert, does not have sufficient
trained staff to accomplish this important and tedious operation while at
the same time fully assuming the responsibilities outlined in paragraph 8.
Technical assistance would be needed to remedy this situation. The main
purpose of such assistance would be to help to prepare the methodology used
to classified GCM jobs and to train the national analysts responsible for
continuing this work.
III. Training at Gecamines
12.       Vocational training at GCM comprises: Ci) classroom instruction,
(ii) technicel in-house training, (iii) training for managerial and
supervisory personnel, (iv) traineeships (stages) abroad. All this
training is administered at the central level by the Staff Training
Department. This department also manages the Centre de Formation des
Cadres et des Agents de la MaItrise - CFC (Training Center for Managerial
and Supervisory Personnel), the Institut Technique de Mutoshi - UMT
(Mutoshi Technical Institute), and the Technical Training Division.
Proposals have been made at appraisal, which would make the organization of
training more efficient and coherent. They consist in: (i) merging the
,-utoshi Technical Institute with the Technical Training Division, which
already supervises the vocational institutes and in-house training; (ii)
establishing two new units, one of which would be in charge of technical
training for managerial personnel, the other being responsible for training
planning at GCM.
13.       Classroom instruction.  Classroom instruction is provided by a
network of establishments comprising:
(i)  The Mutoshi Technical Institute, which trains A2 level
technicians (five years after orientation cycle) in electronics
and general mechanical engineering and A3 level skilled workers
(three years after orientation cycle) in mining, maintenance
engineering and metallurgy. There are a total of 800 students
for the two levels and, on average, it produces 50 A2 and 50 A3
graduates each year. The curricula are those established by the
State but the quality of the teaching is far superior to that in
the public schools. The success rate in the State examinations
is by far the highest in the Shaba Region and even in the
country. This success is attributable to several factors: (i)
the teachers (instructors) are better trained and better paid --
generally 10-15 times better paid than State teachers; (ii)
enrollment is based on the establishment's capacity and entry is



ANNEX 4-3
Page 5 of 9
more carefully screened; (iii) the operating allocations to GCK
schools are based on their needs, unlike the situatlon in the
public schools. However, although 80-90% of the A3 graduates are
hired by GCM, more than 70Z of the A2 graduates set their sights
on higher education. In the long term, GCM, with its competitive
salary structure, should be able to recover these students after
they liave completed their university training. The short-term
goal fo. the A2 cycle cannot, however, be said to have been
achieved, since it has not proved very profitable in economic
terms.
(il) The seven vocational institutes (three in Kolwezi, one each in
Kambove, Lubumbashi, Likasi and Kipushi). Enrollment in these
schools is about 1,600, with approximately 300 graduating each
year. These graduates must take entrance tests before being
hired by the Company, which accepts 80X on average; this figure
still does not meet the Company's needs for workers. The
standard of teaching is good but there is still room for
improvement. While the general courses have oeen taught by
teachers with a university degree, two-thirds of the teachers of
technical subjects are from the worker category. GCM should take
steps to hire qualified teachers who have graduated from the
Instituts Superieurs Pedagogiques Techniques, one of which is
located in Likasi and was financed by the Third Education Project
sponsored by the World Bank.
14.      Technical in-house training.  The in-house training is designed
for the workers. It is given at the centers attached, on a hierarchical
and operational basis, to each major production unit. There are 14 centers
in all, which provide advanced training to some 3,000 staff each year. In
1984, 3,300 staff were invited to take advanced training and the average
length of training for each trainee was 170 hours. This technical training
was primarily a requirement for the promotion of workers to supervisory
posts (500 promotions in 10 years) and for the promotion of workers to the
highly skilled category (495 promotions in 10 years). Since 1982 there has
been a unit (the In-House Training Monitoring Unit) within the Technical
Training Division to keep track of in-house training activities by
production unit and to help standardize the format for technical training
courses. There still remains much to be done to improve this program. The
training methods and programs vary from one center to another. The
instructors are not hired on the basis of uniform criteria. There is a
lack of modern teaching equipment in some centers and existing equipment Is
outdated. The personnel department heads are, in theory, responsible for
monitoring the effectiveness of the training by obtaining as much data as
possible from the production units. But they do not yet have the
experience needed to perform this role effectively. Finally, there is
still no in-house training policy geared to long-term production and career
development goals. The training programs are not prepared from a global
standpoint based on an in-depth study of trades or occupations and their
development. At the technical level the programs are not divided into
units which would enable the most capable personnel to gradually improve
themselves.



ANNEX 4-3
Page 6 of 9
15.       Training of managerial and supervisory personnel. This training
is given at the Centre de Formation des Cadres et des Agents de MaItrise -
CFC (Training Center for Managerial and Supervisory Personnel).
Established in 1981, this center has received special attention from
Management. The reasons for this are: (i) the rapid increase in the
percentage of African staff, which is expected to go from 76% to 85% by the
end of 1989; and (il) the inclusion of 930 Zairians at the supervisory
level in the past five years, 500 of whom require retraining. The training
given at CFC comprises: (i) courses up to the first and second supervisory
level; (ii) training for young university graduates in preparation for
their role as department heads; (iii) the retraining of department heads;
and (iv) seminars for directors. A complete training cycle comprises
theoretical courses interspersed with periods of practical training on the
job. The length of the cycle depends on the level of the training;
generally the duration varies from two to six months. The young university
students also are the subject of special monitoring by an integration
unit. The training programs prepared especially for them comprise three
phases: (i) the initiation phase, organized in the third and fourth
university year during vacations; (ii) the integration phase, which begins
with the hiring, for a probationary period of two years, of university
graduates; and (iii) the temporary assignment phase, organized for those
hired permanently by the Company on completion of the integration period.
16.       The Center has trained 473 staff members since it opened, 290 of
them supervisory staff, 86 department heads and 97 directors. The
last-mentioned have attended two short seminars led by a consultant
provided under the technical assistance scheme financed by the World Bank.
The Center's results seem very encouraging, despite certain weaknesses,
which are discussed later on. An overall evaluation should be made of this
program, however, with a view to making it even better suited to the
Company's needs before launching the second phase of its development.
17.       Several points need to be kept in mind to impruve the training of
managerial personnel: i) the management training given by the CFC should
be supplemented by technical training adapted to each field of
specialization, this being urgently needed because of rapid technological
development and the deterioration in the quality of the training given in
the Facultes Polytechniques; (ii) a study of the training needs of
managerial and supervisory staff should not be limited to the opinions
"xpressed by the production unit heads; it should be based on staff
,erformance evaluations, on the one hand, and on an in-depth study of the
manpower situation, on the other, from the point of view of age and skill
distribution and reductions in expatriate manpower and the replacement of
retirees; (iii) the teaching staff at CFC needs to be strengthened and
retrained; although this staff has an average service of eight years with
GCM and eight to ten years' teaching experience, their management know-how
is limited to theoretical knowledge and to the technical assistance support
received by the Center; (iv) finally, one cf the main weaknesses lies in
the coordination of the practical training (stages) in the production
units, which is handled by a team made up of five people, three of whom
have no experience in operations. Apart from these flaws, CFC's activities



ANNEX 4-3
-76-                          Page 7 of 9
are generally successful and its competence was recently confirmed by the
adoption of new personnel management procedures, whereby one of the
prerequisites for the promotion of managerial and supervisory staff will be
the successful completion of training at CFC.
IV. Program of Action for 1986-90
18.       At the present time GCM has the data and human resources only for
the preparation of annual manpower programs. The quality of the
preparation also varies from one production unit to another. In the
absence of any medium-term plan for manpower development and training, a
program of action has been prepared by GCM along the following lines:
(i)  The level of expertise of the managerial personnel should be
improved or maintained during the period in qniestion; there are
also plans to increase the number of managerial/supervisory
personnel at the works level, while cutting back the number of
managerial personnel in the departments and in the Company's
social programs.  The total number of manr -erial/supervisory
personnel will go from 3,000 to 3,700 by the end of 1990, mainly
through internal promotion.
(ii)  During this same period the number of expatriate personnel will
drop from 648 to 460.
(ii)  The total number of workers will fall by 2X per annum, while the
Company plans to upgrade the skill level of the semi-skilled and
skilled category by developing in-house training.
19.       With regard to personnel management, G04 should for an initial
period (two years) take steps to accomplish the following: (i) establish
job descriptions for supervisory posts in terms of the programs and
activities planned, together with the professional requirements for these
posts; (ii) complete a detailed inventory of managerial and supervisory
personnel; (iii) complete the formulation of mechanisms, procedures and
rules for personnel management and introduce these at the production unit
level; (iv) train personnel management staff and initiate them in the
manpower planning process; (v) strengthen personnel departments at the
central level (production units) through the hiring of training
specialists. Special attention should also be paid to revising the
classifications, since these are no longer consistent with changes that
have occurred in the trades and professions, and to formulating the
methodology used for personnel evaluation.
20.       It is expected that by the end of this initial phase the
personnal management structures will be capable of functioning normally,
effectively implementing the decentralization policy, furnishing precise
data on the manpower situation of each unit, and forecasting its
medium-term development.  It should be possible to prepare a preliminary
medium-term manpower development plan in 1987 on the basis of these data
and to identify manpower needs according to production and activity

programs. This plan would have to be adjusted periodically, however, as
and when the Professional Qualification and Promotion Division, with the
help of technical assistance, prepares the methodology to be used for job
classification and personnel evaluation.
21.       With regard to training, the following measures should be
adopted:
-    Strengthening of the organizational structure at the central
level. Two new units should be established: the Training
Planning Unit, which would be responsible for (i) collecting and
processing all data on training needs, and (ii) investigating the
need to boost and assign manpower, equipment and financial
resources in order to accomplish the Company's established goals;
the Managerial Level Technical Training Unit, which would be
responsible for studying and proposing a policy and plan for the
technical training of managerial level personnel and for
coordinating all managerial level training activities both abroad
and in Zaire. The Inspection Department should also be
strengthened and would be responsible, among other things, for
arranging for the retraining of instructors in conjunction with
CFC, investigating the use of new teaching equipment,
periodically revising, with the assistance of professional
committees, the content of curricula (study programs) and
monitoring the implementation of new teaching methods.
-    Improving the training of managerial personnel:  this activity
would be considered a top priority. An evaluation of CFC's
performance would be made to identify its weaknesses from an
organizational, technical and manpower standpoint, new strategies
would be proposed and recommendations would be prepared for a
program of action for the Center for the next five years. This
evaluation could be conducted by the same consultant who helped
with the start-up of CFC. It would be advisable for this
exercise to be carried out with the assistance of CENACOF (Centre
National de la Coordination de la Formation au Developpement),
given I's expertise in training techniques, with a view to (i)
utilizing the manpower resources available in Zaire, and (ii)
obtaining a more impartial view of the results achieved by CFC.
Arrangements should be made for CFC personnel to attend training
courses (stages) abroad in business management and organization;
combined with their professional experience, this training would
enable them to enrich their teaching skills and might help them
to play the role of training and management advisors. Finally,
the team responsible for monitoring the practical training
courses (stages) in the production centers would be strengthened
by the addition of personnel with experience in operations and
with prior training in communication skills.
22.       With regard to technical training for managerial and personnel,
emphasis would be placed on special training seminars for each field of
specialization. These 2-4 four-week seminars would be organized within GCM



ANNEX 4-3
-78-                          Page 9 of 9
and would be led either by highly qualified company engineers or with the
assistance of specialists provided in part through World Bank financing.
It would be important here to call upon sectoral evaluation and training
committees'/ to work with CFC and the Managerial Level Technical Training
Unit in prewparing training programs and establishing requirements for
lecturers. The second component would consist of organizing practical
training courses (stages) abroad designed either for fields of
specialization for which it would be difficult to organize seminars in
Zaire, or for top-level managerial staff whose knowledge needs to be
updated periodically in order to keep up with developments in the Company's
operations and organization. During this period a study will be conducted
into the feasibility of establishing a technical training center for
managerial and supervisory personnel and to establish other financial,
technical and human aspects of the project.
-    In-house training for workers:  this training should be stepped
up and reorganized. The training activities will no longer be
"isolated." The programs should be studied in their entirety,
with common-core courses for all the sub-groups or trade groups
and with an identification of the various skill or qualification
levels to permit transition from one level to the next. The
planning work could be assigned to evaluation and training
committees organized by sector, which would map out the general
outlines before the actual work of program formulation is
assigned to professional trade committees, under the leadership
of the Technical Training Division. Implementation would, in
accordance with the principle of decentralization, be monitored
by the Personnel Department at the level of each plant, but would
also be closely supervised by the Technical Training Division in
order to guarantee the quality and uniform standard of the
training. Finally, the financing for this project would be used
to renew the teaching materials and equipment and to make it
compatible with the requirements of modern technology,
particularly in the case of hydraulic and pneumatic equipment and
electric controls. It is essential for in-house training centers
to have more say in organizing seminars in communications and
training methods for technicians skilled in production with a
view to strengthening the training corps and ensuring the more
effective monitoring of trainees (stagiaires) in their place of
work. In view of these new responsibilities, the Division for
the Monitoring of In-House Training should hire new experienced
specialists to closely monitor the activities of each center.

maintenance and workshops, functional services, and operations.

ZAIRE - GECAMINES REHABILITATION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A.   Inflation
1.        Since the financial projections have been carried out in current US
dollar terms, orojected international inflation rates have been applied as
follows:
Inflation Rates
(Z p.a.)
1986      1987      1988       1989      1990       1991-92
7.0       7.0       7.5        7.7       7.6          4.5
B.   Sales
2.   Sales volumes during the period 1985-88 have been forecast to fluctuate
around 470,000 tpy of copper in accordance with Gecaminest own estimates.
Thereafter sales are assumed to stabilize at 470,000 tpy. Cobalt sales have
been assumed to amount to 10,000 tpy until 1988 to increase to 11,000 tpy in
1989, 12,000 tpy in 1990 and to remain at that level thereafter. Zinc sales
have been assumed to fluctuate around 64,000 tpy until 1988, based on
Gecamines' own estimates, and to remain constant at that level thereafter.
C.   Investments
3.        Gecamines' investment program is expected to cover all investment
needs of the Company until 1989. Thereafter reinvestment levels have been
assumed of about 10X of Gecamines' annual revenues.  Depreciation assumptions
are based on Gecamines' practice of linear depreciation which is applied for
major investment categories as follows:
Buildings                                 30 years
Mining Equipment                         4-8 years
Vehicles                                5-10 years
Railway infrastructure and equipment  10-30 years
Other materials and equipment          10-20 years
Mine development                            5 years
Studies and prospection                     1 year
D.   Costs
4.        All elements of production costs have been estimated at their
predicted 1985 values. The following assumptions have been made for the
different cost items:



-103-                           ANNEX 7-1
Page 2  of 3
(a)  Labor:  (i) decrease o' the number of expatriates from about 660 in
1985 to about 380 in 1992; real salary increase of 1.8% p.a.;
(ii) increase oZ the number of the Zairian supervisory staff from
about 2,500 in 1985 to about 3,600 in 1992; real salary increase of
2.2% p.a.; (iii) decrease of the labor force from about 32,250 in
1985 to 30,000 in 1988 and stabilization at that level; real wage
increase of 4% p.a. but reduction of fringe benefits which would
bring the increase of total remuneration to about 2.5% p.a.
(b)  C=sumables and spare parts:  increase of 2.5Z p.a. in real terms
until 1990 because of opening up of new mines and mining in greater
depth.
(c)  Electricity:  cost increase of about 1% p.a. due to expected tariff
increases for electricity supplied through Inga-Shaba line.
(d)  Services:  decrease by 1.5% p.a. in real terms principally because
of reduction of fringe benefits for Gecamines' personnel.
(e) Taxes: indirect taxes not included in cost items have been assumed
to remain unchanged in real teL D. The royalty (part of corporaLe
income tax) has been calculated at 7% of metal revenues and
additional corporate tax payments were added when in years during
which the royalty amounts to less than Gecamines' corporate tax
dues (50% of gross income).
(f) Marketing Costs
(i) Transport costs in Zaire:  costs were assumed to remain
unchanged in real terms;
(ii) Land Transport in Africa: costs were assumed to increase by
4% p.a.;
(iii) Maritime Transport: costs were assumed to remain unchanged in
real terms;
(iv) Refining Costs: were assumed to decrease by 14% p.a. over
five years and to stabilize thereafter, to reflect more
favorable refining terms aCnieved through diversification of
refiners.
(v)  Commissions:  were assumed to decrease from 1.4% of copper
sales revenues in 1985 to 1.2% in 1986; for cobalt from 8.4%
in 1984 to 4.5% in 1985 and 3.5% in 1986; for zinc from 2.Z%
in 1984 to 1.4% in 1985 and 1.2% in 1986.

Page 3 of 3
(g)  Financial Cges
(i) Interest: interest on existing loans was predicted on the
basis of Gecaminea' forecasts and interest on new loans was
calculated at an average 10% of the outstanding loan balance,
and a comitment fee of 1% of the average undisbursed balance
was added;
(ii) Ewxort fees: 1.3% of part of sales revenues (55%) retroceded
to Gecamines in Zaire currency.
E. Balance Sheet, Working Capital and Funds Flow
(a)  Current assets:  operating cash has been estimated at about 3.5
months of wage and salary payments and has been assumed to remain
at that level throughout the period. Receivables for sales have
been assumed to decrease from about 1.5 months to about one month
of sales revenues, to reflect improved sales receipts management.
Other receivables have been assumed to remain at approximately the
current level.
(b)  Current liabilitles:  accounts payable have been assumed to
decrease from about four months to about three months of
consumables consumption. Short-term debt is expected to decrease
to about one third df the current level by 1990 principally because
of reduction of prefinancing of metal sales and also because of
Improvements in cash management.
(c)  Outstanding long-term debt has been calculated for existing and new
debt along with the current portion which was included in current
liabilities.
(d)  Other fixed assets, existing provisions, subscribed capital and
existing reserves have been assumed to remain unchanged in current
terms. Retained earnings have been calculated as accumulated net
income.
