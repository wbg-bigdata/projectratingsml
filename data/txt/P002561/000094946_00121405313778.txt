AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
FOODCROP DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
I. BACKGROUNTD
1.(1      The majority of the population of the Southern Sudan is dependent
on subsistence agriculture. The agricultural system is based on shifting
cultivation of a wide variety of foodcrops including sorghum, eleusine (finger
millet), maize, groundnuts, and sesame. The green belt in the Southern border
highlands produces, in favored areas, tea, coffee, palm oil, tobacco, cotton,
maize, groundnuts and a wide variety of other foodcrops. The rainfall drops
off to the North through successive zones with more limited crop potential.
Sorghum and millet become the more dominant foodcrops, and livestock pre-
dominate in the semi-desert areas.  Limited amounts of sorghum are grown in
the higher areas of the flood plains.
1.02      Agricultural development in the South has generally lagged behind
that in the North. Currently, there is only a small amount of private estate
production of coffee and tobacco in addition to a Government development
project at Nzara. The latter is directed at smallholder production of cotton
for a spinning and weaving mill. Some smallholder development has been carried
by missionaries at Yei and at Maridi under USAID assistance. Finally, a small
amount of flue-cured tobacco has been produced under a British American Tobacco
Company scheme near Tala.
1.03      Before the recent disturbances 3 - 4 million people inhabited the
Southern region. During this period, however, some 200,000 persons moved into
neighboring territories and another 500,000 moved out of their villages into
the more remote areas of the region. These refugees movements imposed a sub-
stantial strain on the limited agricultural resources, particularly as local-
ized food shortages have been a regular feature of the past. Many of these
refugees have now returned to their homes, and have successfully established
their first foodcrops, but using seed from past crops and which is unlikely
to be suited to the environment to which the refugees have returned.
1.04      Very little experimental work has been done on basic foodcrops in
Southern Sudan, nor has any improved seed been imported or produced locally.
The most urgent need is for a program which will provide information quickly;
for this reason the Project would rely heavily on the results of experimental
work performed under similar ecological conditions, and upon commercial va-
rieties of seed which have already proven their worth elsewhere in East Africa.

This would allow seed production and distribution to be carried out at a much
earlier date than would be possible if an independent seed selection and
breeding program were to be initiated.
II. ThE PROJECT
A. General Description
2.01      The Poodcrop Development Section would provide a coordinated
approach to the improvement of foodcrop production throughout Southern Sudan.
The main components of this program would be:
(a)  A network of eight crop trial stations established throughout
the region which would help develop varieties and techniques
for improving foodcrop production besides providing information
on suitable cash crops;
(b) A seed production unit;
(c) A seed marketing unit; and
(d) An Extension, Nutrition and Communications Center which
would provide guidelines for the crop development program
and would be responsible for the training of extension staff.
B. Detailed Features
Unit Headquarters
2.02      Headquarters for the Foodcrop Development Section would be estab-
lished approximately four miles from Yei District Headquarters on an area of
about 2,400 acres now being reserved for this purpose by Government. Under
the Project, provision would be made for senior staff housing, a central
office block, laboratories, a seed production farm, seed processing and
storage facilities and a small multi-purpose teaching block to house the
Cormunications Center. One of the eight crop trial stations would also be
located in the same area, and would serve as the main experimental center for
the Project. Yei is located in an agricultural zone representative of the
green belt region, near the regional capital of Juba, and conditions are
suitable for the production of all the main local foodcrops.
Agricultural Trial Centers
2.03      In addition to the Experimental Center at Yei, seven other crop
trial stations would be established throughout the region so as to cover the



ANNEX 1
Page 3
main ecological zones. The tvpe of station to be established would depend
upon the area and the range of crops to be investigated. Details of location
and crops are given below:
(a)  YEI       -    Mlain Experimental Center:  foodcrops, coffee,
tobacco, pineapples, seed production;
(b)  YAMBIO    -    Foodcrops, cotton, ccoffee, and seed production,
with special attention to the Zande scheme;
(c)  WAU       -    Foodcrops, fruit and vegetables for canning;
(d)  R?IJBEK    -    Foodcrops, castor seeds, ox-training school;
(e)  TORIT     -    Foodcrops for dry areas; and
(f)  MALAKAL   -    Foodcrops, sorghum under swamp conditions,
rice under receding flood conditions.
TwJo further stations would be sited in locations to be determined.
2.04      The trial stations would primarily be concerned with variety, crop
introduction, time of planting, cultural, seeding rate and crop spacing trials.
In addition, nest and disease problems throughout the region would be studied
and trials carried out on control methods, and advise given on improved
marketing techniques. The improved varieties of foodcrops for testing would
be obtained from neighboring East African countries having similar ecologies
to the Project area. Varieties under trial at the Lebanese Institute for
Agricultural Research, Tel Amara, Lebanon of both early maturing maize,
sorghums, and finger and bullrush millet will also be tested at the trial
stations.
2.05      Each station would be staffed by two diplomates who would be
responsible for agricultural extension and the crop trial program and who
would be supervised by senior staff located at the experimental center. These
senior staff would comprise an agronomist, a pathologist and an entomologist,
internationally recruited who would be jointly responsible for the planning,
layout and management of all crop trial stations. Land for the stations
is already allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture together with junior
staff housing and stores. Details of the staff, buildings and equipment are
given in Tables 5, 6 and 7.
Seed Production Unit
2.06      An adequate supply of good seed is a vital component in any foodcrop
development program. Past importations of seed have proved successful but
costly. Under the Project, seed production farm would be located near the
crop trial station at Yei. This unit would produce improved seed of the main



ANN'EX 1
Page 4
foodcrops, and also serve as a primary source of seed for rehabilitating
areas hit bv famine. Famines resulting from drought or floods are a regular
feature of the climatic pattern of Southern Sudan, and often result in the
farming population being left without seed for planting.
2.07      Initially about 500 acres would be set aside for seed production
but this would be increased as demand warranted. Estimates of acreage of
improved seeds and expected yields are given in Tables 2-3. Provision has
been made for the import of the first year's seed requirements for the Project,
as the first seed from the production unit would not be available until 1975.
Seed Marketing UJnit
2.0 ns    To ensure improved and tested seed reaches the farmer, a Seed
M'arketing Unit would be established which would be responsible for cleaning,
dressing, packing, storing and selling all improved seed produced by the Seed
Production Unit or Durchased for distribution by Project Management. It is
expected that the Unit would start sales, using imported seed by the end of
1974, and Drocessing and storage facilities would have to be completed by
mid-1975 to handle the first seed produced by the Seed Production Unit.
2.09      The Project would annually set the price of seed to farmers to come
within their means. This would initially be low (estimated to be a little
above price for grain for consumption) and would therefore have to be sub-
sidized to the grower. Sales would be on a cash basis as a credit organiza-
tion would not be feasible due to the innumerable very small individual seed
purchases.
2.10      ShopkeeDers would be utilized as distributing agents and a 20%
profit marging has been allowed for. Details of anticipated sales, both direct
and through shops, are given in Table 4. While this Unit would operate at
a loss during the Project period, because of low sales, it would be structured
along commercial lines.
Extension, Nutrition and Communications Center
2.11      Apart from the dietary survey of the Azande carried out in the early
1)i5('s very littlc- information exists as to the food needs of the Region.
iLquallv little is known about farmers' attitudes towards change and the best
methods of communicating with a population of illiteracy rate. If the Experi-
mental Center is to provide meaningful information to farmers and if the seed
produced and marketed by the Seed Unit is to have a maximum impact, it is
essential that more knowledge of dietary needs be obtained and techniques
established for communicating with farmers.  To provide this, an Extension,
Nutrition and Communications Unit would be established in conjunction with
the Ministry of Agriculture.
2.12      The nutritional aspects would be concerned with four important
investigations:



ANNEX 1
Page 5
(a) Identification of areas of permanent or seasonal food
shortage and the causes underlying these shortages;
(b) Identification of areas of malnutrition and methods of
correcting imbalances;
(c)  Assessment of the nutritional value and acceptability
of new crop varietiqs tested at the Experimental Center; and
(d) Assessment of the nutritional consequences of developments
proposed by the Experimental Center as a result of the
experimental program; principally the nossibility of a
widespread shift from sorghum to maize as the main food
grain.
2.13      Investigations would also be carried out into:
(a) Identification of factors which militate against changes
in the present farming system in the Region;
(b) Identification of areas of optimum opportunity for change
and recommendations as to the structure of the extension
organization best suited to make use of these opportunities;
and
(c) Investigation into the best means of communicating with the
farming population.
2.14      The Ulnit would serve as an important information channel between
the Project and the farmer and provide a feedback mechanism to ensure that the
farmiers needs were being dealt with by the Project. Major problem areas such
as the palatability of new crop varieties, a lack of suitable pulse crops in
the farming system, and deficiencies in the family's diet would be the subject
of field surveys carried out by the Unit. The survey results would then be
assessed by the Foodcrop Development Unit and suitable action taken.
2.15      The Unit would also be responsible for the i,n-service training of
extension staff and the production of communications materials, such as regular
farming programs over Juba Radio and which would also give wide coverage to
otlier asTects of th1e development program.
f1etails of staff hiousing, transport and office facilities are given
ini Tables . and 6.  A teaching block and living quarters for in-service train-
in'g of 40 students would also be included.

Cost Estimates
2.17      Total cost estimate of the foodcrop development program over the
four year period would be about hS 1.2 million (US$3.4 million). Foreign
exchange requirements would total about MS 0.65 million (US$1.9 million), or
5.3 of total costs. Detailed breakdowns of costs are given in Tables 5 and
6, but are summarized below:

Plus transport and handling charges to Yei.
ITTI.  ORGANIZATION AND MNAGEM
3.01      The Foodcrop Development Unit would come under the overall direction
of the Project Manager, who would coordinate all its activities. Staff re-
riiirements for this Unit are detailed in Table 8 and shown in chart. Expat-
riate staff would be necessary for the following:  an Agronomist, a Pathologist
and an Entomologist for the Experimental Center; a Senior Seeds Officer; a
Nutritionist; and an Extension and Training Officer.



.ANNEX 1
Page 7
3.02      Staff for the Experimental Center and the Nutrition and Communica-
tions Unit would be required in the first year of the Project. The Seeds
Officer and his supporting personnel would be recruited in year 2.
BENEFITS AND JUTSTIFICATION
4.01      The major benefit of the foodcrop development program of the Project
would be increased yields of foodcrops, thus resulting in expanded food supplies
for both rural and urban population of the Southern Sudan. Besides which
basic information would be obtained as to the best suitable cash crops for
each of the main ecological zornes of the Project area.   An assured supply of
improved seed would also obviate the critical shortages which arise in the
course of recurring famines and dietary surveys would help identify the
nutritional needs of the Region. Furthermore the extension services would be
trained and serviced by material emanating from the Communications Unit.
4.02      The value of incremental production from the Project is expected to
reach about hS 360,000 (US$1 million) by the end of year 4 (Table 10).
4.03      An economic rate of return over 20 years after allowance for a share
of headquarters costs is estimated to be 16% based on prevailing local market
prices for grain. It is assumed that any extra labor input on the farm would
be supplied by the farmer's family and that it would have a zero opportunity
cost.

AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
SMALLEHOLDER COTTON DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
I.  BACKGROUND
1.01      Cotton production in the Southern Sudan was first initiated in
1945 to supply an industrial complex located at Nzara in the West of Equatoria
Province. This comDlex included cotton ginning, spinning and weaving plant,
as well as an oil mill, soap factory, sawmill, and furniture making shop.
These activities were under the control of the Equatorial Projects Board
(FPB) which has since become the Equatoria Agricultural Products Corporation
(EAPC). The Board included a production section which advised farmers on
cotton growing and was responsible for the purchase and transport of seed
cotton to the complex.
1.02      The promotion of cotton as a cash crop was initially very successful
and in the third year of operations (1947/48) total production of 4 million
lb of seed cotton was already close to the 'target' production level of 5
million lb. By 1950/51 production had reached 8.1 million lb and average
yields were 480 lb per acre. However, from this time onwards both yields and
production declined so that by 1954/55 yields had fallen to an average of
170 lb per acre and total production to 2.7 million lb seed cotton. A sub-
sequent increase in producer price caused production to climb back to the
1950/51 level (7 million lb) by 1959/60, with yields averaging around 330 lb
per acre. Civil disturbance broke out Equator4a Province from 1961/62 onwards
and production finally ceased altogether until it was revived in 1971/72
(Anntual figures for Equatoria Province are detailed in Table 1). The prin-
cipal cause of a low level of production from 1950/51 onwards was mainly due
to the low producer prices paid for seed cotton. As a matter of policy these
were held well below export parity and generally average prices were 1 Pt
per lb, below those paid in the Nuba Mountains and Zaire. An additional
factor was that the labor requirement of cotton production clashed with that
of foodcrops and consequently a strong financial incentive is necessary if
farmers are to make the additional effort. The Government's response to these
unsatisfactory levels of production was to instigate compulsory planting of
cotton; this caused the crop to be regarded by farmers with distaste.



ANNEX 2

II. PROJECT AREA
2.01      Cotton development would principally take place in the Tambura,
Yambio and Maridi Districts but would also be encouraged in other areas suit-
able for smallholder production. The number of smallholders who will even-
tually return to the area is not yet known, but it is presently estimated
that there are about 175,000 potential cotton farmers in the proposed areas.
A. Cotton Production
2.02      Agriculture in the cotton growing areas is based on shifting culti-
vation, the land being cultivated for three to four years only. Cotton is
usually planted in June and July and seed is issued free by EAPC. The present
varieties grown (Bar SP84 and Bar 11/5) are, however, breaking down gentically
and recently outbreaks of Black Arm disease have reduced yields considerably.
To counteract the disease problem it is estimated that some 500 acres of
Albar 637 will be planted in Yambio in 1973. This variety is highly resistant
to Black Arm and has superior lint qualities. Sufficient seed should be
produced in the Zande area to meet projected acreage in 1974. Weeding is
only carried out if time is available after planting the finger millet crop.
Cotton picking extends into February and sold at market centers organized by
EAPC. No spraying of crops is now undertaken although some farmers have
expressed an interest. Extension staff foresee no difficulty in introducing
spraying, but they do anticipate a reluctance on the part of the farmers to
pay for insecticides.
'.03      At present only a very small extension service exists.  In Maridi
district there is a District Agricultural Officer, one experienced Coffee
Officer and three junior agriculturists, whilst Yambio District is served
bv one supervisor (EAPC), one senior agriculturist and one junior agricul-
turist. Located throughout the cotton growing areas are 150 demonstrators
employed by EAPC and living in villages and who advise farmers on cotton
growing besides assisting in marketing. Further training of these demonstrators
is required.
B. Cotton Processing
.04 d L  The economic viability of the ginnery, spinning mill and oil mill
are dependent upon the level of cotton production in the surrounding Zande
area. The ginnery is in very good condition and has a capacity of 6 (420 lb)
bales of lint per hour and given a working period of between 100 and 120 days
annually the output is about 5 million lb of lint (10,950 bales), or 15 mil-
lion lb of seed cotton. This production would represent about 20,000 acres
of cotton yielding about 750 lbs seed cotton per acre.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
2.05      The limiting factor, however, is the size of the weaving division,
which has a capacity of about 2.37 million yards of cloth per year on a one-
shift basis, implying a seed cotton requirement of about 2.86 million lb. 1/
The capacity of thle spinning division is about 4.3 million lb per year (also
on a one-shift basis) with present equipment. Thus, on three shifts the
weaving division could utilize about 8.58 million lb of seed cotton. Any
output of the ginning and spinning divisions surplus to the capacity of the
weaving division would have to be sold partly as yarn and partly as lint.
III. THE PROJECT
A. General Descriptions
3.01      The cotton component of the proposed Project would be designed to
raise yields of smallholder cotton farmers through the provision of credit
for the purchase of spray pumps and insecticides and through improved ex-
tension services. Farmer participation in the Project is expected to increase
rapidly from 100 demonstration farmers to be recruited at the outset, to
10,000 farmers by the end of Project year four. Farmers would cultivate
0.75 acres of cotton and the introduction of spraying would increase yields
from 330 to 750 lbs per acre. These Improved yields would substantially
increase financial returns to farmers and supply seed cotton for two shifts
per day production from the weaving division. All cotton would be purchased
by EAPC and processed at the Nzara complex.
B. Detailed Features
Farmer Credit
3.02      Credit would be provided to farmers for the purchase of ULV (Ultra-
Low-Volume) sprayers. Each sprayer would be shared by about 25 farmers, and
the cost would be allocated proportionally among them. These sprayers would
be kept by the local Cotton Demonstrator, but the individual farmer would,
however, do the actual spraying.
3.03      Seasonal credit would also be provided to farmers for purchase of
the necessary cotton pesticides and Project cost has been based of 8 applica-
tions of a single insecticide, although the program is sufficiently flexible
to allow for the use of other chemicals or for a variation in the number of
1/   Assumes capacity of 7,500 yards per shift, 4.5 oz of year per yard,
a 15% wastage rate, and seed cotton composition of 1/3 lint and 2/3
cotton seed.

applications. Interest on loans would be charged at 1% per month and credit
would be administered at field level by an accountant under the overall
control of the Credit Section located at Project headquarters. Details of
credit requirement are given in Table 4.
3.04      The use of sprays and insecticides would result in substantial yield
increases. The farm budget given in Table 2 shows that yields would be in-
creased by 420 lbs seed cotton per acre resulting in a net cash income of
hS 13.30 to farmers. Incremental production expected as a result of the
program is given in Table 3.
C. Cost Estimates
3.05      Costs of the proposed Project program are summarized below.  Input
costs for sprayers and insecticides are based on recent quotations delivered
to Juba by air charter. This method of delivery is considered to be justified
in view of transport delays.

VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01      The cotton program would come under the overall direction of the
Crop Development Manager.  A Chief Cotton Officer, with experience of cotton
agronomy under dryland conditions and extension-work with smallholders would



ANNEX 2
Page 5
head the program and would be assisted by an administrative section comprising
an accountant and other supporting staff with Headquarters at Nzara. A dis-
trict cotton officer located in each main producing district would be supported
by junior agriculturists who would each supervise 10 cotton demonstrators
provided by EAPC. In addition to supervising the cotton spraying program,
extension staff would concentrate on simple improvements in cotton husbandry
such as timely planting, weed control and better harvesting techniques.
V. MARKETS AND PRICES
National and Provincial Supply and Demand
5.01      Between 1967 and 1971 Sudan's imports of textile goods have fluc-
tuated from IaS 8.9 m (12.6% of total imports) to IS 5.27 (21.9% of total im-
ports). During this time local production has increased from 89.8 million
metres (with a value of approximately 6S 8.9 million) 1/ to 122.7 million
metres (with a value of approximately IS 12.3 million).  The total national
market in 1971 for textile goods may therefore be estimated at about LS 37.57
million, and the trend of both imports and local production suggests that
this market will continue to grow.
5.02      To meet this demand three new textile plants are now being built
in Northern Sudan and these are due to commence production in 1975. Their
combined output will be about 48 million metres per year, 2/ and their combined
requirement of lint cotton 13.8 million pounds. Sudan's total requirement of
cotton lint for internal use will then be about 47.4 million pounds per year.
Annual production is between 500 and 600 million pounds lint.
5.03      In Equatoria Province, however, past supplies to the Nzara textile
mill have been well below the level needed and supplies have been supplemented
by imports of short staple cotton from the Nuba Mountains in Darfut Province
(about 0.5 million lb of lint cotton in 1971/72 and 1972/73). These imports
have been costly due to the high cost of transport. 3/ As the spinning and
ginning operations have also been operating at a loss, the cotton processing
has incurred heavy financial losses and it is essential that every effort be
made to encourage local cotton production to prevent further loss. This can
be done by increasing the farmers yields through the Projects spraying prog-
ram and by raising the price.

Determination of Producer Price
5.04      The price which EAPC can pay producers for cotton is related to its
overall financial position. While cotton textile production is its main
rtetivity EAPC's satisfactory financial performance is dependent upon the
efficiency of all its operations, or it will continue to need large-scale
annual subsidies. Government of the Southern Sudan is hoping to take over
the operation of EAPC, but this will almost certainly depend on guarantees
from the Central Government that continued subsidies will be available if
required.
5.05      The development of a satisfactory pricing policy for cotton would
be facilitated if the cotton and textile production programs of EAPC's opera-
tions could be considered in isolation from its other operations. Table 9
indicates that the textile program could be made viable at a fairly low through-
Put level of 2.86 million lb of seed cotton.
5.06      Table 9 also details the budget of the Nzara mill textile division
for 1971/72 and 1972/73. It is unlikely that costs have been allocated
accurately between operational divisions, but the figures may be used as an
indication. In particular the salaries and wages figures overstate the
"necessary" production costs since the six hundred people employed in the
spinning and weaving divisions spent a large amount of their time in other
EAPC activities. The management of the spinning and weaving divisions esti-
mate that a total work force of only 200 people is required for both these
operations on a one-shift basis.
5.07      Table 9 indicates that the textile division could have paid a
producer price of over 3 Pt/lb seed cotton at the cotton supply levels projected
for 1972/73 if these supplies had all been available locally. However actual
prices paid for growers were 2.5 Pt/lb seed cotton for Grade I and 2.0 Pt/lb
for Grade II. Column (3) indicates that at the 1973174 price charged by the
mill for its Damourria cloth was considerably below market. It confirms that
the seed cotton production levels envisaged during the first four years of the
Project (building up to 5 million lb in year 4) will be sufficient both to
enable EAPC to pay the local growers a price higher than 3 Pt/lb (actual
price for the 1973 season) and for the textile division to earn a modest pro-
5.08      Tables 10 and 11 indicate the import and export parity values of
Nzara short staple cotton. Table 11 establishes the export parity value by
reference to current and future cif prices (landed Europe), and shows that
the 1972/73 actual price of 2.5 Pt/lb seed cotton for Grade I was above the
export parity price of 2.0 Pt/lb. Table 10 indicates the import parity prices
based on 100% utilization of the nearest available supplies (i.e., Nuba
rHountains). These figures are summarized below:

as shown in Table 10.
5.09      These figures clearly indicate that producer prices should be based
on import parity. It is recommended that EAPC should pay a price of at least
3.5 Pt/lb for Grade I cotton and review the krice periodically in light of
the price for imported cloth which the factory is replacing locally.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The Project would result in cotton production of 5.5 million lbs of
seed cotton. As the total capacity of the Nzara mill is now about 15 million
lbs and as current throughput averages about 3 million lbs, the incremental
Project production would be well within its capacity. By increasing supplies
to the mill the Project would reduce or eliminate the need to finance the
deficit on cotton textile operations. It would thus ensure the continued
employment of workers who would otherwise either be unemployed or would cons-
titute a recurrent cost to the economy.
6.02      The financial rate of return to this program of the Project has
been assessed both including and excluding the costs of the EAPC extension
staff, who are not financed out of Project funds but who are a necessary cost
to Project implementation. It has also been assessed at the recommended price
to be 52 % (Table 12). At 1972/73 producer prices (2.5 pt per lb) the fi-
nancial rate of return is est3mated to be 3l1. These estimates exclude
the additional benefit of elimination of the subsidy for textile production
at Nzara, which may be valued at iS 150,000 p.a., or 50% of the value of in-
cremental production shown in Table 12.

AGRICULTURAIl REHABILITATION PIOJECT
Smallholder Coffee Program
I. BACKGROUND
1.01      Nearly all the domestic requirements of coffee for the Sudan are
presently imported. In 1972, sales totalled 13,000 tons and are expected to
increase at a rate of about 5Z per annum. Imports are robusta type of fair
average quality; imports historically were mainly from Uganda, but more
recently have been from the Ivory Coast.
1.02      The only areas in Sudan suitable for coffee are in the Southern
Region. Coffee before the disturbances was grown successfully in the high
rainfall zone of Equatoria province along the Uganda and Zaire borders in the
Nzara/Yambia area which is the only area with sufficient rainfall to allow
it to be grown without supplemental irrigation. Irrigated coffee was produced
on a large coffee estate at Nzara, and by smallholders. These areas of robusta
coffee were almost completely destroyed as a result of the disturbances. The
most successful smallbolder coffee production was in Yei district, with
individual farmers sharing cooperatively-owned irrigation equipment. Yields
of about 1,200 lb of washed coffee per acre were achieved.  Areas in the
Imatong mountains and on the Roma plateau have a potential for the production
of Arabica coffee, but development of this type would require further investi-
gational trials.   Present Government policy is aimed at encouraging small-
holder production in the Southern Region either through the subdivision of
state coffee farms to individual farmers or through the reintroduction of the
crop to small farmers.
II. PROJECT AREA
2.01      The areas most suited to coffee production in the Southern Region
are:
(a) Supplementary Irrigation Areas
(i) adjacent to the perennial streams flowing from the
Acholi Hills in Eastern Equatoria.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
(ii) adjacent to the Yei River and its tributaries in
the Mundri-Maridi area.
(b) Rainfed Areas
The Nzara/Yambio area where higher and better distributed
rainfall renders supplementary irrigation unnecessary.
For those areas requiring supplementary irrigation rainfall is between 1300 -
1600 mm falling from April to November. The dry season (December - March) is
very severe and there is often a period of 100 consecutive days when no rain
falls. The mean maximum temperature during the dry season is 35°C, and total
evaporation (Piche) averages 540 mm.
2.02      Generally, soils are shallow and overlie ironstone pans or quartzite
pebble beds but pockets of deep, well-drained fertile soils which occur near
rivers are well-suited to coffee growing. These potential coffee areas are
gently sloping, but, because of the violent storms which are a feature of the
Region, require soil conservation measures.
2.03      All potential coffee areas are served by all-weather roads from
Juba, with the roads to Yei, Mundri and Maridi in fair condition. However,
the road from Torit to the Acholi area is in very poor condition at present,
but is due for improvement before the end of 1973. Feeder roads would have
to be constructed from existing main roads to the streams and rivers along
which the coffee development would be sited and would not normally be more
than four miles long. Construction would be by local labor with assistance
from a Feeder Road Construction Section to be established at Project Head-
quarters.
2.04      Land is held under customary right and is freely available.  There
would therefore be none of the problems associated with land tenure which
are a feature of more densely-populated areas. A more secure form of tenancy
rights would be desirable at some future stage..
III. THE PROJECT
A. General
3.01      The coffee production program of the Project would, over four
years, provide for:
(a) Establishment of 3,150 smallholder plots for producers who
would cultivate individual one-acre coffee plots;
(b) Establishment of seedling nurseries at suitable central sites;



ANNEX 3
Page 3
(c)  Irrigation facilities, both for nurseries and for farmers,
in those areas where rainfall is inadequate; and
(d) Construction of three processing plants and associated
storage facilities.
B. Detailed Features
Smallliolder Development
3.02      Smallholder coffee plots would be established on the smallholders
present farms in the non-irrigated area and in approximately 30 acre blocks
in the irrigated zones, with an individual farmer cultivating one acre.
These blocks would be located adjacent to perennial streams. Smallholders
would be responsible for land clearance and preparation, planting, weeding,
mulching, harvesting and drying of the crop. Credit would be made available
to individual farmers for the purchase of seedlings and drying trays and
communally to a block of 30 farmers for the purchase and operating expenses
of irrigation equipment. Farm budgets for Project participants are given
in Tables 6, 7 and 8.
3.03      The expected participation of farmers over the Project period would
be:
Total Number of Coffee Farmers Participating in the Project
Year 1      Year 2       Year 3      Year 4
Irrigated Coffee
Yei                             150          300         450          600
Acholi                          150          300         450          600
Mundri                            -          150         300          450
300         750        1,200       1,650
Non-Irrigated Coffee
Yambio-Nzara                    150          450         900        1,500
Total                      450       1,200        2,100       3,150
The number of farmers involved in the program would be relatively small as
the majority of farmers have only recently returned to their home areas,
and are primarily involved in building housing, clearing and establishing
fooderops. Also as these farmers are not accustomed to group cultivation



ANNEX 3
Page 4
of adjacent plots and the sharing of equipment, only the more progressive
are likely to join the program. Finally, only a small proportion of the
population in the "coffee belt" lives close to the potential coffee growing
sites, and this automatically limits the number of participants.
Nurseries
3.04      Seedling nurseries would be established at suitable sites adjacent
to planned development areas. Seedlings would be irrigated by small overhead
units as specified in Table 4. Seedlings would be sold on credit to farmers
at 2 pt of each.
Crop Irr gation
3.05      Because of the very high evaporation rates in the area and the
tnumber of scattered units involved, overhead sprinkler irrigation would not
be used on the farmer's plots. A pump and engine would be mounted on a hand
trailer which could then be moved from farm to farm along the river bank.
This would minimize the amount of piping, reduce friction loss and the size
of equipment required. A short length of quick coupling piping would carry
water to the coffee garden, where 1" plastic hoses would be used to apply
water to the base of the trees. "Saucers" would be made around each tree
which would be heavily mulched to cut down evaporation. This method would
ensure the optimum use of the water. Up to three or four applications (each
of 30 gal. per plant) would be sufficient to prevent loss of coffee cherry
which ripens at the end of the dry season. This method was used with con-
siderable success in the past by smallholders and on the coffee estate at
Nzara.
Coffee Processing
3.06      The coffee crop would initially be sun dried on trays as there are
no indications at present that a premium would be paid for wet processed
Robusta coffee. In the event that a premium would be paid for washed coffee
credit would be offered to farmers for hand pulpers. Three processing plants
would be established at Yei, Obbo and Nzara. They would winnow, clean, and
remove the dry cherry skin from the coffee beans. Provision would be made
^r-r a storage unit for 600,000 lb of cherry, Maridi area, for 1,800,000 lb
of dry cherry at Yei and for 1,200,000 lb of dry cherry at Obbo. Specifica-
tions and details of the processing facilities are outlined in Table 4.
Farmer Credit
3.07      Medium term loans would be made to farmers for eight years for
seedlings, irrigation equipment and drying trays and annual running costs
until the coffee commenced production. Loans would have an interest charge
of 7-1/2 per annum and would include a three year grace period on all payments
(interest would be capitalized). Repayments would then be phased over 5 years
(Table 12).

Staff
3.08      Under a coffee development officer rith a credit accountant at
Yei the Project would provide 8 agricultural assistants and four diplomates
for field extension work.
C. Project Cost
3.09      Total cost of the smallholder coffee development program is estimated
at US$1.3 million (ES 470,000) over a four year period. These costs are sum-

IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
4.01      The coffee program would be under the direction of the Chief Coffee
Officer (Chart 1, Annex 1) with Readquaters at Yei, where sone facilities
would be shared with the Food Crops Development Unit. Supporting staff would
include: a credit accountant responsible for the administration of farmers'
credit and tepayments; four assistant coffee officers of d;iplomate level
posted in each of the main coffee growing areas, responsible for field develop-
ment and the supervision of nurseries; and eight agricultural assistants for
extension work among coffee growers.
4.02      In the first year of the program training would be provided for
extension staff, mechanics and pump attendants. As distances between coffee
areas are large production would be concentrated in only three of the four
areas during the first year of the Project.
V. MARKETING
5.01      Imports and domestic sales of coffee in the Sudan have been at the
following levels from 1965/66 to 1972/73:
Year                 Imports (tons)            Sales (tons)
1965/66                13,327                     11,352
11966/67               9,478                      11,325
1967/68               12,462                      12,551
1968/69                6,988                       2,573
1969/70                 8,890                      9,876
1970/71               10,933                      11,500
1971/72                13,034                     13,039
1972/73                n.a.                       12,963
About 75% of total sales are of Robusta coffee, the rest being Arabica coffee.
All imports are made by the Coffee Plantation and Trading Company, a Govern-
ment-owned corporation, which until 1972 imported mainly from Uganda at a
fixed price of UK b 140 per ton (cif Port Sudan). Following the cancellation
of International Coffee Organization (ICO) quotas in 1972 this agreement
ceased to be operative, and the Corporation, in that year, paid a price of
UK b 310 per ton for Ugandan coffee.



ANNEX 3
Page 7
5.02      Coffee imports are subject to heavy additional charges including
an IuS 80 per ton tariff, with an additional 5% ad valorem charge. Total
costs are detailed in Table 14 and this shows that a current subsidy of 9 Pt
per lb to consumers is being met from the Price Stabilization Fund operated
by the Coffee Institute. However, thes3 prices are over twice as high as
those of 1972 when the "subsidy" of 0.9 Pt per lb could easily be met from
the Coffee Plantation and Trading Company's profit margin.
5.03      In assessing the producer price for Project farmers growing Robusta
coffee in the South, the import parity price (cif Khartoum) has been taken
as the basis for the producer price. By Year 8 Project farmers should be
producing about 1,000 tons, or 10% of the current level of imports, and it
is assumed that the bulk of this crop will be sold in Khartoum. It is predicted
that the price of Robusta will be roughly 12% higher than 1973 levels in
1980 1/ (at 1980 prices). It has thereSore been assumed that present import
prices can be taken as indicative of the price level during the earlier years
of the Project. The following table indicates the implied producer price in
Equatoria Province:

VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The establishment of 3,150 acres of Robusta coffee should yield
an annual crop of about 2.2 million lb of clean coffee with a value of
iS 310,800.  As all the coffee consu"ed in the Sudan is imported at present,
this production should result in equivalent savings of foreign exchange.
6.02      When fully developed the coffee plantations would provide an annual
net cash income of about Ij 85 for each of the participating farmers. This
compares well with other smallholder cash crop development.
6.03      The financial return of the smallholder coffee development program
is estimated at 34 percent over 20 years.

I. BACKGROUND
1.01      There is at present no accurate estimate of the total number of
livestock in the Southern Sudan. In 1954, an estimate, 1/ which was not
considered reliable, gave a beef cattle population of 2.4 million head and
a small stock population of 2.4 million. At the present time the Ministry
of Agriculture of the Southern Region estimates the beef cattle herd to be
between four and five million head (a figure which would imply an annual
rate of growth of about 3.4%). Howeve:r, as the mortality rate is still high
(estimated at 13.5% in 1954), 1/ it is very unlikely that this estimate of
herd size is realistic. Also, as a result of the recent civil war, the
natural rate of increase of the herds has been reduced, partly by migration
into adjacent countries, and partly by increased consumption requirements.
1.02      The Nuer and Dinka people, who own most of the cattle, kill few
cattle for local consumption except to mark social occasions. Total consump-
tion in the towns of the Souithern Region is low, totalling only 33,000 head
in 1971/72. Given a cattle herd size of 2.5 million head this would suggest
an offtake (measuring sales for slaughter) of only 1.3%.  To this offtake
;ieeds L() be added local slaughter and transfers to the North - details of
which are non-essential. The official estimates of the current herd size
are considered far too high and at the present time a herd size of between
two and three million is more likely.

/1   Compare Veterinary Service estimates of 3.5-4.0% in Tanzania, and
8.0-10% in Cameroon, Nigeria and Botswana.
/2   These guesstimates.  An offtake of about 5% is generally found in
unimproved nomadic herds in East and Central Africa.
1.03      There are basically three types of cattle in the region, all
humped, variously described as Zebu and Hamitic, and well adapted to their
environment. They appear to have poor milking potential and would probably
be slow to finish for slaughter, even under improvement management. There
is little data available on their characteristics and none on their produc-
tion potential. The two types of sheep in the region are hardy but light
in weight. These are particularly important to the livestock economy because
they are traded more freely than cattle. Goats are lightweight, compact and
hardy, valuable for their ability to thrive under adverse climatic conditions;
rhey are also able to survive in the tsetse infested areas of Equitoria
tirovince which will not support a cattle population.
1.04      The majority of livestock belong to pastoralists who have strong
traditional attitudes towards the management of their herds and flocks.
Livestock are valued for their social prestige and are more important than
cash. Animal husbandry practices are traditional and modern disease control
techniques only recently introduced. Annual flooding and long dry and wet
seasons have resulted in a marked migratory grazing regime of varying and
unknown complexity. However, about 80% of the pastoralists also grow some
crops, mainly sorghum.

Livestock Diseases
1.05      Although disease control methods and the veterinary service have
recently become more effective, the lack of trained staff, transport, drugs
and diagnostic facilities constitutes a serious constraint on further pro-
gress, and livestock disease continues to cause serious losses. Calf weaning
rates may be as slow as 30% and the adult mortality rate is estimated at
about 10%; disease epidemics and droughts are also responsible for periodic
decimation of the herds.
1.06      The most important diseases affecting cattle are Rinderpest,
Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), Trypanosomiasis, Foot and Mouth
Disease (FMD), Shistosomiasis and internal parasites. CBPP and Rinderpest
are probably the two most serious diseases, but since many cattle have
developed some immunity, the numter of deaths are only a poor indication of
the economic losses involved.
1.07      Rinderpest.  The Southern Sudan is one of the largest remaining
sources of endemic rinderpest in Africa. Its control is important not only
as a means of reducing the losses from death, debility and in fertility, but
it is also dictated by supra-national considerations. Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda
and the Sudan have agreed to participate on an East Africa eradication cam-
paign. In view of the widespread movement of cattle throughout the East
Africa region the cooperation of each country is essential to the ultimate
success of the program.
1.08      Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP).  Data from the slaughter
houses in Equatoria Province show 715 confirmed cases out of 8,945 cattle
slaughtered in 1971/72 i.e. 7.9% of all cattle were affected. This data,
collected by cyst counts, indicates a much higher incidence of the disease
than the official total of 1,668 known cases over a two-year period.
1.09      Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD).  In 1970/71, an outbreak of FMD was
reported in Upper Nile which infected 85 animals and killed 15. In 1971/72,
4 outbreaks of this disease were reported in the Akabo region. FMD appears
occasionally in all three provinces of the region, but its effects are limited
as the disease is ordinarily mild.
1.10      Trypanosomiasis.  There have been no recent investigations of
tsetse infestation in the region. In the report of the British Commission
(Ci41 the area between Nimuli, Yei, Maridi, Amadi, and Yambio was declared
to be infested. Tsetse infestation was also reported in one isolated region
north of Gogriel in Bhar el Ghazal. It can be assumed that tsetse fly has
spread since then, since, as a result of the civil war, large areas have
reverted to bush vegetation which offers a better environment for its sur-
vival. The provincial figures which are available only cover treatment given,
without differentiating between therapy and prevention.

Veterinary Services
1.11      The Veterinary Service is part of the Regional Ministry of Agri-
culture, Irrigation, Forestry and Animal Production located at Juba. It is
staffed by three senior veterinarians, assisted by 14 senior assistant
veterinarians and 14 assistants. Fourteen district veterinary hospitals
serve as centers for vaccination and inoculation programs, general livestock
treatment, and the sale of medicines. The hospitals also control local
dispensaries, staffed by stockmen, which report on incidence of disease,
give limited extension advice and carry out meat inspection. Overall the
hospitals are poorly equipped and supplied.
1,12      A vaccination program (JP15) for the control of Rinderpest is
currently being carried out by the Veterinary Service.  The program is in
operation only during the dry season, although vaccinations are given if
specific outbreaks occur during the rains (June to October). The program
is generally ineffectual, however, due to irregularities in the supply,
storage and use of vaccine, fuel shortages, and poor vehicle maintenance.
There has been some resistance to the campaign on the part of local cattle
owners. This can be attributed both a traditional resistance to change, and
to the fact that in view of the previous practice of imposing a head tax on
cattle, owners have been reluctant to bring their animals forward. This tax
is now in the process of being adjusted from a cattle tax to a more general
tax on farmer prosperity. It is estimated that the coverage of the vaccina-
tion campaign may be as low as 10%, and consequently vast areas of infection
still exist in the Southern Sudan.
Research and Training Facilities
1.13      The Veterinary Research Laboratory in Malakal was established in
1904 as a diagnostic center for the Southern Region and for the production
of vaccines. It is controlled by the Central Government and is directed by
a senior veterinary research officer with special training in laboratory
work. The buildings are adequate but in need of repair, and the equipment
requires complete renewal.
1.14      At present there are no training facilities for veterinary staff
m n the Southern Region. A stockman training school which was operated
earlier at Malakal has now been closed for some time. Training opportunities
are provided yearly by the Central Government at Khartoum University for a
few veterinarians, veterinary assistants and stockmen.

II. THE PROJECT PROGRAM
A. General
2.01      The proposed animal disease control program would be the first
stage of a long-term development effort. Within this program would be a
Project (which IDA would support) comprising the essential elements. The
balance, mainly provision of 3 veterinarians and related costs, is expected
to be provided by the Federal Republic of Germany. Overall, the program
would be designed to deal with only the most urgent problems and lay the
foundations for more extensive programs in the future. It would provide
for:
(a) Construction of a central veterinary laboratory at Juba
with provincial laboratories at Wau and Malakal equipped
to provide vaccines; these centers would also provide
diagnostic services and act as bases for mobile disease
survey units;
(b)  A three-year regional vaccination campaign againts the
two most serious diseases--Rinderpest and CBPP; and
(c) Extension and operation of a training school for stockmen
(junior livestock staff) at Malakal.
The program would be carried out under the direction of the Senior
Veterinarian.
B. Detailed Features
Laboratories and Survey Units
2.02      The laboratories at Juba, Wau and Malakal would be designed to
provide general diagnostic services for the area, and to manufacture CBPP
vaccine. Because of the short life of the vaccine involved, these labora-
tories would be able to produce a more reliable supply than would be available
from Khartoum or elsewhere. Production would be geared to the requirements of
a three year vaccination program (para 2.05), and would total approximately
4.5 million doses. The major capital expenditures would be for the purchase
of laboratory equipment; other investments would include those for buildings
and staff housing, vehicles and chemicals and laboratory supplies. Details
of staff, capital and operating costs are available in Tables 1 & 2.



ANNEX 4
Page 6
2.03      A disease survey unit would be established in each Drovince, under
the direct control of the provincial laboratory. The survey program, which
would be prepared and coordinated by the Disease Control Manager, would be
designed to:
(a)  Determine by seriological methods, the geographical
incidence of the most impo-tant epizootic diseases
and by close study of these outbreaks and their
consequences provide data for economic evaluation
and for the preparation of further disease control
programs;
(b)  Identify the type and significance of parasitic
diseases in the Region as a prerequisite to the
implementation of control programs;
(c)  Collect information on the movement patterns of the
pastoralists and their herds;
(d)  Collect veterinary data on the factors influencing
animal production such as breeding patterns, fer-
tility problems, etc.
(e)  Collect and analvze data on adult and calf mortality;
and
(f)  Improve contact with herd owners.
2.04      The survey units would operate in close conjunction with the
vaccination campaign, the general veterinary service and slaughter house
inspectors. Each unit would comprise a qualified veterinarian (also part-time
counterpart in the laboratory), one veterinary assistant, one stockman and
a driver. The teams would be equipped with camping requisites and the
necessary veterinary equipment.
The Vaccination Campaign
2.05      Under the disease control program, 14 vaccination teams would be
established, each comprising a veterinary assistant, seven stockmen and a
vehicle driver. Each team would operate in a province under the direction
of a veterinarian in charge of the provincial laboratory. The overall
program would be directed by a campaign manager responsible to the Disease
Control Manager.   The aim of the campaign would be to vaccinate the entire
cattle population of the region once a year for three consecutive years
with tissue culture Rinderpest vaccine obtained from Niarobi and with CBPP
vaccine prepared by the Project at Juba. The aim would be to vaccinate the
total cattle population estimated at 2.5 million head. However, only a 70%
cover is expected to be achieved of which it is assumed 50%, because of
identification problems in the field, would be "accidentally" vaccinated
twice each year.  Thus 2.6 mi '? on annual vaccinations would be carried out,



ANNEX 4
Page 7
which with a 20% field wastage, would require an annual field supply of 3.1
million doses of each type of vaccine. Since laboratory wastage would be on
the order of 40%, the Juba laboratory would be geared to the manufacture
of 4.5 million doses of CBPP vaccine per year. In order for the vaccination
campaign to be acceptable to the nomadic cattle owners it is not proposed
to charge for vaccinations.
2.06      Each team would be equipped with a 2-3 ton 4-wheel drive lorry,
fitted with a refrigerator and the necessary veterinary and camping equipment
and supplies. The supply of fuel and vaccine and distilled water to district
field posts would be maintained in each province by a regular delivery
service by a 6-ton lorry. There would be vaccine storage facilities in
each provincial capital and the district veterinary offices would have re-
frigerated storage space available for small qualtities of vaccine. The
repair of vehicles would be carried out at the Mechanical Transport Depart-
ment depots, and a supply of spare parts would be assured. Radio telephone
links would be established between the three provincial capitals. Details of
cspital and operating costs are available in Tables 3 and 4.
Stockman Training School
2.07      A training school at Malakal would be established to give practical
three to six month training courses to groups of 20 students (Government
Field Junior Staff). This would allow for the training of the approximately
40 stockmen presently employed and a further 100 to be recruited for the
program. The school would have teaching accommodation including an air-
conditioned post-mortem room and sample store, student and staff housing.
A suitable site in the Malakal urban area has been selected.
2.08      The school would be run by a qualified veterinarian (warden)
assisted by a resident veterinary assistant and visiting lecturers. Courses
which would initially be for in-service stockmen and attendants, most of
whom have not received any formal training. One or two main courses would
be held each year and the balance of the year would be reserved for short
refresher courses. The main courses would cover the following subjects:
(a) Basic Training
(i) Handling, storage and preparation of vaccine
in the field.
(ii)  Storage of drugs.
(iii)  Use of microscopes.
(iv)  Report writing.



ANNEX 4
Page 8
(b) Diseases
(i) Clinical symptoms and the treatment of minor
diseases (including parasitic diseases).
(ii) Simple standard diagnostic methods suitable
for the field equipment available.
(iii) Disease reporting and quarantine procedures.
(iv) Post-mortems and sample collection.
The scope of the training program would be enlarged after the bulk of the
in-service stockmen and attendants had received their basic training. Details
of the capital and operating costs of the school are available in Tables 5
and 6.
C. Costs and Financing
2.09      The estimated total cost of the Government's proposed Animal Disease
Control Program (including the Project component detailed below (para 2.10))
would be about 1,S 1.65 million (US$4.75 million) over the four-year period,
including a foreign exchange component of 65 percent. Costs are summarized
below:

III.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
3.01      The Disease Control Program would come under the overall control of
the Veterinary Services Department in the Ministry of Agriculture.  It would
depend on the central services of the Project Development Unit for general
administration, accounting, procurement, vehicles and capital expenditure on
buildings, vehicles and equipment (excluding expenditures financed through
bilateral sources).
3.02      The unit would be under the control of a manager who would coordinate
all its activities. Seven experienced expatriate veterinarians would be re-
quired to mount the vaccination campaigns and man the laboratories.
IV. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
4.01      The direct benefits from the disease control program would be an
increase in the total herd size and a related increase in offtake numbers
(although not necessarily at the offtake rate). Since it has been shown that
the total herd size is probably between two and three million head, there
seems no danger that an increase in herd size would lead to overgrazing; the
present stocking rate in the whole of the South is probably about one animal
to some 60 acres. 1/
_~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1/   The three southern provinces cover 648,000 km , divided here by 2.5
million head of cattle.



AhNEX 4
Page 11
4.02      The benefits shown in Table 7 are computed on the basis of a
1973/74 herd size of 2.5 million head, which is assumed to be growing at
2 percent per year net of offtake. It is assumed that the program would
increase herd growth rate by 1 percent per year as a result of decreased
mortality. The increase in herd value is assessed each year at a conser-
vative price of LS 10 per animal from Year 2 onwards (the value of a one
year old calf). Under these assumptions the disease control program would
have a financial rate of return of about 14% over twenty years. All program
costs have been included, although the laboratory and the stockmen training
school would generate significant benefits in addition to the increase in
herd size shown here. These would include improved husbandry practices,
the upgrading of existing extension staff and the collection of a substantial
body of information and data which would be essential for the preparation
of more extensive disease control programs.

AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
Smallholder Dairy Program
I. BACKGROUND
Present State of Dairy Production
1.01      Small state dairy farms managed by the Veterinary Department of
the Ministry of Agriculture have been ~in operation at Juba, Wau and Malakal
for a number of years. These farms have not been successful, as they are
generally overstaffed and have insufficient grazing available, and are not
able to depend on adequate supplies of feed and other supplies. These dairy
farms are currently carrying some 310 cows and 480 followers but individual
cow production levels are poor, averaging about 150 gallons per lactation
(Table 1). The milk produced is sold mainly to civil servants, often at
subsidized prices. Government proposed to relocate, enlarge and reorganize
these state dairies under the Project. This proposal has been excluded from
the proposed Project as state dairy farms are difficult to run profitably,
especially under Southern Sudanese conditions.
1.02      There is presently insufficient raw milk available to meet the
market requirements of the three main towns of Juba, Wau and Malakal, and
the populace largely depends on the tinned and powdered milk. However, each
town is supplied by a number of traditional herd owners who sell raw milk in
bottles at the market place under very primitive and unhygienic conditions.
Present price is around 21 Pt per gallon. With the exception of the milk
produced by the state dairies, these herds are the only source of milk.
Production is limited by lack of dry weather grazing, and poor standards of
husbandry; cows give only slightly more than a bottle of salable milk per
day (1/6 gal.). Little or no advice is provided to the cattle owners.
II. THE PROJECT
A. General
2.01      The smallholder dairy scheme would increase the supply of whole
milk to the major centers through the development of the private dairy
farming sub-sector. The Project would assist traditional cattle owners by
providing each individual with 10 acres of irrigated pasture. Fifteen



ANNEX 5
Page 2
smallholder cattle owners chosen from those who presently supply milk to
the respective towns would be established in each of the four Project years.
Overall 60 improved dairy farms would be established on about 600 acres with
capacity for some 7,200 head of dairy cattle (12 per farm).
2.02      The traditional cattle owners with a conservative background in
livestock husbandry would be encouraged to progress through simple improved
methods using hand-milking and simple hygiene to a more developed stage
involving better dairy stock, artificial insemination and the production of
pasturized milk through cooperatives. This would help overcome the situation
whereby the high costs of an overly sophisticated European type processing
plant raises costs so high that the developing producer because of the
limited throughput, gets a lower farm gate price than would have been the
case for unimproved milk.  The designated land would be subdivided, bunded,
sown to improved pastures, fertilized and fenced by the Project staff. Cost
of irrigation machinery, a simple dairying building, some dairy equipment,
together with irrigation pasture fertilization and land development would
be concentrated into a loan of bS444 for each farmer.
2.03      A pasture improvement program would be carried out which would
entail the direct seeding of narrow s.rips (covering 1/10 of the irrigated
area) with Stylosanthes Gracilis, Seratro and Desmodium species. About 100
pounds triple super-phosphate and urea fertilizer would also be applied per
acre. The pasture would subsequently be maintained by annual applications
of triple super-phosphate.
2.04      Diesel engines and centrifugal pumps would be used to flood irri-
gated pasture. Land levelling would be simple and one pump would service
150 acres. Associated dry weather grazing land would be set aside for use
during the rains.
2.05      Dairyfarmers would select cows in milk from their own herds for
grazing on the dairy farm. As cows become dry they would be replaced with
recent calvers from the owner's main herd (kept outside the irrigated area).
Present operators have sufficient stock to replace dry cows on the irrigated
pastures. Cows would be hand milked and the milk packaged in simple heat
sealed plastic containers. All milk would be sold individually by the small-
holder. Yields have been estimated to rise from the present 1 bottle per
day to 3 bottles during a lactation of 6 months, giving a modest lactation
increase of 90 gals. Smallholders would be provided with extension advice
on improved animal management practices. They would also benefit from the
services of the Veterinary Disease Control Laboratories (Annex 4). A model
budget for a dairy farmer is given in Table 2.
B.  Summary of Costs
2.06      Total cost including contingencies of the small holder dairy pro-
gram is estimated at US$465,000 (IS 160,000). Of this total US$ 190,000
or 41% would represent foreign exchange requirements. Detailed Project

Tables 4 and 5.  Loans to Project farmers would be onlent by Government at
7-1/2% per annum with repayment over an eight-year period (Table 3).
C. Organization and Management
2.08      The Smallholder Dairy Program would come under the direction of
the Smallholder Dairy Livestock Manager who would also be responsible for
the Livestock Marketing and Livestock Improvement Center Programs (Annexes
6 and 7). He would be subject to the direction of the Project Director.
Each of the three smallholder scheme areas would be supervised by assistant
managers.
D. Marketing
2.09      Dairy products surplus to the subsistence requirements of the
herdsmen are marketed directly in towns and villages by dairy farmers or
their employees. It is usually sold in beer bottles with a capacity of 1.3
pints at prices ranging from 5 - 8 pt per bottle in Juba, to 3 1/2 - 5 pt per
bottle in Wau, and 3 - 4 pt per bottle in Malakal.



ANNEX 5
Page 4
2.10      A survey of the consumption of dairy products in Malakal indicated
that the total urban population of about 122,000 people consumes an average
of 0.17 pints of fresh, dry and whole milk equivalents per day. Only a small
proportion of this was in the form of fresh milk. If it is assumed that the
total 2,750 gallons consumed per day is drunk entirely by children, the
average consumption rises to only 0.3 pints per day per child. The whole-
sale price of a pint of imported milk equivalent in Juba is about 6.5 pt per
bottle (1.3 pints) indicating a retail price slightly higher than that of
fresh milk. These very low levels of present consumption suggest that an
increase in daily supplies attributable to the Project would be very rapidly
absorbed.
III.  BENEIITS AND JUSTIFICATION
3.01      The Smallholder Dairy Program would increase the supply of whole
milk and would help in the initial development of a private dairy farming
sub-sector. The industry would gradually expand in numbers of cattle and
level of sophistication as experience is gained. Better results can be
achieved through adopting and improving present practices rather than through
attempting radical changes in the initial development period. Project would,
at full development, result in an annual production of 97,000 gallons of milk
valued at IS32,000. The individual dairy farmer would increase his average
income from IS130 to hS300 in the ninth year.

SOUTlERN REGION
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LIVESTOCK MARKETING AND SURVEY PROGRAM
I. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The majority of the livestock in the Southern Region belong to
pastoralists with strong traditional attitudes towards management and sale.
The owners are nomadic or semi-nomadic with an estimated one third of them
almost entirely dependent on livestock products for subsistence; the remainder
cultivate some food crops. Although some of the pastoralists are now moving
towards a cash economy based on the cultivation of crops, great importance
is nevertheless placed upon the ownership of cattle because they provide
an insurance against crop failure and drought and are a social necessity for
settlement of debts and marriage dowries. Thus numbers are more important
than quality.
1.02      These pastoralists migrate with their animals along varying routes
from the relatively higher wet weather grazing areas to the flood plains of
the extensive flat drainage system of the Upper Nile and its tributaries, the
Bhar el Arab, Bhar el Ghazal, Jur and Sobat rivers. These migratory patterns
are relatively unknown and of varying length, sometimes extending hundreds of
miles. Tsetse fly precludes the use of large tracts of grazing, especiallv
in the West and Southwest on the Ironstone plateau. As only a small percent-
age are sold into the cash economv, total offtake (sales and consumption)
cannot be easily estimated; some data for slaughter in official abattoirs is
given in Table 1. a marketed offtake of around 1.3% can only be regarded as
a low level of production.
Marketing
1.03      Towns and villages provide the main outlet within the Region for
the cattle sales. Very few animals from the three Southern provinces are
exported to Khartoum, and in mid-1973 there was an official ban on the export
of any animals from Upper Nile Province in response to low levels of supply
to town abattoirs. However, in the north of Bhar el Ghazal Province there
is the extensive movement of livestock to and from Darfur and Kordofan
Provinces (which are not part of Southern Region). A significant part of the
offtake of these herds probably reaches the Khartoum market.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
1.04      Total consumption in the towns of the south is very low and in
1971/72 totalled only 33,000 head (Table 1). The Nuer and Dinka people who
own most of the herd hardly ever kill for local consumption except to mark
social occasions. On a herd size of 2.5 million head this would suggest an
offtake (measuring sales for slaughter) of only 1.3%. This is almost cer-
tainly too low. When bush consumption and migration estimates are added the
resulting figure of 5% is still very low but similar to other comparable
countries. 1/ (Annex 4 page 2). After the civil war it is likely that live-
stock owners are building up herd numbers as fast as possible.
1.05      There is no shortage of additional long term market outlets since
hoth IJganda and Zaire are net importers of beef. Sudan is a long established
supplier of beef to Egypt, and the existing canning factory at Wau has the
capacity to process up to 10,000 head per year. 2/ The canning factory at
Soroti in northeastern Uganda which has a capacity of over 100,000 head per
year was designed to draw off animals from Southern Sudan, and now remains
very seriously undersupplied.
1.06      The marketing of the small number of animals which reach the local
urban auctions is conducted by well-organized local traders, who in most
cases are members of trading groups including urban butchers. While these
trading groups are not formally registered as cooperatives or companies,
they are well-financed: the Juba group has about thirty members with a con-
tribution of up to LS4,000 per member. The group has the capacity to buy up
to 1,000 animals monthly; these are then trekked in lots of about 300 head
from the northern parts of Blue Nile and Bhar el Ghazal provinces to Juba.
The smaller towns of Equatoria Province are also supplied by similar trading
groups which hold animals for two to three days in the Juba area before
having them trekked southwards.
1.07      Price levels for livestock are somewhat below those prevailing in
neighboring areas of East Africa; prices for an 800 lb steer average iS30
to bS35 at primary markets. Table 2 indicates market prices quoted by traders
at the three provincial centers, and Table 3 indicates the relative retail
prices of beef, sheep and goat meat. These figures indicate that beef is
about 30% cheaper than other types of meat (although it is much more expensive
than fish).
..g-Grounds and Stockroutes
1.08      The existing marketing system lacks facilities for the movement of
livestock between the production and consumer areas. Cattle are held pending
movement or sale on pasture by agreement with pastoralists who have traditional
1/   Cf. Veterinary Service estimates of 3.5-4.0% in Tanzania, and 8.0-10.0%
in the Cameroon, Nigeria and Botswana.

grazing righits. In the dry season, however, access to "toich" grazing - low
lying areas on impeded drainage soils where some good dry weather grazing
exists - is not easily obtained, and traders are sometimes unable to purchase
the cattle offered because they cannot hold them. Stock routes generally have
no staging posts and often have long stretches without watering points. For
example the route between Rumbek and Juba which normally takes around 21 days
to traverse includes a stretch which is waterless in dry weather and takes 3
days to cross. Other routes include similar waterless sections which cause
high mortality if pools of rain water or dry riverbed water deposits are not
found.
II. LIVESTOCK MARKETING PROGRAM
A. General
2.01      The livestock marketing program would have the following two main
objectives:
(a)  To collect data on the existing marketing and livestock
movement systemi for analysis by the Project's market
research division; and
(b) To try to ensure that no livestock offered for sale
at reasonable prices by producers remain unsold be-
cause existing buyers are unable or unwilling to
purchase them.
2.02      The Project would specifically include:
(a) Establishment of two mobile marketing teams one in each
of the Upper Nile and Bhar el Ghazal provinces.
(b) Construction and operation of three livestock holding
grounds one near each of the three provincial capitals
in the Region.
(c) Construction and operation of three boreholes on the
main Rumbek - Juba stockroute.
B. Detailed Features
Marketing Teams
2.03      Marketing teams would be established in the Upper Nile and Bhar
el Chazal Provinces. The teams would be comprised of a buyer, clerk driver



ANNEX 6
Page 4
and head herdsman. The teams would liaise c:'osely with the Municipal market
clerks, traders and others in the collection of data on market offerings and
sales which would be sent to the Project Headquarters in Juba for analysis by
the Livestock Market Research Officer. They would also establish a routine
of visits to the provincial and district markets to establish themselves as a
residual buyer of livestock at floor prices (to be determined by Government
on the basis of experience). Each team would have a lorry and be equipped
with a portable weighing scale, radio and camping equipment (Table 4). Each
team would be based in an office with sale yard and fixed weighing scale at
the market in the provincial capital.
2.04      operating costs for the teams are calculated on the assumption that
the teams would purchase up to 3,000 head of cattle per annum from year 4 at
an average price of hS14 per head. Temporary herdsmen'would be engaged to
hold and move the livestock to the proposed holding grounds at the provincial
capitals and then to Juba (by stock route or by barge on the Nile) where the
cattle would be conditioned before sale.
Holding Grounds
2.05      Holding grounds would be established at the three provincial capitals
in the Region. These would comprise 3,000 acre grazing enclosures at Wau and
?Ialakal, where sites have been selected, and a 6,000 acre enclosure near
Juba. Each holding ground would be enclosed by a perimeter fence, divided
into four paddocks. One permanent house per holding ground would be pro-
vided for the head stockman, and four houses for the resident stockmen and
visiting herdsmen. The holding grounds would also be equipped with cattle
handling yards, and the head stockman in charge would be provided with a
motorcycle. (Capital and operating costs are detailed in Tables 4 and 5.)
Stockroutes
2.06      Three boreholes would be provided along the Tali-Terakeka Section
of the Rumbek-Juba stockroute and would be equipped with hand pumps and manned
by an attendant for whom a house would be provided. Some problems in siting
boreholes in this area are anticipated, but perched water tables are believed
to exist at 150-200 ft deep.
C. Project Costs
2.07      Total costs including contingencies of the Livestock Marketing
Program would be about LS 105,000 with capital investment at 6S 60,000 spread
over Project years 2 and 3. Annual operating costs would build up to aS34,000
in the fourth Project year (Table 5). Foreign exchange requirements would be
IS 43,000 or 41% of total costs. Livestock purchases are estimated to increase
from 1,000 head in year 2 (1S16,000) through 2,000 head in the third year to
3,000 head (WS48,000) in the Project's fourth year and thereafter; 1S20,000
will be required for working capital to cover part of the livestock purchases.

This would be provided from a livestock marketing fund to be established by
PDU. The total marketing component costs would therefore be LS 105,000
(US$305,000) as shown below:

III. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGENENT
3.01      The livestock marketing program would be under the direct control
of the Livestock Development Manager with a Livestock Marketing Officer
stationed in Juba plus staff in charge of the holding grounds, two field
stock purchasing teams and 18 unskilled staff.
IV. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
4.01      The livestock purchased by the marketing teams and handled on the
proposed holding grounds would be stock which would not otherwise have been
purchased and can thus be considered to increase offtake from the regional
herd. The total number of official sales resulting from the marketing pro-
gram - 3,000 head/annum from year 4 onward -- would be 4.6% of the total
each year, or an increase in offtake rate from the regional herds of 0.1Z.
Although this increase in itself is extremely small, the marketing experience
and data gained would lead to development proposals for a full scale marketing
program.



ANNEX 6
Page 6
4.02      The program would have a financial rate of return of 15% discounted
over 20 years. This return is based on sales at the average market price for
cattle in the Juba market during the first quarter of 1973 and on the full
deduction of buying costs at prices paid for cattle in the range areas. If
the full value of the incremental offtake (without deducting the purchase
price paid to the herd owner) iE considered the real benefit to the economy,
the internal rate of return is in excess of 50%.

AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
LIVESTOCK IMPROVEMENT CENTER
(MARIAL BAI PILOT LIVESTOCK CENTER)
I. BACKGROUND
1.01      There is almost a complete absence of any data on the livestock
production potential in the Southern Region; nor is there any local expertise
in the management of livestock enterprises. In addition, only minimal inform-
ation as to the different types of pastures and their potential use is available.
On the other hand there are vast areas of the Region which are potentially
suitable for ranching, but which are currently denied to cattle because of
tsetse fly infestation. Since most of the undeveloped areas are not currently
subject to traditional grazing rights, they present an opportunity for controlled
resettlement; with security of tenure and grazing restrictions, this would
allow the establishment of efficient livestock enterprises and provide the
basis for the establishment of a modern cattle industry.
1.02      In 1970 the Government set aside some 25,500 acres of land at Marial
Bai for settlement as a cattle ranch by local nomadic pastoralists. It was
hoped that the program would give these settlers practical experience in
production systems, cattle management, pasture improvement and grazing control.
The settlement scheme was not pursued, some development of buildings and
fencing was started and 200 head of cattle purchased. About 180 families
continue to occupy parts of the area.
II. LIVESTOCK IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM
A. General
2.01      The livestock program of the proposed Project, would develop the
25,500 acres of the existing Marial Bai ranch as a Livestock Improvement
Center. About 3,000 acres would be reserved for a holding ground (Annex 6)
and an area would also be set aside to meet the needs of the Wau smallholder
dairying scheme (Annex 5).



ANNEX 7
Page 2
2.2       The area comprises a strip of land 1 to 4 miles wide and some 18
miles long, the eastern boundary of which is the El Jur river and the western
boundary the Wau-Gorial road some 15 miles from Wau, capital of the Bhar el
Ghazal Province. The land has 80% bush and tree cover, and the rest is open
grassland. The predominant tree species are Khaya, Isoberlinia, Terminalia
and Combretum. The dominant grasses are Hyparrhenia species with Andropogon,
Louletia and Sporobolus.
B. Detailed Features
2.03      The livestock improvement program of the Project would be designed
to evaluate the production potential of locally available livestock and to
study the management techniques necessary to ensure the development of an
integrated ranching industry. As part of this program, the Project would
therefore take over and develop 22,000 acres of the existing Marial Bai
Ranch as a Livestock Improvement Center for a four-year period. Thereafter,
Government or a second phase project would continue its operation. Those
families now occupying the area would be resettled in suitable alternative
areas.
2.04      A preliminary development plan for the ranch is currently being
implemented by Government. The stocking rate would be limited by the carrying
capacity of the pastures during the dry weather. These are estimated to be
1 animal unit to 10 acres in the 20% of the area which is comparatively low
lying open grassland, and 1 animal unit to 30 acres on the remainder; the
overall capacity would therefore be about 1 animal unit to 25 acres. Designated
capital improvements would include some perimeter and internal fencing, cattle
handling facilities and staff housing (Table 2). The plan also calls for the
purchase of 100 breeding cows with some calves at foot, 5 breeding bulls and
50 immature steers (Table 1).
2.05      The Project would continue the development of infrastructure on
the ranch over the next two years. Fencing would be completed so as to give
12 main and some smaller service paddocks. Under the project a manager's
house, a spray race and water and electricity supplies would also be con-
structed. Details of these and other investment costs are given in Table 2.
2.06      Additional livestock would be purchased over the four-year project
period. The proposed purchase price per breeding cow is the current average
price paid in the Wau market (i.e. 6S27) and for breeding bulls is an
estimate based on the current price of better quality slaughter stock.
The steers are estimated to average 175 kg live weight at a purchase price
of 8 Pt/kg i.e. bS14 per head.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
2.07      The breeding herd would be maintained by purchases and breeding
of 200 cows and 10 bulls as indicated in the livestock projection shown in
Table 1. This also shows the numbers of immature steers which would be
purchased for fatterning during the first four years. The main operating
costs would be for the management and labor (bS 11,742/annum from year 2)
required to ensure that the evaluation program detailed below is properly
carried out and that the data collected are properly analyzed and publicized.
2.08      Performance data from pastoral herds in the vicinity would be
collected to provide comparison with performance at the Project Center.
Data to be collected on the ranch would include:
(a) Livestock
(i)  Birth, weaning and maturity liveweights;
(ii)  Weights for age and growth rates;
(iii) Seasonal weight changes;
(iv)  Supplementary feeding - methods, costs and benefits;
particularly in area for cheap protein during the dry season;
(v)  Mortality rates and causes;
(vi)  Prevention and control of parasites and diseases;
(vii) Age of first calving, calving percentages and fertility problems;
(viii) Killing out percentages;
(ix)  Herd size, management, night grazing and mineral supplements
feeding techniques.
(b) Pasture
(i)  Stocking rates and carrying capacities;
(ii)  Simple management of native pastures by stock number control,
fire, rotational grazing and resting;
(iii) Bush eradication and control;
(iv)  Pasture management and the interaction between flood plain
and upland areas.

C. Project Cost
2.09      The total costs of the Marial Bai Livestock Improvement Center
program are summarized below. Sales over the four-year period of LS16,000
(USS45,000) have been used to reduce the total net cost to be attributed to
the Project.

III. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Staff
3.01      The Center would be in the charge of an experienced graduate Ranch
Manager responsible to the Livestock Development Manager. He would be assisted
by a graduate Assistant Ma-nager and seven unskilled staff. The management
staff would work in close collaboration with the Provincial veterinary service
which would specifically provide suitably qualified staff for part-time work
as dictated by the program. Staff and other operating expenses are detailed
in Table 3.
IV.  BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
4.01      The investments made in this project program are experimental
costs for the preparation of a 2nd phase livestock development project.
Such benefits cannot be quantified at this juncture.

SOUTHERN SUDAN
AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
Headquarters
Project Administration and Staffing
Project Administration
1.        The Project would include a Project Development Unit (PDU) head-
quarters section administering the following components: food crop development,
cotton, coffee, smallholder dairying, livestock marketing, and the livestock
improvement center. It would also provide assistance to the forestry and
animal disease components with procurement and accounting facilities. It
is expected that eight internationally recruited specialists would be needed
at PDU which would be established at Juba. The Project Director would have
overall responsibility for Project administration and implementation; other
internationally recruited staff would include a Financial Controller, a Crop
Development Manager, and a Smallholder Livestock Development Manager, two
evaluating and marketing economists. The Project Director would coordinate
the activities of the various Project components through various operational
units to be established at Project Headquarters under his direction. Detailed
staff requirements are available in Table 1 and Chart 1.
Credit and Input Supply Section
2.        This section would be responsible for the extension of credit to the
cotton, coffee and smallholder dairy farmers served by the Project. It would
also be responsible for the supply of necessary inputs to these farmers. The
Section would be headed by a Chief Credit,and Supply Officer, assisted by an
accountant, a credit and supply assistant and other supporting staff.
The Financial Section
3.        The Financial Section headed by the Controller would handle all
aspects of Project accounting. Provision has also been made for a senior
accountant and an accounts clerk.
The Administration Section
4.        An Administration Section would be set up under a Chief Executive
Officer; this section would have overall responsibility for the operation of
Project Headquarters and would supervise personnel requirements, the central
registry and typing pool, as well as storage and transport requirements. A
central workshop for mechanical repairs would also be established under a
Workshop Supervisor at the Food Crop Development Unit Headquarters at Yei.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
The Project Evaluation and Marketing Section
5.        The Project Evaluation and Marketing Section would include the
livestock studies, existing programs and carry out required surveys for
marketing development. In conjunction with management staff, it would seek
to develop outlets for major crops by identifying markets and purchasing trial
lots of produce and selling these on a pilot basis. The section would coor-
dinate the collection and collation of livestock information and make recommen-
dations on ways of improving the livestock sector. The section would require
two experienced agricultural economists assisted by two Marketing Research
Officers, junior agriculturalist and other supporting staff.
Building Unit
6.        In view of the considerable construction program within the Project
(staff housing, workshops, stores, headquarters' facilities, etc.), a building
unit headed by a Clerk of Works would be set up to coordinate building con-
tracts and carry out simpler constructions.
Other Project Staff
7.        Other Project staff would include a Procurement Officer directly
responsible to the Project Director (who would be in charge of the procurement
and transport of Project inputs). As the Project would rely heavily on sup-
plies from throughout East Africa and in order to prevent delays of essential
equipment, the Officer would be based in Nairobi.
Training
8.        There is now a critical shortage of senior and professional staff
in the Southern Sudan. Consequently, in view of the substantial number of
qualified staff necessary for implementation of the various Project components,
the training of this staff would to a large extent have to be carried out as
part of the Project. Training of Sudanese staff would be under the overall
responsibility of the Project Director. He would aim to replace the maximum
number of internationally recruited staff with Sudanese by the end of the
Project period. Despite the limited number of Sudanese graduates available,
it away be possible to train sufficient local graduatesto fill the 3 or 4 key
posts required after the main project investment are completed by year 4.
However, the staffing of future projects is likely to remain a problem. Some
training is being carried out within the Project area at the present time--
UNDP and USAID have initiated diploma and professional training for agricul-
turalists and veterinarians at Yambio and Juba--but these graduates would
not be available within the Project period. It would also be necessary to
provide for the re-training of some diplomate staff now located in the dis-
trict in order to bring their skills up to the required standard.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
9.        A small training unit designed to fulfill Project in-service
training needs would be established at Yei. (Annex 1). Housing would be pro-
vided for up to 40 trainees at any one time, and it is estimated that the
courses would last from two to eight weeks depending on the course involved.
The unit would be headed by a senior graduate with practical, on-the-job
training experience, as he would be required to design and develop the various
courses to be offered. He would also be expected to be familiar with the use
of visual aids as well as of all the basic hand tools required.
10.       In addition, provision would be made within the Project for 12
man-years of training in Africa; it is expected that these staff would
eventually replace expatriate staff. It is also expected that bilateral
assistance for overseas training would be available for forestry and animal
health students to assist those componentrbeing financed mainly by bilateral
assistance.
Staff Facilities
11.       Housing would be provided for senior staff, and all other junior
staff would be expected to find their own accommodations. Provision would
be made for rental accommodations in years 1 and 2 prior to the completion
of the housing to be constructed by the Building Unit. Transport would be
made available to all staff and provision is also made for official air travel
and the use of charter aircraft. Details of staff capital and operating costs
are available in Tables 3 and 4.
Road Construction Unit
12.       Attached to PDU would be a road unit to construct about 200 miles
of farm tracks mainly for the food and cash crop components. It is expected
that United Kingdom assistance would be provided for an engineer and the
part-time services of an agricultural planner and for all equipment (plus
20% spares) housing and vehicles for the engineer. Local operating costs of
the unit would be about tS 20,000 per annum and would be the responsibility
of Government. The unit would construct low cost access tracks to facilitate
the transport of supplies into the Project areas and surplus crops to local
markets; they would also facilitate supervision and extension activities.
