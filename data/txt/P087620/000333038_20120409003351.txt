2.      The Social Protection Administration Project aims to improve Armenia's capacity
to provide more efficient, effective and high quality services to the population by the
public employment, pension and social assistance agencies. The Project shows good
progress towards reaching its development objective, with the majority of PDO indicators
met or exceeded. However, disbursement remains low at only 9.1 percent after almost 20
months of implementation of the Additional Financing due to the delays in the
establishment of Integrated Social Services and the decision to finance the development
of pension system personified record-keeping with the budget funds.
3.      The Government undertook a review of technical assistance activities in all World
Bank-funded projects, which resulted in the decision to streamline some of the planned
consulting activities under the project. Furthermore it decided to finance the development
of personified record-keeping from the state budget instead of from the loan. As a result,
some of the previously allocated loan funds have been released. It has been proposed to
allocate the majority of those funds for the support to the introduction of Integrated
Social Services throughout the country.

4.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to: (a) support establishment of additional
Integrated Social Service Centers in order to have at least 15 centers fully functional by
the end of the Project, which will require investments in the civil works, furniture, IT
hardware and software; and (b) complete the modernization of the “Gorts? information
system of the State Employment Service and improve the information system of the State
Labor Inspectorate.

5.     The team endorses the proposed reallocation and concurs with the Government’s
request.
