                         disbursement from the Additional Financing remains low at only 17.4% 13 months before the project closing because of the delays in the establishment of Integrated Social Services
                         (ISS) after a number of activities have been removed from the project in order to secure sufficient funding for the ISS. Disconnect between the PDO indicators and the activities arises
                         from the fact that the PDO indicators set under the original project and kept under the Additional Financing measure user satisfaction and share of pension and social assistance
                         beneficiaries receiving payments timely and fully, which are not fully dependant on the components’ activities, therefore the component ratings are lower than progress towards the
                         PDO. After the previous implementation support mission the Government and the World Bank team finalized the changes in the activities under four project components. This is a
                         result of the decision to streamline some of the planned consulting activities under the project following the review of technical assistance activities in World Bank-funded projects,
                         and the decision to finance the development of personified record-keeping from the state budget instead of from the loan. It has been agreed to allocate the majority of those funds for
                         the support to the introduction of ISS throughout the country. The World Bank processed a project restructuring to reflect the request to reallocate $545,000 of the loan funds from the
                         pension component towards the establishment of ISS. The reallocated funds should be used for project designs, refurbishment, software and equipping with furniture and IT
                         equipment of the ISSCs throughout the country. The World Bank and the Ministry agreed on an Action Plan for the period until June 30, 2012. The key actions under the Action Plan
                         refer to the completion and adoption of structural-functional model of ISS, transfer of ownership of buildings for future ISS centers to the Ministry of Labor and Social Issues (MLSI),
                         completion of project design and contracting of civil works for renovation of and IT equipment and furniture for ISS centers. The team reviewed the implementation of the action plan
                         on April 27 and recorded a good progress, with ownership of 19 buildings of future ISS centers already transferred to MLSI and civil works for first two of four pilot ISS centers already
                         initiated, while the functional-structural model of ISS is in the final stage of completion. Progress in the implementation of the Action Plan to be assessed in June will be used as the
                         factor to inform the decision on the restructuring of the Project with a potential cancellation of a part of the loan funds that could not be used by the project closing date. Given the
                         ownership of 19 buildings of the future ISS centers has already been transferred to MLSI, timely finalization and approval of the structural-functional model of ISS is considered the
                         key action to be met, as it is the precondition for subsequent investments in the renovation and equipping of the future ISS centers.

                         On Disbursement: Loan disbursement rate has increased from 9% in October 2011 to 17.4% in April 2012. The team expects disbursement to pick up if the action plan gets
                         implemented by June 30, and the latest review of the progress in the implementation of the action plan revealed there is a good chance for it.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Although the Project shows good progress towards reaching its development objective, with the majority of PDO indicators met or exceeded, disbursement remains low at only 17.4%
                         13 months before the project closing due to the delays in the establishment of Integrated Social Services (ISS) after a number of activities have been removed from the project in
                         order to secure sufficient funding for the ISS. The World Bank and the Ministry agreed on an Action Plan for the period until June 30, 2012. Progress in the implementation of the
                         Action Plan to be assessed in June will be used as the factor to inform the decision on the restructuring of the Project with a potential cancellation of a part of the loan funds that could
                         not be used by the project closing date. Implementation of the Action Plan was reviewed on April 27 and a good progress has been recorded. Given the ownership of 19 buildings of
                         the future ISS centers has already been transferred to MLSI, timely finalization and approval of the structural-functional model of ISS is considered the key action to be met, as it is
                         the precondition for subsequent investments in the renovation and equipping of the future ISS centers.
