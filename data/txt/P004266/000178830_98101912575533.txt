APPRAISAL OF THE MALACCA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1. PROJECT BACKGROUND
The Agricultural Sector
1.01      The agricultural sector plays an important role in the economy of
Malaysia, though its relative importance is declining as the country proceeds
toward industrialization. The sector accounts for about 24% of GDP, 40% of
export earnings, and 41% of employment. Real GDP in agriculture grew at an
average of 4.3% p.a. in the 1970s. Based on past investments in tree crops
and new land development, and continuing public sector investments, growth is
likely to be sustained at 3.5% p.a. for the next decade. Agricultural
production has always been heavily export-oriented; however, the composition
of primary exports has changed significantly in the last decade due to the
Government's diversification policy. Rubber continues to be the single
largest export earner, but its share has dropped from 33% in 1970 to 17% in
1980 as earnings from palm oil and wood products have increased. Malaysia is
the world's largest producer and exporter of both rubber and palm oil,
supplying about 45% of the world's natural rubber and well over 50% of palm
oil in 1980. The agricultural sector's share of total employment has
gradually declined from 50% in 1970 to 41% in 1980. The Government expects
industry and services to absorb an increasingly larger proportion of the
total labor force in the next decade. The continued growth in terms of
volume and prices in agriculture, the expansion of manufactured exports, and
the development of Malaysia's oil reserves have enabled the country to
maintain a healthy trade surplus, estimated at about US$1.9 billion p.a.
during the Third Malaysia Plan, 1976-1980. However, less favorable commodity
prices in the early 1980s have led to trade deficits.
1.02      Malaysian agriculture has a strong comparative advantage in tree
crops which accounts for the dominance of rubber, oil palm and coconut in
the pattern of land use, output and exports. Peninsular Malaysia has about
3.3 million ha, 25% of its area, under cultivation, of which about 2.5 mil-
lion ha are in rubber and oil palm. The other major crops are padi, about
340,000 ha, of which some 60% is double-cropped, and coconut, with about
250,000 ha. The entire padi area and about two-thirds of the treecrop area
are in small holdings.
1.03      During the period 1970-1980, rubber production increased by 26%
and palm oil by 500%; output of rice increased by 33%, primarily due to
improved and expanded irrigation facilities. Domestic production supplies
i

about 85% of Malaysia's rice requirements. The Government has formulated
three basic objectives for rice: (a) to increase the incomes of rice farm-
ers; (b) to maintain a high degree of self-sufficiency in rice production;
and (c) to provide reasonably priced rice to consumers.
1.04      Notwithstanding the impressive performance of the Malaysian economy,
in 1980 some 29% of the population had incomes below the official absolute
poverty line. Two thirds of these were in agricultural households, where the
incidence of absolute poverty was about 46%. The largest poverty group in
Malaysia is rubber smallholders. Despite significant yield increases over
the past two decades, their incomes in real terms have hardly improved. In
1980, about 41% of the 426,000 smallholders were in poverty. Three factors
are primarily responsible for this /1: the long run decline in the real
price of rubber; the likelihood that output gains are concentrated among
larger smallholdings; and the small size of the majority of rubber small-
holdings. Among rice farmers an even higher proportion, about 55% of the
151,000 households, have family incomes below the absolute poverty line, the
two main factors responsible being small size of holdings and low producti-
vity./l A rice farmer with no off-farm income would need about 2.4 to 2.8 ha
of single cropped rice to achieve an income level above absolute poverty;
however, the average holding size is only 1.2 ha. To reach an income above
poverty level on a holding of 1.2 ha, a farmer would have to grow two crops
of rice per year.
Government Strategies for Agricultural Development
1.05      Having officially adopted in 1970 the objective of poverty eradi-
cation, the Government has employed two basic agricultural strategies.
The first is development of new land to transfer labor from low productivity
rural occupations to higher productivity managed agricultural employment.
The second has been in situ development, including projects and programs
aimed directly at increasing smallholder productivity. Implementation of
these strategies, aided by strong performance in the secondary and tertiary
sectors, has contributed to a significant decline in the incidence of
poverty in agriculture from 68% in 1970 to 46% in 1980. Strong industrial
growth during this period provided enough employment outside agriculture to
absorb two-thirds of the increase in the rural labor force. Large scale
irrigation projects, such as Muda and Kemubu, came into production in the
early 1970s and provided increases in rice productivity that significantly
changed the income position of 73,000 smallholders (para. 1.11). They
allowed the country to reduce its imports from 22% of consumption requirements
/1 See Bank Report on Rural Poverty, Report No. 2685-MA, December 18, 1980.

in 1970, to about 11% in 1980. Government agencies, such as the Federal Land
Development Authority (FELDA), carried out land development projects opening
up over 1.1 million ha of new lands, mostly for treecrops, and resettled
about 250,000 rural families.
1.06      In the Fourth Malaysia Plan, 1981-1985, agricultural development
will be guided by the principal objectives of increasing food production,
accelerating export earnings; increasing the productivity and incomes of the
agricultural labor force; and assigning priorities for agricultural crops.
The major treecrops, rubber and oil palm, will continue to be given priority
as they contribute significantly to increasing smallholders' incomes.
Emphasis will continue to be given to cocoa, tobacco, vegetables and fruits,
as mixed crops, and the expansion of livestock and fisheries. In addition,
greater attention will be given to improved marketing and institution build-
ing. In the Third Malaysia Plan, 1976-80, about US$2.1 billion, or 19% of
the total development expenditures were channeled to agriculture. This would
be increased to about US$3.6 billion, or 20% of the development budget, under
the Fourth Malaysia Plan. The Government has also introduced a smallholder
interest-free credit program for poverty alleviation projects. Other pro-
duction and poverty oriented measures include reduction in the rubber export
tax, increase in padi price support, provision of free fertilizers to rice
smallholders, and subsidies on various crops, livestock and fishponds.
Ongoing Bank sector work is reviewing the impact of the various agricultural
subsidies in a sector-wide context.
Rubber Development
1.07      The main agencies involved in the smallholder rubber industry are:
the Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority (RISDA); the Federal
Land Development Authority (FELDA); the Federal Land Consolidation and
Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA); the Malaysian Rubber Development Corpor-
ation (MARDEC); the various state land development agencies; and the Rubber
Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM). In 1953, the Rubber Industry
Replanting Board was organized to administer the replanting funds for estates
and smallholdings generated by a cess on rubber exports first levied in 1951
(para. 3.03). RISDA, established in 1973, took over the functions of the
Replanting Board, which helped rejuvenate the rubber industry, and the
Smallholders' Advisory Service of the RRIM.
1.08      Smallholdings account for about 1.2 million ha or 70% of the total
1.7 million ha of land planted to rubber in Peninsular Malaysia. About
0.9 million ha are owned by 375,000 individual smallholders, with an average
of 2.4 ha. Some 0.3 million ha are owned by smallholders whose plots are part
of government-sponsored land-development schemes organized within the past 25
years. These are: (a) 170,000 ha in FELDA land development schemes; (b)
50,000 ha in block new planting schemes administered by state governments or
state statutory authorities; (c) 50,000 ha of fringe-area new planting
developed under fringe alienation schemes, mostly by FELCRA; (d) 55,000 ha
developed by private individuals or group effort with no government financial
assistance.

1.09      Bank assistance for smallholder rubber development began with a
program of six FELDA projects involving more than 25,000 settler families on
about 117,000 ha of land devoted to oil palm, rubber and cocoa. The first
three projects provided for the development and settlement of about 40,000
ha, of which 16,000 were in rubber, in the Jengka Triangle. Project
Performance Audit Reports for Jengka I and II (Reports No. 2122 and 3021)
noted the success of the projects in terms of improved incomes and living
conditions of the settlers and the build-up of FELDA's technical capability.
The third and last stage of the Jengka Triangle project was completed in
1981. Two more projects, more focussed on oil palm, the Johore Land
Settlement (Loan 967-MA) and Keratong Land Settlement (Loan 1044-MA) are
expected to be completed by end-1982. The FELDA VI Project (Loan 1590-MA),
involving development of 21,000 ha of rubber, 8,000 ha of oil palm, and 800 ha
of cocoa, is under implementation.   Bank assistance for land development
is now focussed on expanding the implementation capacity of the Government's
land rehabilitation agency, the Federal Land Consolidation and
Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA). Two loans were approved in 1981 with
FELCRA as the main implementing agency, the Trans-Perak Area Development
Project (para. 1.12) and the FELCRA I Project (Loan 2013-MA). The Bank is
also assisting a state land development agency to improve and complete the
development of about 20,000 ha of rubber in 26 existing schemes in the state
of Kelantan (Loan 1899-MA).
Irrigation Development
1.10      Irrigation development in Malaysia is devoted almost entirely to
rice production. The Drainage and Irrigation Department (DID), established
in 1932, is responsible for land improvement and water resources development,
particularly for rice.   Until 1960, irrigation schemes were designed for
single crop rice production during the wet season, providing water to
supplement rainfall during short periods of drought. In the early 1960s,
irrigation was expanded as part of the massive rural development program
after independence, and DID began emphasizing double cropped padi cultivation
by building storage dams and pumping stations and upgrading distribution
systems. DID has provided irrigation to practically all major rice
producing areas, and 70% of the country's 420,000 ha of padi land now has
some form of irrigation and about 50% is capable of double cropping. In
addition, DID has constructed drainage schemes on some 425,000 ha of land
devoted to treecrops and it has also developed new land for padi production.
1.11      The Bank has participated in irrigation development in Malaysia
since 1965 when it financed the Muda Irrigation Project (Loan 434-MA),
followed in 1967 by the Kemubu Irrigation Project (Loan 500-MA). Together,
the project areas amount to nearly 120,000 ha, or about 25% of the padi land
in Peninsular Malaysia, and accommodate some 73,000 farm families. Accord-
ing to the Project Performance Audit Report (Report No. 1295), they were
successful projects which helped to reduce rice imports from 42% of national



- 5 -
requirements in 1967 to 17% in 1974, and resulted in increases of 75-100% in
the incomes of project beneficiaries. In these projects, the design of field
distribution and drainage systems, based on standards prevailing in East Asia
in the 1960s, involved widely spaced secondary canals and field-to-field
irrigation and drainage. At that time, there was neither the experience in
design and construction of more intensive modes of on-farm development, nor
widespread use of the modern varieties which depend on precise water control
at the field level.  Higher standards of on-farm development are now being
initiated in the Muda II Project (Loan 1717-MA), on 25,000 ha.
1.12       In early 1981, the Bank approved two land development-cum-settle-
ment projects. The Rompin-Endau Area Development Project (Loan 1957-MA)
would involve land clearing and construction of a new irrigation and drainage
system for about 11,400 ha. The Trans-Perak Area Development Project (Loan
1960-MA) would provide for improvement of about 3,700 ha of padi land,
development of about 6,400 ha of new padi land and about 8,400 ha of tree-
crops. Five other Bank-financed projects, which will improve, expand and
intensify irrigation over 116,000 ha of padi land and drainage over 212,000
ha of tree crops, are under implementation. These projects include, in
addition to irrigation and drainage infrastructure, improved agricultural
support services such as credit, extension, processing and marketing.

1.13      Under the Fourth Malaysia Plan, 1981-85, the Government has pro-
posed a series of multi-component agricultural development projects to
alleviate rural poverty. About US$390 million has been allocated for these
projects in the Plan, comprising slightly over 10% of the agriculture devel-
opment budget.  Under the multi-component concept, emphasis will be given to
land use intensification, crop diversification and improvements to agricul-
tural support services. A project identification brief, was prepared by the
Ministry of Agriculture in 1979. The Government-s objective in formulating
the project was that by bringing all agriculture and related agencies
together, the needs of mixed cropping farmers would be better served. This
is particularly relevant in the densely populated state of Malacca where in
addition to the major components aimed at stimulating smallholder rubber and
padi production, activities such as smallholder dairy, fishpond, and backyard
fruit orchard (dusun) cultivation may contribute substantially to improving
farm incomes.
1.14      Project component proposals were prepared by individual depart-
ments/agencies in consultation with multi-disciplinary groups coordinated by
a Steering Committee of Federal and State representatives. In Malacca, local
management consultants (KPM Khidmat Sdn. Bhd.) were engaged in April 1980 to
compile a project implementation plan based on preparation reports from the
agency working groups and a final report was published in January 1981.

2. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The State ot Malacca (Map TBRD 16173) is on the south-west coast
ot Peninsular Malaysia, bounded by the States of Negeri Sembilan to the
north and Johore to the south-east. It covers about 1,650 sq km, comprising
the districts of Alor Gajah, Jasin and Malacca Central. Malacca town is an
ancient trading and lighterage port dating back to the tifteenth century.
A deep sea wharf, located about 11 km north from the existing port, has been
completed and will include extensive onshore storage facilities for palm
oil. Malacca has air connections to Kuala Lumpur and is well linked by roads
to the north and south. A good network of surfaced roads provides convenient
access to rural areas throughout the state.
2.02      The State Government and the State Development Corporation are
responsible tor the tormulation and implementation of industrial projects.
There are seven industrial estates, including two free trade zones, and
industries already set up include electronic components, medical equipment,
pharmaceuticals, tools, rubber products and textiles. This has led to the
construction of a number of housing estates and considerable migration of
agricultural labor to tactory work. There are no mining activities in
Malacca State currently, and job opportunities in torestry and fishing are
limited. Traditionally, agriculture has been the main source of employment
and income, with about 80% of the land area in the State alienated for
plantation or smallholder agriculture (para. 2.08). This is changing rapidly
with the industrial development.
Climate and Hydrology
2.03      The climate is tropical and intluenced by the monsoons, causing
heavy rainfall and high humidity for about 10 months of the year. The mean
annual temperature is from 260C to 270C and the relative humidity
is 84%. The average annual raintall is about 2020 mm, with two peaks;
the main season during October-December, and the second season during
March-April. The evaporation is uniform throughout the year, with an
evaporation rate (open pan) ot 1,720 mm p.a. However, raintall in the State
is among the lowest in Malaysia; and rainfall patterns pose some problems for
irrigation and water control and create unfavorable conditions for offseason
padi farming.
2.04      River tlows in Malacca are attected by the comparatively low
raintall.   The three main rivers, Melaka, Baru and Kesang originate from
catchment areas above the 300 m contours.  The upper catchments are jungle
but large areas have lately been cleared tor plantation development. Recent



discharge records from three gauging stations, two in Melaka river and the
third in Kesang river, indicate that stream flows are greatly augmented
during the rainy season with high flood peaks for short durations; and that
flows are very low during the dry season. The supply is sufficient for the
main season crop, but inadequate for the off-season crop. DID's assessment
of the low flows based on the five-year return period and seven-day low
flows, indicates that about 2,000 ha of the padi land can be doubled-cropped
but these represent only about 18% of the total gazetted padi land in the
State. The Government is investigating additional surface and groundwater
sources of supply.
Topography and Soils
2.05      Topography.  The State consists mainly of rolling terrain with
pockets of steep land towards the northern borders. The terrain slopes
towards the sea (Straits of Malacca) forming the coastal plains of Malacca
Central and Jasin Districts. Elevation ranges from mean sea level to about
300 m at the foothills on the northern and eastern boundaries. The Kesang
River forms the natural southern boundary with Johore State. Most of the
irrigated areas are located along the narrow river valleys; hence, there is
no potential for water impounding structures.
2.06      Soils.  The soils of Malacca were broadly classified by the
Department of Agriculture (DOA) in 1967 (Table 2.1). Class I soils, are
suitable for a range of crops, including oil palm, rubber, and fruits.
Class II and III are suitable for rubber and moderately suitable for other
perennial crops; where irrigation is available, padi cultivation is possible.
Some of the Class IV soils in the flat coastal plains are characterized by
highly sulphurous subsoils and poor drainage, making them suitable for padi
cultivation. DOA has initiated detailed soil surveys to check recommenda-
tions made for cropping patterns which were based on information from the
schematic reconnaissance survey undertaken in 1967.

Population and Land Use
2.07       Population.  Malacca, characterized by high population density, is
one of the smallest States in Malaysia. In 1980, the State population
totalled about 453,000, and the density, 275 persons per sq km, was the
second highest among the States in Malaysia. Almost 25% live in urban areas
and the remainder are in small district towns and rural settlements. Most
urban residents are Chinese while Malays are mostly in rural villages and
Indians form the main labor force on estates. Surveys in 1976 show that
34% of all rural households in Malacca, 77% of whom are Malay, lived in
poverty. In comparison, poverty incidence among urban households was 12.5%.
Although Malacca has a lower incidence of poverty among rural households
than the whole of Malaysia, pockets of poverty, especially among rubber
smallholders and padi farmers, exist. The fifth lowest amcng the 13 States,
Malacca had only 80% of the average national per capita income in 1980; and
only 46% of that of Selangor, the richest State. A 1980 survey indicated
that about 80% of the project beneficiaries have incomes belcw the absolute
poverty line.
2.08       Land Use.  About 129,000 ha or 78% of the total land area is
devoted to agriculture, the second highest among the States in Malaysia
(Table 2.2).  Malacca's agricultural economy is based primarrly on rubber
production. Of the total area planted with rubber, about 37% (36,500 ha)
are estates and the rest (61,000 ha) are smallholdings.

2.09      About 8,000 ha or some 16%  of the total smallholder rubber land
yet to be replanted and some 13,600 ha which were replanted in 1952-57 are
scheduled a second replanting during the project period. RISDA started its
Group Replanting Program in 1976 for areas under 40 ha, and through 1980, 46
schemes had been developed involving 1,700 ha and 1,340 smallholders. For
replanting areas exceeding 40 ha, RISDA has offered since 1979 its Mini-
Estate Program (para. 2.19). There are now mini-estates in Malacca totaling
520 ha and 427 members. Apart from rubber, other commercial crops occupy
only 6.4% of cultivated land (8,000 ha). In addition to rubber, many
smallholders are engaged in semi-subsistence farming, primarily padi
cultivation. Padi covers about 12,200 ha or 9.5% of agricultural land and
fruit trees about 9,400 ha, approximately 7%.
2.10      Underlying Malacca's settlement and land use patterns is an
economic relationship between the urban and rural sectors.  Malacca town is
the center of all major activity in the State, which is based primarily on
rubber and other commercial development. A large proportion of State
infrastructure is for the rubber industry including an extensive road
network connecting rubber estates to the city where bulking, grading and
related activities take place.



- 1.0 -
Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.11       Farm Size.  Smallholdings account for 67% of total cultivated
land. Most family-operated holdings are less than 4 ha, varying with crop.
Two recent studies of Malacca villages provide estimates of the average size
of family-operated rubber smallholdings. One is a comparative study of 40
villages (16 Chinese and 24 Malay) conducted in 1978 which show that family
operated rubber smallholdings range in size from 0.4-5.0 ha, with an average
of 2 ha for the 40 villages. The average for the Chinese villages was 3 ha
and that of the Malay villages 1.5 ha. A second study of 21 Malay villages
in 1980 showed a range of 0.8-5.0 ha and average of 1.7 ha, corroborating
the findings of the earlier survey.
2.12      Rice cultivation is mostly confined to Malay villages.  The aver-
age size of individually owned padi fields is about 0.8 ha, which, when fully
cultivated, more than meet a family's subsistence requirements. In the 1978
study (para. 2.11), over 60% of the farm population in half the Malay
villages cultivated both rice and rubber. These families operate padi on
holdings ranging in size from 0.1-1.2 ha, and rubber on holdings of less than
2 ha; rice supplements the cash income from rubber smallholdings. Neverthe-
less, given the uneconomic size of both padi and rubber holdings most
families live in poverty unless they have other sources of income.
2.13       Land Tenure.  The majority of smallholders are owner-operators on
land acquired through purchase or inheritance. The two studies of Malacca
villages (paras. 2.11-2.12) reported that at least 90% of farmers surveyed
own their land and nearly 50% of the Malay farmers acquired their property,
particularly padi fields, under customary inheritance law.
Existing Infrastructure
2.14       Irrigation Works.  Over the past five decades, the Drainage and
Irrigation Department (DID) has constructed 51 small irrigation schemes (both
gravity and pumping types) in Malacca, serving about 8,600 ha of padi and
ranging in size from 20 to 600 ha. Since the State has inadequate rain
during January and April, only about 2,000 ha are double cropped. Rainwater
and stream run off are the only means of irrigation, since groundwater
investigations have not shown encouraging results. The two main sources of
irrigation water, the Melaka and Kesang rivers, are highly sensitive to
rainfall. High floods during the rainy season often cause inundation of
lowlying areas. In some irrigation schemes, infrastructure has deteriorated
over the years resulting in low efficiency. Hence, it is necessary to
improve or provide adequate irrigation and drainage facilities.
2.15      Five irrigation schemes have been identified for improvement under
the project covering about 1,850 ha, of which only 350 ha are double cropped.
Some of the remaining areas are utilized during the off-season for short-term
cash crops, mainly due to lack of water and partly because of inefficient



- 11 -
irrigation systems.  Since construction more than 20 years ago, the irriga-
tion and drainage facilities have deteriorated, resulting in inadequate
commands, poor water management and low padi production. The internal
drainage is equally deficient and frequent inundation during big storms is
common. This, compounded by water shortages in the dry season and migration
to urban areas, has led to abandonment of some padi land. The present
irrigation systems rely on field-to-field flooding, often over long dis-
tances. The maximum water demand, during land preparation and early plant
growth is aggravated by excessive standing water in the fields at the
upstream reaches of the system and the time required to reach downstream
areas. This is further complicated by the fact that farmers rarely follow
cropping schedules; consequently, the maximum water demand period is
prolonged.
2.16      Treecrop Drainage Works.  Drainage runoff has increased due to
intercropping of cocoa and coffee in the coconut plantations in Merlimau and
Padang Temu schemes, and from adjacent rubber and oil palm areas. Ponding of
the drains and waterlogging in coconut holdings have been frequent. Tidal
control gates and the drainage structures within the systems are also
deficient in number and capacity.
2.17      River Improvement Works.  Six rivers have been identified for
improvement under the project. The intensive land use and opening up of
catchment areas over the years have made some of the river channels and
crossings and drainage structures inadequate to dispose of runoff.  With new
land development, the river channel clogging problems are expected to become
more serious. Scouring of the agricultural land is already endangering padi
fields close to rivers.
2.18      Roads.  Malacca enjoys a good system of main and secondary roads,
constructed and maintained by both Federal and State Public Works Department
(PWD). The District Offices construct and maintain access roads. The roads
are either gravel or surfaced with thin bituminous coating. The State annual
upgrading program covers about 80 km. Access and farm roads, which mainly
serve the agricultural areas are constructed and maintained by either
agricultural agencies such as DOA and RISDA or the District Offices.
However, these roads are generally narrow, with insufficient drainage and
often completely submerged or washed out during the wet season.
2.19      Rubber Development.  Programs for rubber development in small-
holdings comes under the responsibility of RISDA (paras. 3.03 and 4.05).
RISDA has modern offices with storage facilities in three of the five
districts/subdistricts of the State (Alor Gajah, Jasin, Masjid Tanah) and in
Malacca Town has a large office block under renovation which will serve as
the new State headquarters and as the local office for the Malacca Tengah
district. Rented accommodation serves the Merlimau subdistrict. RISDA



- 12 -
recently started to operate its first central rubber nursery in the State,
comprising 16 ha near Masjid Tanah. It has also established up to 1980,
seven mini estates totalling 520 ha /1 and since 1976 Group Replanting
Programs of 1,700 ha./2 In support of an improvement in the quality of
smallholder rubber, RISDA has constructed about 130 Group Processing Centers
(GPC) on village sites, each Center having up to 30 members. It also
operates a 15-ton capacity smokehouse at Air Pak Abas Training Center for the
processing of smallholder rubber and maintains three small purchasing depots
with a total storage capacity of about four tons.
2.20      Milk Collection Centers.  The Department of Veterinary Services
(DVS) is responsible for smallholder livestock and dairy development
(paras. 3.19 and 4.18). A milk collection center (MCC) was established at
Jasin in 1974. Milk collection in 1980 was 733,000 liters, averaging more
than 60,000 liters monthly. This is by far the largest MCC in the country.
The other center in Merlimau collected about 223,000 liters in 1980. This
MCC is scheduled for expansion under the Coconut Smallholder Development
Project (Loan 1618-MA), and another center will be constructed under that
project at Masjid Tanah.
2.21      Agricultural Support Services.  The Department of Agriculture
(DOA) is responsible for agricultural extension in padi areas, cash crop and
fruits development, and farmers' training (paras. 3.16-18 and 4.10). Agricul-
tural training facilities are concentrated at the Sungei Udang Agricultural
Station. Present annual intake of trainees is about 670 for short- and
medium-term courses. The station also has nursery facilities for the
production of budgrafted fruit trees and other planting materials.  Current
output is about 15,000 fruit trees per year, mainly mango, rambutan and
durian, which are distributed free to farmers by the DOA staff.
2.22      The Farmers' Organization Authority (FOA) is responsible for amal-
gamating rural cooperatives into viable Farmers' Organizations (para. 4.17).
/1 Mini-estates are contiguous areas of about 40 ha or more of smallholders'
rubber in which individual owners have leased their land titles to
RISDA for the benefits of larger scale and higher standards of replant-
ing and field maintenance for the total immature period and early
production years.
/2 Group Replanting Programs comprise contiguous areas of somewhat less than
40 ha of smallholders' rubber in which individual owners under RISDA
supervision group their land during the first two years of replanting for
the benefits of larger scale and higher standards of replanting.



- 13 -
FOA facilities in Malacca include a Kompleks Geraktani (KGT) /1 under con-
struction, five farmers' development centers (FDCs),/2 96 small farmers'
units /3 and 12 staff quarters. In addition, a farm mechanization service
center at Malacca Town serves the project area. To expand services to
farmers' cooperatives, agri-based societies, and nonmember farmers, the five
FDCs would be converted into KGTs. FOA's equipment pool includes, among
others, 18 tractors of 45/70 HP, 10 pedestrian tractors, and associated
agricultural implements. FOA has, at present, a State membership of about
8,650.

- 14 -
(c)  Crop Development Programs, including establishment of a padi seed
multiplication program; planting of about 380 ha per annum of
various cash crops ; and rehabilitation of smallholder orchards and
backyard fruit lots totalling about 810 ha;
(d)  Dairy and Fisheries Development Programs, including distribution of
2,500 crossbred dairy heifers to 1,000 new and 500 existing dairy
farmers; establishment of some 250 ha of on-farm fodder grass
production; construction and equipping of a milk collection center
handling up to 1,350 liters of milk per day and construction and
stocking of about 260 ha of freshwater fish ponds; and
(e)  Implementation of Pilot Schemes for perennial crops on 160 ha of
fragmented, idle agricultural land;
3.02      In addition, the project would provide for buildings, vehicles and
equipment for training, agricultural support services and operation and
maintenance, and consultant services for studies, detailed design and
construction supervision of project works.
Smallholder Rubber Development
3.03      Rubber Replanting.  Through RISDA, the project would replant about
8,950 ha of rubber (para. 5.01), phased to increase annually from 1,300 ha
in 1982 to 1,700 ha by 1987, by financing replanting grants/i to
smallholders of M$5,430/ha for holdings less than 4 ha and $3,700/ha for
holdings exceeding 4 ha. Total project cost for replanting, excluding
contingencies, is estimated at about M$64 million. Although most replanting
will be done by individual smallholders, it is expected that up to 25% (about
2,250 ha) would be organized and replanted as 30 mini estates and a further
25% under Group Replanting Programs (para. 2.19). The project would also
provide simple equipment to smallholders for clearing old rubber prior to
replanting and for weed control in young rubber.
3.04      Upkeep of Immature Rubber.  About 5,260 ha of rubber replanted
under RISDA from 1976 to 1981 will continue to be eligible for the six years
phased replanting grant payments from 1982 through 1987. The project
includes the cost of these replanting grant payments estimated at about
M$11 million (para. 5.02).
3.05      New Planting.   About M$1.8 million has been provided under the
project to assist smallholders' planting new rubber totalling 320 ha. The
/1  Replanting grants are financed mainly from the cess levied on rubber
exports: for holdings less than 4 ha, 86%; and for holdings exceeding
4 ha, 80%. The balance is provided for by the Federal Government.
(Refer to paras. 1.07 and 4.05 and Annex 5, Reference C2.



- 15 -
planting would be in small scattered plots and ineligible for planting grants
through RISDA as these areas have generated no contribution to the cess funds
(para. 1.07). This activity would be implemented through RISDA's nongrant
development program.
3.06      Nursery Development.  The project would establish a central
nursery of 48 ha to bring the total RISDA nursery area in the State to about
63 ha (para. 5.05). RISDA already has a 15 ha nursery in Masjid Tanah
subdistrict. The additional land would be acquired in 1982 at an estimated
cost of about M$1.2 million and brought into production over the next two
years. At full production, the nurseries would provide planting material
for 1,800 ha of replanting per year. Nursery development expenditures would
include roads, drains, fences, water and electricity supplies and buildings.
3.07      Processing Facilities.  RISDA has assisted in the establishment of
about 130 Group Processing Centers (GPC) for farmers to process latex into
rubber sheet. The project would continue this program by providing for some
12 new GPCs per year bringing the total to 202. Each GPC would be provided
with basic processing equipment and a weighing platform. Three new
smokehouses each of 12-15 tons capacity would be constructed in central
locations, quadrupling present capacity. The project will also build a
central store of 900 tons capacity for RISDA to store rubber prior to
marketing and export.
Infrastructure Development
3.08      Small Irrigation Schemes.  The project provides for construction
of one new scheme of 66 ha and rehabilitation of five existing schemes
serving about 1,850 ha. The schemes, which would be not less than 40 ha
with a minimum economic rate of return of 10%, would be evaluated, selected
and prepared on the same criteria adopted under the National Small-Scale
Irrigation project (Loan 1444-MA). The schemes would be selected on their
individual merits and the initial technical and economic analysis would be
carried out by Malacca State DID. Final evaluation, preparation and design
would be done at the Federal level.
3.09      A new irrigation scheme at Brisu in Alor Gajah district covering
about 66 ha would be developed under the project. A concrete weir and a
regulatory intake structure to the main canal would be constructed. Other
structures include canal cross regulators, constant head orifices, culverts,
field turn-outs and drainage requirements. To minimize seepage losses
certain reaches of the main and secondary canals would be concrete lined, a
common practice in Malaysia as it reduces the fill, permits higher velocities
than earth canals and reduces maintenance. About 4 kms of canal would be
concrete lined and a new drain of about 1.5 km would be constructed. Earth
canals would be cut with side slopes of 1 1/2:1 or 2:1. On-farm irrigation
facilities would be provided to improve water control and make 100% cropping

intensity possible during the main season, and about 60% in the off-season
season. During the off-season, cash crops would be cultivated in areas
where water supply is adequate.
3.10      The irrigation conveyance system and drainage facilities for
the five existing schemes would be improved. The area under double cropping
of padi is expected to increase from 350 ha to about 1,000 ha; and about
100 ha of cash-crops would receive off-season water under the project.
Existing canals would be improved to increase their capacity and efficiency.
Most of the structures would be rehabilitated including seven diversion
structures (of which two are pumping sets), about 54 km of canals and 22 km
of drains. In order to reduce fill material for canal embankments and/or to
eliminate seepage, concrete lining would be carried out in a number of
locations along the canals.

3.11      Drainage Improvement Schemes.  The project would improve the
following three drainage schemes serving about 1,000 ha which are subject to
frequent water logging and backup: (a) Merlimau; (b) the extension to
Merlimau; and (c) Padang Temu. The improvement works would include the
upgrading and intensification of drainage network, provision of additional
drainage and tidal control structures and construction of river bunds.



- 17 -
3.12      Merlimau drainage scheme would be provided with a higher intensity
internal drainage system since the main drains are adequate to meet augmented
drainage from the catchment area.  The density of the internal drainage would
be raised, wherever possible, from its present level of about 10 meters/ha to
about 30 meters/ha.  An additional tidal control gate would be constructed
adjacent to the existing gate to accommodate runoff. The drainage
improvement will benefit about 490 ha. An area of about 70 ha lies outside
the Merlimau river bund and is subject to frequent inundation. This area
would be reclaimed by constructing a bund and internal drains to connect with
existing drains in the main Merlimau scheme.
3.13      Because of recent development in the hinterland, the run-off has
increased appreciably causing periodic inundation of Padang Temu drainage
scheme. Improvement under the project would include widening of existing
main and secondary drains, strengthening of the protection bund and
construction of an additional tidal control gate adjacent to the existing
one. Table 3.1 summarizes the proposed irrigation schemes included under the
project.
3.14      River Improvement Works.  Six river channels would be improved
under the project, including widening and/or canalization and construction
of bunds and structures. Undersized culverts and structures would be
replaced and additional drainage inlets and outfalls provided. About 50 km
of river banks would be trained benefitting an area of about 1,600 ha.
Table 3.2 summarizes the proposed drainage and river improvement schemes and
details of works are in Annex 5, Reference Cl.
3.15      Farm and Access Roads.  The project would provide about 140 km of
access and farm roads in 52 segments. Access roads would serve the proposed
rubber mini-estates and existing agricultural areas; and farm roads would
be within and leading to the irrigation and drainage schemes. Existing
village access roads would be upgraded to all-weather standards and existing
tracks would be widened, reshaped and realigned where necessary. Farm roads
would be spaced, wherever possible, so that farms would not be further than
800 m from a road. Farm roads and access roads would have 3 m wide carriage
way with 60 cm wide shoulders. However, where land acquisition is a problem,
farm roads could be 2.0 m wide with about 50 cm shoulders. Roads would
generally be constructed from earth fill, free from organic matter, properly
watered and compacted. The surfacing material (5-7.5 cm thick) would be
spread, leveled, graded mechanically and compacted to form the wearing course
and would meet PWD minimum all weather traffic requirements. Generally, the
roads would be designed on a working traffic load of 5 tons and provided with
the necessary parallel and cross drainage.
Crop Development Programs
3.16      Padi Seed Multiplication.  Improved varieties would be introduced.
Selected seed growers covering about 16 ha would produce 48 tons annually.

In addition, about 12 tons of similar seed would be purchased from
agricultural stations each year. The quantity of seed available for sale or
exchange to padi tarmers would be sufficient for planting about 2,400 ha
annually, or over 60% of Malacca's padi area seed requirements.
3.17      Cash Crop Diversification.  Planting of short term crops would be
encouraged through Government assistance to farmers for planting materials,
fencing materials and purchase of small farm equipment. To overcome man-
power shortages and lack of capital, the assistance would include a plough-
ing subsidy of M$150/ha for rehabilitation of idle padi fields, grants of
between M$50-100/ha tor planting materials ot short-term crops tor otf-season
planting in padi areas, and M$200/ha for fencing materials to protect off-
season crops. Subsidy payments would be made once only to individuals, and
group participation would be encouraged. Subsidy payments ot up to 50% of
cost for the purchase of ridging plough, power sprayer or water pump, would
be granted to farmers commencing full time commercial vegetable production on
a minimum area of 1 ha. An estimated 245 ha of sweet potato (about 65% of



- 19 -
the present planted area), would be grown as an off-season crop in padi
areas. About 140 ha of other commercial cash crops would also be planted
annually.
3.18      Dusun Rehabilitation.  About 810 ha of existing smallholder
orchards and house lots with mixed fruit trees would be rehabilitated.
This would consist of selective felling, clearing and tree pruning, supply
of replacement planting materials, fertilizers, pesticides and loan of
mechanical equipment to participating community groups. Government assist-
ance would be given to participants, amounting to about M$220 per household
for materials and operating costs for mechanical equipment (para. 5.14) to
assist smallholders to upgrade their dusun.
Dairy and Fishery Development
3.19      Dairy Development.  About 2,500 cross-bred dairy cattle /1 would be
distributed to smallholders throughout the State as in-calf heifers./2 The
animals would be imported as weaners, aged 6 to 9 months old, or as year-
lings, then raised on a DVS cattle raising center, artificially inseminated
at age 18-24 months and distributed to participants as in-calf heifers when
about six months pregnant (paras. 4.18-4.19). On-farm fodder grass develop-
ment would amount to about 250 ha, and about 1,000 cattle sheds with feed
storage and water supply facilities would be constructed by participants./3
A milk collection center with capacity for handling about 1,350 liters/day
would be constructed and equipped to handle the milk produced by farmers in
east Alor Gajah district.
3.20      Fishpond Development.  The project would assist DOF (para. 4.20)
with its freshwater fishpond development program by constructing about
1,200 ponds with a total area of about 260 ha. This would increase the total
area of ponds in the State to about 370 ha. Existing idle padi lands would
be eligible on conversion of their land use titles. The current government
subsidy meets pond constructon costs up to a maximum of about M$3,000/pond of
0.2 ha size (paras. 4.20 and 5.21).
Pilot Schemes and Studies
3.21      A study would be undertaken by consultants (paras. 3.24 and 4.26)
to prepare two schemes in Kuala Sungei Baru and Kuala Linggi for conversion
of about 160 ha of largely idle agricultural lands to perennial crops,
/1 Animals which are the progeny of temperate country dairy cows (e.g.,
Friesian) mated to Bos indicus dairy type bull (e.g., Sahiwal, Sindhi).
/2 Each would cost about M$2,000, but would be sold at subsidized cost to
farmers at M$1,100. Bank Pertanian Malaysia would lend this amount
interest-free repayable in three years (para. 4.23).
/3 M$200 loan assistance for materials, repayable in 3 years.

probably oil palm.  The study would include a detailed soil survey, a revised
land utilization plan, infrastructure plans and a report on land tenure
aspects using data from a recently completed socio-economic survey of land
owners and tenants. The study would also include an implementation plan for
land aggregation and agricultural development. Agency responsibilities in
the management of the scheme and the nature of farmer organization and
participation would also be covered. A comprehensive study on the
utilization of about 4,000 ha of agricultural lands which are no longer in
production in Malacca State would also be undertaken by consultants to
identify the constraints against and opportunities for more intensive
production. An assurance was obtained that the Government would submit, by
June 30, 1982, the terms of reference of consultants to be employed for
carrying out the studies on the use of idle agricultural lands for the Bank's
review and comment.
Buildings
3.22      All project agencies are currently headquartered in Malacca Town.
However, additional offices, storage space and staff quarters are required in
the districts. To provide facilities for the Kompleks Geraktani (KGT)
(para. 2.22), separate office blocks would be needed. Under the project
four KGTs and three KGT subcenters would be built at different locations
around the State. Each KGT will occupy an area of 1.2 to 2.0 ha and will be
equipped with a main office compound to house all the Farmer Organization
Authority's (FOA) staff together with the representatives of the individual
agencies. Within each compound, ten staff quarters for FOA (para. 4.17)
would also be constructed. Staff quarters for other agencies would also be
provided at remote locations where employees would be required on a
continuous basis. The project would also provide for a variety of agricul-
tural facilities including a milk collection center (para. 3.19), an agri-
cultural marketing center (para. 4.21), three rubber smoke houses
(para. 3.07), and expansion of an extension training center. Construction of
all project buildings would be through DID (para. 3.25). Annex 1, Table 2
shows the building requirements of individual agencies.
Equipment and Vehicles
3.23      Vehicles and equipment would be purchased for project operation and
maintenance, training and agricultural support services. DOA would be pro-
vided with equipment for training and extension programs. DID vehicle and
equipment pools would be enlarged for maintenance of canals, drains, river
training and farm roads. Agricultural equipment and vehicles would also be
provided for RISDA, DOA, DOF, DVS and FOA. The routine maintenance of equip-
ment for most Ministry of Agriculture agencies would be carried out in a well
equipped FOA Farm Mechanization Service Center and branch workshops in the
State, financed under an ADB Loan. RISDA's own workshop is adequate for
minor repairs. For major repairs, Malacca Town has a number of well equipped
private workshops. A complete list of equipment and vehicles to be provided
under the project is in Annex 1, Table 3.



- 21 -
Consultant Services
3.24      About 366 man-months of consultant services totalling about
US$1.0 million would be financed under the project. DID would employ local
consultants for design and construction supervision (para. 4.08); and MOA for
design and planning of pilot crop development schemes and a comprehen-
sive study on the utilization of about 4,000 ha of idle agricultural land
(para. 3.21), and to provide expert advice to the Planning and Development
Division and the Project Director on various aspects of project planning,
management and monitoring (para. 4.27).
Status of Engineering
3.25      Preliminary studies were carried out to a sufficient degree to
permit initial planning, design and cost estimates. The construction
quantities were estimated from profiles and cross-sections from existing
main and secondary canals. Cost estimates for rehabilitation of on-farm
facilities (tertiaries and field channels) and field drains were based on
quantity estimates per unit area. Sufficient investigations have also been
made to ensure availability of construction materials. More detailed
investigation will be required for final designs and tendering. For the
final design of access and farm roads, the investigation would include
survey, planning and consultation with the farmers affected. As DID would
be responsible for construction of all project buildings, they will
coordinate with other project agencies on specifications, land acquisition,
and financing before carrying out design and construction. Staff quarters
are generally designed to the GOM standards. Annex 5, Reference Cl shows
the status of engineering of the project works.
Implementation Schedule
3.26      The project would be implemented over six years (mid-1982 to mid-
1988). All works are expected to be completed by June 30, 1988. The pro-
posed implementation schedule is shown in Fig. 3.1. Preparation of
detailed designs and tender documents for the project works to be carried
out during the first year would be ready by mid-1982. By end 1984 all topo-
graphic survey, planning, design, evaluation of schemes and land acquisition
would be completed. Construction activities would gradually increase and
peak in 1985. Equipment and vehicle procurement would be phased with field
requirements, but grouped as much as possible for ICB purposes. The various
project agencies would recruit all needed staff and construct facilities
over the first three years of the project. Consultants would be engaged to
assist DID in design and construction supervision.
Cost Estimate
3.27      Total project costs for the 6 year period 1982-88, in mid-1982
prices, are estimated at US$76.4 million, with a foreign exchange component
of US$25.0 million, or 33%. The cost estimates exclude all known taxes and
duties. For civil works and land development, cost estimates are based on
quantities and unit prices prepared by the implementing agencies. Consultant

expenditures for DID preparatory works totalling about US$0.3 million prior
to mid-1982 have been included in the cost calculations. Unit prices are in
line with recent bid prices in Malaysia. Physical contingencies of 15% were
applied for the main activities such as irrigation and rubber replanting,
5% for buildings, equipment and vehicles, and 20% for imported heifers and
pilot schemes development. Expected price increases over the project imple-
mentation period amount to 29% of base costs plus physical contingencies,
assuming the price escalation below for both toreign and local expenditures
of 8.5% in 1982, 7.5% in 1983-85, and 6.0% in 1986-88. Details of the
project costs are given in Annexes 1 and 5 and are summarized in Table 3.3.

Financing
3.28      The proposed Bank loan of US$25.4 million, including a front-end
fee of US$0.4 million, would finance the full foreign exchange requirements
of the project. The loan would include about US$0.3 million of retroactive
financing for project start-up activities included in project costs (para.
3.27). The Government's contribution of US$51.4 million would be financed
through annual budgetary allocations.
Procurement
3.29      Works:  All project works are small and widely scattered and
implementation would entail interaction with large number of farmers, oper-
ating staff, and with Government land acquisition teams. Such works, con-
sisting of small irrigation and drainage schemes, farm and access roads, and
buildings, totalling about US$12.0 million, including physical and price
contingencies, have estimated contract size less than US$2.5 million and are
unlikely to interest foreign bidders. Of the 22 contracts expected to be
awarded under this arrangement, the largest would be about US$2.2 million
for drainage and irrigation and the rest would be less than US$1.3 million
each. The average contract size would be about US$500,000. These works
would be procured by local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures which are
satisfactory to the Bank, with foreign bidders having the opportunity to
participate.

supervision.
3.30      Rubber replanting for mini-estates (para. 3.03) covering some
2,250 ha and valued at about US$4.0 million would be let through LCB. The
balance, totalling about US$24 million, involving scattered smallholdings,
would be carried out by individual or groups of farmers under close RISDA
supervision. Fishpond development, dusun rehabilitation and cash crop
development would also be carried out by individual or groups of farmers
under close supervision by relevant agencies.
3.31      Goods.  Equipment, totalling about US$1.3 million including
contingencies, would be grouped in appropriate bidding packages and procured
by international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank



- 25 -
Guidelines. Qualifying domestic manufacturers would receive a preference in
bid evaluation of 15% or the import duty, whichever is lower. Vehicles in
various packages estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$200,000
each and the equivalent of US$600,000 in the aggregate required by the
implementing agencies would be procured under LCB procedures which are
satisfactory to the Bank. Off-the-shelf items of equipment, in packages
costing less than US$25,000 each and not more than the equivalent of
US$100,000 in the aggregate would be procured in accordance with the normal
Government procurement procedures, satisfactory to the Bank.
3.32      Procurement of dairy heifers to be imported under the project
would be made through prudent international shopping. The successful bidder
would be required to arrange for the breeding and raising of crossbred
heifer calves, and shipment ot animals as weaners or yearlings. The con-
tract should provide for the staff of the Department of Veterinary Services
to make the selection of animals for shipment to Malaysia, and further
health inspection on arrival in Malaysia. The estimated cost of imported
heifers would be about US$3.5 million, including physical and price
contingencies.
3.33      Contract Review.  A threshold for prior review of contract docu-
ments of US$2.5 million has been established in the three most recent pro-
jects in Malaysia (Loans 1957, 1960, and 2013-MA). This threshold approxi-
mately coincides with the Ministerial level tender approval ceiling within
the Government. The larger contracts in the project would be tendered by
DID, which is implementing two of the projects mentioned above, as well as
six other ongoing Bank projects, and which is fully conversant with Bank
procurement guidelines. No contracts are anticipated to reach the threshold
under this project, and hence all contract review would occur after execu-
tion of the contracts, but prior to submission of withdrawal applications to
the Bank. A review of the first draft bidding documents would be required
but only random post review would be conducted thereafter.
3.34      For goods, bidding packages over US$500,000 equivalent would be
subject to prior review resulting in coverage of about 70% of total goods
contracted. The balance of contracts would be subject to random post review
by the Bank after contract award. In respect of the dairy heifers, the
estimated three bidding packages, would be subject to the Bank's prior
review.
Disbursements
3.35      Disbursements from the Bank loan would be made at the rate of 100%
against the foreign exchange cost of directly imported vehicles and equip-
ment, or the ex-factory price net of taxes for items manufactured locally,
and at the rate of 80% of the total costs of imported items procured
locally. Disbursement for civil works executed by contract would be 56% of
total costs. For rubber replanting and maintenance, disbursement would be
at the rate of 56% of the replanting grant based on certified quarterly



- 26 -
statement of expenditures. Related documents would be retained by RISDA and
made available to Bank missions for inspection. For crossbred dairy heifers,
disbursement would be made at the rate of 100% against the foreign exchange
cost. For consulting services and overseas training, disbursements would
equal 100% of total expenditures. No disbursement would be made against cash
crop subsidies, dusun rehabilitation, fishpond development and family income
maintenance loans. Disbursements from the Bank loan would not exceed the
foreign exchange component of the project. The proposed allocation of loan
proceeds is presented in Annex 1, Table 6.
3.36      The schedule of disbursements has been projected with the follow-
ing assumptions:
(a) the project provides for retroactive financing from October 1981
totalling about US$0.3 million;
(b) disbursements may be delayed by up to 18 months behind the
implementation schedule based on past experience with similar
projects in the country; and
(c) a number of small irrigation and drainage schemes which would
be implemented by small contractors may face some land acquisi-
tion delays.
Disbursements are somewhat faster than the country subsector profile. These
reflects expected improvements in the implementation of the rubber replanting
and maintenance component, but a more conservative estimate than actual over-
all experience of area development projects in the region (Annex 1, Table 7).
It is expected that disbursements would be completed by December 31, 1989.
Accounts and Audits
3.37      The agencies involved in the project are all subject to normal
government controls and audit procedures. Assurances were obtained that all
agencies involved in project implementation would maintain separate project
accounts which would be collated by the Project Director; these accounts
would be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank; and
forwarded to the Bank within nine months of the close of each financial year.
Environmental Effects
3.38      Land development would be carried out within the guidelines of the
Malaysian Conservation Act which provides adequate safeguards against
erosion, siltation and excessive flooding. The scattered nature of
development would limit the impact of increased run-ott and ot dissolved
plant nutrients. Improvements to drainage and river channels would prevent
occurrence of standing water and flooding and thereby mitigate crop damage.

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Organization and Coordination
4.01      The six participating agencies in the project are:  the Rubber
Industry Smallholders Development Authority (RISDA), under the Ministry
of Land and Regional Development; the Drainage and Irrigation Department
(DID); the Department of Agriculture (DOA); the Farmer's Organization
Authority (FOA); the Department of Veterinary Services (DVS); and the
Department of Fisheries (DOF), all under the jurisdiction of the Ministry
of Agriculture (MOA). Other supporting agencies include: the Federal
Agricultural Marketing Authority (FAMA); the Malaysian Agricultural Research
and Development Institute (MARDI); the Bank Pertanian Malaysia (BPM); the
National Padi and Rice Authority (LPN); and the Department of Lands and
Mines (DLM). Their respective responsibilities are detailed in paras. 4.05-
4.25.
4.02      A Project Director appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA)
would be responsible for overall project direction. He would be guided on
policy matters by a Steering Committee composed of representatives from all
government agencies with project responsibilities, co-chaired by the
Secretary General of MOA and the State Secretary of Malacca. He would be a
member of the Malacca State Agricultural Planning Research Development and
Extension Committee composed of senior State-level officers from all the
agricultural-related agencies. The Project Director and his staff would
reside in the project area. A suitably qualified Project Director has
already been appointed and the appointment of two of his key staff, an
accounting officer and an economist, is a condition of loan effectiveness.
The former would be for financial administration and the latter for monitor-
ing and evaluation (para. 4.04). Involvement of the State Secretary (the
highest ranking civil servant in Malacca) in the Steering Committee, who has
broad executive authority, would ensure participation of both State and
district level agencies and officers and coordination of project activities.
This management structure has worked satisfactorily in previous Bankfinanced
multicomponent agricultural development projects (Loans 973-MA, 1294-MA,
1444-MA, 1522-MA, and 1632-MA) and a similar structure was adopted for two
recently approved projects (Loans 1957-MA and 1960-MA). The proposed
management structure is in line with the Federal and State responsibilities
and jurisdictions under the Malaysian constitution. For greater efficiency,
the Government recently decided that funds for MOA agencies involved in
multi-component agricultural development projects will be allocated through
MOA.
4.03      The Project Director will be responsible for:  (a) monitoring
the plans, programs and schedules of implementing agencies and synchronizing
their activities with the overall project schedule; (b) preparing annual
project budgets, including staff and training requirements and procurement
of vehicles and equipment; (c) coordinating multiagency agricultural support



- 28 -
programs; (d) representing project management in meetings with Government
agencies, such as the Treasury and Public Service Department for fund
approvals and releases and for staffing requirements; and (e) reporting
progress at regular intervals to the Government and the Bank. Assurances
were obtained that the Project Director would: (i) furnish by December 31,
1982 proposals for coordinating and integrating the various agencies'
agricultural extension programs serving all groups of farmers for Bank's
review and comment, and (ii) prepare by June 30, 1984, a manual detailing
the operational roles of the various agricultural agencies as a guide for
field staff. It will be organized on the basis of crop and agricultural
commodity production activities.
4.04      The proposed organization of the Office of the Project Director
and the line agencies is shown in Figure 4.1. The Project Director's Office
will have two sections - Finance and Administration, and Planning and
Development. The Finance and Administration Section will collate the annual
budgets, for approval by the Steering Committee, of the implementing agen-
cies; ensure the smooth flow of funds to implementing agencies; prepare
periodic financial reports to the Bank, the MOA and other Government agen-
cies; and monitor disbursements of the project components. The functions of
the Planning and Development Section include (a) coordination of planning and
implementation in accordance with approved budgets; (b) monitoring and
collection of project inputs, outputs and complementary activities; (c)
assistance with the concerned agencies in preparation of agricultural support
programs; and (d) conduct studies in cooperation with MOA.
Agency Responsibilities
4.05      Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority.  RISDA, an
autonomous agency under the Ministry of Lands and Regional Development, would
be responsible for replanting, extension, processing, and other assistance
to rubber smallholders including marketing. Over 95% of smallholder
production is processed and marketed by private traders and MARDEC. RISDA
administers several assistance schemes for the benefit of replanters. Most
important is the rubber replanting grant which is paid in installments of
cash and kind at scheduled intervals for about six years provided defined
standards of upkeep of the immature rubber are met. The grant, financed
from a cess on rubber exports and a Federal government contribution, is
designed to cover all development and upkeep costs including land
preparation, planting materials, fertilizers and chemicals up to the start
of tapping. The amount and scope of grant are shown below.

Replanting/new planting of old rubber land with                M$ 3,700 per ha
other crops
Details of phasing ot grant payments are shown in Annex 5, Reference C2.
Another RISDA administered scheme is the family income maintenance loan
started in 1981 for farmers owning and operating less than 4 ha of rubber
approved for replanting grants. Subject to certain limiting conditions of
other income, they may receive a loan of M$100/family/month, repayable
interest free over 15 years from year 9 after replanting. For mini-estates
(para. 2.19), RISDA pays rent for the land it acquires under leasehold from
the smallholders. Currently owners receive M$37/ha/month, continuing
throughout immaturity and until such time as each owner has reimbursed RISDA
for development costs above the level of the replanting grant at which time
the lease reverts. These costs arise from the higher standards of replanting
and the provision of such field infrastructure as access and farm roads,
perimeter fencing, drains and bridges and land terracing. Throughout the
leasehold period, each owner may work on the mini-estate at commercial wage
rates.
4.06      RISDA also promotes among small farmers the formation of Group
Processing Centers (GPC) in village locations, meeting the cost of construc-
tion of a processing shed and equipment and assisting members in the group
marketing of their rubber to village dealers. Each GPC would be operated by
a group of about 25 smallholders. RISDA enters these markets competitively
to ensure the farmers receive a fair price and processes these and other
purchases into standard quality block rubber for export by RISDA's national
Marketing Division under their registered mark.
4.07      The expanding operations of RISDA under the project would require
significant strengthening of its extension service and the introduction
of field monitoring activities to achieve a better insight into replanting
standards and to increase the annual rate of replanting. Currently field
staff are largely concerned with the regulatory and administrative processes
of the grant schemes and other benefits for smallholders. The project would
expand the number of field officers (ARO grade) by 24 to a total of 75 of



- 30 -
which 15, or an average of three for each of RISDA's district/subdistrict
offices, would be concerned with extension/monitoring services. The
increase would improve the overall ratio of ARO field officers to farmers
from 1:470 to 1:320. The proposed increases in supervisory staff include
one in each office responsible for extension/monitoring activities. The
balance of the additional RO and ARO staff would be required for increasing
regulatory work.
4.08      Drainage and Irrigation Department.  DID would be responsible for
the construction and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage works, river
improvements, buildings and farm and access roads except farm roads within
RISDA mini-estates. Detailed design and construction supervision would be
done by DID with the assistance of consultants (paras. 3.24 and 4.26). To
ensure that design concepts of the irrigation and drainage schemes are fully
understood by District-level staff who will maintain and operate the com-
pleted systems, an assurance was obtained that DID, on completion of final
design, would prepare a designers' operations manual covering the major
works in the project. Malacca State DID would be responsible for operation
and maintenance after project completion and acceptance by Federal DID.
4.09      DID would formulate a detailed construction program in coopera-
tion with the various concerned agencies and would be responsible for
construction of all project buildings and access roads. The designs and
layout would be agreed with the agencies concerned who would assist DID in
site selection and land acquisition (para. 3.25).
4.10      Department of Agriculture.  DOA would be responsible tor the
agricultural support services, particularly tarmer training and
extension; training of tractor operators; supply of seeds, planting
materials and other inputs for crop intensification and diversification; and
administration of crop subsidy schemes.
4.11      The Malacca State Director of Agriculture would have overall
administrative responsibility for programming and implementing of the DOA
project components. The agricultural officer in-charge of extension and
training would be responsible for technical guidance and supervision.
Particular attention would be given to determining the content of training
courses in relation to the priority needs for management skills and
technical knowledge of different categories of farmers. Thus, training
courses for field staff, farmer group leaders, or groups of farmers would
concentrate primarily on current problems and on-going schedules of field
extension activities. The impact of extension programs would be monitored
and evaluated by the agricultural officer in-charge, and used to formulate
training programs.
4.12      Additional agricultural technicians (AT's) recruited under the
project would improve the ratio of field extension agents to farmers from
the current 1:1,000 to about 1:600. The AT's would undertake T&V system



- 31 -
extension work already being practised in the State, under the guidance of
district supervisors (agricultural assistants) and AO subject matter
specialists. To enable extension staff to devote full time to extension and
training, a regulatory unit would manage and distribute subsidized inputs,
and carry out crop monitoring and measurement and other regulatory work.
4.13      Other DOA activities would include collaboration with MARDI in
field varietal trials, demonstrations of drying, processing, and storage
methods, demonstration plots on farmers' fields to encourage use of improved
varieties and proper management techniques, and technical back-stopping for
the extension services.
4.14      The forecasting and control of major pest and disease outbreaks,
regulation of pesticide use, and general support to extension through pest
and disease identification and prescription of remedial measures is the
responsibility of the Federal DOA Crop Protection Service. In conjunction
with the Crop Production Specialists, it would conduct observations and
demonstration plots on measures to reduce crop losses due to pests and
diseases, which would be passed to the extension personnel.
4.15      The Federal DOA Soils and Analytical Services provide surveys and
analyses for the project area. It would be responsible for the design of
soil management systems and, with the extension service, for advising
farmers on improved practices, particularly fertilizer use.
4.16       Several agricultural problems in Malacca, for example, change of
land use, land aggregation with development of perennial crops, cropping
intensification and mechanization requirements, require specialized advisory
services. Planning for specific schemes would be undertaken by senior staff
of the State DOA, with technical assistance from Federal DOA subject matter
specialists and MARDI as required, in consultation with other agencies
such as DID, DLM and FOA. During the establishment of schemes of 100 ha or
more involving group management by farmers, the district agricultural
assistant responsible for providing technical guidance would be supported
by Federal DOA and/or MARDI agricultural specialists. This would apply to
the pilot development schemes planned for Kuala Sungei Baru and Kuala Linggi
(para.3.21).
4.17       Farmers' Organization Authority.  FOA is responsible for manage-
ment and staffing of the farmers' cooperatives, mechanized agricultural
services especially tractor hire, fertilizers and agrochemicals, and training
for staff and members of the farmers' cooperatives. For FOA staff, special-
ized courses on project planning and management would also be provided.
Farmer training would be in different levels in various spheres. Those in
leadership positions would be given project orientation training to explain
project concepts, the management system, and responsibilities of field
staff. Special training sessions addressing topics such as cooperative
principles and management, supervision and credit would also be conducted.



- 32 -
4.18      Department of Veterinary Services.  DVS is responsible for animal
health and livestock production projects for smaliholders. The State
Director of Veterinary Services would be responsible for the coordination of
operations and support services for the expanding State dairy industry
especially between the new milk collection center to be provided under the
project and the main milk collection center at Jasin. DVS would be respon-
sible, in consultation with village committees, for selecting participating
farmers, and arranging for training in dairy husbandry at a Federal DVS
training center (normally Kluang). An assurance was obtained that selected
farmers would be suitably trained in dairy husbandry before receiving their
dairy animals. The MCC staff would be responsible for assisting
participants with on-farm development and in providing extension and support
services, including supplies of concentrate feed, veterinary drugs, and AI
services.
4.19      The importation of suitable dairy cross-bred heifers and the
breeding and rearing of animals prior to distribution as in-calf heifers to
farmers would be the responsibility of DVS. As facilities for handling
imported stock are not available in Malacca, an assurance was obtained that
the Government, prior to the importation, would make arrangements for
rearing facilities for dairy animals in one or more of its DVS stations.
4.20      Department of Fisheries.  The DOF is responsible for develop-
ment ot treshwater fish ponds on farmers' land. For pond construction,
government subsidy amounts to a maximum of about M$3,000 per pond of 0.2 ha
(para. 3.20). Most ponds are designed to be 0.2 ha to qualify for the maxi-
mum subsidy which fully covers construction costs. Each farmer can
receive construction subsidy for ponds with a total area not exceeding 1.62
ha. There is an additional subsidy for cost of production inputs in the
first year (fish fry, fertilizers, lime) and amounts to M$500/pond. In
operating these subsidies, the DOF advises on pond design, inspects com-
pleted ponds and determines the material inputs for the first year of pond
production. Supply of fish stock to farmers is through fish breeding sta-
tions in other States supplemented, especially for certain carp species,
from local groups, namely small agricultural unit chiefs, cooperative
members and dealers. Fisheries officers are also responsible for providing
farmers with an extension service on the technical aspects of fish culture,
attending to their production problems, and arranging short training courses
at inland fisheries centers for all new fish farmers.
4.21      Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority.  FAMA would be respon-
sible for marketing agricultural produce such as fruits and vegetables,
cocoa and coconut. FAMA would expand its marketing activities by estab-
lishing an agricultural marketing center under the project, and its market
intelligence, price surveys and marketing research activities.
4.22      Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute.  No
direct contributions to MARDI facilities or operations are included in the
project. The research services provided by MARDI in connection with the



- 33 -
project would include freshwater fish research (Batu Berendam station)
annual crops production and soil technology. MARDI's central stations cover
most aspects of agricultural research, including livestock and fisheries.
Technologies developed from these activities will be evaluated and modified
to suit project requirements through location specific trials. The
Extension Liaison Unit, established as an integral part of the Federal DOA
Extension Branch to strengthen the support and coordination of research and
extension, would be the main channel of communication between MARDI and the
DOA. An additional link, the State Agricultural Planning Research and
Development Extension Committee (SARDEC) has been established to coordinate
research and other agricultural activities.
4.23      Bank Pertanian Malaysia.  BPM would provide credit trom its own
resources to smallholders either directly or, for cooperative members,
through FOA. BPM would also provide other rural banking services. The
Malacca Branch of BPM opened in early 1979. Under the Fourth Malaysia Plan,
the Jasin sub-branch was opened in late 1981; sub-branches will be opera-
tional in the following districts: Alor Gajah, 1982; Merlimau, 1983; and
Masjid Tanah, 1985. In 1980, BPM lent about M$3.6 million in the state
mainly for short-term crop loans.  Under the Government's poverty alleviation
strategy, lending for poverty alleviation would be interest-free. With the
introduction of fertilizer subsidy to padi farmers in late 1979, lending by
BPM to this group has declined. For dairy development, the total BPM credit
requirement in the project would about M$2.8 million.
4.24      National Padi and Rice Authority.  LPN was established in 1971 as
a Statutory body to ensure: fair and stable padi and rice prices for
farmers, and consumers; adequate rice supplies to meet emergencies, and to
recommend policies to promote padi development. The purchase price of padi
is reviewed annually by Government with advice from LPN which buys padi
in the rice growing areas, provides drying, storage and processing services,
and sells rice to wholesalers. LPN compiles rice-related statistics and
conducts research on rice grade and quality. LPN is responsible for admin-
istering price support, providing and maintaining padi drying, storage and
rice milling facilities and marketing services. LPN would act as a support
agency in the project.
4.25      Department of Lands and Mines (DLM).  DLM would be responsible
for land acquisition and property compensation assisted by a Federal
Mobile Task Force. To speed up action, the Task Force has already commenced
field work. About 105 ha would be acquired for project works, of which
about 48 ha would be for RISDA and about 43 ha for DID. Details of this
component are shown in Annex 5, Reference C.
Consultant Services
4.26      The total cost of the 366 man-months of consultants services, of
which 336 local and 30 toreign would be about US$1.0 million: DID, US$0.6
million; and MOA, US$0.4 million. The average cost of local consultants
(including salary, overhead, profits, local travel and allowances) is



- 34 -
estimated to be about US$2,200 per man-month and the average cost of
expatriate consultants, about US$8,700 per man-month (Annex 1, Table 4).
4.27       DID has extensive experience in the design, execution and operation
of irrigation and drainage works, and is fully qualified to design the pro-
ject works. However, DID is currently designing and supervising construc-
tion of projects to the limits of its current capacity. For this reason,
DID would require 286 man-months of local consultants for design and
construction supervision under the project, of which 120 man-months would be
utilized before implementation begins. MOA would employ local consultants
for 50 man-months to undertake a comprehensive study of agricultural land
utilization, with particular reference to idle and under-utilized lands (see
para. 3.21). MOA would also engage consultants (30 man-months) to advise
the Project Director and MOA's Planning and Development Division in planning,
programming, coordination and monitoring and evaluation of multicomponent
projects. Consultants would be selected in accordance with the principles
and procedures described by the Bank Guidelines. An assurance was obtained
that consultants engaged under the project would be employed under terms of
reference and under conditions acceptable to the Bank.
Training
4.28      The project would provide funds for local and overseas training
for selected MOA, DOA, DVS, and DOF staff. In MOA, professional staff of
the Planning and Development Division, most of whom have less than two years
experience, would be sent overseas for three to six month courses in project
planning, preparation and management in Europe, America or Australia. Three
staffmembers from the Project Director-s Office would be similarly trained.
About 60 man-months totalling US$0.2 million have been provided for this
purpose. For DOA, short- and medium-term courses would be held for an
additional 300 trainees annually by expanding existing facilities at Sungei
Udang. Training would include courses for tractor operators, leadership
training for potential farmer group leaders, courses in agriculture and home
economics for rural youths and farmers. In-service training courses would
also be conducted for field extension staff. For DVS, practical training in
dairy husbandry would be organized at a DVS training center for smallholders
selected to receive in-calf heifers. Short-term overseas training, totall-
ing about 30 man-months, would be provided for MCC staff in dairy technology
and fodder management.
4.29       The DOF training component comprises 24 weeks of local study and
42 weeks of overseas study at a total cost of about US$29,000. Local train-
ing at a two week aquaculture course at a State Fish Breeding Center would be
provided for all Assistant Fisheries Officers (AFO) at the rate of two
officers per year. Overseas study-training programs of 6 weeks duration to
keep abreast with modern technology would be provided for seven officers at
a regional fishery center (e.g, in Thailand, Philippines). Provision has
been made for the State Director to visit regional centers to determine
suitable locales and study programs.



- 35 -
Staffing
4.30      The implementing agencies would require additional staff under the
project (Annex 5, Reference C) phased over the six-year implementation
period. An assurance was obtained that the Government shall ensure that
adequate staff positions required for the implementation and, thereafter,
operation and maintenance of the project are established as and when needed
and that qualified staff are appointed in a timely manner.
Operation and Maintenance
4.31      The Malacca State DID would operate and maintain the irrigation
and drainage facilities and works to the tertiary level. The estimated
annual O&M cost for DID facilities is M$45 per ha. The farmers, under the
guidance of DID irrigation overseers, would be responsible for the operations
below the tertiary offtakes. As improved water control and management are
key elements in achieving yield targets and cropping intensities, irrigation
overseers would instruct farmers on planned water distribution and management.
DID would maintain the farm roads within the padi schemes; and the District
Office for access roads other than those leading to RISDA's mini-estates.
RISDA would maintain the access road to mini-estates and agricultural roads
and drains within them; the smallholder would have responsibility for main-
tenance of items within their individual holdings. The DVS would be respon-
sible for the management and operation of the milk collection center. Main-
tenance of fishponds will be carried out by the smallholders. The other
implementing agencies would be responsible for the maintenance of other
buildings and facilities which they administer. Details of the incremental

Monitoring and Evaluation
4.32      Monitoring of overall project implementation would be carried out
by the Project Director's Office (para. 4.02). Physical and financial pro-
gress reports from the implementing agencies would be collated by the
Project Director's Office and submitted to the Government and the Bank on
regular basis. Overall monitoring of project benefits would be undertaken
by the MOA through its Statistics and Economic Analysis Section (SEAS) of
the Planning and Development Division and would include benchmark surveys
and subsequent periodic surveys and evaluation. SEAS is responsible for
monitoring and evaluation of all multi-component agricultural development
projects under MOA. It will work closely with the key staff of the Project
Director and the implementing agencies in respect of the design and opera-
tional aspects of monitoring. RISDA, DOA, DVS and DOF would monitor the
benefits of their respective components. For RISDA, the monitoring officers
would determine smallholders reasons for not replanting or delay after grant
approval, phasing of potential replanters, including advice on tapping of
old rubber, and quantifying replanting performance in terms of tree density,

growth rate, yields, disease and cost of field operations. An assurance was
obtained that the Government would, by December 31, 1983, submit proposals
for monitoring and evaluation of the project for Bank's review and comment.
5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Rubber
5.01      Phasing of Development.  About 90% (8,050 ha) of the replanted
rubber will be in plots less than 4 ha with an average ot 1.6 ha and
supporting some 5,000 families. The remaining 10% or 900 ha will average
about 5 ha. The proposed rubber replanting and new planting schedule is
shown in Table 5.1. The total area to be replanted however, will be less
than the State replanting level between 1952 and 1957 (13,560 ha), and which
after 25 years of production is again ready for replanting. The estimated
amount of replanting necessary to sustain the State's smallholder rubber in a
30-year productive cycle is about 1,800 ha/year. There is a high level of
interest in replanting reflected by applications for 3,600 ha in 1981;
indications were that some 15% could be rejected for technical reasons, often
related to land title. Experience also shows that many approved
applicants do not start replanting in the year the grant is approved. Both
these issues will be examined under the projects monitoring services (para.
4.07 and 4.32).

rates shown in para. 4.05 and detailed in Annex 5, Reference C2.

5.03      Yields and Production.  The assumed yield profile of replanted
rubber of clone RRIM 600 and of old rubber stands are shown in Annex 5,
Reference C12. For holdings under 4 ha the mean annual yield is 1,170 kg/ha
and 1,280 kg/ha for holdings above 4 ha; the difference is due to better
tapping standards and the use of stimulation on renewed bark that could be
expected from larger holdings. Without replanting, old rubber might remain
in production for up to 15 additional years but with yields declining from
400 kg/ha to 250 kg/ha. Estimated total production with and without project
at intervals over 25 years is shown in Table 5.3. The net gain from
replanting is estimated at 265,000 tons rubber.

5.04       Crop Establishment.  Rubber will be replanted at a density of
555 trees/ha. Most farmers currently replant at about 500 tree/ha, but
RISDA encourages adoption of the higher rate as more appropriate for small-
holders with low requirements for hired labour. Replanting materials will
be budded stumps and polybag buddings used in an overall ratio of about 3:1.
Polybag buddings will be mostly used in mini-estates and areas near RISDA's
nurseries.
5.05      Nursery Development.  Until 1984 nursery production will be
augmented from certified commercial growers.  Thereafter the planting
materials for the project will be raised in the 63 ha of central nurseries.
Planting materials are currently distributed to farmers at a fixed price of
M20.5 each for budded stumps; and M33.0 each for polybag buddings;
production costs however amount to about M~33 and M82 each respectively.
5.06       For immature rubber, fertilizers and weeding are the main field
maintenance items, weed control being the main criterion for approval of
replanting grant payments. The replanting grant provides rock phosphate for



- 39 -
the planting holes (but little extra for dressings on the legume cover crop)
and NPK compound fertilizers for regular applications oyer the six years of
immaturity. The quantities of NPK provided however do not fully meet stand-
ard Malaysian recommendations for young rubber, the under-provision being
420 kg/ha or 15% occurring mainly in years 4 to 6 (Annex 5, Reference C
shows the comparison of recommended rates and RISDA distributed quantities
during immaturity). The reduced rate of fertilizer application can be
expected to extend the period of immaturity and lower future yield poten-
tial. The total fertilizer requirements for the project at recommended
rates are outlined in Table 5.4.

5.07      Harvesting and Processing.  Most smallholders process their latex
on their own holdings or at Group Processing Centers into air dried sheets
and arrange marketing through private village dealers. Some smallholders
sell directly to RISDA which also enter the market for small purchases in an
effort to maintain fair market prices for small farmers. RISDA currently
processes about 45 tons/month of air dried sheet.
Padi
5.08      Cropping Pattern, Yields and Production.  Padi production extends
to about 2,200 ha in the areas scheduled for irrigation and/or drainage
improvement under the project. Present yields average about 2.5 tons/ha in
the main season and 2.3 tons/ha in the off-season; a cropping intensity of
115% gives an annual padi production of about 6,300 tons. Without public
investment, little change from current production levels is likely. Some
modest yield increases from adoption of higher yielding varieties and better
farming practices as a result of extension efforts can be expected, but this
would be offset by a declining interest in padi planting in areas where
water shortage or labor problems arise. It is assumed that the present
situation would reflect the overall "without project" production situation.



- 40 -
5.09      With improved irrigation and drainage facilities and water manage-
ment, together with better distribution of inputs and improvements in
agricultural support services and machinery for land preparation, it is
expected that a cropping intensity of 160% would be achieved within three
years of the completion of project works. The expected changes in cropping
patterns, yields and production are shown in Table 5.5.

5.10      Cropping Calendar.  Nonavailability of adequate water is a
recurrent seasonal problem in many padi areas, hence the achievement of
maximum benefits from irrigation is dependent on strict adherence to a
cropping calendar. Adoption of well coordinated and uniform timing of land
preparation, nursery sowing and transplanting are particularly important to
intensify production through double cropping which would be expanded under
the project. This requires close coordination among the technical agencies
for water delivery, tractor hire services, supply of seeds and fertilizers
to meet planting schedules (para. 4.03). For the main season crop, land
preparation by tractor plowing would be undertaken in August/September to
enable transplanting at the end of September/beginning of October. Padi
varieties with a growth maturation period of 130-145 days would be planted
and crop harvest would occur during the relatively dry period of late
January to early February. Where irrigation supplies are available for an
off-season padi crop, land cultivation would be done in late February/ March
to enable transplanting in March/April and crop harvesting by late July/
early August. A cropping calendar for a sample irrigation scheme is shown
in Figure 5.1.



- 41 -
5.11       Crop Management.  Cultural practices would follow DOA recommenda-
tions based on proven research data. Through the input subsidy scheme,
farmers would have access to fertilizers for nursery and field application
and pesticides. Tractor services (to supplement the private sector), fer-
tilizers and pesticides supply would be organized by FOA. DOA would arrange
a system of padi seed exchange or sale to participating farmer groups to
ensure that pure seed of recommended improved varieties is distributed on a
3-4 year cycle. Crop damage by insects and rats is relatively severe
throughout Malacca for most seasons, and extension activities by DOA would
concentrate on concerted group action to control pests through chemical and
cultural control measures. The relatively small size of padi fields in the
project schemes limits the opportunities for mechanical harvesting; hence,
crop harvest and handling would continue to be done manually by family
labor.
5.12      Post-Harvest Crop Handling and Marketing.  At present, most padi
production in the project area is for subsistence with farm families
sun-drying their crop at home prior to storage. Sales of padi at harvest
time are made to LPN and private dealers or small local rice mills. These
mills also depend mainly on sun-drying before processing. Although there
are no large rice mills in Malacca, there is one at Muar, Johore, about
28 km south of Malacca town. The private sector is expected to expand in
line with increased project production to provide all the required handling
and marketing facilities.
Cash Crops and Fruits
5.13      Cash Crops Production.  Sweet,potato, a popular cash crop in
Malacca during the off-season between March and July in single cropped padi
land, has an annual target area under the project of 245 ha. After padi
harvest the land is cultivated mechanically and ridged. Propagation is by
stem cuttings. A fertilizer dressing of NPK 15:15:15 mixture at about
200 kg/ha is incorporated in the soil during final manual preparation of
ridges just before planting. The crop is quick in establishing ground cover
and there is minimal need for weeding. Pest or disease problems are not
normally encountered. The crop matures in 3-1/2-4 months, and yields are
about 3.7-4.0 tons/ha.
5.14      Dusun Rehabilitation.  Incremental fruit production would result
from rehabilitation of about 810 ha of existing orchards. The target area
would be at an annual rate of 120 ha for the first 4 years and then at 180
ha from year 5. Rehabilitation would involve adequate weeding, tree
pruning, application of recommended levels of fertilizer, and appropriate
pest control measures. On average, it is estimated that unproductive old
trees, extending to about 20% of the area, would be felled by chainsaw and
replaced with budgrafted material of improved varieties of rambutan 50%,
durian 25%, and mango 25%.   Rehabilitation measures would be directed at
village community groups rather than scattered individual orchards. Yields



- 42 -
from small mixed orchards are very variable; estimates of present general
yields and the yields after rehabilitation and replacement of old trees are
given in Table 5.6. It is estimated that at full development, about 12
years after commencement of rehabilitation measures, the yield increase
would be about 45% above present levels.

5.15      Marketing.  Cash crops and fruits would be marketed as fresh
produce through private traders as at present. The incremental production
of sweet potatoes amounting to about 900 tons represents an increase of
about 65% above present levels. Produce not absorbed by the local Malacca
markets would be readily saleable in Kuala Lumpur or Singapore. The
incremental production of fruits at full development would amount to about
730 tons. Population growth and per capita consumption in the rapidly
expanding urban areas in both Malacca State, and the traditional trading
outlets of Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, would allow this increased quantity
of fruits to be marketed without difficulty.
Dairy
5.16      Phasing.  Participating smallholders would be given two cross-bred
dairy-type cattle initially, and existing dairy farmers would be provided
with one or two animals depending on capacity for expansion.  A minimum
period of between 18 to 24 months is required between placing a tender
for supply of animals from an overseas contractor and receipt of the young
stock in Malaysia.  A further 18-24 months is required before distribution
as in-calf heifers to smallholders, and another 3 months before they calve
and commence milk production. It will therefore be 1985/86 before animals
imported under the project are in production. Smallholders would purchase
in-calf heifers supplied on credit terms at a subsidized price of M$1,100
repayable over 3 years to BPM at no interest through deductions made by the
MCC on monthly milk sales.
5.17       Fodder.  Grasses grow abundantly along roadsides, in plantations
and, during the fallow period, in padi areas, and these areas would be
grazed where possible. However, they are generally low in nutritive value.



- 43 -
Each participant, therefore, would be required to establish and maintain an
area of about 0.2 ha with fodder grasses (such as Pennisetum, Panicum,
Brachiaria) for supplementary cut-and-carry stall-feeding of animals. DVS
would assist farmers in establishing fodder grasses by providing plowing
services, planting materials, fertilizers and fencing materials. A well-
managed fodder area of 0.2 ha would provide adequate feed for the mainte-
nance of two milking cows. To maintain a daily milk production of
6.5 - 7 liters per day it is necessary to feed a supplementary concentrate
ration of about 2.7 kg per cow. DVS would undertake to stock and supply
farmers with concentrate feeding stuffs and mineral supplements which would
be paid for from farmers MCC proceeds. A good clean water supply is
essential for hygienic milk production, and DVS would provide loan
assistance to farmers to install adequate water supplies to their cattle
shed.
5.18      Milk Production.  Adequate nutrition is also required to maintain
satisfactory fertility and breeding levels. Variations in both production
and breeding performance will occur with the cross-bred animals distributed,
and culling would be required to achieve acceptable standards. It is
estimated that a culling rate of about 15% per year would be required to
obtain a calving interval of 400 days or less (assuming adequate nutrition)
and milk production of about 2,000 liters per year per dairy cow. DVS would
provide AI services and train farmers in the correct detection of oestrus to
enable improved AI conception rates. With recommended improved feeding and
management it is expected that calving rates would improve progressively
from the present level of about 55% to 70%. Calf mortality would also
decrease with experience and better management from an initial 15% to about
10%. Cross-bred animals tolerate local climatic conditions well, are more
resistant to tick infestation than pure bred cattle, and do not appear to be
much affected by tick-borne fevers in Malaysia. Sporadic foot-and-mouth
disease outbreaks have occurred in Malaysia within recent years and a
compulsory vaccination program is administered by DVS. There are generally
no other major disease problems in the country. Prophylactic vaccinations
and treatment for animal health are undertaken by DVS in areas where disease
problems arise.
5.19      Processing and Marketing.  Efficient milk collection on a regular
twice daily basis is critical for the dairy development program. The system
already established in Malacca achieves the objective and would be followed
under the project. The MCC would be open for 2 hours each morning and night
to suit local circumstances. It would service an area of about 25-30 km
radius, and about 200 small dairy producers at full development. Collection
of milk from farms and delivery to the MCC is arranged in several ways: the
farmer himself may take small quantities of milk in containers to the MCC,
an agent may collect from a group of farmers and deliver by motorcycle or
utility vehicle in larger containers (e.g. tanks of about 110-liter capa-
city), or the MCC may collect with its own vehicle directly from farmers or
from agent subcenters with immersion coolers which enable milk to be held
for daily collection. At the collection point the milk is weighed, the
specific gravity taken, and screened for quality by a simple quality test.



- 44 -
At the existing MCCs in Malacca, experience has shown that with extension
guidance farmers can produce clean milk and rejection rates are normally
low.  On receipt at the MCC, milk is cooled to a temperature of about
5-90C, and stored in churns in a refrigerated cool room. Milk can then be
retailed locally as fresh milk or transported in bulk to a factory near
Kuala Lumpur for processing.
Fish
5.20      Phasing of Development.  The phasing of development of 260 ha of
new freshwater fish ponds based on current average pond size of 0.22 ha
representing some 1,180 ponds, is shown below.
Table 5.7: PHASING OF FRESHWATER FISHPOND DEVELOPMENT
1982    1983    1984    1985    1986    1987    1988          Total

5.21      Currently, the maximum amount of construction subsidy per pond
is M$3,OOO and covers the construction costs of an 0.2 ha pond and hence
most ponds will be around that size.  Cement and pipes for water supply
and drainage are included in the subsidy. The main inputs covered by the
first year one time only production subsidy of about M$500/pond are lime for
pH control of the water, triple superphosphate for production of feed stock
in the ponds, and fish fries for stocking. For a 0.2 ha pond, these inputs
currently amount to about M$30 for lime, M$44 for fertilizer and at least
M$190 for fries depending on the number of the relatively expensive Chinese
carps included. The common fry species Lampam Jawa and Lee Koh are readily
available and presently provided free of charge by DOF. Fries of various
kinds of Chinese carp are available only from commercial sources at a cost
of M$0.50 to M$2.50/ fry. All the production inputs are repeated when the
pond is reestablished after harvest - about every nine months. Total lime
and fertilizer consumption during the project period would amount to about
730 tons and 340 tons respectively.
5.22       Production.  It is estimated that pond yield at 0.9 kg/fish will
average about 1.8 ton/ha in the first year and rise to 2.2 tons/ha within
five years. About every 10-12 years, there would be pond deterioration due
to siltation and bund erosion, production would decline, and re-excavation
would be necessary. Total production due to the project would be expected
to reach a peak by about 1991 when some 570 tons fish/year could be
harvested. The profile of total production over 25 years would be as
follows:

5.23      Marketing.  All production would be marketed locally with the
common species currently fetching about M$3.30/kg. There is a very strong
demand from the towns for the more expensive carp species.
6. MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      Rubber./l  Malaysia is the world's largest producer and exporter of
natural rubber, accounting for about 45% and 50%, respectively in 1980. The
country's production doubled between 1960 and 1980, from 0.8 million tons to
1.6 million tons, almost all of which was exported.
6.02      Demand for all elastomers (natural and synthetic rubber) responds
quickly to changes in aggregate economic activity, but it is quite insensi-
tive to price changes. The rate at which synthetic rubber producers can
adjust their supplies to changes in market demand (through capacity expan-
sion and/or higher utilization of existing capacity), exceeds by far that of
natural rubber producers, who cannot shift resources in and out of rubber
production. However, production of natural rubber for the next five years
is adequate to meet demand induced by recent technical and economic
developments, such as the strong market penetration of radial tires that
require more natural rubber or the improvement in the competitive position
of natural rubber vis-a-vis synthetic rubber. In 1980, natural rubber was
estimated to have about 30% share in the world market of elastomers, more or
less the same as it held in 1977. After 1980, world demand for elastomers
is projected to grow at 5% p.a. until 1990 which would indicate that natural
rubber will continue to enjoy strong markets. Yet the potential supply of
natural rubber, based on existing average and available production techno-
logy, is projected to grow more slowly during this period than in the 1970s,
namely, at a rate of about 3.8% p.a. This implies that the share of natural
rubber would drop from 30% in 1980 to 27% in 1990. To avoid a shortfall of
natural rubber during the 1980s, additional investments beyond the targets of
/1 Paras. 6.01-6.03 and 6.07 and 6.09 were adapted from IBRD's Prospects
for Major Primary Commodities, Report No. 814/80, January 1980, and its
updates on June 22, 1981 and December 24, 1981.

existing plans would be required. The project's incremental production of
about 16,000 tons at full development would represent about 1% of Malaysia's
exports.
6.03       Rice.  Rice production in Malaysia, totalling about 1.3 million
tons in 1980, is consumed domestically, and about 0.2 million tons additional
rice is imported to meet domestic demand of about 1.5 million tons. In 1980,
local production is estimated to supply about 90% of consumption requirements,
or 98% of Peninsular Malaysia-s needs and 56% of Sabah and Sarawak require-
ments. Over recent years both national production and consumption of rice
have remained roughly constant, with losses of marginal padi land due to
abandonment balanced by increases in yields in more efficient and better
irrigated areas on the one hand, and increases in population balanced by
apparent declines in per capita consumption, at least in Peninsular Malaysia.
Projecting conservative yield increases, output of new irrigation schemes,
some additional abandonment of marginal padi areas, differential population
growth rates for Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak (where both popula-
tion growth rates and rice consumption vary markedly), and continued slight
declines in per capita rice consumption in all regions, estimates for 1990
are for national production to reach over 1.4 million tons of milled rice,
consumption to reach over 1.7 million tons, and imports to be slightly under
300,000 tons. At full development, the project would produce about 12,000
tons of padi, equivalent to 7,560 tons of rice, all of which would be
consumed in the State.
6.04      Milk and Fish.  Marketing of milk would pose no problem as Malaysia
is only about 6% self-sufficient in milk (fresh and recombined) at present
and the Government projects only about 20% self-sufficiency by 1990. Given
increasing income levels in the country, which effects a consumption pattern
favorable to milk and the Government's nationwide school feeding program, the
incremental milk production of 6.5 million liters would amount to much less
than 1% of the projected demand in 1990.  Similarly, the project's fish
production represents a small fraction of local demand so that its impact on
the national market is insignificant.
6.05       Fruit and Other Cashcrops.  The mix and hectarage of fruit trees
and cash crops proposed under the project are conservative in relation to
assessment of demand based on a survey of demand in Malacca and the neigh-
boring urban centers. Because of the relative nearness to Kuala Lumpur,
Johore Bahru and Singapore, and Malacca-s growing tourist trade, marketing
the project-s output is not expected to be a constraint.
Prices
6.06      The calculations for rubber and rice prices are presented in Annex
5, Reference C14.  The prices for rubber and padi are calculated on the Bank's
commodity price forecasts for 1982, 1985 and 1990; for rice it was assumed
that the ratio of financial to economic prices established by the Government
in 1981 through its retail, wholesale and farm level price control/support



- 47 -
policies would be maintained. Adjustments have been made for grade
differentials and processing and transport costs and prices have been
expressed in mid-1982 prices. The present and future economic prices of
each crop were derived by calculating the f.o.b. price for rubber and the
c.i.f. price for rice in local currency and working back to the farmgate,
excluding taxes and duties and adjusting domestic costs by applying specific
conversion factors to express all local costs in border price equivalents.
For other commodities - milk, fish, fruits and cash crops - the economic
farmgate prices are estimated from financial farmgate prices using
consumption conversion factor. Future prices of these commodities are
expected to remain at constant 1982 levels.
6.07      Rubber.  Prices for natural rubber experienced cyclical fluctua-
tions during the past two decades, reflecting supply and demand forces.
Since the 1960s, the low point in real terms was reached in 1975 at
US$1.14/kg (in 1982 prices) when the economic recession in OECD countries
severely reduced demand for elastomers. Natural rubber prices rebounded
sharply in 1976 with RSS1 increasing by more than 30% in real terms to
US$1.48/kg. In 1980, the average price reached US$1.66/kg in real terms,
followed by a decline in 1981 to US$1.30/kg. In the long run, the Bank
forecasts that the prices of natural rubber will move with those of synthe-
tic rubber. The Bank projects a rise in real prices in the 1980s, which
could further stimulate replanting and expansion in acreage. The Bank-s
forecasts and the derived prices are as follows:

6.08      Rice.  In addition to operating a network of rice mills and main-
taining the national rice stockpiles, LPN is responsible for setting
purchase prices for a wide range of grades and varieties of padi at the



- 48 -
beginning of each season. LPN mills generally pay the purchase price,
discounted for moisture content in excess of 14% and for dirt, empty grains,
straw, or other foreign matters. Private mills generally offer prices equal
to or better than the official prices. The purchase price at millgate in
1981 is M$662/ton for long-grain padi, M$628/ton for medium-grain and
M$595/ton for short-grain. After deductions for moisture, etc., the
financial farmgate price is estimated at M$605/ton.
6.09       The rice produced by the project is expected to be equivalent to
the higher grades of Thai rice. However, since the quality of imported rice
is generally lower, a mixture of 10-15% brokens, for economic analysis the
price of the lower quality has been used. These grades are generally traded
internationally at price 10% below that of the Thai 5% brokens, for which
the Bank makes long-term projections. For financial and economic analysis,
it is assumed that the milling ratio would be 65%, that the market for
project output would be Malacca, and that the farmgate prices would rise
along with the projected world market price. The Bank's forecasts and
derived prices are shown below.

6.10       Milk, Fish and Cash Crops.  Prices of milk, fish, fruits and
other cash crops are conservatively assumed to remain constant in real
terms over the project period. Based on the individual crop budgets, these
commodities would generate returns sufficiently attractive for smallholders
as supplementary enterprises.
6.11       Farmgate fertilizer prices are based on the Bank's world market
price projections for urea, triple super phosphate and muriate of potash.
Prices of other farm inputs are based on data provided by RISDA, DOA, DVS



- 49 -
and DOF personnel in the project area. Economic prices were estimated by
applying the conversion factor for agricultural inputs to the financial
price estimates. Details of these estimates are given in Annex 5, Refer-
ence C14.
Farm Incomes
6.12      Farm budgets have been prepared for five representative farms in
the project. Model A has 5.0 ha rubber and 0.2 ha dusun representing the
larger 5% of holdings; and Models B through E represent mixed small holdings
of rubber, padi and dusun, with or without the supplementary enterprises of
dairy or fishponds. Model B comprises 1.6 ha rubber, 0.6 ha single-cropped
padi, and 0.2 ha dusun (40% of holdings). Model C comprises 1.6 ha rubber,
0.4 ha single-cropped padi, 0.2 ha dusun plus 2 dairy cattle on 0.2 ha
fodder plots (20% of holdings). Model D is similar to C except for 0.2 ha
of fishpond which replaces the 2 dairy cattle (15% of holdings). Finally,
Model E has 1.6 ha rubber, 0.6 ha double-cropped padi and 0.2 ha dusun (20%
of holdings). Except for Model A where hired labor would be required, all
other models, which are owner-operated, would utilize solely family labor.
Annex 2, Tables 1-5 present the farm budgets for the farm models.
6.13      Estimates of the inputs, wages and other parameters were based on
farm surveys and estimates of Government field staff and the mission during
project preparation and appraisal. Financial labor cost (M$8/day) and
contract rates were based on surveys in the project area. Estimates of
nonfarm incomes are also based on survey results and are assumed to remain
constant with the project. Household subsistence rice consumption of 120
kg/capita/year or about 720 kg/family/year is based on the average national
consumption in rural areas. Smallholders pay a variety of land-based taxes
to the State including irrigation rates and quit rents. These tax payments
are projected to remain constant. The only production related tax paid by
padi farmers is zakat, the Islamic religious tithe, paid to the State
Department of Religious Affairs, which use the receipts to finance the
religious school system, teacher salaries, welfare and mosque maintenance.
Payments vary from State to State, but in Malacca the rate is 10% of the
total padi crop.
6.14      The present annual family incomes generated by each of the five
farm models range from M$3,400 to M$5,100. These translate into a per
capita income range of US$240 to US$370. The estimated national per capita
income in 1982 is about US$2,000. At full development in 1995, the
projected per capita incomes would be between US$480 and US$940 while the
national per capita income is expected to rise to US$4,000. Thus, while
most of the project beneficiaries would have incomes above the absolute
poverty line, they would still be below the critical consumption level (CCL
of US$1,300), defined as one-third of the GNP per capita. Without the
project their income position would be even worse with rubber trees becoming
older and with no additional incomes from supplementary enterprises.

/a 1995.
Project Charges
6.15      The Government imposes export taxes of about M57/kg on rubber,
about 22% of projected 1982 prices, a replanting cess of M9.9/kg and a
research cess of Mq2.2/kg. At full development in 1995, project output
would generate export tax revenues of about US$8 million and cess collec-
tions of US$1 million. Water charges would be treated along the lines of
the previous seven Bank-financed agriculture and irrigation projects. In
Malaysia, to support O&M, operation and maintenance costs are funded from
general state and federal revenues. Nominal water and drainage rates are
collected by state governments and form part of the general revenue. Almost
all project beneficiaries would be subject to zakat which is 10% of gross
annual padi production. On project farms, zakat would average about US$50
per farm p.a. at full development, about five times the irrigation system
O&M cost per farm. Thus, zakat payments would make a substantial contribu-
tion to capital cost recovery. Also, smallholders would repay, without
interest (under the Government's poverty alleviation strategy) about 50% of
the capital cost of dairy cattle over three years, and the income mainte-
nance loan over 15 years. Based on present values of the project rent, loan
repayments, zakat and other charges, export taxes, cess collections and
subsidies, the rent recovery indices for the beneficiaries would range from
31% to 54%. For the total project, the rent recovery index is 39%. The
cost recovery index of the project is 43% (Annex 2, Table 6). Since all of
the project beneficiaries would remain below CCL, even in their highest
income years, the cost and rent recovery indices would be acceptable, espe-
cially in view of the Government s strong commitment to poverty alleviation.
Moreover, the Government has levied cesses on rubber exports since 1951 and
consequently, the present value of these payments, although not quantified,
would more than offset the replanting grant provided by the Government.



- 51 -
7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.01      The project would provide for replanting of about 9,000 ha of old
rubber, maintenance until tapping of about 5,300 ha of rubber replanted in
1976-81, construction and rehabilitation of small irrigation and drainage
schemes, importation of 2,500 crossbred dairy heifers, and construction and
stocking of 260 ha of fresh water fish ponds. Some 8,300 smallholder
families, or 50,000 people, would directly benefit from the project. The
project would contribute to the Government's goals of poverty alleviation,
increased exports and reduced dependence on rice imports. The average
capital cost in financial prices, including physical contingency, is about
US$2,600 per ha and about US$7,000 per family. The incremental annual
production of about 16,000 tons of rubber at full development by about 1995
would result in net foreign exchange earnings of about US$22 million while
the incremental output of rice (5,500 tons) would result in net foreign
exchange savings of about US$3 million (all in 1982 prices). The project
would also provide buildings and equipment for project operations and
maintenance, training, and a wide range of agricultural support services.
7.02      Foreign Exchange.  The unit of account is uncommitted foreign
exchange in the hands of the Government, expressed in terms of local
currency. All tradeable components are valued directly in foreign exchange
converted to local currency at the official exchange rate of M$ = US$0.435
and adjusted for dealer or processing margin, local transport and handling.
Conversion factors for a number of broad categories of goods and services
produced or consumed by the project have been used to express all nontrade-
able inputs and outputs in terms of the unit of account.
7.03      Benefits.  Projected yields and production are discussed in
Chapter 5. Chapter 6 presents the farmgate prices for inputs and outputs,
based on Bank price forecasts for rubber, rice, and fertilizers and mission
estimates for non-traded commodities, such as milk, fish, fruits and other
cash crops. Gross returns, production costs, labor requirements and farm
budgets are given in Annexes 2 and 5, Reference C13. Annex 3 summarizes the
foregoing information and gives the expected economic benefits from the
project at full development.
7.04      Distribution of Benefits.  All of the direct project benefits would
accrue to 8,300 smallholder families, about 50,000 people. The smallholders,
80% in the target group, have average incomes of about US$270 per capita.
With the project, average incomes are expected to range from US$480 to
US$940 per capita. While these incomes would take the project beneficiaries
above the absolute poverty level, it is expected that their incomes would
still remain below the projected CCL (US$1,300 per capita).



- 52 -
7.05      Employment Impact.  The annual demand for labor with the project
is about 2.1 million man-days. About 8,300 smallholder families would
provide the total labor supply of 12,500 workers at full development equiva-
lent to 1.5 workers per smallholder family. Assuming 24 work-days per month,
the total available monthly labor supply would be about 300,000 man-days in
1995. Peak monthly demand occurs in January, April and July at 226,000,
204,000 and 199,000 man-days, respectively. In view of the generally tight
agricultural labor market in Malaysia, the opportunity cost wage rate was
assumed to be the current agricultural wage of M$8 per day, M$6.40 per day
in border prices. The economic cost of labor at full development would be
about M$18 million.
7.06       Investment Costs.  The economic capital cost of the project
is about US$60 million. This capital cost estimate includes allowances for
physical contingencies but exclude expected price increases and transfer
payments. The foreign exchange elements are valued at border prices while a
construction conversion factor (0.77) was applied to local costs net of
taxes and duties. The annual economic incremental O&M costs for the whole
project would average about US$0.7 million annually from 1989 onwards.
7.07      Development Period.  According to the project implementation
schedule, all works would be completed by mid-1988 (Figure 3.1). Full agri-
cultural development would be reached in the project area by 1995.
7.08      Economic Rate of Return (ERR).  On the basis of the foregoing
assumptions and discounting costs and benefits over a 30-year period, the
overall project ERR is 15%. The rubber replanting component has an ERR of
14%; the rubber maintenance component, 15%; the dairy component, 10%; and the
fishpond component, 16%. For the irrigation and drainage component, four
representative schemes (out of 15) were analyzed:/1 a new irrigation scheme
has an ERR of 19%; an irrigation improvement scheme, 24%; a river improve-
ment scheme, 14%; and a drainage improvement scheme, 11%. The dusun
rehabilitation component has an ERR of 14%.
7.09       Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity of the rate of return was
tested to cost overruns, reduction of benefits, and implementation delay.
The analysis was carried out on the total project and on each component.
The results are shown in Table 7.1.
7.10       Sensitivity analysis was also used to determine which variables
would be most crucial to the agricultural component. In carrying out the
sensitivity analysis, two measures were developed for each variable tested,
the crossover value and the elasticity. The crossover value is the value
of the variable tested for which NPV discounted at 10% is zero and is a
/1 Prior to start of construction, DID would prepare and submit to the
Bank an evaluation report following procedures established under the
National Small Scale Irrigation Project (Loan 1444-MA). Each scheme
would have a minimum ERR of 10% (see para. 3.08).

measure of how the variable can differ from its most likely value before
the project becomes economically nonviable. The crossover value may also
be interpreted as the value of the variable tested, beyond which the economic
rate of return would fall below 10%. The elasticity is defined as the per-
centage change in NPV discounted at 10% with respect to a 1% change in the
variables, at the most likely value of that variable./1 The results are
presented in Annex 3. The likelihood of these critical variations is
discussed below.
(a) Rubber. Rubber is most sensitive to price and yield.
A long-term world price 18% below the Bank's 1990 projec-
tion would have to occur before NPV reaches zero. It is
unlikely that this will happen given the supply/demand balance
for natural rubber. The average peak yield would have to
fall by 21% before ERR declines to 10%. RISDA's extension

curve.



- 54 -
and monitoring services are being strengthened in order to
attain the projected yields which would be about 80% of the
projected yields in Government-s land rehabilitation schemes.
(b) Rice. In the sample irrigation improvement scheme, viability
of rice production is moderately sensitive to yield, cropping
intensity and price. For the NPV to fall below zero, these
variables would have to fall by 45%. This is unlikely as the
crossover values are already far below present values, e.g.
crossover yield of 1.8 ton/ha as compared to 2.5 ton/ha. For the
sample river improvement scheme, rice is highly sensitive to the
above variables. Yield and cropping intensity would have to fall
by 10% for NPV to reach zero. Agricultural support services would
be improved under the project to achieve the desired yields. On
the other hand, the crossover cropping intensity of 91% is already
below the present level of 100%.
(c) Dairy. Dairy has a marginal ERR of 10% and is extremely sensi-
tive to all variables tested. In this component, wide variations
in production are possible due to individual animal performance,
level of nutrition, calving interval, and milk quality. Standards
would also depend on culling of inefficient stock. The expected
values are based on yields now being achieved on existing farms
and projected price is assumed to remain constant. As the project
beneficiaries would have incomes at full development of less than
20% of the projected average national per capita income at that
time, the distribution impact is likely to be significant.
(d) Fishpond. Fish production is sensitive to both yield and price.
The crossover values would fall by 20% for the NPV to reach zero.
This is unlikely as expected yield is presently being achieved and
fish prices are expected to remain constant in real terms. In
addition, the project would strengthen DOF-s extension services
and training to smallholders.
(e)  Dusun.  This component is sensitive to both yield and price.  The
ERR would fall below 10% whenever yield and price fall by 13%.
Supply of fruits is seasonal and prices can fluctuate. A premium
is expected for the improved varieties being planted.
(f) Cash crops. Cropping intensity on padi areas could vary as farm-
ers- interest depends on market demand and prices. Sweet potato,
the major cash crop, is taken as proxy for all cash crops in the
sensitivity analysis. As sweet potato is a short-term crop, a 10%
return on the production cost is assumed. Sweet potato is sensi-
tive to both yield and price. Their crossover values are 21%
below the expected values.



- 55 -
7.11      Risks.  There are no unusual risks associated with the project,
and those normally associated with project benefits, costs, development
period and implementation delays have been evaluated in the sensitivity
analyses. However, coordination among the implementing agencies would be
crucial to project execution. To reduce this risk, the Project Director has
already been appointed and participated in the project negotiations; and
adequate funds for consulting services have been provided to assist the
project-related agencies.
7.12      In respect of the dairy component, the risks involved are connected
with the adoption of suitable levels of technology by smallholders. Poor
standards could result in high animal mortality, poor calving rates and
disease problems all of which could affect production levels and economic
viability. To reduce this risk, the project would strengthen the
veterinary extension services and training for smallholders.
8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following
major points:
(a)  the Government would submit the terms of reference of consultants
who will carry out the studies on the usage of idle agricultural
lands by June 30, 1982 (para. 3.21);
(b)  the implementing agencies would maintain separate project accounts;
these would be collated by the Project Director; these accounts
would be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank
and forwarded to the Bank within nine months of the close of each
financial year (para. 3.3i);
(c)  DID would prepare, on completion of final design, a designer's
operations manual covering major project works, (para. 4.08); and
the Project Director would: (i) furnish the Bank, by December
31, 1982, proposals for coordinating and integrating the various
agencies' agricultural extension programs serving all groups of
farmers for review and comment and (ii) prepare, by June 30,
1984, a manual for detailing the operation roles of the various
agricultural agencies as a guide for field staff (para. 4.03);
(d)  the Government, prior to importation, would make arrangements for
a rearing facility for dairy animals in one or more of its DVS
stations (para. 4.19); and suitably train selected farmers in
dairy husbandry before receiving their dairy animals (para.

- 56 -
(e) consultants engaged under the project would be employed under
terms of reference and under conditions acceptable to the Bank
(para. 4.27);
(f)  the Government shall ensure that adequate staff positions required
for the proper implementation, and thereafter, operation and
maintenance of the project are established as and when needed and
that qualified staff are appointed in a timely manner (para.
4.30); and
(g)  the Government would furnish, by December 31, 1983 proposals for
monitoring and evaluation of the project for Bank's review and
comment (para.  4.32).
8.02      The appointment of two of the key staff of the Project Director,
an accounting officer and an economist, is a condition of loan effectiveness
(para. 4.02).
8.03      With the above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$25.0 million, with a 15-year maturity including a
grace period of three years. The Borrower would be the Government of
Malaysia.
