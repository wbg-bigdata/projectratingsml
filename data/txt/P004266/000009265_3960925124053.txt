farmers having smaliholdings with low productivity. The project provided
mainly for development of rubber areas, construction and improvement of irri-
gation and drainage works, farm roads construction, smallholder dairy
development, fishpond development, crop development, and improvement of
agricultural support services. Smallholder rubber development included re-
planting with improved clonal materials of about 9,000 ha of old, low yielding
rubber; maintenance until commencenent of tapping of some 5,300 ha of rubber
replanted in the years 1976-81; and planting of new rubber totalling about
320 ha. Infrastructure development included construction of a new irrigation
scheme for about 66 ha of padi and improvements to five existing irrigation
schemes serving about 1,850 ha; improvement of three drainage schemes serving
about 1,000 ha and six river channels serving about 1,600 ha of padi and other
crops; and construction of farm and access roads totalling about 140 km.
Dairy and fisheries development program included distribution of 2,500
crossbred dairy heifers to 1,000 new and 500 existing dairy farmers; estab-
lishment of some 250 ha of on-farm fodder grass production; construction and
equipping of a milk collectiou center handling up to 1,350 liters of milk per
day; and construction and stocking of about 260 ha of freshwater fishponds.
Crop developmentc included establishment of a padi seed multiplication program;
planting of about 380 ha per annum of various cash crops; and rehabilitation
of smallholder orchards and backyard fruit lots totalling about 810 ha.
The project also provided for local and overseas training for staff;
buildings, vehicles and equipment for training, agricultural support services,
and operation and maintenance; and about 366 person-months of consultant ser-
vices (336 local and 30 foreign) to the Drainage and Irrigation Department
(DID) for detailed designs and construction supervision of infrastructure
works and to the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) for (i) design and planning of
pilot perennial crop development schemes on 160 ha of largely idle
agricultural land and a comprehensive study on the utilizaticn of about 4,000
ha of idle agricultural land in Malacca State; and (ii) expert advice on



- vi -
planning, programuing, coor4iuation, and monitoring and evaluation (M&O) of
multi-component projecte.
The NOA was to be the lead agency for project implementation and it had
already appointed a Project Director (PD) before project commencement. The PD
wae to coordinate v-rious departments and agencies under the MOA which were to
participate in the project and the Rubber Industry Smallholders Development
Authority (RISDA), tnder the Ministry of Land and Regional Divelopment, which
waS to be responaible for the rubber component. The PD whs to be guided on
policy matters by a Steering Committee, composed of representatives irom all
government agencies with project responsibilities, and co-chaired by the
Secretary General of MOA and the State Secretary of Malacca (who was the
highest-ranking civil servant in Malacca and, consequently, had the executive
authority).
Implementation Experience
Project implementation was generally free of problems, though project
completion was delayed by one year to June 30, 1989. The organizational and
management factors including appointment of a Project Director before project
commencement and his proRence until completion, capable and effective project
management, delegation of powers to the Project Director to mal budgetary
allo-ations to the cooperating agencies, establishment of comm2.ttees at the
leve_ of the project participanta, and effective support from the Steering
Committee, greatly facilitated project implementation. At pruject completion,
appraisal targets for all major components were either met or exceeded.
Financing of RISDA's replanting of old rubber with oil palm was iacluded in
1986 and that with various other crops (except cocoa) in 1989. Problems were
experienced mainly with minor components vis., irrigation and fisheries
development. As early as July 1982, the new irrigation scheme proposed in
Brisu was cancelled when found economically unviable. Later, two irrigation
schemes targeted for improvement were also cancelled whmn they were found
unviable after en indepth stud . Irrigation improvement (1,415 ha) was thus
onl,y 76Z of appraisal target.   Fishpond development (about 61 ha) was only
232 of appraisal target, mainly bec_uoe of decline of farmer interest after
termination of Government subsidies in *nd-1983. Another minor component,
fruit orchard rehabilitation, was dropped in 1986 for the same reason
(termination of subsidies). Very little of consultancy funds were used. This
was mainly due to the reduced scopfr of irrigation works and deletion of the
idle padi land study since Malacca was not considered a granary padi area
under the new National Agricultural Policy adopted in 1984. However, one
foreign consultant was employed for 13 months to assist in establishing the
project's monitoring and evaluation (M&H) system. Part of the Bank loan was
also utilized for the detailed engineering design of Bekok Dam under the
Second Western Johor Agricultural Development Project (Loan 2740-MA). Project
/1    Th Borrover's comment point out that, with these adjustments, the economic IRR of the
irrigation component weo 122. 80 Annex It p.2.



- vii -
implementation was somewhat affected by the national budgetary constraints in
the mid-1980s.
Project management actively pursued adjustments to the project scope
and financing during implementation. As a result, the Loan Agreement was
amended threa times and various appraisal targets were revised. At comple-
tion, the project cost was only US$33.0 million equivalent, or about 43Z of-
the appraisal estimate of US$76.4 million. This difference was mainly due to
overestimation of coats at appraisal, particularly for coutingencies, and also
due to the reduced scope of irrig'"'ton works and lower expenditures on fish
ponds, dairy development (mainly beoause of restrictions imposed by the
Government on the import of crossbred heifers), consultancy  !.rvlnes and
engineering and supervision. The Bank loan was correspondingly r4duced from
US$25.40 million to US$17.75 million.
Results
Overall, the project v;as satisfactory and had a substantial insti-
tutional impact. Its contribution to the beneficiaries' productivity and
incomes '.s actually and potentially positive. The number of beneficiaries is
at least 10,00C, compared to the appraisal target of 8,300. The overall
project economic rate of return (ERR) is a satisfactory 14X, only slightly
lower than the appraisal estimate of 151, mainly because of lower world prices
projected for rubber and palm oil. The ERRs of most individual components
viz., rubber replanting and maintenance, oil palm repl&nting and maintenance,
irrigation improvement, drainage improvement, and river improvement, range
from 12% to over 50X. However, the potential returns from the irrigation
improvement component a-e questionable, since farmers' interest in padi is
declining, re.ulting in an unsatisfactory cropping intensity and decreasing
area planted with padi. Farmers' interest in padi is low because, with the
small size of holdings, incomes from padi are unattractive even though sub-
stantial Government subsidies are offered. For three minor components viz.,
dairy development, fish pond development, and cash crops, the ERRs are 2%,
less than 1X, and 3Z, respectively. The dairy activity is not competitive at
import parity prices, though current Government subsidies provide attractive
incomes to project farmers. For fish ponds, low yields resulting from lack of
farmer interest after termination of subsidies aake both economic and finan-
cial returns low. The cash crop diversification component, aimed at utilizing
idle land (mostly padi land) with more remunerative alternative short-term
cash crops, cocoa and othei  tree crops, *was also not very successful as 43% of
the area planted went idle again, though initially, when subsidies and
services were being provided by the project, farmers' participation was high.
The project achieved some success in its group extension efforts, particularly
in small area development achmes for the planting of idle lands with short-
term cash crops (vegetables), but was not very successful in making the
farmers' organizations self-financing.

Sustainability
Overall, the project is sustainable. The Project Director's office
exists and is wvll-funded and vwll-managed.  The nroject'e main components,
rubber and oil palm, are financially and economically viable and are super-
vised by RISDA, which is a long-established institution, is well-funded, and
being supported by the Bank und,r the RISDA Project (Loan 3139-MA). The
irrigation and drainage works are also being supervised by a well-established
agency, the DID. However, the dairy and fishpond activities, padi and some
cash crops under the project are unlikely to survive without subsidies. As
regards cost recovery, project costs are expect i to be fully recovered by the
early nsxt century through coss and export duty on rubber and zakat for padi.
Findirgs and Lessons Learne'
The integrated area development approach can be successful if appro-
priate organizational, management and funding arrangements are in place (PCR,
paras. 1.11, 1.13, 1.18, 2.01-2.06, 4.01, 4.02, 4.21 and 4.31).
An effective M&E system, which was a noteworthy feature -f the project,
can greatly facilitate corrective act'ons during Vi:oject implementation (PCR,
paras. 1.18, 2.02-2.06, 2.12, 4.06, 4.18 and 4.19).
Grassroots planning of project activities with participation of bene-
ficiaries can enhance project impact (PCR, paras. 1.12-1.15, 4.02, 4.23 and
4.24).
Inclusion of project components, which depend on subsidies for
successful implementation, should be carefully reviewed during preparation and
appraisal (PCR, paras. 2.11, 2.28, 2.35, 3.10, 3.28, 4.15 and 4.17).
Building self-reliant and self-financing farmers' organizations is a
task which cannot be achieved in a few years (PCR, paras. 3.42, 3.43, and 4.26
and 4.27).
Close coordination with marketing organizations (such as with the
Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority in this case) facilitates project
planning for crops (PCR, para. 3.45).
Continuity and appropriate skill mix of Bank staff during supervision
facilitate project implementation (PCR, paras. 4.09 - 4.11).
More detailed preparation, particularly of irrigation and drainage
components, would have improved project implementation (PCR, paras. 4.12 and
4.15).



PROJECT COMPLET'ON REPORT
MALAYSIA
4ALACCA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2147-MAt
I. BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.1       In the late seventies the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) had adopted
the integrated agricultural development approach to rural development as the
vehicle for promoting growth in rural agricultural sector and eradicating
poverty. I.hroughout Malaysia, some 15 Integrated Agricultural Development
Projects (IADP) were implemented, at an average of one project for every state
except Sabah. fome were locally financed, whlle others were financed through
foreign sources.
1.2       In 1979, MOA prepared a project identification brief which proposed
World Bank financing for smallholders in Malacca who did not benefit from any
specific irrigation or commodity project. A local management consultant was
engaged in April 1980 to compile a project implementation plan. Its final report
was issued in January 1981 and reviewed by a January-February World Bank
preappraisal mission.
1.3       A World Bank mission appraised the Project in September-October 1981.
Loan 2147-MA amounting to US$25.4 million was approved on May 18, 1982. The Loan
Agreement was signed on October 7, 1982.
Proiect Description
1.4       The Project would benefit some 8,300 smallholders in the major
identifiable groups with the highest incidence of poverty - rubber
smallholders, padi and mixed annual and perennial crop farmers having small
holdings with low productivity.
1.5       The objectives of the Project were to eradicate rural poverty,
increase income and agricultural production through land-use intensificatLon,
crop diversification and improvements to agricultural support services,
resulting also in increasing job opportunities. The Project was also intended
to improve the socioeconomic livelihood of farmers. All agricultural and
related agencies were to be coordinated under one project agency to serve the
farming community in Malacca. The smallholders were to benefit from a range
of programmes designed to solve various constraints and problems in the
smallholders5 sector and provide the target groups various opportunities to
improve their farming activities.



- 2 -
1.6       The description of the Project as per Loan Agreement dated October
7, 1982 was as follows:
(a)  Smallholder rubber development, including replanting with improved
clonal materials of about 9.000 hectares of old, low yielding rubber;
maintenance until commencement of tapping of some 5.300 hectares of
rubber replanted between 1976 - 1981 planting of about 320 hectares
of new rubber; development of a new 48 hectares rubber nursery; and
construction of 72 aroui rubber processing centres, 3 smokehouses and
central storage facilities.
(b)  Infrastructure development, including construction of a new irrigation
scheme (66 hectares); improvement of 5 existing irrigation schemes
(1.850 hectares)s and improvement of 3 drainage works and 6 river
channels (2.500 hectares); and construction of farm and access roads
totalling about 140 kilometers.
(c)  Cron  develoiment,   including  establishment  of  a  padi  seed
multiplication program; planting of about 380 hectares of various cash
crops annually; rehabilitation of smallholder orchards and backyard
fruit lots totalling about 810 hectare; and implementation of pilot
schemes covering 160 hectares of fragmented idle agricultural land for
perennial crops.
(d)  Dairy and fisheries develoment,  involving distribution of 2,500
crossbred dairy heifers to 1,000 new and 500 existing dairy farmers;
establishment of some 250 hectares of on-farm fodder grass production;
construction of a milk collection center able to handle 1.350 liters
of milk per day; and construction of about 260 hectares of freshwater
fish ponds.
1.7       In addition, the Project would construct buildings, purchase equipment
and vehicles, and provide agricultural support services and operation and
maintenance, staff training, and consultancy services for studies, detailed
design and construction supervision of project works.
1.8       The Project area was identified as all agricultural areas in the State
of Malacca.
orcanization and Manaaement
1.9       The Malacca IADP organizational structure was set up on a coordinative
model where the effectiveness of a Project Director (PD) lies in his ability to
motivate the co! ponent staff without having full executive control over them. The
implementing arms of the Project were the existing line agencies who had their
own set of priorities. The main participating agencies were RISDA, DID, DOA,
FOA, DVS and DOF whereas the supporting agencies included FAMA, MARDI, BPM, LPN
and DLM.
1.10      The PD was to be guided on policy matters by a Steering Committee
composed of senior representatives of all agencies with project implementation



- 3 -
responsibilities under the joint chairmanship of the State Secretary and the
Deputy Secretary General of MOA. This Committee was to meet twice a year to
provide policy guidance for project implementation which was also obtained from
MOA and other central agencies from time to time.
1.11      For coordination purposes, the PD was to be a member of the Malacca
State Agricultural Portfolio and Agricultural Task Force, under the chairmanship
of State Executive Councillor and the Chief Minister respectively. At the PD
office level, several committees on specific subjects such as the Implementation
Committee (Co-chaired by Under Secretary of Monitoring and Evaluau.ion Division,
Ministry of Agriculture) and Working Committees on Crop, Infrastructure,
Livestock, Aquaculture, Training, and Special Project Development were set up to
plan, coordinate and monitor the implementation of various identified programmes.
This arrangement was satisfactory and effective in providing much needed rapport
among implementing agencies and State Government.
1.12      At the Project level, Project Action Committees were set up by the
Project to establish channels of communication from project participants to
smoothen ground level implementation. These committees provided feedback and
solutions to emerging problems. The Village Development and Security Committees
set up by the State Government also played important roles and some were very
active and rendered much help to the Project.
1.13      Ground level project identification and planning of farming activities
and infrastructural facilities (farm roads, drainage and irrigation facilities)
were given primary attention by the PD.   The target groups were given the
opportunity to identify their own needs, and applications were scrutinized by the
Project.   These covered all types of projects,  i.e. crop, infrastructure,
livestock etc. The planning process started with identification of project by
target groups - individual farmer, Village Development and Security Committee,
Headman, contact farmer or group farming units.    At this level, they had to
determine among others:
(a)  The type of project (drainage, irrigation, small farm road, culverts,
bridges, commodities etc.).
(b) Number and names of participants with their backgrounds.
(c) Location, with detailed cadastral maps, sketch plan and passages.
1.14      If the project was initiated by a group of farmers, the group had to
ensure that all members were interested and ready to participate in the project.
They also had to furnish comments and recommendations from technical staff in
charge of their area, so as to ensure the project's technical viability.
1.15      All completed documents were then forwarded to PD for further action.
This grassroot planning became an integral part of the project cycle and was
initiated as early as 1983. An example of area development planning is shown in
Chart I.

1.16      In terms of the dLvision of work, the organization of the PD Office
was quite in balance between planning/development and administration/finance. The
PD was assisted by a Deputy Director who took charge of plcnning/development, x
especially the monitoring and evaluation of projects. The implementation of
projects in each district (Central Malacca, Alor Gajah, Jasin, Masjid Tanah and
Merlimau) was carried out and monitored by one staff in the PD's office and
supported by staff from various participating agencies.
1.17      There were some posts created under the Project.  Their creation was
to boost the participating departments and lt was never intended to house them
under one roof wlth the PD. The PD had no control over them and, therefore, some
put departmental priorities ahead. This normal attitude of certain departments
did not in any way deter project implementation. The PD played his role well
and tried to accomplish agreed targets.
1.18      The PD had full control over annual budgetary allocation and could
ensure that identified projects were implemented as per schedule.   He also
monitored progress and monthly expenditures. Having control over finances gave
the PD an added advantage since he was made fully aware of the direction in which
the Project was heading. He signed all vouchers and kept abreast regularly with
payments and progress. The flag system (red, yellow, green) was utilized for
physical projects, so as to signal minor derailments and provide remedial
measures before problems could occur. This method worked well and proved its
worth since, during implementation, no serious delays occurred.
1I. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE
General
2.1       This Project has had the benefit of having a PD who continued from the
beginning of the Project until completion. This continuity unquestionably helped
to ensure smooth planning and implementation of the project. He was able to
prepare the ground work, created a system of coordination among participating
departments and established rapport with the State Government (civil servants and
politicians alike). He also maintained close contacts with the target groups
ensuring constant feedback on project implementation.
Mon$torino and Evaluation
2.2        Regular dialoques,  discussions,  visits and feedbacks were very
important features of the Project. Data collection right from the initial stage
of project implementation was the rule rather than the exception. Sequential data
were kept in various books each titled according to components and districts.
In the Project office various records were made available to those interested and
annual summaries were produced.   Socioeconomic data of projects were also
collected, to be utilized later on ior various project reviews and reports.



-6-
2.3       A good monitoring and evaluation system was established from the
initial project period.  The objective of the system was to ensure that all
programmes were implemented as per schedule and met expected targets. Apart from
frequent committee meetings to monitor implementation of projects, the Project
Directors Office also designed a special system to monitor and evaluate projects
that were implemented.
2.4       As mentioned earlier, the implementation of projects in each district
was carried out and monitored by one staff from the Project Director's Office and
supported by implementing staffs from various agencies. This officer was given
multifaceted responsibilities ranging from project identification and sifting
applications, reporting status of project and attending ground-level meetings to
writing special project reports as well as acting as an intermediary to the
Project Director. These officers maintained close rapport with the staffs of
implementing agencies and the project participants. Constant and close contacts
were emphasized. Approximately 70% of their working hours were spent outside the
office, visiting projects and preparing reports on the current development of the
projects. These officers were made accountable only to the Project Director.
Reporting was done in prepared M&E format after each project visit and had to be
submitted to the Project Director within 24 hours. The Project Director would
scan through the reports and advise immediate actions to be taken by the officer.
These 'Rapid Observation Reports' were a very important feature of this Project
which helped to ensure smooth implementation. The system was also taken up by
some participating departments. (Format 1 on page 177 shows a specimen of this
M&E format). To ensure that the projects were implemented as intended, the PD
often made field visits. Apart from tho M&E 1 format, the Project office also
devised various formats to suit each case. Updating these formats to tally with
current needs was a normal procedure. Several M&E formats currently used by the
Project are shown in Formats 2 and 3 (pp. 178 - 179).
2.5       Formal monitoring was also done through Term Reports.  'Logical
Framework Matrix' (LFM) was used by this Project for the Term Reports. Several
evaluation surveys had also been conducted to obtain feedback on project
achievements.
2.6       As mentioned above, feedback played a very significant role in the
daily affairs of the Project Office and enabled the management to keep abreast
with the implementation process and initiate corrective measures if there was any
deviation.    Positive responses to problems,  hk #ever minor,  remained the
characteristic of the Project.   Priority was given to farmers' needs since
failure on the part of the Project could lead to frustration on farmers' part.
Frustration could lead to declining morale and trust in the Project.
2.7       Within the Project Office, this style of project implementation
presented no problems.   But the same could not be expected from supporting
agencies. Some gave positive responses and others did not. Modernization of
agricultural management was not an easy task. What the Project office attempted
to create was an official/formal communication system between the top management
and the lower staff.



-7-
2.8       Towards the end of the Project period, the Project office saw some
positive uteps being taken by other participating agencies, but a lot still needs
to be done. Communication whether verbal or written should be a two-way process.
Resoonse From The Target Grouns
2.9       During project implementation, responses from the target groups were
varied - some gave very positive responses, some negative and some positive only
at the initial stage. clear procedures had been devised for concurrence of land
owners, dialogues, choice of crops, upgrading drainage and irrigation facilities,
construction of other infrastructural facilities and supervision by staff
concerned. All projects were carried out on an Area Development concept, whereby
a package deal was implemented. However, farmers' perseverance and consistency
dwindled with time and there were different results in the implementation of Area
Development Projects. Some failed totally, with some existing only as a fraction
of original areas.   There were some cases where existing area remained and
increased in phases. Those who gave positive responses right from the initial
stage managed to improve their income and quality of life. In cases of failures,
there were various reasons such as attitude, management, manpower, drought,
financial resources and poor extension activity.
2.10      As far as construction/upgrading of infrastructural facilities was
concerned, the Project Office did not face any major problems.  Land owners
readily gave consent for access in the construction of farm roads, bridges,
culverts, drainage and irrigation facilities.  Planning from the ground was
encouraged especially by the active Village Development and Security Committees.
Plans of an area detailing infrastructural requirements were done by them and,
if found to be viable, the Project would implement them. Payments for land
acquisition were generally not required from the early stage of the Project.
Payments were, however, made when lands were acquired for construction of
buildings, river channeling and drainage improvements.
Proiect ScoDe
2.11      During the course of implementation, the Project was affected by a
series of policy changes. In 1984 the National Agricultural Policy came into
effect and with it there was a reduction of government investment in non-granary
padi areas. In 1985 a gradual withdrawal of agricultural subsidies was initiated
which affected the implementation of the fish pond and cash crop development
components. The curb on the importation of crossbred heifers seriously affected
the Project's attempt to replenish farmers, aged stock.
2.12      The Project Office wanted to ensure that thle appraisal targets were
realistic. A brief study was done as early as December 1983 which led to certain
amendments being made to the Loan Agreement, including an increase in the
percentage of disbursementq, in June 1984. A major "Expenditures and Scope
Review" was carried out in May 1986 by the Project Office and this led to an
overhaul of project implementation schedule identified in the SAR and amendment
to the Loan Agreement in July 1986. The cancellation of the New Brisu Irrigation
and the Bacang and JasLn II Irrigation Improvement; the reduction of staff
quarterup cancellation of dusun rehabilitation scheme; and reduction in the scope



of vehicles and  quipment and staff overseas training were some of the main
results of the 1984 and 1986 amendments. Under the Rubber Development Component,
projects such as nursery development, construction of amokehouses and new
planting of rubber were cancelled.   Oil palm planting was added as a
reimbursable. The final review which was done in late 1988 was aimed at fully
utilizing the loan and led to some changes in the Loan Agreement in January 1989
mainly as regards additional crops which could be reimbursed by RISDA (see
Appendix 115).
Proiect Finances
2.13      Project costs were estimated in the SAR at M$175.27 million or US$76.4
million equivalent and these costs included about 10% physical and 20% price
contingencies.   At an early stage, the Project Office felt that the cost
estimates were on the high side.   Later, there were also some budgetary
constrainto. As mentioned above several projects were cancelled or reduced in
scope as a result of a review done in 1986 and the cost estimates were lowered
tc about M$80 million. At the time of project identification, there were high
expectations and over zealousness and some projects were not given an indepth
study. This should not have happened.
2.14      As mentioned above, the 1986 review done by the Project office
projected total expenditure to be about M$80 million and the final figure at
completion was close to that (about N$88.93 million). Details of the budget
allocation are in Table 1.

2.15      The original loan given by the Bank was US$25.4 million or about 33%
of estimated total project cost of M$175.27 million (US$76.4 million) which
included 30% contingencies and front end fee of US$0.4 million. Lack of adequate
financial planning and over ambitious plan of implementation during the pre-
project stage coupled with some budgetary constraints resulted in the annual
allocations falling short of BAR's estimates. As a result, the Project Office
took its own initLative to scrutinize the whole Project bearing in mind
Government Of Malaysia's financial situation, the viability of each project
identified in the BAR and the capacity to utilize the Bank loan.
2.16      The Loan Agreement was amended on June 25, 1984 (para. 2.12) and under
the Special Action Plan (SAP) the rate of reimbursement was raised to 80%. Not
satisfied with the 1984 amendment and doubtful about the ability to utilize the
Bank loan, the Project Office carried out a major review of the whole Project in
1986 detailing each item. As a zesult, the Loan Agreement was again amended on
July 17, 1986 cancelling US$7,650,000 of the loan. The main items were: adding
oil palm planting and maintenance an reimbursables, cancelling one irrigation
improvement scheme (Tangga Batu/Sungai Udang), adding two more river channel
improvements, reducing the length of farm roads, cancelling the Dusun
Rehabilitation Scheme, increasing hectarage under varioui. crops, adding three
Milk Collection Sub-contres, and reducing hectarage of freshwater fish ponds.
Under the consultancy services, funds were also used for the Bekok Dam Study
(West Johore).
2.17      As the Project office was concerned about the capacity to utilize the
loan within the stipulated time frame, another review was done resulting in
another amendment to the Loan Agreement on January 19, 1989. A high percentage
of the loan was utilized by RISDA and realizing this trend the new Loan Agreement
included as a reimbursable the planting of tree crops (with the exception of
cocoa) between 1982 and June 30, 1989. The Project completion date was also
extended to June 30, 1989.   As a result, the loan totalling US$17,750,000 was
fully disbursed by October 1989, two months before the target date of December
31, 1989.
2.18      The final project expenditure totalling M$82.792 million or US$33.03
million was close to the expenditure expected during the 1986 review (M$79
million) but 47.23% lower compared to original SAR estimates (see Appendices 3
and 4).
2.19      Initial disbursements were ahead of schedule.  Total disbursement was
US$17.75 million or 70% of the appraival estimate. The foreign loan component
amounted to 53.7% of the total project cost (US$33.03 million equivalent), which
is higher in comparison with the SAR estimate of 33% (see Table 2 and
Appendix 4).

Smallholder Rubber Development
2.20       This RISDA-executed component was successful  and met its main
targets.   In most years there were adequate budgetary funds derived from
Government's replanting cess levied on rubber exports. During the period of
national economic constraints in 1984 and 1985, budgetary shortfalls led to a
marked decline in the area approved for replanting which resulted in a sharp
under-achievement of annual replanting targets for those years. Over the project
period, however, the achievement of th4 replanting of old rubber exceeded the
SAR's target of 9,000 hectares.   Some 10,719 hectares were replanted of which
7,915 hectares or 74% were replanted with rubber (7,614 hectares individual
replanting and 301 hectares mini-estate). In addition to replanting, the loan
financed the maintenance up to crop maturity of some 5,042 hectares of rubber
which is about 68% in excess of SAR's target of 3,000 hectares.
2.21      Some 2,318 hectares of oil palm were planted starting from 1985 when
the outlook for this crop was more promising than that of rubber. A further
3,843 hectares of oil palm planted from 1979 were maintained up to maturity with
three post-planting grants.   About 269 hectares or 12% of oil palm replanted
were in mini-estates.  From 1986, some 486 hectares of old rubber area were
replanted with other tree crops such as fruit trees and coffee.
2.22      Overall  standards  of  crop  establishment  and  maintenance  were
satisfactory. The replanting programmes were environmentally sound, with legume
ground cover routinely planted between the rows of the young crops to provide
ground protection from erosion and weeds.



- 11 -
2.23      The 48 hectares rubber nursery included at appraisal wau cancelled
with the change in RISDA's policy to expand their central nursery in North-West
Johore for the supply of planting materials to Malacca.
2.24      Some 104 Group Processing Centres (GPC) were either constructed or
rehabilitated. This was about 47% above the number snvisaged at appraisal. The
three smokehouses for rubber-sheet curing and central storage facilities that
were targeted for construction were cancelled following a change in Government
policy eliminating RISDA's role nationally in the processing of smallholder
rubber.
Irriaation Development
2.25      DID Melaka assisted by their own staff and local consultants executed
all civil works under the Project and this included drainage and irrigation
improvements, farm roads, river training, and minor works catering for area
development. Many programmes were not implemented as originally planned due to
policy changes.   As early as July 1982 the new Irrigatinn Scheme in Brisu was
cancelled when found not economically viable.   Two irrigation schemes targeted
for improvement were cancelled when indepth study was carried out and found not
viable - Jasin II in 1983 and Bacang in 1985. The latter was mainly due to rapid
urban/industrial development.' The extension to Merlimau Drainage Area was also
cancelled due to lack of detailed investigation. About 76% of the SAR's target
was achieved at a cost of about US$305/hectare compared to estimated
US$1,100/hectare.  Rehabilitation of schemes started slowly due to insufficient
design capacity in DID headquarters.2   Only one scheme (Masjid Tanah) was
completed in 1985 and the other two (Duyong and Tangga Batu/Sungai Udang) became
fully operative in mid-1987 in time for the 1988 dry season crops.  All the
schemes were highly dependent on rain and river flows for achieving high cropping
intensities and yields.
Drainace of Aaricultural Lands
2.26      Improvement work has been carried out for two schemes serving about
1,335 hectares (which exceeded SAR's target by 34%) of low lying, frequently
waterlogged lands mostly planted with rubber, oil palm and mixed fruit trees.
The implementation of improvement works on the Merlimau ard Padang Temu/Alai
drainage schemes were carried out smoothly and completed on time, but the
completion of the tidal gate was not on schedule due to insufficient capacity of
the contractor.
1      Borrower notes that economlc non-viability was also due to implementation of the 1984
National Agriculture Policy, which fostered rice production in designated granary areas. Malacca
was not so designated. See Annex 1, p.2.
2      The Borrower's DID points out that this was not the only reason for the slow start, and
refers to para 4.4 below, which indicates that delays were not major and that DID performance and
relationship with the project were good. See Annex 1, p.2



- 12 -
2.27      Additionally, eLght river channels were trained, draining about 4,621
hectares of both rice and mixed cropping lands which is 189% above the target at
appraisal (1,600 hectares). Implementation of this component progressed well and
was highly appreciated by area residents.
Cash Crom Diversification
2.28      This component promoted crop diversification on idle land (mostly padi
land) into more remunerative alternative short-term cash crops, cocoa and tree
crops. This was done by providing agricultural infrastructures such as drainage
and irrigation system, access roads, bridges, culverts etc.; services (tractor
hire, extension, applied research and marketing); and input supplies (fertilizers
and pesticides). Project management vigorously pursued the development of con-
tiguous areas of land by groups of farmers under the Area Development concept.
Various loci were set up and during the first three years the rate of development
was high and farmers' participation was excellent partly due to incentives given
by the Project in terms of subsidies and services.
2.29      Overall, the vustainability for crops was 57% in which 47% of the
original area developed was still utilized with original crops while 10% was
changed to other crops. Some 43% of the area went idle again. Tree crop gus-
tainability was much better at 72% for cocoa and 63% for fruit trees compared to
47% for padi, 57% for short term crops/vegetables and only 35% for banana areas.
However, banana planting should not be regarded as a failure since it was only
for a two-year span. Those areas formerly planted with banana were cultivated
with alternative crops such as cocoa and other permanent crops. In some areas,
banana trees acted as cover crops for young rubber trees. Moreover, thie banana
project which was originally implemented on a trial basis on idle padi land has
given the Project Office some experience which was also useful for other
agencies.
2.30      Inputs and agricultural support service were provided for 2,902
hectares of crops by end of project period with 5,556 farmer participants, at an
average cost of about US$625/hectare or US$341/participant.  Most tree crop
farmers were glven the necessary inputs during the immatu-e period.  Some 1,997
padi growers on 1,299 hectares of land received infrastructure improvements and
minimum amount of input, normally pesticides, since they were already eligible
for free fertilizers. Some 884 farmers participated in vegetables and other
short term crops scheme on 523 hectares of mostly idle padi land. For these
farmers the total costs averaged about US$538/hectare. Some 2,395 farmers planted
various tree crops (cocoa and various types of fruit trees) on 931 hectares of
land at an average cost of about US$431/hectare.
2.31      The 8AR's target for cash crop diversification was 2,310 hectares.
However, this was increased to 3,000 hectares in 1986 and the achievement of this
revised target was about 96.7% (or 25.6% above the original target) with 2,902
hectares of idle land brought in production with various short term and tree
crops (Table 3).

2.32      A padi seed multiplication program was also implemented from 1983 with
average annual hectarage of about 16 hectares. At completion, total area covered
under the prog7;am was about 114 hectares and some 260 tons of approved padi seed
(MR 71 and MR 84 variety) were distributed to padi farmers through selling or
exchanges.
2.33      Some special projects were carried out to test the suitability of
local idle padi land.  This component included the planting of 'Pisang Mao,
(banana), Papaya Exotica (a cross of Subang and Hawaiian Solo variety), Pomeloes
and Starfruits. 'Sabah Cnoy' (sweet shoots) and Rock Melon were also tried. The
trial plots done with the assistance of MARDI were valuable as a learning
process.   They were successfully planted and provided a base for further
expansion of area.
Dairy Develoument
2.34      Through  the  DVS  allocation,  1,063  heifers  were  supplied  and
distributed and some 208.5 hectares of pasture and fodder grasses were
established. Breed upgrading, improved feeding and care led to an increase in
Malacca's dairy herd population to a total of about 3,000 dairy cows. One Milk
Collection Center and three Sub-centres were constructed to cater to the increase
in milk production in Malacca.   Equipment were also provided.   Malacca is
currently the top dairy state in Peninsular Malaysia.
Fish Pond Develooment
2.35      The Department of Fisheries (DOF), with the cooperation of the  Pro-
ject, assisted farmers with the construction of freshwater fish ponds through an
existing subsidy program (M$3,000 for 0.2 hectare pond). Farmers' interest in
this project was quite strong in the initial years.   On termination of the
subsidy program in 1986, only 60.5 hectares or 23% of the project target was
achieved, with 303 ponds at an average of 0.2 hectare per pond.
Parm Road
2.36      The Project provided for the construction of about 140 kilometers of
access and farm roads in 52 segments. During project implementation, the target



- 14 -
was reduced to 85 kilometers, which was over-achieved.   There were 5 local
contract packages for about 48.1 kilometers at an average cost of
US$13,560/kilometer    (which   was   higher   than   SAR's   estimate   of
US$12,857/kilometer). The rest (106.3 kilometers) was done through indent work
at a lower coat of about US$7,563/kilometer. The State is now well provided with
roads for farming communities and production areas. Maintenance has been timnely
and satisfactory. Some farm roads were upgraded by the State authorities. About
5,743 hectares of agricultural areas, mostly rubber and oil palm involving 7,082
farmers, have benefited from this farm road construction.
Farmers' Development Centreg
2.37      The Project constructed four Farmers' Development Centres (FDC) and
three sub-centres at strategic locations in the State. Farmers' Organization
Authority (FOA) which was the main occupant and other participating age. ties were
provided with office and storage facilities as well as staff quarters where
necessary. This proved to be a successful effort in obtaining agency cooperation
and allowed decentralization of staff away from Malacca City. All agricultural
extension services at the district level were coordinated at these Centres. FDC
cost an average of US$143,500 while sub-center cost averaged US$60,000.
2.38      A  small Agricultural Marketing Center,  operated by the Federal
Agricultural Marketing Authority (FAMA) was attached to one of the FDCa
(Merlimai).
EcuiRment. Vehicles and Materials
2.39      The Project wae to provide DOA, FOA, MARDI, DID, FAMA, DOF and RISDA
with substantial facilitie': vehicles and equipment.   Given the budget con-
straints, most of the equipment/vehicles purchases estimated at US$0.22 million
were cancelled. Final expenditures for equipment/vehicles was US$1.10 million,
or about 83% of the SAR's estimate.
2.40      Due to the substantially larger area of idle land development with
inputs provided by the PD office, fairly large quantities of fertilizers (2,182
tons) and approved agro-chemicals (55,169 kilograms) were locally procured in
seasonal batches and given free to the farmers.
Consultancies and Overseas Trainina
2.41      Provision was made for 36 man-months of local and 30 man-months of
foreign consultants to assist DID and MOA with planning and implementing various
components of the Project at a total cost of US$1.0 million. Another US$0.2
million was allocated for overseas training.   Due to the reduced scope of
irrigation works, some of the funds were used by DID Headquarters with approval
from the Bank for the detailed engineering design of drainage works under the
Second West Johore Proiect with a cont-act value of M$1.9 million. The proposed
idle padi land study was withdrawn since it was no longer relevant after changes
in Government policy under which Malacca was not a granary area.  Only one



- 15 -
foreign consultant was employed for a period of 13 months to assist the PD Office
in the preparation of a monitoring and evaluation system.
2.42       Budget constraints also provented the proposed overseas staff training
programmes. Only two staff members proceeded for 3 months of training in the
United Kingdom and Netherlands respectLvely.
2.43       Inclusive of West Johore Project coneultancy, overall coat was about
US$0.69 million, which was 43% below the SAR's estimate and 99% of the revised
estimate in 1989.

III      PROJECT RESULT  BENEFIT AND ECONOMIC EVALUATION
Smallholder Rubber Development
3.1        Rubber Replantinoa  Replantlng of rubber went on smoothly even though
achievement was less than the appraisal target in 1982 to 1987. Due to the
extension of the project period, replanting was continued until September 1989,
achieving 113.6% of SAR's target for indlvidual replanting but only 13.4% for
mini-estate. The main reason was the high costs incurred on mini-estates as



- 16 -
campared to implementation by smallholders themselves. The overall achievement
was 88% of 8AR's target (Table 5).
3.2        Rubber to Oil Palm Qonversion: A total of 2,318 hectares of old rubber
were replanted with oil palm mostly between 1985 to 1987 following the favorable
price of that commodity during thoue years. The hectarage suffered a decline in
1988 and increased again in the final year of the Project.
3.3        Rubber to Other Cros ConversLon:  About 486 hectares of other crops,
mainly fruit trees and coffee, were planted on ex-rubber land under RISDA's
replanting schme. Cocoa was not included under this scheme.

3.4        Rubb-r  Maintenance:    The  actual  maintenance  scheme  for  rubber
repltnted between 1976 to 1981 was 5,042 hectares, which was 96% of the SAR's
estimate. The malntenance scheme was spread over a period of eight years from
1982 to 1989.
3.5        oil  Palm  Maintenance:  Some  1,843  hectares  of  oil palm  replanted
between  1979 and  1985  and given maintenance  grant  from  1982  to  1989 were
reimlbursed, following the amendment to the Loan Agreement in 1986 which allowed
reimbursement effective from 1982 (Sae Table 6).

3.6       Yield and Production: Rubber would be ready for tapping by year nine.
For individual replanting, the first tapping was in 1990 producing about 390 tons
(Appendix 14). Total estimated rubber production for 25 years is 216,000 tons
which is 63.7% of 8AR's estimate (Table 7).

smallholders was 1.9 hectares for rubber, 2.06 hectares for oil palm and 1. 6
hectares for other crops. With such size, it is estimated that about 9,144
rubber smallholders benefited from the Project as shown below:

3.8       Rubber Prlces:  Natural rubber experienced price fluctuations as a
result of supply and demand forces. Rubber prices were low in 1982, bullish in
1983 and 1984 but declined again in 1985. Prices appreciated slightly in 1987
but the rise is insignificant when translated into constant prices.

3.9       Economic Rate of Return:  The individual rubber replanting component
has an economic rate of return of 12% compared to 14% estimated at appraisal.
Mini-estate replanting has an ERR of 29% while, for rubber maintenance, the ERR
is 22% which is much higher than the appraisal estimate of 15%. This relatively
high rate is because the yields occurred early and therefore enjoyed the benefit
of good rubber prices in the early years of the Project. The economic rate of
return for ex-rubber land replanted with oil palm is about 26%.
Irriaation Imorovement
3.10      CroDina Pattern and Yield:  The cropping intensity for padi had
declined steadily in 1985, 1986 and 1987 even though the three improvement
schemes were completed. This was due to the declining interest in padi planting.
None of the areas were double-cropped. The padi production area covered in 1988
when all the three schemes were fully operative was only 407 hectares compared
to 1,848 hectares targeted at appraisal. Large areas were either left idle or
diversified to short term crops. SAR estimated that the cropping intensity would
be about 160% three years after project completion.   However, the cropping
intensity two years after the completion of the latest scheme was only 88% with
yield of 3.6 tons per hectare.
3.11      Productions  The projected total. padi production is about 1,570 tons
as compared to the appraisal estimate of 11,985 tons. This lower production was
due to the declining area planted with padi. This is a healthy change since it
is the policy of OA to diversify padi areas to other viable crops in non-granary
areas.

3.13      Farmerg' Income: The survey conducted by PD's Office in 1989 showed
that 8.5% of the 2adi farm families lived in poverty with monthly household
incomes of less than MS350 (Table 11). The average income was about M$843/month
while the padi sector contributed only about 11% (i.e. M$90) to the total monthly
household income. A large portion of the income was from off-farm sources, a
normal trend among Malacca's farmers.

3.14      Economic Rate of Return:  The SAR's estimated ERR was 24%.  The  PCR
calculation gave an economic rate of return of 12%, if padi bonuses at $16.50/100
kilogram of padi sold were excluded from the production cost since these payments
were made outside the farm gate prices. However, if padi bonuses were to be
considered as an element of the production cost, the ERR is nil.

Drainaae Improvement
3 15      Benefits   Some 541 hectares of agricultural areas (rubber, oil palm
and fruits) have bonefited through avoidance of flooding and water saturation as
a result of improvement works to three drainage schemes. The area is about 54%
of SAR's target of 1,000 hectares.
3.16      Since data on incremental benefit was not available, the calculation
of production war based on marginal benefit from all additional areas. With the
project life of 25 years, it is expected that total production from benefiting
areas will be about 76,182 tons with 58%, 37% and 5% under oil palm, fruits and
rubber respectively.
3.17      Economic Rate of Return:  The estimated ERR at appraisal was 11%. The
PCR calculation gave an economic rate of return of 24%. This relatively high
percentage was due to the lower capital and production costs involved (for
details, see Appendix 67).
River Improvement
3.18      gnefij:  About 1,800 hectares benefited directly (not affected by
flooding and water saturation) after the completion of eight river improvement
schemes. The phasing of incremental benefited areas is shown in Table 12.

3.19      Production:  Calculation of production was based on marginal benefit
from all additional areas.  Out of eight benefited areas, three agricultural
areas (Sungai Baru, Sungai Alor Gajah and Sungai Tuang) were planted with padi
monocrop while the areas adjacent to Sungai Tedong, Sungai Duyong, Sungai Lereh,
Sungai Umbai and Sungai Punggor were utilized with mixed cropping, mostly rubber
and oil palm (also about 20 hectares with padi in Sungai Tedong area). The
expected annual production after completion is about 48,075 tons of various
crops. Some 326,877 tons of various crops are expected to be produced from the
areas in 25 years (about 93% of the tonnage will be from oil palm). Appendix 72
provides details.
3.20      Economic Rate of Return: PCR calculation gave the ERR of this program
at 12% which is lower than the SAR's estimate of 14%.

Dairy Development
3.21      Benef$tt There were 313 active dairy farmers who regularly sent their
milk production to various collection centres in 1989. This number is slightly
smaller than that in the previous year (355 farmers).   The number of active
farmers from 1982 is shown in Appendix 81.
3.22      The number of dairy cattle increased from about 1,910 heads at the
start of the Project to 3,772 heads in 1990 and is estimated to increase to some
6,674 in the final year of project life (25 years). It is estimated that about
46% of the total cattle population are active milkers. The other 30% are males
and small calves in stock, while about 24% are aging and non-productive.
3.23      Progtgtgao:   Milk sold to the MCCs was nearly 2.0 million liters
during early Pxoject yeaLs and increased steadily until 1987 when it reached a
record of 3.97 uillion liters. From that year onwards, the production decreased
slightly and at completion, total production went down to 3.2 million liters.
This decreasing trend was due to various problems faced by the sector such as:
(a) the increase in stock more than 10 years old;
(b) non-replacement of stock during the years 1987 to 1989;
(c) new pricing scheme under which milk was paid according to quality
(solid contents) which resulted in better quality control;
(d) the increasing cost of production, especially the price of feeds, and
prolonged drought in the State affecting grazing areas; and
(e) discouragement by the estates of rearing of cattle in their areas.
3.24      With the new program to increase dairy cattle population through
replacement of old stock in the Sixth Malaysia Plan and the construction of a
Milk Plant, it is expected that milk production will increase steadily in the
years to come. Malacca will be the dairy state to be reckoned with.
3.25      Price:  The average price of fresh milk increased from M$600/1,000
liters in 1982 to M$810/1,000 liters in 1989. However, the relatively high price
included Government's price subsidy of M$200/1,000 liters in 1982 and 1989 plus
bonus payment of N$10/1,000 liters from 1984. When translated into economic
price, the farm gate price was M$421/1,000 liters in 1982 and increased to more
than MS500/1,000 liters in 1988 onwards (see Appendix 87 for details).
3.26      Farmers' Income:   Farm Survey undertaken by the PD Office in 1989
found that the average farmers' household income was M$847 per month and dairy
farming contributed about 37% or M$317 per month. Those who were in the poor
group with income of less than M$350 per month constituted about 13% of the total
farmers while more than 80% were getting an income higher than M$500 per month.
3.27      Economic Rate of Return:  At completion, the ERR was calculated at
2.3% which is lower than SAR's estimate of 10%. This is because of very low
returns due to high cost of production, especially the feed cost. Besides, the



- 22 -
price subsidy given by the Government has been excluded from the economic
farmgate price.
Fish Pond Develonment
3.28      Phasina of Development:   The Project managed to construct 60.48
hectares of freshwater fish pond during the project period, which was about 23%
of the appraisal target (Table 13). The areas developed with fish pond were
below target because pond construction subsidies were withdrawn in 1985.

3.29      Performance:   Assessment of the ponds performance was conducted
regularly. Only about 43% of the ponds produced regular yields. The average
annual production for fish ponds recorded in 1987, 1988 and 1989 was 0.9,  1.03,
and 0.93 tons/hectare, respectively.   This was quite low compared to SAR's
estimate of 1.8 to 2.2 tons/hectare. However, some selected active farmers could
produce up to 4.5 tons/hectare per year as revealed through a study undertaken
by the . Office in 1987.
3.30     x%roduction:  At completion, annual fish production was estimated at
24.18 tV.s and about 562.2 tons in 25 years (compared to SAR's estimate of 12,275
tons). This low production was due to reduction in area developed as well as
average low yield.
3.31      Benefit:  There were originally 224 farmers involved in the project,
but at completion, about 57% were inactive due to lack of interest, frequent
flooding and drought. Low yield resulted in lower income and average gross
income from the pond per farmer was only M$951 per year.
3.32      Prices:  The average economic price for 1989 was M$3.91/kilogram.
3.33      Economic Rate of Return:  As the yield is lower than expected, the
economic rate of return is also very low. The rate of return calculated at PCR
was less than 1% compared to 16% at appraisal.
Cash Croos
3.34      Phasing of Develooment:  The Project managed to develop 523 hectares
of cash crops comprising vegetables and short term crops. However, it was found
that only about 32% of these areas were sustained with original crops at
completion. They are assumed to remain constant through the end of project life.

3.35      Production: A survey conducted by PD's office shows that the average
production of cash crops was about 6.9 tons/hectare which was higher than SAR's
estimate of 3.7 to 4.0 tons/hectare. This level of production was obtained from
active utilization of farms with 3 crop cycles per year.
3.36      At completion, the estimated annual yield was about 1,159 tons and
about 24,382 tons were expected to be produced in 25 years.
3.37      Price:J  The derivation of economic price for various selected
vegetables and other short term crops is shown in Appendix 107. The economic
price at farm gate in 1989 was M$438/ton and this is assumed to remain constant.
3.38      Economic Rate of Return:  PCR calculation gave the ERR of cash crops
development program at 2.9%. This low percentage was due to low sustainability
of area under the crops and high cost of production.
Total Proiect
3.39      Overall Proiect Rate of Return:  The overall economic rate of return
is 14% which is lower than the expected 15% in the SAR. The summary of all

Cost Recovery
3.40      Cost recovery is from zakat for padi and from cess and export duty for
rubber. Zakat is obligatory for Muslims and the amount is 10% of gross output.
Excluding the payment of padi bonus, the collection of zakat based on incremental
yield would be about N$0.07 million in 1990.
3.41      For rubber, the replanting cess levied is 10 sen/kilogam, research
cess 4 sen/kilogram and export duty varies with the FOB price. It was calculated
that the export duty was 24.5 sen/kilogram in 1988, 13.2 sen/kilogram in 1989 and
12.2 sen/kilogram in 1990. Total cost recovery from rubber would be about M$1.65
million in 1990. The peak collection years would be between 1997 and 1999 with
the amount of about M$10 million per year, and drop to M$7 million from 2000 when
the trees produce less. The cumulative collection would be about M$86 million
by the year 2002, which is sufficient to recover all the cost incurred on the
Project.
Other Aaricultural Services Activities
3.42      Farmers'  roranization:  There were five Area Farmers' organizations
(AFO) under FOA in Malacca. In 1989, a total of 13,800 farmers were members of
these APO which was a 51% increase compared to the start of the Project (9,165
in 1982) and this membership was 69% of the FOA's target of 20,130. Members
benefited from this organization through various activities such as credit for
agricultural inputs, farm mechanization, profit from contracts and business
ventures etc. At the end of 1989, some M$0.34 million in members' shares were
credited into APO's account.
3.43      The annual business volume of AbOs was quite satisfactory with value
of contract works at more than M$1.O million and another M$3.0 million from other
business activities. A self-reliant AFO is still a dream since, when management
costs are included not a single APO showed profit. There is still a lot to be
done and at present financial returno none will be in the self-reliant category
in many years to come. A summary of the organization's performance is shown in
Table 16.

3.44      Reeearch Activities:  Some crop-based research activities by MARDI
through the implementation of trial plots were also financed by the Project. The
activities included fruits research on starfruit in Duyong and pomeloes in Bukit
Meta mainly to determine the suitability of such fruits on idle padi lands.
Apart from that, MARDI was also involved in the practical observation on crops
including the new variety of papaya, rock melon, vegetables, bananas and cocoa
in various areas developed by the Project. Most of the research and observations
are on-going and results are produced from time to time for other agencies and
farmers.
3.45      Marketina Activities: FAMA'e role was crucial in the marketing of
fruits, cocoa, cash crops and freshwater fish produced by farmers. In several
strategic places, FAMA had organized farmers' markets as a marketing alternative.
FAMA had benefited from the Project through the construction of Agricultural
Marketing Center (AMC) in Merlimau. There was no major marketing problem during
the project period. Marketing outlets for quality fruits and cash crops were
readily available. FAMA also took the initiative through its market intelligence
to produce various monthly reports on supply and demand of commodities in
Malacca. Apart from easing supply planning, these reports also helped to monitor
production areas.   Other useful  information  is also available to those
interested.   FAMA has been actively involved in the training of farmers,
especially in marketing of cash crops and grading of cocoa. Several collection
centres in viable cash crop production areas were set up to ease collection and
marketing of farmers' product. The Project has been highly dependent on FAMA for
market outlets when planning any planting of crops.
IV. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER. THE BANK AND LESSONS LEARNED
Performance of The Borrower
4.1       As mentioned earlier, the PD's tenure of office right from the initial
stage of Project implementation to the end was a very important factor which
ensured continuity, particularly of planning, implementation, monitoring and
evaluation, and thus contributed enormously to the Project's success. Forward
planning could be done and remedial measures to avoid any derailment in the
implementation  process  could  be  adopted.    The  package  deal  covering
infrastructural, crop, fisheriee, dairy, livestock and other related developments
gave slgnificant benefits to the target groups.



- 26 -
4.2       Project preparation, especially the ground work, was carried out
smoothly. Initial planning was done by having a series of dialogues with the land
owners. Meetings were held with the various sub-technical committees to ensure
proper Implementation on the ground (especially under Infrastructural and Crop
Development). A bigger Area Development Committee was also set up covering the
field officers of various participating departments. Development was done on the
"Locus Concept" where several loci were developed after initial success.
Semi-detailed and detailed planning were normal processes a locus must go
through. A locus was divided by hectarage and geographical area. Benefits were
only given to interested farmers and Project Action Committees were set up as the
voice of the participants. With such mode of implementation, one would expect
success but, as mentioned earlier, sustainability was only partial. It should
not deter a practitioner. It is an experience one has to go through in human
development where multifaceted socio-economic strata exist. One lesson derived
by the Project management was with regards to the future areas of concentration
where further development of the target groups could be undertaken. These viable
areas were given special focus and farmers in these areas derived a lot of
benefits and experienced improvement in their livelihood. Close and constant
contact as well as systematic monitoring of projects maintained the sustainable
percentage.
4.3       Land acquisition faced no major problems since the Project managemlent
processed it at an early stage. The State Government was very cooperative in
expediting applications. Any hindrances were brought up to the State Government,
which solved them early.
4.4       No  major  delays  were  experienced  as  regards  the  designs  of
infrastructural works which were completed in-house by DID. Good relationship
with DID headquarters expedited the process and some designs were taken up by the
State Office.
4.5       Delays were prevented by PD'a office with constant monitoring and
esprit de corps at official or unofficial levels. Committees met regularly to
clear the path of implementation. The setting up of sub-technical committees
helped.
4.6       The Project office set up a good monitoring and evaluation system
which started from initial project implementation. Collection of socio-economic
data, records on project implementation, audit reports and withdrawal
applications were timely. Regular reporting system via the "Rapid Observation"
format by the ground officers kept track of project implementation. Various
other monitoring and evaluation formats were devised by the Project management
to ease the flow of information.
4.7       The Project management did well to adapt to financial shortfalls
experienced during implementation and put forward to the Bank three Loan
Agreement amendments. These led to the cancellation of a portion of the loan and
also reviews of projects to be implemented.
4.8       Generally, the Project has performed up to expectation and this has
happened due to the cooperation among the Project management team and
participating departments.



- 27 -
Performance of The Bank
4.9       The Bank's supervision missions visited the Project twice a year
during the first few years of implementation.   The missions provided much
guidance on disbursement procedures and project implementation and also provided
valuable solutions to problems faced. These missions, consisting of a tree crop
specialist and an agronomist, dealt effectively with the Project management
during the course of implementation. The missions never failed to visit on-going
projects and provided useful insights and comments. Their sincerity to smoothen
the implementation process led to various unofficial meetings in Kuala Lumpur.
This occurred when the missions did not include Malacca as part of their
itinerary.
4.10      During the final years of Project implementation,  missions were
handled only by the agronomist who was a great help to the Project Management
because of his sincere criticism and comments. He provided a lot of guidance and
solutions to problems and this was strongly felt during the time of the
preparation of data for this report. The Bank's economist also played a role in
providing valuable guidance to ease the preparation of the Project Completion
Report.
4.11      Generally, these missions were very effective and greatly helped to
smoothen project implementation. otherwise the process might have experienced
some significant problems.
Lessons Learned
4.12      In retrospect, there appeared to be over-enthusiasm and lack of
detailed planning during the pre-project stage which led to non-implementation
of a number of projects.   This led also to over-estimation of costs to be
incurred during implementation stage.   Preparation reports were not very
satisfactory.    This applied particularly to the drainage  and  irrigation
improvement namely Brisu Irrigation (new constriction), Jasin II, Bacang and
Msrlimau Extension.    The Project management was quick to realize these
shortcomings and proposed remedial measures such as the Expenditure and Scope
Review and other relevant proposals which led to loan cancellation, amendments
to the Loan Agreement and increasing projects' scope in order to fully utilize
the loan.   Without these measures, the Government would have had to pay a lot
of commitment charges arising from loan disbursement delays.
4.13      There also appeared to be excessive provision at appraisal for staff
quarters to be constructed and equipment to be bought.  Moreover, financial
conatraints were faced in times of the downward trend of the economy arid the
central agencies then did not give enough budget to implement identified
projects. Training of officers overseas was also affected as many courses were
identified in the SAR but not considered during budgetary allocations.
4.14      Lack of detailed planning also led to some viable projects not being
included in the SAR.   The Project management did identify these projects which



- 38 -
were reimbursed by the Bank.   In future,  all projects pertaining to the
objectives of the Project should be put up to the Bank.
4.15      Some assumptions made in the SAR were not realistic.   There was
over-estimation of crop yields and some prices. Unrealistic categorization of
farmers into models A, B, C and D made comparisons on the% same basis impossible.
The farmers' interest in padi farming was also not dealt with deeply. It was
assumed that they xuld participate in padi planting after an irrigation
improvement. During the Project period this was not so and the expected cropping
intensity did not materialize. Infrastructural upgrading should be concentrated
in available double cropped areas.
4.16      In the SAR, little emphasis was given to the small scale civil works
which were extensively implemented by the Project. The Project management would
like to suggest that in future major and small civil works should be given the
same platform as, in terms of benefits, both works have the same merit. While
major works like drainage, irrigation and river improvement had a wider coverage
in terms of area, small scale civil works which normally cover smaller areas and
require shorter time to implement provided immediate benefits to farmers. These
projects include farm roads, small drainage system, culverts, control gates and
bridges.
4.17      The  justification  of embarking  on projects  such  as the Dusun
Rehabilitation was also not studied in detail and this component had to be
cancelled.  It should not have been in the Project at all.  In future, only
viable projects should be included. It is also important that the projects have
proper objectives; this could ease the monitoring and evaluation process.
4.18      The mainstay of this Project was the monitoring and evaluation of
projects and this was fully acknowledged by the Bank. The Project management
established the mechanism for data collection, record keeping and studies and
these were given due compliments by the Bank. Data was readily available and as
such little problem was faced by the Project management when requested by
interested parties.
4.19      Careful monitoring of projects  implemented,  especially  in crop
development, gave worthy albeit bitter lessons to the Project staff.
Sustainability of such endeavors needed a lot of perseverance on farmers' part
and a lot of commitment on the official side. Close and constant contact was
encouraged and any observation must be reported in the "Rapid Observation
Reports". Attention was given to interested farmers and they were the ones who
benefited from the Project with increase in their income and improvement in their
quality of life. Non-sustainable cases were unavoidable especially in areas with
acute labor shortage and high rate of out migration.   Close monitoring,
incentives, upgrading of ventures, fast solutions to problems and proper choice
of crops managed to stabilLze the sustainable rate at the end of the project
period.
4.20      Trials implemented on idle padi land with certain tree crops managed
to prove their suitability and this should be taken into account in future
projects. Proper drainage and irrigation facilities are, however, necessary.



- 29 -
4.21      Adopting central control of annual budgetary allocations led to
prudent financial management and full utilization of resources. This system was
a good move by the Ministry since it gave the PD some authority in utilizing the
allocations according to the need and speed of each component.
4.22     Much could be accomplished also if all relevant staff were placed
under the direct control and under the same roof with the PD.   Even though it
may be too much to expect, it is a suggestion to ponder seriously. Such move
with a proper controlling system will greatly facilitate project implementation.
4.23      The project had a 'bottom up' approach which helped to ensure that
only those groups with firm commitment and that really needed the project got
what they asked for. This system was actively practieed from mid-project period.
Interested parties planned at the initial stage what they wanted and took the
trouble also to get access from land owners if farm roads or drainage and
irrigation system were to be constructed. Other simple planning processes were
also encouraged from the target groups. As the years went by, the procedures set
up were clearly understood by them. It has become a standard procedure with
which the target groups have to comply whenever they apply for a project.
4.24      The setting up of the committees helped to get the participating
ager.cies' staff closer and expedited implementation. Project visits by officere
of the PD's office were made together with relevant ground staff and their
rapport was very good.  The setting up of ground level committees helped to
bridge the communication gap and also solved many problems.
4.25      The tenure of office of the PD helped smooth implementation and
continuity of work was ensured.  The officere of the PD's office and other
responeive staff from participating agencies benefited tremendously from this
Project. They gained knowledge and experience of planning and management of
projects. They were able to wider their horizons beyond their former fields of
training - they acquired knowledge on livestock, fisheries, crop and
infrastructural development.
4.26      There were also some lessons learnt from APO's activities.  AFO is an
organization with members comorilsing of farmers having shares. It played a vital
role in uniting its members for an active participation in the agricultural
sector. Facilities such as credit for agricultural inputs, farm mechanization
and transportation eased some burdens on farmers in the course of their farming
activities. But the over-emphasis and concentration on its business enterprises
such as contract works and supplies caused AFO's commodity development work for
crops, livestock and others to suffer.   AFO was also found to be heavily
dependent on Government support with funds via the FOA and PD"s office for its
management overheads. Self-reliant AFOs are yet to emerge.
4.27      There is still a lot to be done by AFO to achieve the self-reliant
category. More viable projects in the agricultural sector should be ventured
into. The PD's Office and MARDI did the groundwork in idertifying types of crops
best suited to Malacca.  There are large areas suitable for cultivation and
adequate infrastructure is available. AFO needs to make a bold move to improve
its services to lts members and to fortify its financial base. This depends a
lot on the dynamism of the Board of Directors and Management, more so on the



- 30 -
General Manager.  The objective of the Project was to achieve equally balanced
development ln varlous subsectors of crops, dairy, aquaculture and others.
Mevertheles, the overall rate of development was unequal among subsectors. Many
crop development programmes faced the problem of areas reverting to being ldle
again. Failures were due to lack of manpower, drought, dwindllng lnterest of
som  partLcLpating farmers ln addltion to marketlng, input supply and farm
mechanlzatLon problms.  The Project devlied some effectlve implementatLon
strategles, lncludlng an improvement of the monitorLng and evaluation system,
focussLng on full. tlme commercial farmers and conductlng a thorough
envlronmental scannlng' durlng plannlng. 'Scannlng' lncluded a revlew of the
compatiblilty  of soll, crops and partLclpants to ensure sustaLnability of
development and maximize lmpact on agrLcultural development.
4.28      The dalry component showed consLderable success. Mllk productlon and
total dalry cattle population Lncreased steadily.   Adequate lnfrastructure
facilitles such as Mllk Collectlon Centres and Sub-centres, transport servLces
for mllk from MCC/MCSC to mllk processLng plants and strLngent mllk quallty
control contrLbuted to the lmprovement of the sector. Government's mllk prlce
subsLdy also helped to stablilze pricLe  and lncomes of dalry farmers.  However,
towards the end of the Project, productlon decreased alLghtly due to various
problems faced by the sector. Nevertheless the scenarLo ls expected to improve
wlth the lntroductlon of programmes geared towards the lncrease of dalry cattle
populatLon in the years to come.
4.29      The aquaculture  sector experlenced the problem  of  ldle ponds.
However, group projects done by actLve farmers turned out to be more successful.
important crlterla of a successful venture are actlve partLclpants, established
marketLng outlets, and the partLcLpants maLntaLning a rapport wlth Project Actlon'
Commlttee and flild offLcers of the FLiherLes Department and the PD'S Offlce.
4.30      In general, the lntegrated approach proved to be an effectlve approach
in the development of the agrLcultural sector. The glst of the approach is
well-regulated and coordlnated development, quLck actlon in rectlfylng problems
faced by target groups, and concerted offorts to prepare a package for each
project planned. This ensures manpower and tlme conservatlon. The Project could
be implemented smoothly and approprlately. Flnanclal allocatlon could then be
channelled to vlable projects after a thorough evaluatlon ls done lnvolving many
agencles.

COMMENTS ON DRAFT PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ON MALACCA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(1) Page V para 2 line 10
The  report  points  out  that  the  potential  returns  from   the
irrigation improvement component are questionable. However, it
should be noted that the ERR for irrigation improvement component
was 12% which is quite reasonable for this project.
(2) Page 1
The correct date should be May 18, 1982 in para 1.3 line 4 and
October 7, 1982 in para 1.6 line 2.
(3) Page 4 Para 1.17 line 4
The   sentence  "This  normal  attitude  of  certain   departmental
priorities ahead" is repeated and should be deleted.
(4) Page 10 para 2.25
(a) Line 5
The new irrigation scheme in Brisu and two irrigation improvement
schemes in Jasin II and Bacang were cancelled from the project
partly because it was found not economically viable and also due to
implementation of the National Agriculture Policy in 1984 when
Malacca was not considered as a granary area.
(b) Line 12
It should be noted that the rehabilitation of schemes started
slowly   was  not  solely  due  to  the  design  capacity  in   DID
headquarters. This is in accordance to para 4.4, section IV, page
25.
(5) Spelling Mistakes
There are a number of spelling mistakes in the report. The
important ones are as follow:
(a) Page 24 para 3.45 line 5
Merlicau should spell as Merlimau.
(b) Page 27 para 4.12 line 3
Merlima should spell as Merlimau.

Dear Mr. Donaldson,
Malaysia: Malacca Integrated Agricultural Development Project (Loan 2147 - MA)
Draft Completion Report (PCR)
We would like to thank you for letter of February 28, 1992 enclosing the draft PCR of
the Malacca IADP. We are pleased to hear from you that project implementation was
generally free from problems. This in itself was partially due to lessons learned from
the implementation of previous projects as well as to the dedication and uninterrupted
tenure of the Project Director. We note in particular that the project has contributed
substantially to the beneficiaries'  productivity/incomes  and that the number of
beneficiaries has even exceeded that of the appraisal target.
2.    Of particular interest to us, however, are the findings and lessons learned from
the implementation of the project. As you may well be aware, the Malaysian Government
irTends to place emphasis on the implementation of integrated area development projects
as one of the strategies of in situ development, now that land for new planting is
getting increasingly scarco. We will strive to overcome problems which prevent the
smooth implementation of future projects and we certainly agree with you also that the
continuity and appropriate skill mix of Bank staff during supervision will greatly
enhance implementation capability as well as maintain enthusiasm.
3.    Thank you again for the favourable comments in the PCR and we look forward
towards receiving the final report.
Yours Sincerely,
(Signed)
