NEMORANDU MAND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDEm
OF TIE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EMECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF HAITI
FOR THE FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
1.   The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Haiti for SDR 9.40 million (US$12.61 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years' maturity and help finance the Fifth
Education Project for Haiti.
2.    Background.  Haiti, with a population of about 6.3 million, is the
poorest country in Latin America, and its economic and social development
faces major challenges. The per capita GNP has decreased every year since
1980 and was US$400 in 1989. Recent political crises and civil disturbances,
which resulted in the suspension of vital external aid in 1987-90, have
further weakened the country's fragile economy. Social indicators reflect the
depressed environment: The infant mortality rate is 116 per 1,000 live births,
and about 65 percent of adult Haitians are illiterate. Between 25 and 30
percent of the labor force is unemployed.
3.    Despite a comprehensive educational reform launched in 1982, basic
education in Haiti faces major deficiencies due to low school enrollments,
poor quality of education, and inefficient resource management. Haiti nearly
doubled enrolliseits during the 1980. to one million students (evenly
distributed by sender), but students enrolled in grades one to six represent
only about 50 percent of the corresponding age group. The private sector has
absorbed the bulk of rising demand for basic education, with an increase of
its enrollment share from 40 percent in 1973 to 72 percent in 1989. However,
quality remains poor across the system, especially in underfinanced private
rural schools. About 80 percent of teachers in rural areas do not have the
required ten years of formal education. The delivery of inservice training
that could improve instructional quality has been hampered by the low level of
teachers' formal educat n. Inspectors and advisors do not provide
instructional supervisiou in a periodic and organized fashion. Only about 25
percent of children in rural schools have access to textbooks or to other
educational materials. Although several commercially developed textbook
series exist, textbook provision is sporadic and inconsistent due to high
costs and lack of agreement on curricula. Not only are ;eachers unable to
teach clearly defined material, they cannot monitor student progress due to a
lack of achievement tests. Often instruction takes place in dilapidated
buildings vithout basic furniture and equipment. Sector policies to address
these problems hive been developed in the past, but their implementation could
not be sustained in Haitil's bleak economic environment. A realistic needs
assessment is necessary in the areas of instructional quality, educational
finance, organizational structure, and school construction and maintenance in
order to develop a workable sector policy and investment program for the
medium term.
4.    It is estimated that families finance 25 percent of the overall cost of
public primary schooling. In 1987, the Government increased its public
expenditure on education from 1.5 to 2.7 percent of GDP. Salaries in the



Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sport (MENJS) were brought in line with the
rest of the civil service. Without improved inservice training, supervision,
or instructional materials, however, the increased expenditure did not yield
better accessibility or quality of public education. The salary expenditure
rose to 93 percent of the MENJS budget, leaving no budgetary margin for
operation, materials, or maintenance. Poor budgeting practices and personnel
record-keeping in the MENJS also result in wastage. Despite the educational
opportunity provided by the expansion of low-cost private-sector schools,
teacher salaries at these schools (US$50 against US$175 per month in the
public sector) reflect the generally low qualifications of private-school
teachers. To address the quality issue of private education, the Haitian
Foundation for Private Education (FONHEP) started an instructional and salary
support program to private rural schools with financing from the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) in 1986.
5.    Since 1976, IDA has financed four operations in the education sector.
The first and second projects (Credit 618-HA, US$5 million, 1976; and Credit
770-HA, US$10 million, 1978) sought to increase access to basic and nonformal
education. The third and fourth projects (Credit 1305-HA, US$9 million, 1983;
and Credit 1592-HA, US$10 million, 1985) supported respectively the first and
second stage of the 1982 educational reform vith curriculum changes, training,
and increased access to basic education. Although the scope of some projects
was reduced after the civil disturbances of 1987, objectives have been mostly
met, with delays of no more than a year. Lessons learned from previous
projects, mainly centering on implementation and procurement, have been taken
into account in the design of the proposed project. Notwithstanding the
recent political and economic instability and current financial constraints,
several factors are favorable to the improvement of the quality of basic
education in Haiti today: (a) Haiti has many dedicated educators with good
expertise; (b) the unabated demand for education even among the poorest rural
families has been associated with the development of a responsive and cost-
effective private sector; (c) the recent evaluation of the 1982 reform
provides well-defined and broadly accepted areas for further sectoral
development; (d) a successful experience with public subsidies to private
rural schools initiated under the Fourth Pro,ect has helped identify options
for an improved partnership and future investment; above all (e) the
Goverrment's support which had been lacking since the launching of the reform
can now be harnessed for the benefit of the sector; and (f) the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and other agencies and donors are committed to
supporting the development and implementation of a realistic sector policy.
6.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.  A popular election was held for the
first time in Haiti in December of 1990. The elected Government has the
difficult task of resuming the management of public affairs, restoring
essential political and social stability and minimum confidence in the public
sector, arresting the financial and economic deterioration, and promoting
policies that will lead towards the resumption of growth. The current IDA
goal is to ensure continued sectoral dialogue with the Government, maintain
the quality improvement benefits of the four previous projects and take
advantage of the existing opportunities for sector modernization and
integration. The proposed Fifth Education project would therefore be a
transitional irolect with limited scope and duration. It would set the
conditions and carry out technical preparation for future lending that would
seek to strengthen and expand basic education within an integrated



public/private financing and management framework. IDA involvement would be
supported by various positive developments in the sector, particularly the
Government's emphasis on poverty alleviation and basic education for all, and
its genuine interest for private sector participation in educational
development.
7.    Proiect Obiectives.  The project would seek to maintain the gains made
in basic education through the first four IDA projects and to prepare for
future development.  It would finance transitional measures to support
long-term improvements in the access to, and quality and efficiency of, basic
education with emphasis on the first four years of schooling, and on the rural
and poorest schools.  Specifically, the project would seek to: (a) prepare
recommendations for sustainable soector nolicies and investment protram
development which would be implemented in the future; (b) consolidate benefits
of prior investments in aualitv improvement in the public and private sectors;
and (c) improve the resource manatement capacity of MENJS and FOHEP.
8.    Proiect Description.  The project would serve both the public and
private sectors and would include three components: (a) sector Policv and
investment program develooment (US$0.69 including contingencies) through well
targeted diagnostic studies and corresponding follow-up measures to improve
primary-level curricular and instructional delivery, sector financing,
institutional setup, and primary school construction and maintenance; needs
assessment would be initiated through a Living Standards Measurement Survey
(LSMS) under the responsibility of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, to be
used in education and other social sectors; (b) primary-education qaglity
imorovement (US$10.87 including contingencies) byt (i) training 42 private-
sector pedagogical advisors who would render technical support at the school
level and providing 42 motorcycles to these advisors; (ii) training 42 public-
sector pedagogical advisors and providing travel allowances to 80 public-
sector pedagogical advisors until September 19931 (iiI) providing inservice
training to approximately 6,400 public and private teachers, 700 private
school principals, 20 public trainers of trainers, 28 regional directors and
specialists who would provide instructional support during and after the life
of the project; (iv) providing textbooks and teachers' manuals in the basic
subjects in grade 2-4 for a total of about 70,000 low Income students in
schools with limited resources; (v) developing end-of-cycle (4th grade)
achievement tests, and administering them to 500 schools in 1992 and 2500
schools starting in 1993; (vi) reconstructing or rehabilitating a total of
about 48 public and private dilapidated schools with limited resourcest (vii)
providing furniture, equipment, and instructional materials to the
rehabilitated or reconstructed schools and to 70 other priority schoolst and
(viii) continuing and expanding a technical support program including
teachers' salary supplements, in private schools which agree to comply with
101BP performance criteria and to be monitored; (c) resource manasement
(US$2.95 including contingencies) includings (i) technical assistance to MENJS
for updating management, budgeting, and monitoring personnel systems;
(ii) equipment and technical assistance for rationalizing the administrative
and accounting procedures of MENJS1, FOBHP, and participating schools; and
(III) partially financing the project administration for both public and
private sector participants. The project would be implemented through a
project implementation unit (PIU) in MtNJS as well as through 1OHEP and the
Ministry of Finance.   The total cost of the project is US$14.51 million
equivalent. A cost breakdown and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.



Amounts and methods of procurement as well as the di6bursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. The implementation and disburemuent schedule, spanning
over four years have been appraised conservatively and correspond to the
timing of the proposed short transitional project. The timetable of key
events of project pro'essing is summarized in Schedule C. The status of IDA
operations in Haiti is shown in Schedule D. A map is attached. The Staff
Appraisal report No. 9418-HA, dated May 16, is also attached.
9.    Agreed actions.  Durina neaotiations. it was agreed that:  (a) NENJS
would maintain during project implementation a PIU executive director,
controller, and a procurement/disbursement specialist with qualifications and
experience satisfactory to IDA; (b) FONHEP would maintain, during project
implementation, its present staffing structure unless otherwise agreed with
IDA, as well as a technical staff and a controller, who would be counterparts
of the PIU's staff, with qualifications and experience satisfactory to IDA;
(c) a Coordinating Committee would be maintained throughout the project
implementation period, and its composition would remain as agreed; (d) the
Government would follow the plan for executing the diagnostic studies and for
submiting the resulting recommendations and program to IDA as agreed, sad the
Coordinating Committee would be maintained throughout the project life; (e)
HENJS would send to IDA no later than December 31, 1991, the action plan to
eliminate redundancies in its payroll which will spell out the mechanism for
eliminating such redundancies and for reducing the ratio of salaries/other
operating expenses in a way satisfactory to the Association, by June 1992;
MENJS would execute the agreed plan as scheduleds and the ratio of
salaries/other operating expenses agreed to be reached in June 1992 would be
held constant thereafter; (f) each year during the execution of the project,
and no later than three months prior to the beginning of the next fiscal year,
HENJS would submit to IDA for review and comments the public sector education
budget, and conduct with IDA an annual project progress review with respect to
project execution; (g) the Government would maintain the allocation for
recurrent costs in MENJS's budget in real terms at no less than the FY91 level
of Gourdes 3,900,000; (h) the Government and FORMHP would provide the
counterpart staff members and facilities to administer an end-of-cycle test;
(i) FONHEP and MENJS would agree by June 1993 on effective community-based
methods to conserve and reuse IDA-financed textbooks; (j) the Government would
assume the travel costs of the 80 public-sector pedagogical advisors starting
in October 1993; (k) MENJS and FoNHIP would apply the agreed eligility
criteria for the training pedagogical advisors, the rehabilitation and
reconstruction of schools and the support to private schools; and (1) FO8E0P
and the PIU would send quarterly reports to IDA about their project-related
activities. A condition for Board presentation would be that the Minister of
Education, Youth, and Sports would sign a Policy Letter spelling out policy
objectives and a program of action to improve the education sector.
Conditions of effectiveness would be that: (a) the Coordinating Committee
would be established under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDAt (b) a
Subsidiary Agreement satisfactory to IDA would be signed by the Government and
POEEP; and (c) the Government/FONHEP would open and maintain two project
accounts for the PIU and FONHEP in Gourdes with an initial deposit of US$0.23
million equivalent in each to be made by the Government.
10. Benefits. The project's main benefits would be the consolidation of the
gains of the previous education projects with respect to the 1982 education
roform, quality improvement, and the encouragement to the private sector to



participate in on Integrated sector development effort. The pros ct would
also prepare and carry out the preliminary measO%res noeded to support future
landing with far-reaching modernization and efficiency objectives. The
leading role of POQEIP and the participation of IGOs which operate private
schools would contribute to Improve donor coordination and to alleviate sOme
aspects of poverty. A large numbor of private- and public-sector personnel
vould bo trained or retrained, Including 42 educational advisors and 6,400
teachers.  Also, 70,000 low-income studonts would gain access to textbooks.
Female students would benefit from increased access to education. Attention
to *oil erosion in schools would prevent environmental dam&g-.
11. 31gkg. The project faces major risks. They are associated with the
possibility of continued financial distress, economic instability, and an
uncertain sociopolitical envirorment. Political events in recent years have
eroded the sector's implementation capacity: little progress has been achieved
through the four education projects in the development of the institutional
capacity of the MBNJS. These risks have been minimized in four ways: (a) the
transitional character of the project, its small size and short time-frame
would facilitate project executions (b) the participation and strengthening of
the private sector would help ensure continuity and timely project execution;
(c) the replacement of the existing project implementation unit staff with
fewer and better-qualified employees would facilitate the management and
coordination of the project; and (d) the maintenance of the Coordinating
Committee would ensure that the project receives adequate support from the
relevant partners in the sector and from the donor community.
12.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Esecutive Directors approve the proposed credit.
