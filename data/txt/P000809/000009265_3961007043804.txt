MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on The Gambia
Second Highway Maintenance Project (Credit 1682-GM)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on The Gambia - Second Highway
Maintenance Project (Credit 1682-GM)', prepared by the Africa Regional Office. The Borrower did
not contribute Part II of the Report.
The project objective was to give support to road upgrading and maintenance. The
project entailed a road rehabilitation and maintenance program and institutional development of the
Ministry of Works and Communications (MWC). The institutional program included strengthening
MWC's organization and management and MWC staff training. The project was carefully prepared,
with proper attention given to past lending experience.
Implementation faced serious problems, many related to weak government
commitment. At the height of implementation difficulties, the Bank suspended credit disbursement
for several months. Implementation took three years more than planned. Most categories of physical
works suffered large shortfalls due to substantial increases in unit costs, low productivity and
inadequate maintenance follow-up.
In institution building, little progress was made. MWC is hardly in a better condition
than at the outset of project implementation. Therefore, the main objective of the project was not
achieved. Among the unresolved issues is the selection, training and retention of a cadre of qualified
Gambians. MWC cannot function presently without massive external technical and financial support.
Accordingly, the project outcome is rated as unsatisfactory, the institutional
development as negligible and sustainability as unlikely.
The PCR is of good quality. No performance audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA
SECOND HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE PROJECT
CREDIT 1682-GM
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Highway Maintenance Project
for which Credit 1682-GM in the amount of SDR 5.3 million or US$5.8 million was approved on
April 15, 1986. The Credit was closed on March 31, 1992, and the last disbursement was made on
November 20, 1992. The remaining funds of US$26,312.35 in the credit account were cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of the Sahelian Department,
Africa Region.
Preparation of the PCR was based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreement,
supervision reports, the correspondence files and interviews with IDA staff and the Consultants. The
Borrower has been asked to provide Part II of the PCR but did not provide it.
Co-donors included the African Development Fund, the Commission of the European
Economic Community, the United Nations Sudano-Sahelian Office, and the United Nations
Development Program.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION STUMMARY
Objectives
The main objective of the Project was to support the Ministry of Works and
Communications (MWC) in carrying out a four and one-half year (1986 to mid-1990) road
maintenance and upgrading program. This program comprised the continuation and expansion of the
road maintenance program initiated under the first Highway Maintenance Project, and other works
(para. 6).
Implementation Experience
Project execution got off to a prompt start because it was a follow-up to the first Highway
Maintenance Project. However, execution of maintenance works was extremely slow right from the
start and for more than two years because of poor equipment availability and equipment diversions.
Moreover, MWC reorganization was not successful because of staff shortages.
The execution got off to a fresh start after IDA suspended disbursements and conditions for
resumption were met; maintenance works execution thereafter was fair to good until project closing,
but staff shortages continued to hamper institutional building, and the MWC Tender Board created
to streamline procurement was never operational. Production incentives for workers succeeded to
boost production to a certain extent, but created distortions in works planning and reporting, and
were difficult to manage.
Results
About 65% of the highway maintenance works were executed, but over a longer than planned
time period, the bulk being executed during 89-91. The rehabilitation works, were realized although
with large delays; the AfDF component, part of a substantially larger AfDf project, did not get
underway until the IDA component was near completion, thus the Project is not scheduled to be fully
completed until mid- 1994 (para. 22).
Little progress was made on institution-building mainly because of the failure of the Government
to attract and put into place capable local personnel to be trained by management consultants (para.
22).



- .11 -
The internal rate of return for the road maintenance activities is estimated at 23%, substantially lower
than the 38% calculated during Project appraisal.
Sustainability
Overall, the Project did not succeed in strengthening MWC sufficiently for it to be capable
of sustained and competent road network management(para. 30).
Findings and Lessons Learned
If IDA should consider a future road maintenance project in The Gambia, stringent conditions
should be imposed on the Borrower. These would include: i) the establishment of a competent and
operational tender board as a condition of Board presentation (para 24); this issue is already being
tackled under the Public Works and Capacity Building Project which financed studies of the
operations of the MF&T Major Tender Board, and the forthcoming Economic Management Project
which will incorporate the conclusions of the aforementioned study; ii) the contracting out of most
of MWC's periodic road maintenance works (para 23); iii) heavier emphasis on institution building
with prompt suspension of disbursements if progress on that component is not satisfactory, or if
project resources are misused (para 23); iv) the appointment of sufficient full time staff to MWC who
will not be used on work outside MWC (para 41); and v) a carefully designed and monitored
institution building program that will encourage the transfer of skills from consultants to local staff.
(paras 43 and 44). IDA should be prepared to supervise any new project at least three or more times
a year during its execution.

B.    Project Background
1.    The Second Highway Maintenance Project (SHMP) was a follow-up to the first Highway
Maintenance Project (FHMP, Cr. 897-GM of April 1979; see Part III, Table A). IDA's strategy in
the highway sector had focused on developing the country's road maintenance capability, to insure
that the traditional priority given to construction and expansion of the paved road network was
replaced by a strong emphasis on maintenance and improving the country's deteriorating road
infrastructure.
2.    The first Highway Maintenance Project was implemented by the Ministry of Works and
Communications (MWC) through its Public Works Department (PWD). Up to about 1984, the
MWC was assisted by a few line managers provided by the Overseas Development Authority (ODA).
Following their departure, PWD was managed by Gambian engineers, some of whom had returned
after training abroad. In 1984, the quality of PWD management was considered satisfactory, but
senior management was overextended.'
3.    According to the Project Performance Audit Report for the FHMP dated July 22, 1987, the
project had achieved its objective of improving the quality of maintenance for the greater part of the
PWD network. PWD institution building and staff training had also advanced but was more difficult
to measure. Road maintenance had bogged down because of the problems of force account
equipment maintenance, although the United States Agency for Development (USAID) had
completed in 1986 a new PWD workshop. In addition, the workshops operated by the Mechanical
Engineering Division (MED) of the PWD provided services to other Government departments
besides MWC. Initially, MED had not been authorized to charge fully for its services to various
Government departments. A realistic charging system for mechanical services was worked out only
during preparation of the SHMP by the MWC and the USAID workshop consultants.2

4.    IDA considered its support of the SHMP as crucial for consolidating the initiatives outlined
above, and for assisting Government in building up sustainable road and equipment maintenance
management systems. Furthermore, IDA considered that its support under the SHMP would intensify
the ongoing policy dialogue on road maintenance financing and investment planning for the transport
sector.3
C.    Project Objectives and Description
Project Objectives
5.    The main objective of the Project was to support MWC in carrying out a four-and-one-half-
year (1986 to mid-1990) road maintenance and upgrading program comprising: (i) continuation and
expansion of the road maintenance program initiated under the first Project; (ii) rehabilitation of
priority sections of the paved network; (iii) strengthening of the organization and management of
MWC to improve the efficiency of road and equipment maintenance; (iv) introduction of sound
transport planning procedures; and (v) assistance to domestic contractors to enable their more
effective participation in road maintenance activities.
Project Description
6.    To attain these objectives, the Project provided fnancial assistance for the following
components:
(a)   Road Maintenance Program:
i)    regravelling, resealing and routine maintenance of the national and local road
networks;
i)    experimental low-cost paving of gravel road sections;
iii)   equipment and vehicles, including initial stocks of spare parts; and
iv)   road maintenance and workshop management assistance.
(b)   Road and Bridee Rehabilitation:
i)    reconstruction of the Bund Road (3.5 km), the main access road to the Banjul Port,
and strengthening of deformed sections along 150 km of the South Bank Road; and
ii)   reconstruction of the Brumen Bridge on the South Bank Road.
(c)   Institutional Strengthening:
i)    technical assistance to MWC for implementing its reorganization, for transport
planning and studies, and for auditing;
ii)   training program for MWC staff; and
iii)   technical assistance and training for domestic contractors.
Para. 6.4 of the Initiating Project Brief



D.   Project Design and Organization
7.    The First Highway Maintenance Project had concentrated on improving maintenance of about
780 km of primary and secondary roads. The SHMP was designed i) to continue the works initiated
under the First Project; ii) to extend maintenance to a network of 1300 km of roads comprising the
primary and secondary road networks and local paved roads and gravel roads of national importance;
and iii) to continue institutional strengthening. To alleviate import funding problems that had
hampered implementation of the FHMP, the SHMP provided for a Special Account and a Project
Account. 4
8.    The Project was identified by IDA staff during the supervision of the FHMP; the Initial
Project Brief was dated April 18, 1984. During Project preparation, a troublesome issue was the
proposal of the Government to invest in a number of low priority roads, in particular the uneconomic
construction to paved standards of the Laminkoto-Passimus Road (150 km). IDA worked closely with
potential donors and Government to reduce the standards and thus the cost of the road, or to
persuade them to drop it altogether, in favor of a gravel road, in the light of The Gambia's severe
public financing constraints.5 The road was redesigned with financing under a Project Preparation
Facility (PPF), but it was finally dropped from the Project during negotiations.
9.    The Project was prepared by the consultants for the FHMP who delivered their final reports
in December 1984. Their study indicated a total Project cost of about US$16.3 million, which was
quite close to the Project's final appraised cost.
10.   The Project was appraised in January 1985. A detailed Aide Memoire signed by the
Government and IDA dated February 2, 1985 summarized the agreements reached and outlined the
appraisal mission's recommendations regarding Project conditionality. A key recommendation was
that the MWC be reorganized before Project start-up to enable more efficient and cost effective
management of the road network. ' The mission prepared TOR for a management study, and
recommended that the restructuring of the MWC be a condition of effectiveness. A separate
appraisal of a training component was carried out by IDA in March, 1985. '
11.   The draft Issues Paper of March 1, 1985 was fully based on the Aide Memoire. It
recommended a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance to cover the organization study, and
detailed engineering of certain road works to expedite Project preparation. According to the
combined Issues Paper/Decision Memorandum dated April 18th, the scope of some of the Project
components was reduced, and the revised total cost of the Project was estimated at US $17.0 million
to cover a four-year time slice. External financing was estimated at US$14.5 million or 92% of total

cost, a high proportion because of the difficult economic situation in The Gambia. This left a
financing gap of US$9 million after the IDA credit amount was increased 10% to US $5.8 million.
12.   The Decision Meeting agreed with the mission that the auditing backlog of the First Project
would have to be cleared before the Government was invited to negotiations. The Decision Meeting
noted that the African Development Bank had just cancelled its loan for constructing and paving the
Laminkoto-Passimus Road, but that other donors might be interested in it. IDA promptly asked the
Government not to proceed with the Road and to reduce the Feeder Road Program s to 80 km of
feeder roads to be constructed in the Laminkoto area. Finally, the Decision Meeting called for annual
reviews, starting at negotiations, on the level and specific content of investments in the transport
sector as a requirement in the Credit Agreement. This was an innovative feature at the time which
gave IDA considerable leverage over future road budgets. A PPF advance of US$200,000 was agreed
on to prefinance the organization study of the MWC, and detailed engineering.
13.   Although the Government was very slow in preparing TOR and contacting prospective
consultants to be financed by the PPF, 9 the PPF was raised to US$550,000 in December 1985,
mainly to bridge the costs of the Project consultants from the First Highway Maintenance Project to
the Second Project because of the repeated postponement of negotiations.
14.   The Credit was negotiated in Banjul in February 1986 with only minor revisions to the draft
agreement. At negotiations, the estimated appraisal cost was US$16.4 million of which about 83%
was foreign exchange. IDA raised its proposed contribution from US$5.6 million to US $5.8 million,
the African Development Fund (ADF) was to provide US$4.5 million, the EEC US$2 million and
two UN agencies US$1.3 million in total.
15.   Credit Effectiveness.  The originally agreed effective date of August 19, 1986 had to be
postponed because of slow Govemment action in enacting the new MWC organization, the
publication in the Gazette of the list of charges to be paid by Govemment departments for service
provided by MED's workshops, and the allocation in the budget for fiscal year 1986/87 of amounts
satisfactory to IDA to enable these departments to pay for MED's services. The Project timetable
is given in Part III, Table B.
E.    Project Implementation
16.   Project execution got off to a prompt start because of the extensive preparatory work done
before negotiations, and because the contract of the technical assistance retained under the FHMP
was extended to cover the Second Project. Thus, by the time of the first supervision mission in June
1986, within a month of credit signing, PPF-financed studies and technical assistance were on
schedule, preliminary engineering studies had been completed and the detailed engineering of the
bridge and road rehabilitation component to be financed by AfDF were underway. (AfDF was
expected to appraise its component in early 1987, but actually did so only two years later).

17.   In addition, the Project documents for the UNSO component which financed the feeder roads
routine maintenance program, for the UNDP component which financed technical assistance to
MWC management and training, and for transport planning were to be signed in August 1986 with
IDA as executing agent. At IDA's request, USAID had extended its original technical assistance
program to MED's Central Workshop at Kotu. The labor-based maintenance component supervised
by the International Labour Organization (ILO) had started in January 1986. Arrangements had
been made for the procurement of the IDA-financed maintenance equipment through a procurement
agency.
18.   Despite these efforts, performances steadily deteriorated over the next year until all but one
of the four performance ratings fell to 4. Although approved in September 1986 by the cabinet as
part of MWC's reorganization, agreed streamlining of procurement procedures had not been acted
on by the Ministry of Finance and Trade (MF&T); also, road maintenance equipment had been
diverted to non-maintenance tasks. Thus progress of the periodic maintenance component was
negligible. Staff shortages meant that key positions in MWC remained unfilled and high level staff
were overburdened with non-project related matters as well. Consequently, the handover of
management responsibilities by consultants to local staff could not be completed by mid-1988, as
planned. ' These mounting shortcoming finally led to a recommendation to suspend the Credit. "
IDA sent a strongly worded letter to the Government dated June 21, 1988 requesting Government
to propose remedial action. This letter was followed up by a supervision mission in July 1988 which
included the divisional manager, to review the situation. The Borrower was informed that IDA would
continue to finance the Project and the technical assistance only if the following measures were
implemented by mid-September 1988:
a)    All equipment bought under the Second Highway Maintenance Project would
be used solely for the implementation of the agreed program of works. All
equipment should therefore be thoroughly serviced at the Kotu workshop and
ready and available for works by mid-September;
b)    All stores and other consumables bought with IDA funds for the Second
Highway Maintenance Project but used on other projects would be replaced
in-kind or the Second Highway Maintenance Project account credited with the
cost of such stores and consumables. For this, a materials audit would be
carried out immediately;
c)    All counterparts to the team members of the technical assistance team would
be identified and put in post for on-the-job training. Of particular importance
were the appointments of a counterpart accountant and a head for the
Transport Planning Unit of the MWC;
d)    A management study for the future operation of the Kotu workshop would
be concluded; and

- 6 -
e)    A new, monitorable, program of works would be prepared and submitted
immediately to IDA.
The Government gave assurances that the above measures would be correctly implemented, and as
a start, the Minister of Works and Communications undertook to issue a statement to all
Government ministries and departments to the effect that no further requests for the use of highway
maintenance equipment would be entertained. 12
19.   IDA suspended disbursements of the Credit in November 1988. " Following a supervision
mission in February 1989 which reported that it found considerable progress had been made in all
aspects of the SHMP, disbursements were resumed in March 1989. Although the mission noted that
"Project overall rating might be revised to "2" if progress continued, it also noted that "this Project
will require close supervision to stay on track". 14
20.   Unfortunately, progress was short-lived and the next supervision visit which did not take place
until November 1989, reported that it was "disappointed with the relative slowdown in progress." The
overall performance rating remained at "3". The mission noted that "the progress in appointing staff
had been extremely slow. The lack of professional staff in key positions in MWC has been
recognized as the single most important constraint impeding the attainment of the Project's
objectives". 1
21.   The last supervision mission in July/August 1991 found little change over the two previous
missions in 1990/91 and the overall rating of the Project remained unchanged at "3". MWC support
and commitment to the SHMP was lacking in key areas such as procurement, availability of cash, and
communications with other key departments and ministries. Nevertheless, the mission recommended
that since the Credit would close on March 31, 1992 and the IDA Credit was fully committed, the
physical works should be completed, despite the poor institutional performance. 16
F.    Project Results
22.   The following is a brief resume of the status of execution of each Project component as
defined in para. 6:

A program of regravelling, resealing, and routine maintenance was carried out on the
national network but not to the extent envisioned by the SAR and incorporated in
Schedule 2 of the Credit Agreement (c.f. Part III, tables F(i) to F(iv)). The pilot
labor based routine maintenance program was carried out but did not cover the paved
roads because of the shortage of bitumen. After some progress, the program was
eventually cancelled by the MWC The experimental low cost paving of five km of
gravel road section was not done.
Equipment and spare parts were procured but generally later than scheduled in the
work program. One successful piece of work was the regravelling of the Essau-
Ndugu-Kebbe road (27 km) which was carried out in four months by a Senegalese
contractor. This demonstrated to the MWC the advantages, including time and cost
savings, of executing periodic maintenance works by contract rather than by
departmental forces.
(b)   Road and Bridge Rehabilitation
This component was financed by AfDF. It was not appraised until August 1989
because of the long delays in awarding contracts for the design and preparation of
bidding documents. The AfDF credit for US$20 million was signed on December 4,
1989. This credit covered a substantially larger component than envisioned at the time
of the IDA appraisal when US$4.5 million was included in IDA's financing plan: it
notably included technical assistance for 150 man-months and the rehabilitation of
Banjul city streets. The contractor mobilized in January 1992 and is expected to
complete the works in mid-1994.
(c)   Institutional Strengthening
The last supervision report (August 22, 1991) noted that the organization consultant
had "prepared a detailed Manpower Development Plan and a thorough
comprehensive study for the reorganization of MWC, which was approved by
Government in 1987. Up to now, the reorganization of MWC, although approved by
Government, was never implemented. The lack of professionals in key positions is,
in large part, due to a lack on the part of organization and commitment of the
Ministry, and makes it unattractive to young professionals. Following the unsuccessful
attempt to recruit Gambians, the Government is recruiting non-Gambians from
neighboring countries. Applicants although competent, have been rejected by the
Ministry, which now insists on hiring Gambians." After detailing a number of
shortcomings, this report concludes that despite the efforts of the management
consultants, the institutional performance was poor and no lasting benefits to MWC
were achieved.--The main reason for this persistent failure to attract and retain
competent Gambian staff are local civil service salary scales, and while the Project was
successful in obtaining UNDP financing to pay to repatriate Gambian professionals
and finance their contracts, there remained shortages even at lower levels, and this
was altogether too late in the project life to have a determinant effect.
23.   To sum up: the execution of the physical targets and, to an even greater degree of the
institutional building objectives fell short of those expected when the Project was designed. The



failure to achieve any meaningful progress in strengthening the MWC, leaves that organization back
where it was when the Project was first prepared. One benefit of the Project is that it demonstrated
to the MWC the advantages of contracting out periodic maintenance works, rather than relying on
force account operations. Contracting would be a better alternative to work by departmental forces,
given MWC's problems in procurement of equipment and supplies, and inability to maintain its
equipment and obtain reasonable output from its works organization. Any future road project should
emphasize institution building even more strongly than the SHMP did, and disbursements for civil
works should be tied strictly to performance on institution building. IDA should be prepared to
suspend credit disbursements at the first sign of non-performance on the institutional component, and
leave it suspended until performance improves.
Procurement
24.   While maintenance equipment, supplies and spare parts were eventually obtained, and
contracts with consultants and contractors were eventually signed, the failure of the Government to
set up an operational MWC tender board unnecessarily delayed the Project, ran up costs, and
prevented the attainment of the Project's institutional objectives.
Disbursements
25.   Because of the slow start-up of Project execution, and the very large accumulation of
unclaimed payments in the Treasury 'below the line' account used to pre-finance expenditures,
disbursements fell behind the estimated disbursement schedule. However, once this was resolved in
early 1991, disbursements gradually caught up to the schedule. The last disbursement was made on
November 20, 1992. The US$26,312.35 remaining in the credit account was cancelled. Credit data
is given in Part III, Tables C(i) and (ii).
Credit Allocations
26.   Appraisal and actual credit allocations are also in Part III, Table C(ii). They show that only
minor changes were made in allocations over the life of the Project.
Proiect Costs
27.   Final project costs and financing are presented in Part III, Tables D and E. Total project
expenditures are about as appraised even though unit costs of road maintenance are estimated to
have been about 75% greater than appraised (para. 28); therefore, only about 65% of the force
account road maintenance program was executed, at a total cost slightly higher than the appraised
cost. UNSO could not finance feeder road maintenance but this was done within the core program
with IDA and GLF cofinancing. EEC did not finance workshop maintenance assistance but this was
taken care of in mostly by an extension of the technical assistance financed by USAID following the
workshop construction. ADB financing, indicated in Table D, for the road and bridge rehabilitation
component was part of a larger financing which also included the reconstruction of streets in Banjul,
and technical assistance. IDA's financing, measured in USS was 23% larger than appraised because
of the fluctuation of the US$ against the SDR. Gambia cofinancing was larger than planned, even
though the salaries that were financed were lower, mainly because very little was done in the first two



- 9 -
years when the GLF share of financing was 0% and 20% respectively, and the bulk of the work was
done while the share was 40%, so that the overall share of contracts and supplies financed with GLF
came to 37%.
28.   The breakdown of total road maintenance expenditures into costs of periodic and routine
maintenance of paved and gravel roads presented in Table D results from the computation of the
standard cost of the road maintenance activities that have been reported in the progress reports and
monitoring visits report and the apportionment of remaining expenditures proportionally to the
volume of works measured under each category. On that basis, 57% of the paved roads periodic
maintenance program was completed, 37% of the gravel roads periodic maintenance, 124% of the
paved roads routine maintenance and only 26% of the gravel roads routine maintenance. Sixty
percent of the expenditures had to be apportioned, representing overhead costs, inflation (only about
15%), works not recorded, and productivity shortfall. It is estimated that unit costs of road
maintenance activities were about 75% greater (representing mainly the productivity shortfall) than
planned.
Economic Performance
29.   Economic performance has been evaluated by reviewing the appraisal report economic
evaluation and factoring in the variations that have occurred during project execution. Actual traffic
recorded throughout the project period was used to evaluate the benefits of the periodic maintenance
programs. Benefits for the routine maintenance component were calculated as a factor of the
contracts and supplies component of the standard maintenance costs, on the basis of the appraisal
economic evaluation results. Consultant and equipment purchase costs were apportioned as in the
appraisal economic analysis. The cost and benefit flows are shown in Table F(v). The internal rate
of return for the road maintenance activities is estimated at 23%. It is substantially lower than the
38% calculated during appraisal but remains to an acceptable level because of the higher return on
the paved roads maintenance. The internal rate of return for the gravel road maintenance (12%
instead of appraised 28%) suffered mainly from the higher unit costs, the late start of activities which
had for effect to front load the consultants costs, the very low level of activities on routine
maintenance, and the low productivity of the regravelling unit carrying out the periodic maintenance,
but was helped by the return on the regravelling of a 27 km section of the Essau-Kerewan road by
contract which had a 20% return. The internal rate of return of the paved roads maintenance
estimated at 32%, down from 70% at appraisal, was mainly affected by higher unit costs. Because of
the sudden disintegration of sections of the South Bank road in 1987, which was finally rehabilitated
on the AfDF credit in 93/94, far larger than planned quantities of road patching were required.
Those activities have a good economic return but represent a far lower than optimum utilization of
funds; ideally resealing should have been carried out long before 1987, or failing that, rehabilitation
should have been carried out earlier than 93/94.
G.    Project Sustainability
30.   Some field staff were trained under the Project and gained experience in routine and periodic
road maintenance. The incentive scheme was useful in encouraging output but finally had to be
dropped because of constraints beyond the control of field workers. Little or no progress was made
in strengthening the MWC, a key objective of the Project. Thus on an overall basis, the Project
cannot be regarded as sustainable as it did not leave a cadre of trained staff to carry on MWC
operations.



- 10-
H.    IDA's Performance
31.   IDA staff thoroughly prepared and appraised the Project, and took into account the lessons
learned during the implementation of the FHMProject. IDA's carefully selected conditionalities for
negotiations, board presentation and effectiveness are credited with putting much needed pressure
on the Government to take the essential steps needed before Project execution could get underway.
While fulfilling these conditionalities took time and delayed Project processing somewhat, they set
the stage for smooth Project execution if the Borrower had followed the implementation plan. It was
no fault of IDA's preparatory efforts that little or no progress was made on institution building.
32.   Project supervision was also good but the frequency of the supervision missions became
relatively low towards the end of the Project. The staff left detailed records of their findings in Aide
Memoires before departure, and the supervision reports covered their findings in considerable detail.
When it became evident that progress was not picking up despite strenuous efforts on the part of
staff to identify the problems, Divisional management followed up with a meeting in The Gambia in
which problems were highlighted and specific action called for. IDA's senior management fully
backed suspension of disbursements when that step became necessary. It was unfortunate that the
improvement in performance was only brief, due to a lack of interest and commitment to the Project
on the part of the Borrower. Even threats by IDA to hold up the preparation of the SAL II project
seem to have had little effect on the Government's performance. Use of IDA resources is given in
Part III, Tables G(i) and (ii).
33.   The main criticism of supervision is the failure of IDA to maintain pressure on the
Government by more frequent supervision visits during the latter part of the Project. A programmed
mid-1989 visit was postponed, only one visit was made in 1990, two in 1991, and none since. Thus
from 1990 to the end of the Project, IDA seemed to ignore the recommendation of its February 1989
supervision mission which called for "close supervision" of the Project. More intensive supervision
might have succeeded, although given the indifference of the Borrower to IDA's repeated calls for
improvement in performance there is no certainty that it would have been effective.
34.   The unsatisfactory progress in institution building is all the more disappointing because of the
substantial efforts of the training advisor who appraised that component and frequently supervised
it throughout its execution. IDA's training effort on the Project probably represented more staff time
than is normally put into most IDA projects. It is difficult not to conclude that the Borrower, by its
indifference and lack of cooperation, missed an excellent opportunity to build up an effective works
organization.
35.   It is not clear why the AfDF component of the Project was so slow in getting underway (para.
22), although delays in completing the design work was a contributing factor. The outcome was that
the AfDF component was just getting underway when the IDA financed component was reaching
completion. Furthermore, the AfDF loan was for a much larger component than originally planned.
The supervision reports rarely mention the AfDF component. It would appear that there was little
coordination between IDA and AfDF on this Project. However, Tripartite reviews were held among
the Borrower, IDA and the UN Agencies.
36.   IDA staff were cooperative and flexible in their dealings with the Borrower, and approved
changes requested by the Borrower to facilitate procurement, to standardize equipment and to review
and comment on documents that were not always well prepared. IDA helped set up an incentive



- 11 -
system for the staff of MWC, but even though its design was straigthforward, based on the execution
of physical works programs, it tended to distort work planning and reporting,and its application
proved exceedingly difficult to manage. It eventually had to be abandoned.
I.    Borrower's Performance
37.   The Borrower's inaction in meeting the conditions of effectiveness (para 15), seems to prevail
through most of the implementation period. Despite the visit of the Division Chief in mid 1988 in
which the measures which needed to be taken were spelled out at a meeting with the Borrower in
minutes signed by both parties (para 18) and a follow-up letter dated November 2, 1988 from senior
management in which disbursements were suspended until the Borrower had taken steps to carry out
nine specified actions, no lasting improvement took place. Following a temporary improvement in
performance (para 19), the Government's interest and commitment to the Project again fell off. The
Government's compliance with credit covenants is shown in Part III, Table H.
38.   Soon after Project start-up, the Borrower began to use Project equipment, material and
supplies earmarked for specific maintenance work to carry out non-Project works. This practice
continued up to mid 1988 when as a result of IDA's intervention, the Government finally issued an
order to its agencies to cease this practice, to return the equipment to the Project and repay the
Project accounts for non-Project expenses. These steps were eventually taken.
39.   The Borrower repeatedly refused to sign Aide Memoires left by supervision missions because
they clearly spelled out poor implementation performance. However, the Borrower did not submit
any revisions of its own. Despite almost constant urging from IDA, the Borrower did not appoint
staff in key positions in the MWC nor provide counterpart staff to the consultants, thus a key
objective of the Project, to strengthen MWC management, was never met. Only towards the end of
the Project, the MWC acquired a few Gambian technical staff from outside the country.
40.   A further problem was the inaction on the part of the Government to streamline its
procurement procedures for works equipment, material and supplies, which was essential to
expediting the Project and meeting IDA procurement guidelines. IDA had pressed the Borrower
over two years to establish a Tender Board. Previously the MWC had to depend on a Government
Tender Board which met only infrequently and held up procurement decisions for months. The
results were long delays in signing contracts, procuring equipment, fuel and spare parts, and getting
works underway.
41.   Clearly the major problem for MWC staff has been the low salaries paid in The Gambia,
which encouraged them to take on outside work, and thus not devote their full time energies to their
jobs. Supervisors work only part time and were sometimes diverted to other tasks outside their
regular jobs by Government officials outside the MWC. Thus any attempt in the future to strengthen
the MWC must include provision for ensuring that staff will devote full time attention to their jobs.
J     Project Relationships
42.   Despite the many problems encountered in executing the Project it appears from the
correspondence that relations between IDA staff and the Borrower's representatives were good.

K     Consultant and Contractor Services
43.   As mentioned earlier (para. 9), the technical assistance under the F.HMP was continued under
the Second Highway Maintenance Project. While it would have been good experience for the MWC
to gradually assume some of the responsibilities delegated to the consultants such as programming,
executing and supervising works, it made no effort to do so. MWC seemed content to let the
consultants carry on indefinitely, without establishing any timetable for assuming their duties. This
explains why little in the way of transfer of skills took place between the consultants and the MWC.
44.   The management consultants' mandate under the Project was to transfer skills from the
consultant to local staff. To encourage this, the stay of the consultants staff in The Gambia was
purposely limited to an initial demonstration period for demonstrating how to carry out tasks, and
subsequent short term visits to check on the progress of local staff in performing their tasks. The
concept was to hand-over responsibility to local staff as quickly as possible. While the concept was
commendable, and a local training official was trained under the Project, the MWC failed to take
advantage of the opportunity by providing sufficient local staff to be trained. The problems
encountered by the consultants who specialized in management, and who were young, energetic and
creative, and trained in facilitating rather then performing, were used as a case study prepared by
EDI. While the management scheme was innovative and well conceived, it could not succeed in The
Gambia at the time because of the poor response from MWC.
45.   Regravelling works carried out by a contractor on the North Bank Road were satisfactory,
and clearly proved the advantages of contracting out periodic maintenance (para. 23).
L     Project Documentation and Data
46.   The Project documents provided a sound basis for the design and execution of the Project.
The Aide Memoires left with the Government by the supervision missions, and the supervision
reports and letters provided a detailed record of the problems encountered in the execution of the
Project, and an explicit guide to the Government of action needed to achieve better performance,
if it had wished to do so. The correspondence files contain about eight misfiled documents related
to other projects.
