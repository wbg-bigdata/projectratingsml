INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXCUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO FIJI
FOR A TELECOM(NICATIONS PROJECT
1.     I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Fiji for the equivalent of US$2.2 million to help finance a
telecommunications project.   The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including five years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.     A report entitled "The Economic Prospects of Fiji" (No EAP-18a,
dated October 6, 1970) was circulated to the Executive Directors on
November 3, 1970.   The next economic mission to Fiji is scheduled for
1973.   More recent information has been obtained from a 1971 11F mission
report and through statistics sent by the Fiji Government.  Basic country
data are given in Annex II.
3.     Fiji became independent on October 10, 1970 after nearly 100 years
as a British colony and is now an independent member of the British
Commonwealth.   It is composed of a group of over 800 islands in the
South Pacific with a total land area of some 7,000 square miles.  It has
a population of slightly over 500,000 of which about 90 percent live on
the two main islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.  The gradual transfer of
political power was accompanied by a program of local recruitment at all
levels of government which has helped to ensure competent leadership and
a well managed administrative system after independence.  In the first post-
independence election in April of this year, the Alliance Party,based
largely on the support of the Fijians (42 percent of the population) and
European and Chinese minorities (8 percent), retained political power.
Under the Constitution, the Indian community, which forms 50 percent of
the total population, is somewhat under represented politically although
Indians have considerable economic power especially in trade and cammerce.
However, serious racial tensions have been avoided.
4.     Fiji's economy is more complex than its small size might suggest.
In addition to coconut production, it has developed an efficient
smallholder sugar industry established with indentured labor in the 19th
century.   There is also a wide range of other crops, a number of small
industries, some mineral development and a developed services sector



-2 _
within which tourism now has a leading role.   GDP grew at about 5 percent
annually in real terms during 1966-70.   Per capita GNP is about uS$400
and growing at an average annual rate of about 2.5 percent.   Major factors
in the steady economic growth have been the rapid expansion of investment,
the burgeoning tourist industry and the expansion of the sugar industry.
Foreign exchange earnings from tourism increased from US$8 million in
1965 to US$27 million in 1970 or about 25 percent per year, making it the
largest foreign exchange earner after the sugar industry whose earnings
amounted to US$37 million.
5.     The Government's fiscal performance is satisfactory.   Largely due
to increased collections of customs duties and income taxes, government
revenue rose from 19 percent to 23 percent of GDP during 1966-70.   Gross
investment has been increasing by about 12 percent a year and by 1970
represented about 29 percent of GDP.   Much of this investment is export
oriented since Fiji is highly dependent on foreign trade, exports and
imports representing about 46 percent and 50 percent of GNP, respectively.
With the expansion of investment and incomes, merchandise imports, rising
at 9 percent per year in the late 1960's, have grown faster. than exports,
which rose at 7 percent annually.   The growing trade deficit has been
financed by increased tourism receipts, private capital inflows and some
grant assistance from the U.K.   As a result, Fiji has been able to
maintain a strong foreign exchange position, with reserves five times
external debt outstanding at the end of 1971.
6.     The Government's strategy for economic development is outlined in
the Development Plan 1971-75. It calls for a growth rate of 6.7 percent
a year during 1971-75, with continued steady expansion in agriculture
a n d manufacturing   and    further strong growth in tourism.    The future
of sugar is somewhat uncertain due to the ending of the Commonwealth Sugar
Agreement in 1974 with new arrangements to be negotiated before then with
the enlarged European Economic Community.    Aggregate investment is
projected to grow at about 8 percent a year, but because of limited capacity,
particularly in the construction industry, the rate may prove to be somewhat
less.   According to the last economic mission, with the-somewhat slower
expansion in investment, the growth rate in the economy may be nearer 5
percent a year during the Plan period.   On these more conservative
assumptions the deficit on the goods and non-factor services account may
amount to some US$56 million over the period 1973-77.   Taking into account
other projected external obligations, such as debt service, Fiji's groes
capital requirements would total some US$150 million during this period.
Slightly over half of this would be met by private investments, and the
remaining US$70 million by external borrowing and grants.   Projected
disbursements from Bank loats would account for one-third of external
financing, and the rest would be met through assistance from the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) and the U.K. and other bilateral lenders.
7.     Fiji's external debt is very small.   The ratio of debt service to
export earnings is expected to rise from 1 percent in 1970 to about



-   3   -
5 percent in 1977.   Exports are unusually large in relation to GNP, and
this ratio means that by 1977 debt service will probably rise to about 10
percent of domestic savings.   This burden should be quite manageable given
FiJi's relatively high per capita income, demonstrated capacity for
economic growth and strong reserve position.   Fiji therefore remains
creditworthy for borrowing on Bank terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
8.     After attaining independence in October 1970, Fiji became a member
of the Bank in May 1971.   Fiji has until June 30, 1972 to complete
membership in IDA and is considering whether to join IFC.
9.     This loan would be the Bank's second loan to Fiji, bringing total
Bank lending to US$14 million.   The first loan of US$11.8 million was
made in June 1971 for the construction of 67 miles of the 130 mile
Suva-Nadi Road.   Some delays have been encountered because bids for
constructing the two road sections were substantially higher than the
cost estimates on which the loan amount was based.   After discussion with
the bidders, the Government has invited new bids on the basis of revised
plans and specifications;   it is expected that the new bids will be
received and evaluated by the end of June.   At the end of April 1972,
about US$0.7 million had been disbursed, leaving an undisbursed balance of
US$11.1 million.
10.     No other loans are expected to be presented to the Executive
Directors in the near future.   The Bank is executing agency for a
UNDP-financed tourism study which is expected to be completed by early
1973.   The study is expected to form the basis for Bank consideration
of a tourism project (probably related infrastructure), planned for FY 1974.
No IFC investment has been made in Fiji.
11.     The strategy of the Bank's lending program is to help bridge the
resource gap by financing the foreign exchange requirements of a small
number of relatively large public infrastructure projects in the transport,
telecommunications, tourism and power sectors.   This focus is due to the
fact that the steady growth of the Fijian economy in the late 1960's has
created a need for additional infrastructure and that the projects are of
sufficient size to justify Bank participation in their financing.   While
adequate required external assistance for other sectors is presently
available from alternative sources (such as ADB and bilateral aid), the
Bank will keep its lending program under review to determine where Bank
assistance can be most effective.   In any event this assistance will be
relatively modest in financial terms but should help to strengthen
institutions in a number of sectors.   A Bank economic mission scheduled
to visit Fiji in 1973 will not only review the general economic developments
but will also consider questions relating to income distribution, employment
and agricultural policies and priorities.

PART III -    THE PROJECT
11.     In February 1971 the Govexnment approached the Bank for financial
assistance for telecommunications.  A Bank reconnaissance mission visited
Fiji in April and identified this project which was appraised in November.
Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington in early May 1972.
The Government was represented by a team headed by Mr Mosese Qionibaravi,
Secretary for Finance.
12.     The project consists of the telecommunications expansion program
of the Department of Posts and Telecommunications (P & T) during the last
four years (1972-75) of the Government's Five-Year (1971-75) Development
Plan.   P & T, which comes under the Ministry of Communications, Works and
Tourism, is the government agency responsible for establishing and maintaining
the telecommunications network in Fiji.  The telecommunications branch of
P & T provides local telephone services in major cities together with radio
telephone and long distance services among the two main islands and about
40 outlying islands.  The total number of telephones in December 1970 was
about 17,000 or about 3.4 per 100 people, above the average for developing
countries.  Despite this there is a need for further expansion because
Fiji's large number of islands and rugged terrain make telecommunications
extremely important for the efficient conduct of government administration
and commerce.   The waiting list for telephone connections at present numbers
about 2,400 or about 25 percent of the direct exchange lines totalling about
10,000.,
13.     The project includest
(i)  expansion of the capacity of local exchange equipment by about
5,650 lines together with cable network and associated facilities;
(ii) expansion of radio telephone facilities in rural areas;
(iii) installation of new microwave long distance facilites among
major cities on the two main islands;
(iv) expansion of telex and telegraph services; and
(v) the introduction of a commercial accounting system for
P & T.
Details are in Annex III and in the appraisal report (PU 91a of May 16, 1972)
which is being distributed separately.
14.     The total cost of the project is estimated at US$5.7 million, of
which about US$4 million would be required in foreign exchange for



- 5.-
imported equipment and services.   Of this, P & T had at the time of
appraisal placed orders for some switching equipment from the suppliers
of existing equipment and for some microwave equipment through limited
international competitive bidding.   These items contracted for are being
financed from their own funds leaving the following items for Bank
financing:
Cost
(US$ million)
a) Automatic exchange equipment                  .5
b) Subscribers' network and associated
facilities        1.0
c) Microwave equipment                           .3
d)  Consultants' services                       .1
e)  Contingencies                                .3
Total        2.2
15.     All the equipment will be imported since none of it is manufactured
locally.   Fiji has a preferential tariff favoring other Commonwealth
countries.   However, since P & T is exempt from customs duties, these
arrangements will not affect procurement.   Subscribers' network and
associated facilities together with microwave equipment (Items b and e)
would be procured on the basis of international competitive bidHing.
Automatic exchange equipment (Item a) costing about US$500,000 will be
used to extend existing exchanges and must be compatible with the existing
system to penrit use of common equipment.   The automatic exchange equipment
financed under the loan would therefore be procured from the original
supplier provided the prices are in line with international prices.
16.     The allocation for consultants' services includes about
US$55,000 for the employment of an expert for two years to help establish
a commercial accounting system for P & T.   If, however, the Government
can obtain such an expert under bilateral aid, the amount allocated for this
consultant would be reallocated to contingencies.    Since the project is
part of P & T's continuing expansion program, any unused balance of the
loan would be used for the purchase of additional imported items of the
same type in agreement with the Bank.



-6-
17.     The present management of P & T's telecommunications   services
is adequate.   The staff include a substantial number of expatriates who
are gradually being replaced as qualified Fijians become
available.   P & T has a training program for skilled workers and operating
personnel which is satisfactory, but        its recruitment and training
of technicians and engineers need to be improved.   The Government has
agreed with the Bank that P & T will carry out a study to see how its
recruitment and training programs can be improved.   This study will be
completed in about a year and the results will be discussed with the Bank
to determine how its recommendations should be implemented.
18.     Consultants have been engaged to help prepare specifications and
bidding documents.   Installation of exchange equipment will be done by
contractors under P & T's supervision.   P & T will carry out the rest of
the works with its own staff.   The operations of P & T's telecommunications
branch are satisfactory, and its. organization is adequate.  With
improvements in its staff training arrangements as noted in paragraph 17,
P & T has the capacity to implement the project and operate the network.
The execution of the project will take about four and a half years and is
expected to be completed by mid-1976.
19.     As a government department, all P & T's revenues are deposited in
the consolidated revenue account and its current and capital expenses
are voted annually by Parliament.   As a result its accounting system
merely controls cash flows and therefore does not provide enough information
for management purposes.   The Government is aware of this deficiency and
in 1970 engaged a consultant from Australia to study the accounting system
of P & T and to recommend improvements. His .report recommended, a
commercial accounting system similar to that used in Australia for
telecomunmications.   The Government has agreed that during 1973 P & T
will engage an expert for about two years to set up a commercial, accounting
system on the basis of the consultant's report and to employ a qualified
accountant to head a new finance section to administer the system after. it
has been established.
20.     Under P & T's present accounting practices, its postal and
telecommunications operations are not separated, nor are plant cost records
maintained.   However, on a notional basis, the data available indicate
that P & T's telecommunications operations show a satisfactory financial
performance.   During the last four years P & T's rate of return on average
net fixed assets of its telecommunications branch ranged from 27 percent
in 1969 to 17 percent in 1971, the drop being mainly due to a large increase
in assets.   The Government has agreed with the Bank that P & T will maintain
tariffs for telecommunications services at a level which, will ensure, after
the commercial accounting system has been set up, a minimum annual rate of
return of 12 percent on the net average fixed assets of its telecommunications
branch.



- 7 -
21.     Notional, proforma accounts show that P & T's four-year
(1972-75) telecommiunications expansion program including a small net
increase of working capital would be financed from internally generated
funds (63 percent), the proposed Bank loan (34 percent)and a small
government contribution (3 percent).   The proforma accounts reflect payments
to the Government out of net income, over and above interest on debt,
amounting to US$2.6 million over the project period or an annual return of
about 8 percent on the Government's equity investment in the telecammunications
branch.
22.     The project provides for additions to local and long distance
facilities in line with earlier plans which were designed for the least
cost system development.   The internal economic rate of return is estimated
at at least 14 percent.   Sensitivity analysis indicates that the project
remains economically justified under the least favorable combination of
circumstances.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMFNTS AN AUTHORITY
23.     The draft Loan Agreement between Fiji and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a resolutiOn approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directora
separately.
24.     The draft loan agreement conforms to the normal pattern for loans
for telecommunications projects.
25.     I am satiafied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V  -   RECOMDlMATION
26.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
