APPRAISAL OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project for the expansion
and improvement of telecommunication services in Fiji. The Government of
Fiji has asked the Bank to help finance its program for telecommunications
included in the national development plan for the period FY1971-75
(Development Plan VI). This program is estimated to cost F$6.12 (US$7.29)
million.
ii.       The project proposed for Bank financing, which would be the
first Bank telecommunication project in Fiji, is the four-year time slice
(FY1972-75) of the program. It provides for the expansion of local tele-
phone systems by about 5,650 lines of exchange equipment (36% increase),
the extension of the long distance system throughout the main island of
Viti Levu, and between Viti Levu and other is&ands, and the extension of
telex services to meet existing demand. The cost of the project is
estimated at F$4.74 (Us$5.65) million with a foreign exchange component
of F$3.33 (US$3.97) million. The proposed loan would provide F$1.85
(US$2.2) million for this foreign exchange component.
iii.      The borrower would be the Government of Fiji and the beneficiary
would be the Department of Posts and Telecommunications (P&T), which is
responsible for all postal and telecomunications services in Fiji.
iv.       All the items for the project with the exception of telephone
switching equipment would be procured through international competitive
bidding. A major part (77%) of the switching equipment is required for
extensions to existing exchanges and would be procured from the original
supplier for reasons of economy., compatibility and standardization of
equipment in these exchanges. The procurement of the balance is also
recommended from the existing supplier as it is a small part of the
network and it would not be appropriate to separate out this order for
international bidding from the rest of the program. The Bank's agree-
ment to this purchase would be subject to the prices being in line with
international prices. The cost of this tied procurement would be about
24% of the proposed loan (US$0.52 million).
v.        The reorganization of the finance section of P&T and the intro-
duction of commercial accounting practices are of basic importance to
improve the organization. The present cash accounting system does not
provide management with the timely information necessary for sound
financial management, nor does it segregate the postal and telecommuni-
cations operations.  In 1974 P&T plans to install an appropriate commercial



- ii -
accounting system segregating these two operationz. It was agreed that
an expert will be required to initiate and maintain the system until such
time as the finance section can take over these responsibilities.
vi.       P&T's estimated financial position for telecommunications opera-
tions, based on a notional separation of the postal and telecoomnications
functions, is sound, and the forecast indicates this will continue through-
out the project period.
vii.      The program would contribute substantially to the growth of the"
economy and is of special importance to the development of tourism. The
internal economic rate of return is estimated to be at least 14%.
viii.     The project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$2.2
million for a term of 20 years, including a grace period of five years.

APPRAISAL OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Govermnent of Fiji has requested Bank assistance in financing
a project conprising the remainder of its five-year telecommunications
expansion program (DP VI) for fiscal years 1971 to 1975, to be undertaken
by the Department of Posts and Telecommunications (P&T).
1.02      The project proposed for Bank financing is the four-year time
slice (FY1972-75) of the program. The program is expected to cost
F$6.12 (US$7.29) million. The cost of the project is estimated at
F$4.74 (US$5.65) million with a foreign exchange component of about
F$3.33 (US$3.97) million.
1.03      The proposed Bank loan of US$2.2 million would finance about
56% of the foreign exchange cost of the project covering items which
have not yet been contracted for procurement by Fiji. This would be
the first Bank-assisted telecommunications project in Fiji. It would
be carried out by P&T, which provides all public telecomnmunications
and postal services in the country. Tne borrower would be the Government
of Fiji, which would make the proceeds available to P&T. The accounts of
P&T will reflect the servicing of the debt incurred on behalf of or
provided to P&T.
1.04      This report is based on information provided by P&T and on
the findings of an appraisal mission composed of Messrs. I. A. Newstead,
S. A. Sathar and R. C. Mitchell, which visited Fiji in November 1971.



2. THE SECTOR
Economic Setting
2.01      Fiji, formerly a British colony, became independent on October 1J,
1970, and now has dominion status within the Commonwealth. It is composed
of over 800 islands, situated in the South Pacific Ocean on the main tracie
routes between Australasia and North America. The country has a population
of slightly over half a million people, over 90 percent of whom live on the
islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.
2.02      The economic structure of Fiji is varied.  Onto the typical
South Pacific copra economy has been grafted an efficient smallholder
sugar industry. There is also a wide range of other crops, a number of
medium and small-scale in&d.stries compatible with market size, some mineral
development and a developed services sector within which tourism now has a
leading role. Sugar is still the leading export, but revenues from tourism
have been growing at 25% per annum, making it tne second largest earner of
foreign exohange. Per capita GNP is about $400 and growing at an average
annual rate of about 2.7%.
2.03      Fiji's large number of islands and the rugged mountainous terrain
of its major islands make it difficult to establish the basic transporta-
tion links required by a steadily growing and increasingly integrated
economy. Because transportation of goods and people is difficult, tele-
communications becomes particularly valuable in maintaining coordinatilon
between the other production and population centers and Suva.  The growing
tourism industry relies heavily on telecormurnication services to assure
the proper booking of facilities. This project provides for the improve.
ment and expansion of these vital services to meet Fiji's needs.
Telecommunications Sector
2.04      Ordinance Chapter 149 enacted in 1954 gives the Governmert the
exclusive privilege of establishing and maintaining telecommunications
within Fiji. P&T is the governmental department charged with this respon-
sibility under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, Worke
and Tourism. While generally the functioning of P&T is efficient and its
organization adequate on the engineering side, its accounting system doe-s
not follow oommercial principles. Government has agreed in principle to
the recommendations of a study made at their request by Mr. Hasen of the
Australian Post Office to set up a new accounting system. The implementa-
tion of these recommendations would allow P&T to function more efficient,y.
This and other organizational matters of P&T are discussed in paragranphs
5.04 to 5.09.
2.05      The main international telegraph, telex and telephone services
are operated by a private company, Cable and 'wireless Ltd. (C&W), under
a license. Suva is connected by submarine cable to Hawaii on one side
and Auckland (New Zealand) on the other. This cable has a capacity of



80 telephone channels, of which 16 in each direction have been made avail-
able to Fiji for its international telephone and telegraph traffic. P&T
receives terminal charges for originating and terminating traffic.
Existing Facilities
2.06      The telephone density in Fiji at the end of 1970 was about 3.4 per
100 people, making Fiji above average when compared with other developing
countries (see Annex 1). Considering Fiji's geography and its needs for
transportation and industries, this is considered reasonable (paragraph 2.03).
The waiting list for telephone connections is at present about 2,,400 or 25%
of direct exchange lines (DEL's). About 85% of the local telephone exchanges
are automatic and subscriber trunk dialling (STD) service is available to
all principal cities. Standards of service are satisfactory at the main
centers of population but in the smaller towns and rural areas there is
need for improvement.
Local Telephone Facilities
2.07      The standard of installation and maintenance of the telephone
exchange equipment and external network is satisfactory. Some principal
statistics for Fiji's local telephone services as of December 1970, are
given below (see Annex 2 for details).
Number of automatic exchanges                                  9
Total capacity of automatic exchanges (lines)            10,500
Number of manual exchanges                                    11
Total capacity of manual exchanges (lines)                2,392
Number of connected subscribers exchange lines (DEL's)   9,623
Number of telephones                                     16,860
2.8       Prior to 1963 about 5,400 lines of step-by-step automatic exchange
equipment had been installed; the new automatic exchanges installed since
1963 are of the common-control type. The exchange fill is about 55% which
is rather low dae to the recent completion of extensions which will be
utilized during the next two or three years.
Subscribers Radio Service
2.09      About 40 of the outlying islands are connected to the network
by HF and VHF radio equipment. In addition a VHF subscriber radio service
is provided to some 20 localities on the main islands of Viti Levu and
Vanua Levu. These mostly serve governmental agencies and private con-
struction projects but also accept public traffic. There is need for
extending these facilities to more islands ana also the interior.
Long Distance Service
2.1C      The main long aistance service is proviaad by a backbone
300-channel microwave system connecting Suva, Fiji's capital and largest
city, with Lautoka, the main city on the western side of Viti Levu, and



- 4 -
by UHF and VHF radio to other centers. There are 470 telephone circuits
in all, 300 of then between Suva and Lautoka.  These two cities have
automatic trunk exchanges, which provide STD facilities for about 85% of
the subscribers. The long distance network is shown on the map.
Telegraph and Telex Services
2.11      Fiji has 73 telegraph offices, which handle public traffic.
In Suva there is an automatic telex exchange, which serves the whole of
Viti Levu. It has 58 subscribers ana a waiting list of 17.
Regional and International Services
2.12      P&T provides HF radio, telegraph and telephone services to
neighboring islands and territories in the South Pacific, details of
which are shown on the map, the international services being provided
by C&W (paragraph 2.05).



3. THE PROJECT
The ProJect
3.01      The project comprises the remainder of P&T's FY1971-75 Develop-
ment Plan, which provides for the expansion of Fiji's telecommunication
services to meet growing demand and to extend and improve the range of
services to, and within, the outlying islands and rural areas.  The
program is estimated to cost about F$6.12 (US$7.29) million. Details
of the program and its present status are set out in Annex 3.
3.02      The project, which is the four-year (FYl972-75) time slice of
the program, provides for:
(i)  purchase and installation of about 5,650 lines of local
exchange equipment together with the local and junction
cable network and associated facilities;
(ii) expansion of radio telephone facilities in rural areas by
VHF and HF radio stations;
(iii) expansion of long distance facilities consisting of new
microwave systems between (1) Suva and Singatoka and
(2) South Ridge and Delaikoro, connecting Viti Levu and
Vanua Levu;
(iv) expansion of the telegraph service and addition of about
40 subscribers' lines to the telex system; and
(v) provision of consultants' services for engineering,
procurement and assistance in the accounting reorganization.
The estimated cost or the project is F$4.74 (US$5.65) million witn a
foreign exchange component of about F$3.33 (US$3.97) million. Details
of the prmject are given in Annex 3.

Procurement
3.06      Equipment under items (ii) and (iii), i.e., the subscribers'
network and the microwave equipment, would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding. Procurenent of the exchange equipment
under item (i) above will be from suppliers of existing exchanges (see
paragraphs 3.07 and 3.08). For the engineering consultants' services
included under item (iv), Preece, Cardew and Rider have been retained by
PBT as engineering consultants and the Crown Agents for procurement,
inspection and shipmenit. These arrangements are satisfactory. For the
accounting reorganization along commercial lines, P&T proposes to apply
through the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) or bilateral assist-
ance for an expert to set up the commercial accounting system. However,
if aid is not available from these sources, it is proposed that the Bank
should finance the foreign exchange cost of such services. US$55,000 has
been included in item (iv) for this contingency.
3.07      In 1962, IPT invited bids from manufacturers in UK, Sweden,
Germany and Netherlands with a view to long-term standardization of tele-
phone switching equipment. Based on an analysis of these offers, P&T
selected the L.M. Ericsson (Sweden) crossbar system for new installations
of telephone exchange equipment. In conformity with this earlier decision,
out of the 5,650 lines of local exchange equipment, provided in the project,
P&T had already placed orders for about 2,25G lines on LME (Sweden) before
this project was appraised and this is not part of the Bank-financed
item (i). A major part (71%) of the remainJrng 3,400 lines of local switch-
ing equipment is required for extensions to 'xisting exchanges. Some
minor extensions to existing automatic trunk exchanges are also needed.
The extension to local and trunk exchanges need to be of the same type



- 8 -
to that already installed on grounds of compatibility and in order to use
existing common equipment facilities. Although international bidding will
be possible for the balance, considering the small size of the Fiji tele-
phone network, it would not be appropriate to separate out this relatively
small (Us$120,000) order from the rest of the system.
3.08      It is recommended therefore that the Bank agree to procurement
of about US$0.52 million, equivalent to 23.6% of the loan, for the entire
trunk and 3,400 lines of local switching equipment from the original
supplier provided that the prices of this equipment are in line with inter-
national prices for such equipment. The individual quotations for the
equipment will be examined by the Bank b-r comparing these prices with
quotations for similar equipment bid internationally in other countries
where the Bank has experience. P&T does not pay any custom duties for
imported equipment.
Execution of the Project
3.09      Preece, Cardow and Rider have prepared the specifications for
the local and long distance telecommunications systems and the Crown
Agents have also prepared the first set of specifications and bid docu-
ments for the subscribers' network materials. The installation and
commissioning of all telephone exchange equipment would be carried out
by the contractors under P&T supervision. P&T would use its own staff
for the installation of the cable network, subscribers' installations,
microwave system, and other radio telephone and telegraph equipment.
3.10      The project is scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1976.  A
detailed timetable is shown in Annex 4. Subject to improvement of the
staff training arrangements (paragraph 5.04), P&T has the capability to
carry out the project and subsequently operate the network.
Disbursement
3.11      The proposed loan would be disbursed against the CIF costs of
imported equipment and materials and the foreign excnange costs of
suppliers' installers and the consultants' services. The estimated
schedule of disbursements is given in Annex 5. As the project is part
of a continuing investment program, it is proposed that anwy unused balance
should, after consultation with the Bank, be app±ied to the purchase of
additional items of the same type.

4. JUSTIFICATION
4.ol      The objective of the program of which the project forms a part,
is to provide telecommunication facilities needed to meet the growing
demand for service throughout Fiji, and to extend and improve the range
of telecommunication services to and within Fiji's outlying islands.
These facilities will aid the development of all areas of Fiji including
the outlying islands by providing effective telecommunications needed to
promote trade and commerce in the commodities produced in these islands
and assist Government in administering and developing these and other
areas.
Demand for Local Service
4.02      During the five-year period of Development Plan V (1966-70),
total demand grew 9% per year from 7,027 DEL's and 830 on the waiting
list to 9,623 DEL's and 2,427 on the waiting list. During the five-year
period of Development Plan VI (1971-75), growth of demand is projected
at 7.2% due in part to tariff increases. The total demand in 1975 on
this basis will be 17,100 connected lines of which the program will pro-
vide for 15,600 connected lines leaving a waiting list of 1,500. The
Govermnent does not consider that the additional capital expenditure of
about F$1.5 million that would be needed during Development Plan VI to
satisfy demand completely would be justified at this time in light of
other pressing claims.
Demand for Long Distance Service
4.03      Long distance calls are largely haniled automatically and the
call charge units are recorded on subscriber meters. P&T have also not
made special sampling observations to measure the traffic at periodic
intervals (usual practice is about once a month) on long distance routes.
It was therefore not possible to separate and establish a growth rate
for long distance traffic.  In the absence of adequate data, P&T have
based their expansion plans on a growth rate of 17% per year. This would
be in line with the experience in ot.ier countries and is reasonable.
Demand for International Service
4.o4      International calls have been stimulated by tourism and have
been increasing at an average rate of 24? per year during 1967-70.  It
is expected that this rate of increase will continue through the program
period.
Demand for Telegraph and Telex Services
1.4o5     The length of the average telegraph message has decreased.
Therefore, even though nes-ages continue to :.ncrease, the associated
revenues are decreasing at ar. -nnual rate of 6%. This pattern reflects
the public's preference for telephone servric, when the message length



- 10 -
is substantial and for telex service which is growing at a rate of 17%
per year. The trends in telegraph and telex services are expected to
continue in the immediate future as telephone and telex facilities
become more available.
Least-Cost Solution
4.06      The fundamental decisions determining the basic network of
Fiji's telecommunications were made in the period 1962-65 and included
the national numbering, switching and transmission plans. It was at that
time that a decision was taken to standardize on common control equipment
for the local and long-distance switching systems. As far as the long
distance network is concerned, VHF, UHF and microwave radio was chosen
as the only practical means of providing this service in view of the
topography of the country and the difficulties of road access. This
project provides for additions of local and long distance facilities
which were planned already to provide the least cost system development.
Internal Economic Ratafff tburn
4.07      The internal economic rate of return determined by equalizing
the present values of increase in expenditures and related revenues is
estimated to be at least.14.% (see Annex 6). The least favorable combina-
tion of circumstances, when construction costs increased 10%, operating
costs increased 10%, and growth decreased 10% from current projections
would lower the internal economic rate of return to 11%.

5. THE BENEFICIARY
Organization and Management
5.01      The organizational structure of P&T generally follows conven-
tional practice in most British Commonwealth countries. There are
separate functional branches for postal, telephone and telegraph opera-
tions, postal savings accounts, finance and accounts, and administration.
The organization chart for P&T is given in 5nnex 7. The Secretary for
Posts and Telecommunications is respons;i 'E nor the administration of
all branches of P&T. However, budget control is exercised on a detailed
basis by the Ministry of Finance. Also the civil engineering construction
for P&T is the responsibility of the Public Works Department and recruit-
ment is the responsibility of the Public Services Department. Because of
the small scale of operations, P&T has no difficulties coordinating the
different activities and the present set up is appropriate during the
construction period of the proposed project.  However, these arrangements
should be reviewed in about four years giving consideration to vesting
F&T with a measure of day-to-day autonomy in these matters.
5.02      Present management is adequate.  There is a substantial number
of expatriate officers in the technical branches. The Government is
gradually replacing them as and when qualified Fijians become available
t to fill the posts (paragraph 5.04).
Staff
5.03      P&T staff totalled 716 in January 1971, with about 560 engaged
in telecommunications. The resuiting ratio of 33 per 1,000 telephones
is reasonable at this stage of developme-it when compared with Papua New
Guinea with 34 and Indonesia with 86.  P&T plans to maintain the ratio
of 33 per 1,000 telephones during the project period.
Training
5.0h      The training of skilled workers such as linemen and cable
jo-nters and also the operating staff such as telephone and wireless
operators and telegraphists is done within the P&T in a training center
and is satisfactory. Other engineering personnel comprising technicians
and supervisory engineers are all recruited as telecommunication techni-
cian cadets. The technician cadets who are required to have the equivaler.
to the New Zealand School Certificate are given about 50% of their traininL
at the Aational Technical Institute, where they study for an Ordinary
Technician Diploma (OTD) of the City and Guilds Institute of London,
followed by one year of practical training with P&T. The best of these
are sent abroad for taking a unilrersity degree in engineering and become
telecommunications engineers. Because of the need to fill the posts of
engineers from the personnel recruited for both categories, the initial
qualifications and training syllabi for technicians are more severe than
would be the case if only technicians posts were to be catered to and



- 12 -
from time to time have resulted in inadequate recruitment. Further quite
a few persons after taking the engineering degree under P&T sponsorship
do not continue with P&T but leave for better positions. In view of the
long lead time in completing such training, adequate staffing of engineers'
positions becomes difficult.  These problems could be alleviated by recruit-
ment of technicians and engineers separately with appropriate qualifications
for the two categories and training tailored to meet the requirements.
During negotiations, assurarces were obtained that the recruitment and
training system will be reviewed with a view to its improvement. This
review, together with the changes in the recruitment and training program
which P&T proposes, will be sent to the Bank within one year of the signing
of the loan. P&T will consult with the Bank before implementing these
measures.
Accounting and Reorganization
5.05      P&T capital and operating expenses are voted by Parliament as
an integral part of the Government's annual budget. Revenue receipts
are deposited in a consolidated revenue account. The Accounts Branch
of P&T performs the limited accounting necessary to these procedures,
maintaining expenditure records and cash receipt ledgers so that the
required cash reports can be submitted to the Treasury. No original
cost records on telecommunications plant have been maintained.
5.06      This accounting system, being designed only to control cash,
does not provide management with the adequate and timely data needed to
evaluate P&T's performance and take any corrective action. The Govern-
ment has been aware of the deficiencies of this accounting system, and
in 1.970 engaged a consultant from the Australian Post Office to make an
evaluation. His report recommended a co=aerciai accounting system similar
to that of the Australian Post Office.  The report provides a satisfactory
basis for a new accounting system for P&T.
5.07      As a first step a finance section should be established to
install and maintain the proposed commercial accounting system. The
section should be administered by a qualified accountant with experience
in commercial application. During negotiations assurances were obtained
thati this important position will be established and filled by a Qualified
person during 1973 to assist in the installation of the commercial account-
ing system and to administer the finance section and the accounting system
after installation (paragraph 5.08).
5.o8      P&T does not have the accounting leadership needed to install a
commercial accounting system.  The finance secti-on head discussed above
will be new and not necessarily familiar with te...ecommunication or postal
operations. The Government and P&T have agreed that it will be necessary
to engage a suitable expert as a consultant for a psriod of about two rears
to insTall the commercial accounting system anu to maintain it until F&T's
personnel are able to assume that responsibility. The consultant should
be famillar with postal and telecommunications operations and the applica-
tion of commercial accoar.Ling practices to such operations.  P&T intends
to request these consultant services under bilateral assistance or UNDP.



- 13 -
However, funds for this purpose have been Ircluded in the proposed loan,
in the event that such aid is not forthcoming. The suggested terms of
reference for these consulting services are set out in Annex 8. During
negotiations agreement was reached on these services and on the terms of
reference.
5.09      During negotiations assurances were obtained that P&T will
establish a commercial accounting system within twelve months of the
appointment of the consultant referred to in paragraph 5.08 that will
provide the following:
(a) A complete separation of the accounts of P&T's postal
and telecommunications branches. The accounts of the
telecommunications branch w.12 not reflect losses, if
any, resulting from the operations of the postal branch.
(b) An adequate property record including the establishment
of a value for telecommunications plant and the applica-
tion of a suitable depreciation policy.
(c) Recording of all costs of both a capital and recurring
nature, that relate to P&T's telecommunication operations,
including costs of services provided to P&T by other
Government departments.
(d) A complete billing and recording of the revenues from
all telecommunication services provided by P&T, including
those related to other Government entities.
(e) Timely and effective financial reports for management.
Audit
5.10      Audit functions for P&T are presently performed in satisfactory
fashion by the staff of the Auditor-General. Audit procedures and the
audit program are acceptable. Two auditors are engaged full-time, with
additional auditors made available as required. P&T's accounting staff
supplement the Auditor-General's audit with cash audits at field locations
and physical inventories of stockrooms.
5.11      Assurances were obtained however, that, after the commercial
accounting system has been set up, an annual audit by a qualified accountant
acceptable to the Bank will be performed and that certified financial
statements (including the auditor's opinion) will be submitted to the
Bank within four months after the close of each fiscal year. The Govern-
ment has suggested that the Auai or-General, who is appointed by the
Governor-General, should continue to audit P&T.  The Auditor-General has
been performing commercial audits for the sugar mills and has the staff
and proficiency necessary to oerform the audit within the time require-
ments; therefore, this proposal. woula be acceptable.  However, if the
BanK is not satisfied with this audit, the right to require an audit by
another accountant acceptable to the Ba-ik was reserved.



- iL. -
Taxes and Insurance
5.12      P&T as a department of the Government is not subject to any
form of taxation.
5.13      P&T's assets are widely distributed geographically and there
is no concentration of risk. Experience elsewhere would confirm that
the risks of significant damage is minimal and rehabilitation of the
system is not expensive. Based on these considerations, insurance is
not considered necessary and the Government policy of not carrying
insurance is acceptable.

6. FINANCES
Summary of Finances
6.01      P&T does not utilize commercial accounting practices, separate
postal and telecommunications operations or maintain plant cost records
(paragraph 5.07). Consequently, it has been necessary to present finan-
cial data for past telecommunications operations notionally, based on
information made available by P&T. These data reflect a sound financial
performance over the past four years as evidenced by a plant in service
increase of 102% from F$4.2 million to F$8.4 million, financed almost
exclusively from internally generated funds. The expansion program for
the next four years will increase plant in service another 61% to F$13.5
million. It is estimated that internally generated funds will cover 63%
of this expansion after dividend distributions of 48% of profits and
assuming no taxes. The proposed Bank loan will provide funds for 34% of
the cost of the project and will provide the opportunity for needed
institution building in P&T. The remaining 3% will be provided by the
Government during the first year of the project.
Past Performance
6.02      Income statements for the years 1968 through 1971 are shown
in Annex 9. The rates of return on average net telecommunications plant
in service were estimated as follows:
Year             Rate of Return
1968                   18.6%
1969                   26.9%
1970                   21.5%
1971                   17.0%
This earnings perfonmance is satisfactory. The increase in the rate of
return in 1969 was due to a 20% increase in call charge tariffs when
these were rationalized at the time of change to decimal currency. The
subsequent change in the rate of return is due to the large increase
in assets.
6.03      Collection performance is generally satisfactory, with receiv-
ables averaging about two monrths' sales. The bulk of the billing,
employing machine applications, and collecting is performed in Suva.
The remainder of the call charge billing and collections are performed
by Post Office personnel irn the rual ar-as. Complete mechanized billing
at Suva is desired by P&T for record simp-ification and will be initiated
as soon as increased volime makes this approach feasible.
Tariffs
6.o0      The Minister of Communications, Works and Tourism has authority
to revise the telecommunications tariffs.  In practice, however, all major
tariff revisions are submitted to the Cabinet for its concurrence before
they are put into effect.



- 16 -
6.o5      A summary of exi3ting tariffs is given in Annex 12.  The
basic features include a F$10 installation charge; for connections
to automatic exchanges, annual rentals of F$20 for business and F$15
for residential 3ubscribers tcgether with a 3¢ a call charge; for
connection to manual exchanges which do not have metering facilities
an annual rental (no call charge) of F$32 or F$40 for business and
F$22 or F$24 for residence subscribers depending on if the exchange
has less or more than 200 subscribers. The structure of this tariff
follows practices in many countries. However, in Fiji the classifica-
tion between business and residence subscribers is causing administra-
tive difficulties since small businesses operate from residences. Also
a few subscribers make a smalL number of outgoing calls which makes the
total revenue for these installations less than the costs of providing
the service. P&T proposes to correct these two minor weaknesses by the
following changes:
(a) Establish a minimum call charge, in tne range of F$2.00
per month. This modification will eliminate a number of
very small invoices under the existing tariff, and produce,
P&T estimates, an annual revenue increase of F$11,000;
(b) Eliminate the residential classification and rate. This
will produce an annual revenue increase of F$20,000.
6.o6      Government departments do not pay any call charges.  It is
estimated that the revenues that would accrue from such charges are
currently about F$500,000 per year. The Statement of income for P&T
(Annex 9) has been adjusted to include an estimate of Government call
charges based on normal tariffs.  YManagement believes that the Govern-
ment departments should be billed for all services provided. During
negotiations assurances irere obtained that Goverrnient departT,,ents
will be billed for all services provided at normal tariffs and that an
appropriate procedure for payment will be instituted.
6.07      Although a complete evaluation cannot be made unitil commercial
accounting practices are installed, it is not anticipated that any major
tariff revision will be required to support the proposed expansion pro-
gram.  Forecasts (Annex 9) snow satisfactory operating results over t-he
next six years. However, to ensare that earnings will be sufficient to
provide for an adequate contribution to future exparnsion and service debt,
agreement was obtained during negotiations that tariffs will be
maintairned that will produce a rate of return on average net fixed assets
in service, properly valued, of niot less than 12% and that no tariff re-
ductions will be made during the project period without consultation with
the Bank. It is expected that the rate of return during the construction
period will approximate 16% (paragraph 6.14).
Financial Position
6.o8      A notional summary of the financial position of the telecom-
munications operations as of December 31, 1970, is given below. A

- 18 -
6.10      The above presentation assu.mes that P&T's accounts would
reflect the servicing of debt incurred on behalf of P&T. On this basis,
internal cash generated would cover 63% of the total requirement after
servicing debt and compensating Government for their investment.  During
negotiations assurances were obtained that the accounts of P&T will reflect
the servicing of debt incurred on behalf of or provided to P&T.
6.11      The proposed Bank loan of F$1.85 (US$2.2) million which would
provide 56% of the foreign exchange costs would have a term of 20 years,
including a 5-year grace period.
Future Operating Results
6.12      Forecast statements of income for the seven-year period 1971-77
and the assumptions used in developing these forecast results, are shown
in Annex 9.
6.13      During this period, telephone revenues are expected to increase
by 83% - from F$2.4 (US$2.8) million to F$4.4 (US$5.2) million - or an
average increase of 9% per year. Operatirg expenses, excluding depre-
ciation, during the same period would increase 88%, also at annual average
of about 9%. This growth in expenses is reasonable considering the addi-
tional staff required, higher salaries and wages, and increasing costs
related to the expanding facilities.
6.11      The rate of return on average plant in service is expected to
stay reasonably constant throughout the period at slightly under 16%.
The operating ratio also remains constant at 62%. These results are
satisfactory.
Equity Investment Compensation
6.15      The forecast assumes a payment to the Government from annual
profits at a rate of 8% on its equity contribution. This practice would
produce a pay out of net income varying from 53% in 1972 to 36% in 1977.
The Government has not decided how it should be compensated for its
investment, however, the method implemented must assure that adequate
funds are made available to P&T to meet the financial plan. During nego-
tiations it was agreed that the accounts of PF&T will reflect payments to
Goverrment from telecommunications net incoie to provide a reasonable
return to Government on its ecuity invest7nent in the telecommunications
branch.
Debt Ltmitatior. Covenan,
6.16      Although the aiaouut o'f :-'s dorig--.exm debQ is expected to
remain small in relation to its overall capi-,alization for the foreseeable
future, it would be useTL to  P&T to revie ; the debt. service coverage as
part of the normal managementt coutrols.    rr .ag negotiations agreement was
reached that Government will nrt incur on bcar.alf of or provide to P&T addi-
tional long-term debt without tlae Bank'S a~n:r-,-val unless historical 12-months
net revenues of P&T cover maxLmumr deat service at least 1.5 times.

7.  AG&iEEENTS REACHED AND RECOMMNDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreements were reached on the
following principal points:
(a)  within twelve months of the signing of the loan, P&T will
complete a study of its recruitment and training program
and will consult the Bank before implementing the measures
recommended in the study (paragraph 5.0L);
(b) during 1973 P&T will (i) establish a finance section,
(ii) employ a qualified and experienced accountant to
administer the finance section, and (iii) engage an
accounting consultant to install a commercial accounting
system (paragraphs 5.07 and 5.08);
(c) P&T will complete installation of the commercial account-
ing system within twelve months of the appointment of
the accounting consultant (paragraph 5.09);
(d) the accounts of P&T will be audited by an independent
auditor and the certified financial statements and the
auditor's report will be sent to the Bank not later than
four months after the end of the fiscal year (paragraph
5.11);
(e) P&T will bill all Government ciepartments for all services
provided at normal tariffs and Government will insure that
payments are made promptly (paragraph 6.06);
(f) P&T during the period of the project will make no tariff
reductions without consultation with the Bank; and with
the installation of the commercial accounting system,
P&T will maintain tariffs that will produce a rate of
return of 12% on the average net fixed assets (paragraph
6.07);
(g) the accounts of P&T will reflect the servicing of debt
incurred on behalf of or provided to P&T (paragraph 6.10);
(h) the accounts of P&T will reflect payments to Government
from net telecommunications income to provide a reasonable
return to Government on its equity investment in the
telecommunications branch of P&T (paragraph 6.15); and
(i) Government will not incur on behalf of or provide to P&T
any long-term debt unless the historical twelve months
revenues of the telecommunication. branch cover maximum
future debt services at laast 1.5 times (paragraph 6.16).
7.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank
loan of US$2.2 million, for a term of 20 years, including a five year
grace period.

DEPART!ENT OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS (P&T)
Development Program (DP VI) and Project
1.        Details of P&T's five-year development program for 1971-1975
are given below. The project is the four-year (1972-1975) time slice
of the program.
A. Buildings
2.        Combined post office and telephone exchange buildings will be
constructed at Deuba and Nasinu, and a telephone exchange building will
be constructed at Labasa. In addition, a workshop building will be
erected at Lautoka.  The first stage of a new central building in Suva
will be undertaken with some alterations in the existing building. The
program also includes some post office buildings and minor buildings for
radio stations.
B. Telephone Exchanges
3.        The program provides for replacement of some of the main manual
exchanges with automatic exchanges of adequate capacity including exchanges
at Labasa, Navua and Rakiraki with a total of about 1,600 lines. An auto-
matic exchange will be established at Deuba with 200 lines and in Nasinu
with 650 lines to handle growth expected in these areas. In addition,
the capacity of existing automatic exchanges in Lami, Lautoka, Nadi, Namaka,
Samabula and Suva is to be increased by about 4,900 lines. Trunk exchanges
at Lautoka and Suva will also be extended to accommodate the additional
circuits required for the increased STD traffic.
C. Subscribers' Trunk Network anc. Telenhone Instruments
4.        The program cl subscr:.bers' network, which consists mainly of
the primary and secondary cable networks and the subscriberst installa-
tions, is geared to the expans'.on of the telephone exchanges. The plans
for expansion of these facilitIes in the program period a.r> planned for
an increase in the number of telephones .r 10.5% per year.
D.  Trunk_ystem
5.        The program provides for the expansion of existing microwave
routes and replacement of some of tne existing VHF/UHF routes by higher
capacity microwave.  A new microwave system between Suva and Singatoka
and betweer. South Ridge and Delaikoro, connecting the two main islands
of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu will be const'ucted.  The existing UHF
system between Delaikoro, Savusavu-Taveuni will be expanded.

E. Telegraph and Telex Services
6.        The telex service introduced in 1963 is expanding.  It is
proposed to expand the telex exchange to a capacity of 200 lines and also
adequately increase the channelling on VFT systems and the number of
teleprinters in the country.
F. Radio Communications
7.        Radio is the most feasible method of providing communications
to the scattered island communities. Provision has been made in the
program to improve communications with the Lau island group by the use
of VHF radio links in tandem working into the main system by direct
dialling. Radio links will be extended from a new radio station on
Taveuni to Vanua Balavu, Lakeba and Kabara. The program also provides
for VHF radiophone services for private rental and public use at fixed
points in remote areas, in land vehicles and on vessels in Fijian waters.
These VHF services will complement and progressively replace present HF
radio services at various points so improving the service.
8.        The program also provides for the replacement of 13 of the
so-called provincial radio stations. In addition, 17 new stations will
operate by HF or VHF as appropriate according to location and technical
considerations. These stations will be maintained and operated by agernts
appoin-ed by the Government.
G. Costs
9.        Details of costs of the program and project are given in Table 3
of this annex.

Internal Economic Rate of Return
1.        Page 3 of this Annex presents the cost and benefit streams for
the proposed investment. The internal economic rate of return which is
the discount rate equalizing these two streams is 14%.
2.        The following assumptions were made:
Period - The 25-year period is derived from the five-year
-       construction period plus the twenty-year estimated
life of the asset.
Capital Expediture - The construction costs of the program
at 1971 price excluding the portion of the contingency
estimate associated with pricing.
Revenues -
Call Charges  - Computed by applying the average call
charge revenue per telephone to the average telephones
gained during the years 1973 through 1975. For the
years 1976 through 1980 an increase factor of 10% per
year is used.
Rentals, Etc. / - All revenue increases during 1973
through 1977 are associated with the program.
Leased Circuits -/ - All revenue increases during 1973
through 1977 are associated with the program.
Telex - All revenue increases during 1972 through
1977 are associated with the program.
1/ A conservative position has been assumed since an indeterminable
portion of the revenue increase during the year 1972 would
undoubtedly be associated with the project.



ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 3 pages
Expenses - 40% of the annual expense increase exclusive of
depreciation is estimated to be related to the
project. The remaining 60% of the increase is
considered to be the result of normal cost increases
which will occur regardless of whether or not the
project is undertaken..
Rate of Return
10% increase in construction costs         12.3%
10% increase in operating costs            13.3%
10% increase in operating revenues         15.3%
10% increase in construction costs
with 10% increase in operating
asts and a 10% decrease in the
gvrovth rate                           10.8%

Telecommunications Branch
Notes and Assumptions on the Pro-Forma Income Statement
Revenues
1968-70
1.        Actual cash basis revenues have been restated consistent with
categories used in the forecast and reflecting accrual accounting prac-
tices and the billing of Government service at regular tariff rates for
all calls.
1971-77
No major tariff revisions have been anticipated or reflected
during the period.
Call Charges
2.        Call charges have been forecast to increase at a rate of 7% for
1971, consistent with P&T btidget and at a 10% rate thereafter conservatively
reflecting revenues relating to the Development Plan VI estimate.
Rental and Miscellaneous Charges
3.        Rental and miscellaneous charge revenues have been forecast at
an experienced rate of F$24 per estimated average telephone during the
years 1971-75 and at the conservative annual growth rate of 8% thereafter.
Leased Circuits
4.        Leased circuit revenues have been forecast at F$80,000 per year
during 1971-72 consistent with P&T budget and increasing at a rate of
F$5,000 per year thereafter.
Telegraph
5.        Telegraph revenues have been forecast to decrease at a rate of
6% per year reflecting recent experiences and the increasing availability
of telephone services.



ANNEX 9
Page 3 of 4 pages
Telex
6.        Telex revenue have been forecast at an experienced rate of
F$1,000 per estimated average subscriber during the years 1971-75 and at
the annual growth rate of 10% for 1976 and 1977.
Special Services
7.        The revenues from special services such as ship-to-shore radio,
etc. have been forecast at F$15,000 per year consistent with P&T budget.
Ifnternational Service
8.        P&T's portion of the international service net revenues have been
included with Call Charges and projected on that basis.  The major portion
of this revenue is retained by Cable and Wireless Ltd.
Expenses
1968-70
Personnel
9.        Actual cash basis personnel costs have been restated to reflect
accrued accounting practices and an estimate of those costs not reflected
in the accounts of P&T for expatriate's gratuity payments, a portion of
the Minister's salary and the capitalization of labor devoted to the
construction program.
Other Operating Expenses
10.       Actual cash basis operating expenses have been restated to
reflect accrued accounting practices and an estimate of the costs not
reflected in the accounts of P&T for pension fund contributions, power,
water, audit services, building maintenance and supplies.
1971-77
Personnel
11.       Personnel expenses have been forecast to increase at an annual
rate of 12% and 5%, respectively, for the yearsl971 and 1972 consistent
with P&T budget and at a rate of 7% for the subsequent years making the
estimate consistent with F4ji's planning guidelines which attempt to
restrict personnel cost increases to 6.3% per annum.



ANNEX 9
Page Fof 4 pages
Other Operating Expenses
12.       Other operating expenses have been forecast to increase at an
annual rate of 27% and 10%, respectively, for the years 1971 and 1972
consistent with the P&T budget, and continuing at the rate of 10% for the
subsequent years.
Depreciation
13.       P&T does not maintain a fixed asset register - therefore it was
necessary to develop fixed asset values for application of depreciation
rate. The rate itself was developed by assuming that additions during
the years 1963 through 1970 were representative of the total plant invest-
ment. By giving lives to this plant which are normal to the telecommunica-
tions industry, a composite depreciation rate of 5% was developed.
Interest Expense
14.       Interest expense was computed at 3-1/2% for the Viti Levu VHF
loan, 7-1/4% for the proposed Bank loan and 8% for future financing.

DEPAR¶MENT OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS (P&T)
Telecommunications Branch
Notes and AssuWmtions on the Pro-Forma Balance Sheet
Plant-in-Service
1.        No fixed assets register has been maintained so it was neces-
sary to develop fixed assets values. Cash basis additions were obtained
from P&T records from the years 1948 to 1970. These additions were
increased to reflect estimated P&T labor costs not capitalized during
this period. Additions for each year were also adjusted to reflect
balances for plant-under-construction computed as discussed in paragraph 2
of this Annex. Values of total plant additions and balances for plant-
under-construction for the year 1971 through 1975 are based on P&T's
program. Accumulated depreciation was computed for each year's additions
based on a 5% depreciation rate.
Plant-Under -Construction
2.        In each year's additions from 1948 to 1970 it was assumed that
the amount of plant under construction at the closing of each year would
be 40% of the sum of the construction program for that year plus the
construction program for the prior year. Values for the years 1971
through 1975 are based on P&T's program.
Trust Account
3.        The formation of a trust account was suggested in the Hansen
Report on commercial accounting. All revenue receipts would be deposited
into this account and all expenditures would be paid from it. When expend-
itures are greater than receipts the account will have a credit balance
which represents a temporary advance of funds to the P&T by Government.
This advance could be repaid from subsequent receipts or from arn additional
capital contribution by Government. When receipts exceed expenditures the
account will have a debit balance representing an advance to Government by
P&T. The forecast indicates that this situation will occur temporarily
at December 31, 1975.
Accounts Receivable
4.        Accounts receivable are estimated at 2C% of annual call charge
revenues reflecting slightly more than two months billings.






ANNEX 10
Page 3 of 3 pages
Inventories
5.        Inventory values for 1968 to 1970 are based on P&T's records
and include both materials and equipment purchased for a specific con-
struction project and those purchased for any routine construction or
maintenance. Future inventory value has been estimated at 3% of gross
plant which appears to be acceptable considering the distance from
suppliers.
Viti Levu VHF Telecommunications Loan
6.        This loan represents the item of public debt which relates
specifically to telecommunications financing. It therefore was consid-
ered notionally to be an obligation of P&T which could be paid as funds
are available prior to its 1979 due date. Government sinking fund
accumulations have not been considered in determining the valuations of
this obligation.
Accounts Payable and Accrued Payroll
7.        Accounts payable and accrued payroll were estimated to be 5%
of annual capital and operating expenditures. This level appears to be
adequate as P&T's obligations, after authentication, are submitted for
payment from Government consolidated funds.
