FIRST HOUSING LOAN TO CREDIT IMMOBILIER ET HOTELIER (CIHI)
(LOAN 2245-MOR)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report describes the preparation, appraisal,
and implementation of the Third Urban Development Project in Morocco, for which
Loan 2245-MOR in the amount of US$60 million was signed on April 11, 1983. The
project became effective on August 30, 1983 and closed on December 31, 1989, as
originally planned. The loan account remained open until January 29, 1990, at
which time the loan was fully disbursed.
The Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III of the PCR were
prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division, Country Department II of the
Europe, Middle East and North Africa Regional Office.  The Borrower, the Real
Estate and Hotel Finance Company (CIH), has submitted Part II of the report on
September 1991.
The report was based on, inter alia, the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Loan and Guaranty Agreements, supervision mission and reports, correspt Adence
between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPOR,
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Intreduglo!
1.             Thifr operation was a pilot project, as it was the first time the
Bank had financed an urban development operation through a line of credit granted
to a financial institution. Before 1981, when the project was identified, assistance
to the sector had been accomplished through lending directly to the Government. The
line of credit approach to promoting the development of affordable housing was
necessary because the Government had to minimize its financiog of low- and moderate-
cost housing in the face of severe budgetary constraints. It was judged a viable
apprcach since there was already a sound financial institution in place. At the
time, the Real Estate and Hotel Finance Company (CIH) was the country's only
financial institution granting long-term home mortgage loans. CIH was also well known
to the Bank, which had previously granted it four loans for the development of the
tourist industry.
Prolect Oblectives and ImRlementation Experience
2.             The project's main objectives were to:
(a)  encourage public and private developers to pr>-7uce housing programs
accessible to households whose incomes were lower than the median
income, estimated at US$330 in 1982; and
(b)  develop CIH's car-city to evaluate programs to finance low-cost
housing and advise developers on the technical and financial aspects
of their subprojects.
3.            ITine of Credit.  A line of credit in the amount of US$59 million
financed low-income housing development programs according to technical and financial
criteria defined during appraisal. Two design flaws contributed to difficulties in
disbursing that line of credit. First, the technical criteria were too rigorous,
as four fully defined sub-categories did not allow for sufficient flexibility in
programs involving both eligible housing in the different sub-categories and non-
eligible housing. Second, the selling price ceiling imposed on eligible housing was
too low, because, on the one hand, potential savings by beneficiaries were
underestimated, and on the other hand, advantages conceded to eligible housing also
applied to other low-cost units whose criteria, such as a higher selling price
ceiling, were more flexible. In addition, the guarantees, notably on land titles,
which CIH requested for the allocation of construction loans, made some eligible
programs impossible to finance. Interest rates at 14% and 15% applied to medium-
term developer loans were high compared with the local prime rate ranging from 9%
to 11% during the project period and prevented private developers from keeping
selling prices below the ceiling set by eligibility criteria. It was, therefore,



iii
necessary to amend the Loan Agreement seven times to allow for a modification of the
categories of subloans eligible for the highest rate, as well as for a postponement
of deadlines for the commitment and withdrawal of funds.   CIH took a number of
initiatives to accelerate the commitment and withdrawal of loan proceeds, including
the transfer of developer loans to the beneficiaries, i.e., consolidating mortgage
loans of housing units before completion, and the introduction of new lending
products, such as two- or three-storey units, which the owners partially occupy
leaving the rest for rental activities.
4.             CIH's Financial and Technical Capacity.  CIH underwent a complete
reorganization in July 1984. This entailed the decentralization of responsibilities,
a modification in the tasks of the central services, and the redeployment of staff.
It resulted in file transfers to Loan Officers who did not follow up on project
implementation nor receive the requisite computerized data-processing training. In
addition, the consultant in charge of developing a computerized data base for CIH
proposed a system that was too complex. CIH had conside.able difficulty using it
and later had to seek a more viable model. Instead of building up its capacity to
evaluate the technical viability of the projects it finances, CIH rely on the ability
of the architects and engineers hired by the developers.   This permitted CIH's
management to place greater emphasis on financial and commercial aspects.
Prolect Achievements
5.             The project sustained the pace at which low- and moderate-cost housing
construction loans were granted when the Government was rapidly reducing its support.
However, it was less successful in increasing the number of subloans for core units
and other unfinished housing construction and for land development intended for low-
income households.
6.             Between 1984 and 1989, CIH granted about DH 900 million (US$100
million equivalent) in long-term mortgage loans for self-help construction and low-
cost housing. During the same period, the project contributed towards the financing
of 15,479 housing units, for which CIH granted loans totalling DH 894 million. It
supported subprojects whose total real estate value per housing unit ranged from DH
80,000 (US$9,500 equivalent) to DH 150,000 (US$17,700 equivalent).   Clearly, the
project helped finance important social programs.
7.             During project implementation, CIH underwent transformation from a
specialized financial institution into a universal bank.  It now manages individual
and corporate accounts in addition to its housing and tourism loan portfolio.  It
continued,  however,  to benefit  from  special  tax  and  resource  mobilization
arrangements (e.g., Value Added Tax exemption on interest, obligatory bonds
subscribed by commercial banks), which are now being revised under the Proposed
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan approved by the Board in June 1991.
ProleSC Sustalnabilty
8.             It is difficult to evaluate project sustainability at this time.
Developer programs, which were launched in 1988, will be not completed until two
to three years after the initial release of CIH funds.  The total disbursements
made on long-term mortgage loans during the project period were comparable to the



iv
aggregate of short-term loans tc developers. The financial return is even higher
since the selling prices have generally risen beyond expectation, as developers took
advantage of market conditions to increase their margin.   The follow-on Second
Housing Finance Project (Loans 3121-MOR and 3122-MOR), which is now fully committed,
has continued to enhance access to home ownership and improve housing conditions for
low-incozue groups, while rationalizing the structure of the housing finance sector,
further strengthening CIH's operations, and improving the delivery of land and
housing delivery processes.
Findings and Lessons Learned
9.             Project experience illustrates the following:
-    The full value of Bank assistance to a sector or subsector is greatly
enhanced when Bank loan proceeds are made through financial
intermediaries capable of subproject appraisal and supervision.
Such capability frees Bank staf,. from having to scrutinize minute
details, allowing thc--, instead, to focus on broader institutional
and sectorial issues.
-    The process  by which  developer  loars were  transferred to  the
beneficiaries, as soon as the down payment was made, reduced the
developers' loans and financial burden. Developers could then pass
on those savings to beneficiaries in the form of relatively lower
final selling prices.
-    To maintain a satisfactory loan disbursement rate, the Bank must
allow the Borrower to apply more flexible technical and other
eligibility criteria to the refinancing of subprojects, especially
when the project is a pilot scheme.

Project Name: Third Urban Development Project

Loan Amount:   US$60 million
RVP Unit:       EMENA
Country:       Morocco
Sector:        Urban Development
Subsector:     Housing
A. BACKGROUND
2.01           When the project was  idetitified in 1981,  44%  of the Moroccan
population lived in urban areas and this proportlon has increased annually by 5%,
i.e. 500,000 to 600,000 inhabitants, while 20% of the urban housing stock continued
to be composed of slums. According to estimates, 30% of the urban population lived
in informal housing units, of which 35% to 40% had incomes below the poverty level.
Before 1981, the Government's traditional response to the urban housing shortage had
been to encourage public agencies to move into two key areas:
(a)  Rroduction of serviced land mainly for housing accessible to low-
and moderate-income families. The Ministry of Housing and Land-Use
Planning (MHAT) had been in charge of this program, for which a
special fund was established in 1973. This fund was supplied by a
turnover allocation of DH 6 million provided by the national budget
as well as down payments from plot buyers. Some 113,000 plots were
produced, which satisfied only about 10% of the demand and led to the
depletion of the special fund. This was due to the highly subsidized
selling price of the plots and the low repayment of the selling price
by the beneficiaries; and
(b)  Droduction of core housing units targeted at households with incomes
less than USS170 per month.   MHAT has produced about 19,000 such
units since the program started in the early 1970s.  In addition,
16,000 low-cost units were produced during the 1970s by:
(i)    the Regional Development and Construction Agencies (ERACs),
established in 1974 with a total working capital of



-2-
US$5 million and supplied through a Government grant;
(i.i   the General Real Estate Company (CGI), affiliated with the
Financial Intermediary for Deposits and Management (CDG); and
(iii)  other small public agencies.
2.02           The private sector, which had built 90% of the housing supply, was
nonetheless limited to individual, or self-help, construction, mainly aimed at
higher than median-income families.   It was unable to produce serviced land at
affordable prices, due to the difficulties in obtaining permits and financial
support.  At the same time, Government-funded housing programs for lower-income
groups were impaired by wcak MHAT implementation capacity, lengthy admitistrative
procedures, and the escalating cost of housing units produced by the public agencies
in the face of increasing construction standards. Typical ERAC units cost more than
US$16,700 (1982 prices) and became less affordable to the target group.
2.03           During  the  same period,  Morocco's  macro-economic  situation had
worsened, and public funds could no longer fully support the production of low-
income housing. The situation was characterized by:
(a) a fast growing external debt generated by an earlier ambitious
investment program, launched when export prices, in particular for
phosphates, declined and the price for imported oil increased causing
a trade imbalance. In 1982, the external debt service increased from
10.7% of total exports in 1977 to 35%, or US$1.5 billion;
(b)  the adoption, by the Government, of a two-year Stabilization Plan
1978/80 with rigorous credit and import controls, as well as a fairly
rigid program of budgetary expenditure reduction resulting notably
in a decline in investments from 27% of the GNP in 1977 to 12% in
1980;
(c)  endogenous  factors  (e.g.,  drought,  military expenditures,  heavy
increases in subsidies for commodities) and exogenous ones (e.g.,
appreciation of the US Dollar, increase in the price of oil and
interest rates), combined with the effects of the Stabilization Plan.
In 1981, this resulted in a decline in GNP by 1.3%, a cash flow
deficit reaching 14% of GNP, and a balance of payments deficit equal
to US$1.8 billion, or 12.6% of GNP; and
(d) the International Monetary Fund's intervention, in April 1982, within
a proposed assistance agreement involving fiscal measures and
restrictions on expenditures.
2.04           In 1981,  to improve the deteriorating situation of the housing
subsector, particularly regarding the access of the urban poor to affordable housing,
the Government decided to encourage (a) formal private construction through
legislation providing for substantial tax exemptions for private developers and (b)
the Real Estate and Hotel Finance Company (CIH), the country's only institution, at
that time, granting long-term home mortgage loans, to channel financial resources



to low-income groups. The Government, therefore, allocated the bulk of public funds
earmarked for low-cost housing to CIH for mortgage loans with 7Z and 8X interest-
rate subsidies. At the same time, it authorized CIH to mobilize a greater share of
the financial market through the sale of long-term bonds to the other banks. CIH's
total domestic borrowings increased more than threefold from DE 1.8 billion in 1981
co DH 5.8 billion in 1988.
2.05           The Bank had previously participated in the urban sector through the
firnancing of two projects aimed at upgrading squatter areas, developing plots for
low-cost housing construction, improving access to public services, and increasing
institutional capacity. Even though considerable improvement occurr.3d during their
implementation, the two projects fell short of expectation. Inadequate provision
of counterpart funds led to substantial delays in project implementation.
2.06           To bolster Government initiatives in requesting that public agencies
focus on the production of units with lower standards and in fostering the private
sector production, the Bank shifted its sector lending strategy.   It decided to
accommodate ics first housing finance project through the intermediation of the only
financial institution equipped, at that time, to channel resources to low-income
households for housing. In addition, the Bank stressed the need to provide technical
expertise to public and private developers to ensure their adherence to low-cost
design.
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
3.01           The project's main objectives were to:
(a) encourage public and private developers to produce housing programs
accessible to houtseholds whose monthly incomes were below the median
income, estimated at US$330 in 1982; and
(b)  develop CIH's capacity to evaluate low-cost housing programs and
advise developers on the technical and financial aspects of their
subprojects.
3.02           The project consisted of:
(a) a line of credit in the amount of US$59 million to low-income finance
housing according to technical and financial criteria defined during
appraisal; and
(b) a technical assistance program for CIH for which the loan provided
financing in the amount of US$1 million.
3.03           The line of credit was envisaged to finance:
(a) construction loans to developers in the amount of US$56 million for
different types of housing from unfinished two-room units whose



-4-
selling price did not exceed US$5,300 to apartment units priced at
a maximum of US$13,300;
(b) loans for individual construction and plot development for which
selling prices did not exceed US$30 per m2; and
(c) the consolidation of loans granted to housing and plot developers,
during the construction period, into mortgage loans to buyers whose
monthly income did not exceed US$330.
The above prices were revised annually to take inflation into account. The programs
had to comply with technical, economic', and financial2 criteria.
3.04           The technical assistance component was envisaged to finance:
(a) the de'elopment of a land-use model;
(b) a computerized management information system; and
(c) a study on the development of the housing construction industry in
Morocco.
C. PROJECT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATION
4.01           This was the first time the Bank helped finance an urban development
project through a line of credit granted to a financial institution.   This new
approach to project design was justified because:
(a) budgetary constraints obliged the Government to minimize its financing
of low- and moderate-cost housing;
(b) as a financial institution, CIH was well known to the Bank, which
had previously granted it four loans3 for the development of the
tourist industry; and
(c) since its creation, CIH had supported the housing subsector, by
granting long-term home mortgage loans.
4.02           Inasmuch as the Bank considered this project to be a pilot scheme,
it limited the loan amount, at first, to US$45 million. The Bank later agreed to
increase it to US$60 million.

4.03           Project preparation was carried out under the following conditions:
-    Sensitization training of private developers, organized by CIH, made
it possible to identify subprojects that would become eligible
following certain program modifications. The developers recognized
the commercial benefits to be derived from the programs, inasmuch
as they enabled low-income buyers to benefit from mortgage loans
under highly attractive conditions (20 years' maturity with interest-
rate subsidies of 7% or 8%).
Public developers whose budget-allocated resources were no longer
available had no choice but to borrow from CIH.
-   Publicity campaigns,  aimed at individuals and launched by CIH,
encouraged the financing of self-construction through the line of
credit.
-   The Government entrusted CIH with the management of a special account
to finance its important slum upgrading program.
4.04      However, two design flaws contributed to difficulties in disbursing the
line of credit:
-   The technical criteria were too rigorous.   Fully defined sub-
categories did not leave the flexibility required to take into account
"mixed programs" (i.e., those involving both eligible housing with
interest below market rates and longer maturities than for commercial
lending activities and within a range of different sub-categories and
non-eligible housing).
-   The selling price ceiling imposed on eligible housing was too low,
since it overlooked potential savings by beneficiaries, the advantages
applied to other low-cost units (HBM)4 whose criteria, were more
flexible.
D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
5.01           During the first year of effectiveness, the following difficulties
were experienced:
-   The consultant in charge of developing a computerized data base,
intended for the appraisal of developers' programs, got behind
schedule. He also proposed such a complex data bank, which CIH had
considerable ditficulty in using, that in 1985, CIH had to seek the
direct assistance and advice of the software designer on a more

certain criteria favoring low-income households.



-6-
viable option.
The guarantees, notably on land titles, which CIH requested for the
allocation of construction loans, made some eligible programs
impossible to finance. This was the case for the programs under the
public Military Housing Administration (OLM), the private Moroccan
Fishing Company (OMP), and some municipalities.  As for the ERAC
programs, it was necessary to wait for an agreement to be reached
between CIH and the Government agency in charge of land titles.
The reorganization of CIH's services in July 1984 entailed the
decentralization of responsibilities and the modification of the
tasks to be carried out by central services. It resulted in file
transfers to Loan Officers who had not followed up on project
implementation nor received computerized data-processing training.
The interest rates at 14% and 15% applied to medium-term developers'
loans were high compared with the local prime rate ranging from 9%
to 11% during the project period and prevented private developers from
keeping their selling prices below the ceiling set by eligibility
criteria.
The HBM price ceiling authorized by the Government after the loan
effectiveness date increased from DH 130,000 to DH 150,000 per unit,
while the selling price ceiling of an eligible unit under the present
loan was limited to DH 100,000.
5.02           The  following measures were  taken to  improve  the pace  of the
commitment and withdrawal of loan proceeds:
CIH transferred developer loans to the beneficiaries as soon as down
payments were made, eligibility for mortgage loans determined, and
final sales contracts with a binding price established. This process
enabled developers to reduce their outstanding loans and financial
burden, thereby passing on to the beneficiaries a lower final selling
price. The disadvantage is the implication that the beneficiary began
servicing the debt before having access to the housing unit.
CIH finalized new lending products, such as the "R+1, R+2" option,
for two- or three-storey construction, in which the owner occupies
one floor, freeing the rest of the unit for rental activities (e.g.,
other families, stores, workshops).
CIH improved the efficiency of its organizational  structure by
creating two central directorates (production and network) with a
view to expanding loan activity and increasing its resource
mobilization through deposits.
The Bank agreed to let CIH apply more flexible technical criteria
and finance such subprojects as commercial shops and other artisanal
activities.



Seven amendments to the Loan Agreement and two amendments to the
Guarantee Agreement also permitted an increase in loan disbursement
rates, a modification of the categories of subloans eligible for the
highest rate, and a postponement of deadlines for the commitment and
withdrawal of furnds.   Modifications to important sections of the
initial Agreements did not, however, fundamentally alter the project's
main objectives.
E. FROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS
6.01           The project maintained the pace at which low- and moderate-cost
housing construction loans were being granted in the face of the severe budgetary
cutbacks. Between 1984 and 1989, CIH granted about DH 900 million (US$100 million
equivalent) long-term mortgage loans for self-help construction and low-cost housing.
During that same period, the project contributed towards the financing of 15,479
housing units, for which CIH granted loans totalling DH 894 million to households
with monthly incomes below the median income varying from DH 2,000 or US$330 in
1982 to DH 3,000 or US$350 in 1989. It supported subprojects whose total real estate
value per housing uniit ranged from DH 80,000 (US$9,500 equivalent) to DH 150,000
(US$17,700 equivalent) depending on the reference year. Disbursements were made on
the basis of developer prefinancing (OPF) releases. Clearly, this project has helped
finance important social programs, even though in 1986, the interest-rate subsidies
for long-term mortgage loans decreased from 7% and 8% to 4% and 5%, making units less
affordable to low- and moderate income households. Unfortunately, the project did
not succeed in increasing the number of subloans for core units and other unfinished
housing construction and land development intended for households whose monthly
income was US$200 (30th percentile or less in 1982).
6.02           The  project  also  helped  CIH  improve  its  financial  position
significantly.   Tht following figures,  extracted from CIH's audited financial
statements, show that, by increasing its income and assets three to four times during
project implementation, CIH has become one of the strongest banks in Morocco.

Table 4 of Part III of this report indicates that CIH financial performance
indicators have been in accordance with the projected figures in the Staff Appraisal
Report.
6.04           The technical assistance component improved CIH's capability to assess
the technical viability of subprojects. It included the computerization of CIH's
lending program, staff training, and the development of a sound data base related
to local market and construction costs. Technical assistance was also instrumental
in helping CIH transform from a specialized financial institution into a universal
bank by enabling it to manage individual and corporate accounts in addition to its
housing and tourism loan portfolios. On December 31, 1989, through its 25 agencies,
CIH handled 17,000 deposit accounts totalling DH 625 million.  The value of its
outstanding loan portfolio increased from DH 3 billion at the end of 1983 to over
DH 7.5 billion at the end of 1989.
F. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
7.01           It is difficult to evaluate project sustainability during the year
following the closing date. Developer programs, which were launched in 1988, are
being completed within two to three years following the first release of the funds.



However, the total disbursement made on eligible long-term mortgage loans during the
project period was comparable to the aggregate of short-term loans to developers.
The financial return on these programs is even higher since the selling prices have
generally risen beyond expectatiorn, as developers take advantage of market conditions
to increase their margin (see para. 6, Part III).
7.02           During the course of project implementation, CIH granted eligible
long-term loans for which equivalent amounts were financed from the Bank loan (para.
6.01). Partial cancellations on some subproiects have been compensated by increases
in other subprojects. It was, therefore, necessary to show that CIH had used Bank
funds in accordance with the legal criteria (Annex 1).   In effect, developers
programs financed under the Bank loan have since been transformed into a viable
long-term mortgage loan program benefitting less than median-income groups.
Sustainability can be attested by the overall good performance of CIH's mortgage
loan portfolio, in which arrears are less than 2X.
G. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01           The Bank's main strength was its flexibility in adapting the changes
in the loan agreement which facilitated disbursements of the loan proceeds.  The
project showed that lines of credit to specialized financial intermediaries for
housing could be economically justified when the Bank loan is made to a creditworthy
institution.
8.02           The Bank's main shortcoming was the inflexible way in which it
initially imposed subloan eligibility criteria. This issue was, however, addressed
in preparing, appraising, and negotiating a second housing loan to CIH under the
Second Housing Finance Project (Loan 3122-MOR).
8.03           At the time of appraisal, the project faced two major obstacles.
First, CIH was the only financial institution that could grant long-term loans to
the housing subsector.   It later bore the full financial burden, except for the
foreign exchange risk, incurred through implementing a pilot project in which
subloans were for relatively small amounts and only marginally profitable. Second,
CIH specialized in financing Government-sponsored programs in housing and tourism
development.  Therefore, CIH's portfolio gave the appearance that it was enhanced
by hotel loans and Government transfers to subsidize hotel construction and low-
income housing. It also gave the impression that the Government favored CIH over
the other financial institutions when, in fact, chronic Government arrears in
payments to CIH added significantly to CIH's financial burden. It was CIH, rather
than the financial sector, that was disadvantaged. To mitigate this situation, the
Bank has supported the Government's recent decision to authorize the entire banking
system to grant long-term loans for home mortgages and to allow all financial
institutions to compete for social housing programs.

H. BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
9.01           The Borrower fully complied with defined project objectives.  All
required contracts, notably those with developers, were organized under the auspices
of CIH's Commercial Department. This expedited the collection of all data necessary
for developing a pipeline of subprojects.
9.02           Project implementation took longer than expected because CIH needed
to:
(a) adapt to new types of markets and clients (i.e., low-income
households) while at the same time maintaining its traditional
activities with higher-income customers;
(b) mobilize part of its staff to engage in special operations on behalf
of the Government, notably the relocation of slum dwellers; and
(c) redeploy its staff as a result of a new organization.
1. RELATIONS ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE PROJECT
10.01          The close collaboration between CIH and the Bank, which had already
been fruitful in earlier projects, was maintained throughout.   This facilitated
amending the Loan Agreement, without lengthy discussions as there was complete
mutual understanding of project implementation needs and Bank requirements.
10.02          Project-related issues to which CIH was not a party (e.g., land
titles, difficulties encountered by public developers) were, nonetheless addressed
through CIH's efforts. The sensitizing of public authorities regarding the urban
development sector has been enhanced in the follow-on Second Housing Finance Project.
It focuses on the improvement of documentation procedures such as urban development
plans and the issuance of development and construction permits.
10.03          CIH's staff have cooperated fully with Bank missions by providing
access to the company's financial statements. The Borrower also met all. required
deadlines for the submission of the audit reports and for compliance with financial
covenants, as set forth in the Loan Agreement.
J. CONSULTANT SERVICES
11.01          The consultants accomplished their tasks to the satisfaction of the
Borrower and the Bank. The contracts of three consulting firms were extended beyond
project  completion.    Their help  in terms  of establishing  computerized data
processing, as well as their training of personnel in banking activities and
computerized models, contributed measurably to CIH's institutional development.



- 11 -
K. DOCUMENTATION AND-DATA PERTINING TO THE PROJECT
12.01          The legal stipulations, which were agreed upon, did not pose any
particular difficulties, aside from the application of certain eligibility criteria,
which these documents merely reflected. It was possible, however, to modify criteria
during the course of implementation whenever certain details needed clarification.
It is noteworthy that the precision with which financial ratios were formulated in
the legal documents provided invaluable assistance in subsequent annual reviews of
audited financial statements.  The appraisal report was also a clear and concise
document. It facilitated the exchange of opinions between the Bank and the Borrower
as differences in interpretation never occurred.

PROJECT COMPLETlON REPORT
PART II: PROJET REIEW F_ROM HE BORROWR'S PERSPEllVI
COMMENTS SUBMITrED BY THE BORROWER
A study by the Government of Morocco estim'.ted the housing deficit
in 1980 at 700,000 units, and additional needs of new households at 90,000 units
a year.
Given Fhe scope of this problem, the public authorities made special
arrangements in successive investment codes, for low-cost housing, specifically
by revising norms for this category of housing and raising the incomes of those
eligible for it.
These measures had a positive impact on the sector, reflected in a
marked recovery of investment in housing production by both public and private
developers.
However, much of the resulting supply of housing was of medium
quality, intended for medium- and higher-income households, the proportion of
low-income housing remaining small.
This situation was aggravated by the ever-increasing disparity
between real incomes that remained virtually stagnant for a number of years and
the rising cost of housing as a result of increases in land prices and
construction costs.
Incentives were therefore introduced to encourage the production of
housing to satisfy the demand from low-income households (particularly by public
sector developers), the aims being to replace slums and promote rural housing in
order to stabilize, among other things, the rural population.
A study program focussing on these objectives was therefore prepared;
it recommended appropriate financial resources together with logistical support
to provide the necessary technical assistance in the area of planning and
execution of large-scale projects.
In accordance with the desire expressed by the public authorities and
in light of the specific features of the proposed action plan, CIH took all the
necessary steps to ensure the success of this program.
CIH's actions took three main forms:
institutional reform through an internal reorganization designed to
enhance its management of lending activities;



- 14 -
simplification of loan appraisal and approval procedures;
creation of new products better adapted to socioeconomic realities.
IBRD has made a significant contribution in this area, in terms of
both finance and technical assistance.
1.    AIM OF LOAN 2245-MOR
The credit line provided under World Bank Loan 2245-MOR was the first
direct assistance from IBRD to CIH and was intended to refinance loans in the
general area of the production of low-cost housing.
Eligibility for refinancing was extended to any project meeting
technical criteria in the area of plot and land development and individual or
group construction, along with acquisition of housing for personal occupation.
The line of credit also provided technical assistance to strengthen
CIH's capacity in the area of evaluating housing projects, specifically as
regards the optimal utilization of computerization.
The contract was signed on April 11, 1983, the loan amount being
US$60 million, allocated as follows:
-    US$56 million for refinancing of loans made to public and/or private
companies for constructing low-cost housing for sale;
US$3 million for refinancing loans to companies for plot development
and to low-income households for individual construction;
-    -US$560,000 of technical assistance to finance consulting services
and equipment.
The Bank's share in the refinancing of amounts disbursed by CIH was
50% for housing construction by developers and 35% for all loans made for plot
development and individual construction. As regards technical assi. :ance, the
Bank's share was 100% of foreign exchange costs and 75% of local currency costs.
The following criteria were adopted for the disbursement of loan
proceeds:
-     the land price was not to exceed DH 180/m2
-     the average housing unit area was not to exceed 100 m2
-     the price of a core unit was DH 32,000
-     the price of a one-story partially finished dwelling was DH 48,000
-     the price of a one- to two-story dwelling (R+l, R+2) was D1 62,000



- 15 -
-    the price of a walk-up apartment was DH 80,000
-    monthly income was not to exceed DH 2,000.
These eligibility conditions, given the constraints deriving from the
real cost of housing in Morocco, were successively revised to take account of
market realities.   Hence the maximum real estate value (VIT)5 of housing
eligible for financing under Loan 2245-MOR increased as follows:
YEAR                          AMOUNT IN DIRHAMS
1983                              80,000
1984                              95,000
1985                             115,000
1986                             130,000
1987                             140,000
1988                             150,000
II.    WITH DRAWALS
As the following table indicates, disbursement of the line of credit
extended over a very long period of eight years, as against the much more normal
two or three years. The first disbursement did not occur until a year after the
loan was signed.

1/    The US$446,650 represents payment of the front-end fee.
According to Moroccan practice, the VIT is defined as the estimated construction cost of the housing
unit pLus a conventional amount for the cost of the land (DH 20,000 or USS2,300 except for the low-
cost units, which is DH 10,000)



- 16 -
The table indicates that during the first four years of loan
effectiveness less than 20% of the loan amount was disbursed, and that only after
1987 did operations really get under way, following the various adjustments made
to the costs of eligible housing.

Although  Loan  2245-MOR  provided  the  fairly  large  sum  of  US$60
million,  it represented a small proportion,  averaging less than 2%,  of the total
funds mobilized by CIH during the loan disbursement period 1983-1990; this was
a result of the mismatch between eligibility criteria and housing market
realities.
The loan proceeds represented less than 7% of the disbursements for
housing made by CIH during the period in question.
B.      Operations  Financed
During the period 1983-1990 CIH approved 120,527 housing loan
operations for a total amount of DH 13,060 million, broken down as follows:

Ill.   ASESSMENT OF THE FIFTH IBRD CREDIT LINE
Although positive in a number of respects, this credit line had
certain disadvantages which for the most part were overcome by the adjustments
made during its utilization.
A.    Advantages of Loan 2245-MOR
The positive aspects were the interest rate, term and disbursement
modalities.
1.          As a development institution, the World Bank was able to offer an
advantageous interest rate, which, starting out at 10.97% in 1983, had declined
to 7.70% by 1990.  This remark must, however, be qualified by one important
consideration, namely the amortization adjustment factor, which was only
favorable to CIH for the period between May 15, 1984 and May 15, 1985. Except
for this relatively short period, the ratio was greater than one, thereby
increasing Morocco's payments of interest and prin^ipal and making the credit
line more expensive. The currency pooling system, whose initial purpose was to
smooth out fluctuations in exchange rates, therefore had the opposite effect and
increased the cost of borrowing.  Nonetheless, the real cost of the loan was
still advantageous compared to interest rates on the local and international
capital markets.
2.          The second advantage lay in the procedure for withdrawing funds,
which did not require documents substantiating expenses made; these would have
been difficult to provide, especially as regards individual construction.
This documentation in fact consists of a works progress report
prepared by CIH technical services  inspectors.   In addition,  computerized
information on programs financed, showing the main features of the housing built,

is permanently available. For any withdray-al of funds the following documents,
certified and duly signed by an authorized CIH representative, are required:
-     a disbursement application in two copies
a statement of expenditures in two copies
-     a form D in two copies.
3.          The third advantage of this credit line was its term of 17 years.
Given that CIH offers mortgage loans for periods from 15 to 25 years,
particularly for HBM loans, the credit line enabled CIH to benefit from
relatively stable resources for 17 years. However, it should be pointed out that
this term is shorter than other Bank credit lines to CIH (about 20 years). It
would therefore be desirable to align repayments of this credit line with
repayments to CIH of its low-cost hous.ng loans.
4.          Loan 2245-MOR, the first line of credit for housing finance, enhanced
the information on the sector and led to a more realistic assessment of housing
costs in Morocco, thereby enabling the necessary adjustments to be made to future
projects in order to take account of the real housing needs of Morocco's
population.
We should certainly note that the loan directly benefited the poorest
groups by bringing decent, healthy housing within their reach.
B.   Drawbacks of Loan 2245-MO
The scope of the advantages cited above was reduced by difficulties
encountered during the disbursement phase, stemming in our view from the fact
that this was IBRD's first operation in housing finance sector.
The difficulty lay in the Bank's underestimate of the real cost of
low-cost housing as compared to the norms laid down by the Moroccan authorities
well before the conclusion of the credit line. It should be noted that the VIT
of a low-cost unit may reach DH 150,000. It was therefore difficult to produce
housing meeting IBRD's criteria, despite the efforts made by the Moroccan
authorities to reduce costs in this category by making land available at symbolic
prices to public developers.
As a result, the credit line had a number of drawbacks which were
only overcome by the desire of both parties to make the project a success:
(1)   The principal difficulty related to eligibility criteria.   The
technical   criteria,    establishing   four   strictly   defined
subcategories, were insufficiently flexible for this kind of
financing.
(2)   The selling price ceilings for eligible housing were too low despite
annual revision of the VIT, so that the true cost of housing in
Morocco was not taken into account. The virtual absence of housing
meeting ISRD's criteria was reflected in the low level of



- 19 -
disbursements during the first four years of the project, as the
table of annual disbursements indicates.
(3)   This low level of disbursements led to CIH paying a significant
commitment charge.
Two comments should be made in this respect:
(a)   The commitment charge paid amounted to $2,016,057.43,  or
DH 18,061,276.93.   This considerable sum resulted from the
slow rate of disbursements, which itself derived from the
rigidity of the crtteria governing housing eligible for
financing.   The commitment charge was also significant in
relative terms, amounting to 3.36% of the loan amount, thereby
increasing the cost of the credit line.
(b)   The second comment under this heading relates to the rate of
the commitment charge, namely 0.75%.  This relatively high
figure would be tolerable for a loan that did not take more
than two years to disburse.   Because of the difficulties
encountered in the utilization of this credit line,
disbursements extended over eight years and therefore the
financial burden deriving from the commitment charge was very
heavy as compared to other IBRD financing.
(4)   It should be noted that some prefinancing (OPF) programs were not
totally disbursed on completion of the credit line and are
automatically excluded from the scope of the next credit line. We
hope that IBRD will agree to finance all the OPF programs straddling
the two lines; in the knowledge that on the closure of the earlier
line these were not all completely disbursed.
(5)   The nonexistence save for a few exceptions of the unfinished housing
technique in Morocco contributed to the difficulties in the
utilization of this  component.    In practice,  the concept  of
unfinished housing is not viable in Morocco given the total absence
of low-cost standard products (doors, windows, etc.) and low incomes
which do not permit beneficiaries to complete work on the housing
acquired.
As a result, the rare programs of unfinished housing undertaken have
resulted in total incompatibility of fa9ades, which undermines the policy of
ensuring that this category of housing has an architectural flavor that matches
the features of the surrolnding environment.

IV.   RELATION   TH IBRD
Relations with IBRD were marked by trust and cordiality. The desire
of both parties to make the project a success required frequent contacts always
characterized by openness and mutuil understanding. Mention should be made here
of the various Bank missions to CIH to monitor and analyze problems that arose
and for which solutions were invariably found.   The various amendments and
agreements to revise both eligibility criteria and the project's closing date are
also evidence of this cooperative spirit.
However, as a result of inadequate definitions of the construction
made in Morocco, the above adjustments have been delayed too long, and CIH has
borne a heavy financial burden to finance social housing.

4. Project Implementation (continued)
B.  Covenanst:        Section 4.04 (a) of the Loan Agreement - (1) must be less
than (3)
Section 4.05 (a) of the Loan Agreement - (2) must remain
at least 1 to 1
C. ReMarks:
The effective audited performance indicators are below appraisal
expectations. The main reason is the increase in the cost of long-term debt (11%
on average compared with 7.5%), since (i) the Government cancelled its DH 40
million line of credit to CIH at 6.5% interest rate; (ii) the interest rates on
bonds and notes issued by CIH averaged 12,5% on 1985/87 from 10.5% on 1981/82,
and (iii) the interest rates on loans did not change during the 1984/87 period.
Nonetheless, CIH has maintained an average spread of more than 3% and has paid
at minimum 10% annually on the outstanding equity to its shareholders.

5.    Project Costs and Financing (continued)
B.    Project Financng  (continued)
Remarks:  (i)    The effective cost of the Project in local currency is
almost equal to what was expected in the Appraisal Report
- DH 909 million instead of 921 million;
(ii)    Due to the 40Z increase of the foreign exchange rate
during the life of the Project, the effective cost in
foreign currency is US$ 107 million instead of US$153
million as projected during the appraisal;
(iii)    To take into account the Amendments of the Loan Agreewent
dated on April 5, 1984 and October 8, 1986, the Bank's
share of expenditures increased from 39% to 55% as
projected during appraisal;
(iv)    CIH has been able to mobilize more internal sources than
expected; therefore, only 10% of the expenditures have
been financed by local borrowings.
