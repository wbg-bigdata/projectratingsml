1. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Setting
1.01      Fiji is a small, sparsely populated country comprising about
300 islands in the South Pacific. Most of the islands are uninhabited and 90%
of its population of 580,000 resides in the two main islands -- Viti Levu and
Vanua Levu. Fiji's economic development during the last decade has been impres-
sive with a real GNP growth rate of about 7% per year, reaching a per capita
GNP level of about US$1,150 in 1976. Sugar and tourism are the mainstays of
its economy. The country has a good natural and human resource base, political
stability and capacity to mobilize additional resources needed for sustained
growth. The electricity sector is fairly developed, per capita consumption
being about 500 kWh. It relies on a number of isolated diesel power stations.
There are no major interconnections between them yet. The main power market
is on Viti Levu island with only tiny facilities on Vanua Levu. The electri-
city sector serves predominantly commercial, small industrial (tourism) and
domestic customers with some limited supplies into rural areas branching out
from main generation centers.
Energy Resources and Government Policy
1.02      Fiji has no known indigenous sources of commercial energy other
than its hydroelectric potential. It is almost entirely dependent on imported
petroleum for its needs. At present, the largest single category of petroleum
fuel is industrial diesel oil used to generate electricity. Electricity gen-
eration in 1976 accounted for 28% of total net imports at an annual cost to
Fiji of about F$10 million.
1.03      In 1973 the Fiji Government set up an Alternative Fuels Technical
Committee to deal with the situation caused by rapid escalation in oil prices.
The Committee advised adoption of a strategy involving:
(a) utilization of domestic rather than imported energy resources;
(b) ensuring availability of cheap power to industry; and
(c) rationalization of energy consumption.
It also advocated extension of rural electrification.
1.04      These principles have been incorporated in the Government's energy
policy. Government has resolved as a matter of high priority to commence
development of Fiji's hydroelectric potential by the 1980's and to achieve a
higher degree of integration of its presently isolated power systems.
1.05      Government's objective is to ensure efficient use of the water
resources of Fiji for multiple uses of domestic water supply, irrigation,
electricity generation, flood control, fish production and recreation.
Investigations were therefore directed to take into account such joint uses.
Studies carried out at the potential sites have, however, indicated priority



- 2 -
of development for primarily electricity generation projects. Those which
involve multiple purpose development are too large for implementation in the
near future.
Hydroelectric Resources
1.06      It has long been recognized that substantial water power potential
exists in the tNandrau plateau of Fiji's Viti Levu Island, an area of about
600 sq km lying at an average altitude of 1,000 m and subject to annual
rcinfall varyirng from 2,700 mm to 4,000 mm. It is a virtually uninhabited
area with rain forests forming a dense ground cover.  Investigations were
limited to hydrological observations and regional geological mapping until
1972 when it waLs established that practical schemes for hydroelectric genera-
tion could be developed. ENEX of New Zealand was appointed as consulting
engineer to investigate these sites in detail, carry out a long-term power
system study and recommend a development program. A New Zealand Government
grant assisted in financing the study from 1972-75. Topographical maps of
catchment areas, dam sites, and reservoirs were prepared; river flows were
estimated and geological explorations carried out at the most promising sites
to determine their engineering characteristics and priorities for development.
1.07      These studies of hydroelectric resources are now being continued
by FEA's new consultants, Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners (Gibb) of Australia.
The schemes available for immediate development and other promising future
sites revealed through the studies of hydroelectric potential are listed in
Table 1.1. The total water power potential is estimated at about 2,000 GWh
annually/i. Of this, Gibb considers that about 80% could be economically
developed by the end of the century making it unnecessary for Fiji to resort
to any further increase in its diesel generating capacity in Viti Levu until
then.  Diesel generation would remain the main source of electricity supply
on the other islands and remote areas of Viti Levu which are beyond economical
reach of grid supplies.
The Electricity Sector
1.08      Struciture of the electricity supply industry and existing facilities.
At present, electricity is produced and distributed by two public undertakings,
the Suva City Council's (SCC's) Electricity Department (SCCED) and the Fiji
Electricity Authority (FEA). There are also a small number of privately
owned generating plants.
1.(9      Suva City Council system.  Electricity supply was introduced in
Fi'ji by SCCED at the city power station in 1920 with DC supply from a 63 kW
generating set. The first AC generating set was installed in 1939. The
capacity of the station now is about 13.5 MW.
1.10      In 1969, SCCED commenced construction of a new power station at
Kinoya, on the outskirts of Suva. Kinoya now has a total generating capacity
of 39.1 MW. Details of SCCED's generating capacity are given in Table 1.2.
/1 In comparison, the total electricity production in Viti Levu in 1976 was
250 GWh.



- 3 -
1.11      SCCED supplies a concentrated urban market with about 22,300
customers and presently accounts for about two-thirds of the island's public
power supply.
1.12      Fiji Electricity Authority system.  FEA was established in 1966 by
an Act, which gives it the authority and power to be the sole electricity
supply entity in Fiji (paras 2.01 and 2.02). It has made remarkable progress
since then in acquiring Government and privately owned generating plants as
necessary and extending electricity supply into hitherto undeveloped and rural
areas. These extensions in turn have contributed substantially to the subsequent
rapid expansion of the tourist industry, now a mainstay of Fiji's economy.
1.13      FEA commenced operation with a nucleus of staff transferred from
the Public Works Department. FEA's installations in 1966 comprised only the
Lautoka power station, with an area of supply covering Lautoka and Ba. The
Authority then took over and expanded three privately owned power stations in
Singatoka, Nandi and Lambasa (Vanua Levu island), and established some new
stations. Distribution and transmission systems were expanded in all areas.
A major centralized power station was commissioned at Vunda in 1977. The
Asian Development Bank (ADB) assisted in its financing.
1.14      At this time, FEA has about 12,800 consumers and seven power
stations. Details of the stations are given in Table 1.2. FEA now provides
one-third of the total public supply, distributing electricity at 33 kV,
11 kV and 440/230 V. Most FEA stations are being interconnected at 33 kV to
supply an area about 100 km long stretching from Nandi to Tavua and from the
sea to the foothills of the mountains. By 1980, the entire western area of
Viti Levu is expected to be interconnected.
1.15      Privately owned systems.  Two major consumers of electricity which
are not dependent on public supply are the Emperor Gold Mines (EGM) and the
Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC). EGM draws its supply from its subsidiary
electric supply company, Tavua Power Limited, which also supplies limited
surpluses to FEA for distribution to its consumers in Tavua/Vatukoula District.
1.16      The Tavua Power Company operates an old 10.5 MW diesel power station
at Vatukoula which supplies the gold mine, company houses and a sawmill. Half
of the generating capacity has already operated over 100,000 hours, some even
longer. It generates about 40 GWh annually.
1.17      FSC has plant installations aggregating 11.8 MW at four separate
mills located at Lautoka, Ba, Rakiraki, and Lambassa. They are operated
mainly on cane waste (bagasse) with back-pressure steam turbines and
some diesel generation to meet out of season requirements. The total annual
generation is about 30 GWh.
1.18      Status of supply and access to service.  In most areas of the
country which have been electrified, supply is presently adequate. Except in
the SCCED area, reliability of supply is satisfactory and losses are reason-
able (about 9%). About 50% of the population has access to electricity. The
cost of electricity is high, reflecting the high cost of imported fuel (para
5.02). The impact of the high cost of electricity is discernible everywhere.
Demand growth is suppressed and there is little waste.



- 4 -
1.19      Rural electrification.   Rural electrification (RE) is being
undertaken by FEA and by the Public Works Department (PWD) of the Ministry of
Communications, Works and Tourism. SCCED's involvement in RE is negligible
because its supply is basically confined to the area of Suva City and environs.
1.20      FEA defines RE as providing electricity to customers outside its
established area of supply, normally through extensions from its grid. The
prospective community or customer has to deposit initially 40% of the esti-
mated capital cost of the connection which FEA retains for five years. At
the same time the customer has to guarantee that he will use during the first
five years at least 50% of the deposit in electricity consumption charged at
FEA's tariffs, in which case he gets his deposit refunded. If he uses less,
his deposit is forfeited. In the past FEA's average annual connection rate
of rural customers has been about 350.
1.21      In its RE program, PWD tries to electrify rural dwellings in
very remote areas where connections would be entirely unprofitable for FEA.
Supply is provided through isolated diesel generating sets. Prospective
customers have to provide one-sixth of the estimated capital cost on a
nonrefundable basis whereas the Government contributes the balance as a
grant. The operating charge to the customer consists of an annual fee of
F$100 per dwelling for maintenance plus the actual cost of fuel. After a
slow start in 1974/75, PWD's program has recently gained some momentum and
so far about 500 dwellings have been electrified. Surveys are continuously
being undertaken to determine additional rural electrification requirements.
1.22      Sector problems.  Lack of skilled personnel to construct and
operate the power supply systems efficiently is a constraint well recognized
by the authorities.  Expatriates are required and are employed at all key
levtels.  FEA has recently evolved a comprehensive training program of Fijian
technicians to meset the country's requirements on a long-term basis (paras.
2.09-2.12).  Despite its much longer history, the SCCED has not developed any
training program of its own and now has a serious problem in maintenance and
operation of its power stations.  This has, inter alia, led to a deterioration
in ithe reliability of power supply in Suva. Generating capacity installed is
adequate to easi:Ly meet the maximum demand of 23 MW, but power cuts have
already become a persistent feature and led to strong public complaints.
1.23      Managemaent of SCCED has been in a poor state for some time.  A
Government-appointed inquiry committee recently reported serious irregular-
ities in SCCED's management and evidence of unwarranted interference by its
councillors in the working of SCCED. The Suva City Council was dissolved by the
Government in October 1977. Its functions have been transferred temporarily
to a council of Administrators with the Chief Administrtor exercising the
functions of Mayor. Fiji cannot afford to continue any longer with a
fragmented and poorly managed power sector. It urgently needs a single
institutional framework through which it can implement a rational and effi-
cient power supply operation. Divided, the operations will be too small to
attract the finance needed to develop the Monasava-Wailoa project which is
too large for FEA and SCCED markets in isolation but is appropriate when they
are combined and an integrated system is created. Continued fragmented



- 5 -
operation will also not attract the experienced management urgently needed
both to implement sound schemes of expansion of supply and to rapidly train
Fijian personnel to reduce costs of operation. FEA was in fact set up to
discharge this national objective. It has made several efforts in the past
to take over SCCED but these were thwarted mainly by differences on the level
of compensation demanded by SCC. SCC has also been diverting funds from its
relatively more lucrative electricity operations to finance other activities
(para. 5.03). These funds should properly be utilized to build up a finan-
cially viable national public electricity supply entity for the whole of Fiji.
1.24      Both in the context of the deterioration in the standard of manage-
ment of SCCED and the fact that Fiji is now embarking on a long-term program
of expansion of hydroelectric generation, which needs a national perspective,
the Bank and Fiji Authorities agreed that takeover of SCCED by FEA was essen-
tial. As the Project is intended primarily to replace imported fuel as early
as possible, the operation of all diesel stations (mostly operated by SCCED)
would have to be fully integrated with the operation of the new hydroelectric
source. Further, associated transmission is being designed on the assumption
that the diesel power stations will be operated to provide emergency coordi-
nation in actual system operation. It would not be possible to provide for
these in any reliable manner if SCCED continued to operate the eastern power
system.
1.25      Before negotiations of the proposed Loan, FEA took the following
steps to bring SCCED under its control (Letters of April 7, 1978 from the
Chief Administrator, Suva, to the General Manager FEA, and of April 14,
1978 from the General Manager FEA to the Chief Administrator, Suva):
(a) in accordance with the requirements of the FEA Act, a six months
notice of intention to take over assets operated by SCCED was
issued on January 25, 1978 with the approval of the Cabinet; and
(b) to facilitate the final takeover after the expiry of the period of
notice (July 25, 1978), FEA assumed limited responsibility for
management of SCCED with effect from April 17, 1978 through exchange
of letters between FEA and the Chief Administrator of SCC. Under
this arrangement, SCCED's accounts have been separated from the
general accounts of SCC. The revenues from sales of electricity
accruing after January 25, 1978 (date of takeover notice) will be
used only for purposes of the power sector.
The above-mentioned letter of April 7, 1978 assured satisfactory financial
management of SCCED operations.
1.26      Completion of the acquisition process requires the approval of the
Supreme Court under the constitutional provisions applicable to compulsory
acquisition of property. FEA has moved the Supreme Court for such an approval.
In order to make sure that this process is completed without complications
later on, formal acquisition (through approval by a court order) has been
made a condition of effectiveness of the Loan.



-6-
1.27      The question of compensation payable by FEA to the SCC continues to
be a serious issue, though it does not restrain legal arrangements for merger
of FEA and SCCEI). -Under the applicable legislation, compensation has to be
agreed by the parties concerned within thirty days of the Court order approving
the takeover (para. 1.26), otherwise the Court will determine the amount of
compensation. The problem has been complicated by the fact that SCC does not
yet: have title to some land compulsorily acquired in 1964 and on which
litigation now rests in the Privy Council. The question has been under
active discussion between the Chief Administrator, Suva, and FEA. FEA
expects to reach an agreement shortly on terms acceptable to it.  To avoid
endlangering FEA's financial viability, the Government has agreed during
negotiations to ensure, in particular by arranging for FEA's tariffs to be
set at a sufficient level, that FEA has available at all times sufficient
funds for proper functioning of its business and for fulfilling all its
financial obligations when they become due.
1.28      Unification of prevailing electricity tariffs is another important
sector problem. In the past SCCED, with the advantage of a limited supply
area and with a larger scale of operations has been able to maintain tariff
levels substantially (about 30%) below those of FEA. Even if it remained
independent, SCCED would not be able to do so in the future particularly if
it expands its supply based on its own diesel/thermal generation. In fact, a
public notice of a 20% tariff increase effective May 1, 1978 has been issued by the
Chief Administrator.
1.29      Government and FEA have been advised by the Bank that the SCCED
tariff should be brought to the level of FEA's tariffs which approximate the
long-run marginal cost of supply for the whole island. This would provide
the unified power sector, under FEA management, with funds urgently needed to
build a viable national power system whose future costs of supply would benefit
from the stabilizing effect of a hydro system. The Government and FEA have
accepted this point of view and FEA has announced on April 12, 1978 that a
unified tariff resulting in average revenues not less than FEA's present
tariff would yield will be introduced nationwide as of August 1, 1978.

2. THE BORROWER
Legislative Background
2.01      The Borrower, FEA, was established as a statutory body operating
under the Electricity Act, Chapter 157, and reports to the Ministry for
Communications, Works and Tourism. It was incorporated in 1966 as a corporate
body with sole responsibility for electricity supply in Fiji, which it can
discharge either by setting up and operating its own installations or through
licenses issued by it.  Its main functions are to promote and encourage
generations of electricity with a view to assist economic development of Fiji
and secure supply of electricity at reasonable prices.
2.02      The Act ensures FEA's autonomy in all matters, including
determination of its tariffs, raising financial resources for its development,
and employment of staff.  FEA has the power to acquire licensee's installa-
tions under procedures laid down in the Act. Licensees' tariffs require
FEA's approval. FEA initially had almost unlimited powers to acquire any
property thought necessary for its purposes but this power has been limited
after the 1970 Constitution. While this has not affected FEA's operations
adversely so far (mainly because of FEA's reasonable approach to the question
of compensation which is normally the main problem), it is important to note
this potential impediment to speedy implementation of FEA's development
program particularly in regard to acquisition of lands for construction of a
reservoir for the Project and establishing rights of way for its main trans-
mission lines (para. 4.35).
The Authority
2.03      The Authority consists of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman, and five
members (of whom not more than three can be public officers) all of whom are
appointed by the Minister of Communications, Works and Tourism (the Ministry).
The Minister for Agriculture presently functions as the Chairman. The
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry and a Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of
Finance are the official members. All others are drawn from the private
sector. The Chairman and members of the Authority work on a part-time basis.
This structure is appropriate in the Fiji situation. The Authority meets
regularly and functions satisfactorily. The Chairman provides the necessary
leadership and takes an active interest in the affairs of FEA.
2.04      The day-to-day management and the administrative and financial
duties of FEA are actually performed by staff appointed by the FEA and headed
by a general manager. The present incumbent is an experienced manager, moti-
vated in the objectives of institutional development, and dynamic. He has
been appointed for three years, commencing 1976. FEA's efficiency, drive
and the respect it now commands in the country are due in large part to his
abilities. However, at the time of appraisal there have been a few basic
weaknesses in the administrative arrangements.



The most important was that the general manager had no statutory or executive
basis for the extensive authority he actually wields. The other weakness,
which is only a potential source of difficulty was that the Chairman could
designate any person (including one outside FEA) to exercise his powers which
presently include administrative control of all staff (including the general
manager). It was agreed by FEA and the Government, that this power of dele-
gation should be restricted to another member of the Authority.
2.05      In discussions the Government has indicated its willingness to
accord statutory recognition to the position of the general manager and also
to define his functions. This is expected to be done within about one year
in the context of a planned comprehensive amendment of FEA's Act which would
also include other items such as specific proposals for strengthening FEA's
financial basis and improvements in the principles of tariff setting. It was
important, however, that, as a first priority, the general manager's position
as top executing official of FEA should be clarified and as an interim arrange-
ment the Chairman delegated in writing the administrative powers he has to the
general manager.
Organization and Management
2.06      FEA at present has a staff of about 500 divided into 4 main depart-
menits headed by the chief engineer., the training director, the financial
controller and the secretary. The organization is rather large for its
present functions but nevertheless it is well administered.  This is due
to tsfforts of a small number of dedicated professional engineers and adminis-
traltors at or near the top level rather than because of an appropriately
trained and adequate, broad-based, supporting organization.
2.07      The professional engineers and administrators are mostly expatriates
or itormer expatriates turned Fiji citizens. Subprofessional staff, who
operate, maintain and administer the electricity system under the close
direction of profEessional staff are all Fijians whose recruitment, training
and advancement have until recently been somewhat haphazard. There were no
qua;Lifications for recruitment of apprentices, on-the-job training or academic
improvement. A1L this is now changing rapidly as FEA has accorded high
priority to training (paras. 2.09-2.12).
2.08      Both FEA's organizational structure and its training program have
been planned in anticipation of immediate takeover of SCCED (paras. 1.24 and
1.25).  The eventual organizational structure, after takeover, is shown in
Chart 2.1. The takeover will be implemented in stages. In the first phase
the Suva system will be placed under a manager, reporting to the general
manager while an FEA office is established in Suva and the systems, methods
and work programs of SCCED are reorganized to ensure conversion to an integrated
branch operation of FEA. It will be followed by a period of consolidation,
when Kinoya station will be made the center for all operations until final



-9-
integration in 1981 by the time hydropower is introduced. By this time
training and staff recruitment would have been completed to cover all aspects
of management, administration, generation and distribution.
Training
2.09      The present team of professional staff which manages the operation
of FEA has handled the ongoing programs of operation and expansion well,
while preparing to meet future requirements. They will form the nucleus of
the top levels of FEA's reorganized setup. FEA's training program concen-
trates on the requirements at the subprofessional level up to that of
Assistant Engineer. It aims at ensuring that by about 1986 there would be
about 130 trained technicians and 25 assistant engineers in the country.
2.10      In accordance with this program a training school has been estab-
lished in FEA at Lautoka. A Director (Training) has been appointed and the
first course is in progress. It was necessary to do this within FEA because
the only other institution capable of handling this requirement, which is the
Derek Technical Institute (DTI) in Suva, has limited facilities and staffing
and financing constraints, as a result of which it could try to meet the FEA
requirement only by depriving other industries/institutions of their needs.
The uncertainty was unacceptable to FEA, but it has offered full collaboration
to DTI, while implementing its scheme.
2.11      Initial recruitment would be at high school level, at about 20 per
year. They would be subject to a five-year sandwich program of periods of
school work (three months) alternating with programmed on-the-job training.
Academic training follows the London City and Guilds Technicians course
adapted to meet FEA's requirements. The technicians will be given training
in workshop practice, electrical and mechanical fitting and mechanical
training in installation, operation and maintenance of generating stations
and transmission lines. In the final year the technicians who qualify would
be graded, those with potential being groomed in the sixth year to eventually
enter the Assistant Engineer grade, with training in management techniques
included. Technicians already with FEA would also be upgraded under this
course of training.
2.12      The Post and Telecommunication Department has offered FEA training
facilities in specialized areas, for instance carrier systems. The Papua New
Guinea Electricity Commission has also offered similar on-the-job and training
school facilities for FEA trainees, particularly on power system operation.
The Australian Development Assistance Bureau (ADAB) has indicated that it
could assist FEA's training program by financing any equipment or services
needed from Australia. In view of this, no provision will be made under the
Bank loan for training.

3. THE MARKET AND GROWTH OF SUPPLY
Consumption Trends
3.01      A detailed survey /1 of the power market was first carried out
during 1972-73 by ENEX to provide forecasts of future electricity consumption
for long-term planning.  After extensive analysis of past and current consumption
in different categories and by separate geographical localities, ENEX made
forecasts which were detailed up to 1980; the trends were then extended up to
1990.  These forecasts were reviewed during 1974-76 to take into account the
effect of extraordinary oil price increases during 1973 which temporarily set
back demand growth. Consumption level forecasts for 1980 and 1985 were
reduced in these later ENEX estimates /2 by about 35%. The power market was
reviewed again and confirmed by Gibb during 1976 /3. Detailed projections
have now been made up to 1983, with trends extended to the end of the century.
These constitute the basis for studies of justification of the project and
FEA's development program.
3.02      Table 3.1 summarizes the historical consumption trends by major
consumer categories. The category "large consumers" covers medium-size
industries, and large establishments, for instance airports and hotels. As
pointed out earlier (paras. 1.15-1.17) existing large industries in Fiji are
not covered by public supply nor are they likely to be in the near future.
The largest potential industrial consumer on the island -- the copper mining
industry at Namosi -- is still largely speculative; its demand is not expected
to materialize within the period of short-term forecasts. For this reason,
large industries have not been separately categorized.
3.03      During the five-year period 1967-72 public consumption as a whole
increased at an annual growth rate of 15% in the SCC area, and 23.5% in the
FEA area; the average for Viti Levu being about 18%. There was virtually no
increase in consumption during 1974 when steep electricity tariff increases
followed quadrupling in the cost of fuel. The average growth rate in Viti
Levu has been generally declining in recent years; during 1970-75 it was just
under 12%, the growth rates in the FEA and SCCED areas of supply being 16.8%
and 9.2% respectively.

Forecast of Energy and Demand
3.04      The short-term energy forecast for the period up to 1983 has been
prepared by analysis of trends of sales to different consumer groups -
residential, commercial and industrial (small), and large consumeLs - during
the past six years in various existing geographical areas of supply and
through market surveys and discussions with individual large consumers and
government departments. The growth rates vary in each category and location.
The results are given in Table 3.1. On aggregate, the anticipation is that
demand growth in the short term would grow at an average rate of about 8.5%
until 1983 (Table 3.3).  There would be no major change in shares of the
various categories of consumption; residential consumers would continue to
account for about 23%, whereas commercial consumers would slightly increase
their share at the expense of the large consumers.
3.05      Long-term forecasts up to the end of the century have been made
by:
(a) projecting the analysis of historical trends and short-term
forecasts; and
(b) macro studies based on a regression analysis with economic growth of
Fiji and comparisons of trends in similarly situated countries of
the region and elsewhere.
They indicate average growth rates varying from 7% to 7.5% per year. Gibb
has recommended and FEA has adopted a median growth rate of about 7% from 1984
up to the end of the century - corresponding roughly to a 4.5% real rate of
growth of Fiji's economy. These are given in Table 3.3. High and low rates
of growth around the median rate have also been indicated to test alternative
programs of development within this possible range. Maximum demands (Table
3.3) have been worked out from forecasts of energy after a study of the load
factors of the individual isolated areas of supply and the likely changes
after more effective system integration.
3.06      The market surveys carried out are adequate.  It is felt that in the
short term the forecast may prove slightly pessimistic as it does not make
adequate allowances for unforeseen demands.
Growth of Supply
3.07      The growth of demand and of firm capacity of existing public
electricity supply systems is given below. The firm capacity has been
assessed on the basis of retirement of diesel generating sets after 20 years
of operation and assuming that the reserve capacity of the diesel system will
not be less than the capacity of the two largest generating sets - viz, that
one set would suffer a breakdown when the other is on planned maintenance. A
reliability level of about 98% is aimed at, with load shedding implied for
about seven days every year.

System demand (MW)       9.0    9.5   10.2   10.9   12.0   13.1   14.0
3.08      The above data show that additional generating capacity would
be necessary by 1980 in the SCCED and by 1981 in the FEA areas of supply.
Interconnection of the SCCED and FEA systems could reduce the provision for
system reserve and postpone the need for augmentation of capacity in the
SCCED area by about one year. This is FEA's intention. A 132 kV system is
needed for the distances involved (about 140 km). It can be economically
justified, however, only in the context of development of a major hydro-
electric source located in the Nandrau plateau. This sets out the main
imperatives of the situation which are:
(a) commissioning of the first hydroelectric station on Viti Levu
island by 1981; and
(b) interconnection of the eastern (SCCED) and western (FEA) power
systems by 1980, to avoid increasing costly diesel generating
capacity.

4. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
4.01      FEA's Development Program.  FEA has drawn up a long-term (20 year)
development program which is based on the least cost sequence of expansion of
generating capacity and associated transmission in Viti Levu. It assumes that
FEA will in the future discharge its statutory responsibility of being the
entity solely responsible for the entire public supply in Fiji.
4.02      Generation.  In regard to expansion of generating capacity, the
program involves construction of the following projects during 1977-1986.
Name ot project           Installed capacity        Completion date
(a)  Monasavu - Wailoa (Stage 1)    40 MW                    July 1981 /a
(b)  Monasavu - Wailoa (Stage 2)       --                    July 1982
(c)  Wainisavulevu 1                  30 MW                  July 1984
(d)  Wainisavulevu 2                  15 MW                  July 1986
/a To allow for unforeseen occurrences, the Loan Agreement provides for a
project completion date of December 1981.
4.03      Detailed field investigations have been completed for the first
stage of the Monasavu - Wailoa hydroelectric project. Selection of the other
projects in the program are based on preliminary investigations. The program
accords high priority to the completion of their detailed field investigations
during the next two years. On the basis of the intrinsic features of these
projects, namely the high heads available, rainfall patterns, and other
available data, the schemes clearly represent the best choice for convenient
expansion of generating capacity in stages. The program will be reviewed in
1979 on completion of the ongoing field investigations. Agreement has been
reached during negotiations that, prior to commissioning of the Project, no
expansion of diesel/thermal generating capacity will be undertaken in Viti
Levu without prior consultation with the Bank as this would not be consistent
with the economic basis of the program.
4.04      Transmission.  Interconnection of the existing eastern and western
power systems of Viti Levu and development of the hydroelectric potential of
Nandrau plateau - where it is expected that about 200 MW of generating
capacity can be built up by the end of the century - requires a higher
transmission voltage than 33 kV which is presently in use. After considering
the available choices, both ENEX and Gibb have concluded that 132 kV repre-
sents the correct solution. Gibb has recommended construction of single-
circuit lines for the most part and tested the recommended transmission
program as the most appropriate even if the scope of hydroelectric development
during the next two decades is limited to about half of the scope envisaged.



- 14 -
4-05      The transmission program for 1977-1986 includes construction of
about 280 km of 132 kV transmission lines and three main substations at Suva,
Wailoa and Vunda. The first stage envisages construction of 140 km of
single circuit 132 kV lines to interconnect Suva and Vunda by mid-1980
(para. 3.08). The main transmission route has been chosen. Detailed trans-
mission line surveys were completed in December 1977. Bid documents for
supply of equipment and materials for its construction have been issued.
4.06      FEA has requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
of about F$16.0 million to cover the foreign currency cost of the first stage
of the transmission program. ADB has appraised the project. It was then
determined that FEA's plan to construct the 132 kV transmission lines a year
ahead (in 1980) of the Monasavu-Wailoa hydroelectic station to derive some
benefits of integrated operations earlier (para. 3.08), was justified.
4.07      Until about 1985, available diesel generating capacity in Viti Levu
will be adequate to serve as emergency reserve to meet the demand in case of
breakdown of the single-circuit 132 kV transmission lines thus providing
adec[uate security of supply. Reinforcement of the 132 kV system will be
required by 1986 and will be provided through a second 132 kV circuit from
Vunda to Suva.
4.08      Construction of the 132 kV Wailoa substation by end 1981 is essen-
tial for the commissioning of the Monasavu-Wailoa project.  Conclusion of
satisfactory financing arrangements for construction of 132 kV transmission
system (first stage), including the Wailoa substation, is a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan.
4.051     Subtransmission and Distribution.  The program provides for exten-
siorn of 33 kV subtransmission lines to distribute hydroelectric power to
various load centers. FEA's program also provides for extensions of its
medium (11 kV) and low voltage lines in its present areas of supply for
extensions in the SCCED areas and for rural electrification. The program in
the SCCED area is' based on information furnished by SCCED to FEA.
4.10      Cost of the Program.  The cost of the program is detailed in Table
4.1. It involves a total outlay of F$220 million during the period 1978-86
of which F$102.4 million will be required during the construction period
1978-81 of the project. The project, detailed in the following paragraphs,
represents about 50% of the cost of the program during this period.
The Project
4.11      Description.  The project is the first stage of the Monasavu - Wailoa
hydroelectric scheme and involves construction of the following works:
(a) a 60 m high, zoned embankment dam across the Nanuku stream in
the upper reaches of the Wainivondi River (Rewa basin) upstream of
Monasavu Falls. The dam will be about 200 m long at its crest with
an impervious core of locally available clayey soil surrounded by



- 15 -
filters and rock fill shells. The total volume of fill (rock and
earth fill) is about 750,000 cu m. A 5 m diameter concrete-lined
diversion tunnel, 325 m long, on the left bank will deal with river
flows during construction, and an ungated, reinforced co'-rete chute
spillway (50 m wide at the top narrowing down to 30 m) on the right
bank will deal with overflows after construction of the dam;
(b) a water conductor system comprising:
(i) a concrete-lined, 2.5 m diameter, low pressure tunnel,
2,400 m long;
(ii)  a vertical, concrete-lined surge shaft 6.5 m in diameter and
75 m high; and
(iii)  a steel lined pressure shaft, 1.8 m in diameter with a
sloping (40 degrees) section 850 m long, and a horizontal
length of 2,000 m. The steel lining will vary between 20 mm and
35 mm in thickness; and
(c) an overground power station on the right bank of the Wailoa River
designed for an ultimate installation of four 20 MW generating sets
of which two sets will be installed initially.
4.12      The basic data concerning the river and reservoir to be formed
are as follows:
River
Catchment area at Monasavu dam                         62.0 sq km
Average annual rainfall                                3,280 mm   6
Average annual flow                                    143.70 x 10 cu m
Maximum flood (10,000/yr.)                             732 cu m per second
Reservoir
Reservoir flood level                                  +735 m
Normal top reservoir level                             +730 m
Minimum draw down level                                +710 m
Effective storage volume (between +730 m and +710 m) 40.0 x 10 cu m
Power House:  Tail water level                         +120 m
Average net head                         595 m
Energy Generation
On the average, 200 Gwh per year; about 180 Gwh in dry years.



- 16 -
4.13      The construction of Stage I of the project would be followed around
1932 by diversion of river flows of two adjoining streams of the Wainivondi
river into the Monasavu reservoir.  This second stage of the project is
currently under detailed investigation and the work is included in FEA's
development program. The works envisaged are construction of low diversion
structures acroiss the two streams and about 5.0 km of 2.0 m diameter tunnels;
they will increase average annual energy generation at Wailoa power station
to 240 GlWh.
4.L4      Invesitigations and Status of Engineering.  Hydrological observations
at Monasavu were initiated in 1967 by the Ministry of Communications, Works
and Tourism and these are continuing. Although the record has not been
maintained continuously, adequate data were available to:
(a) correlate runoffs and rainfall data and establish a long-term (67
years) runoff series for reservoir capacity and power potential
studies; and
(b) carry out analysis of storms to estimate the intensities and
duration of floods.
4.15      The technical feasibility of constructing a dam at Monasavu was
first established by ENEX in 1975 *on the basis of general geological maps and
limited drilling.  Gibb used data from about 16 drill holes at the dam site
(which were fulLy tested for water losses) and a number of trial pits to
arrive at the same conclusion in 1977. Both ENEX and Gibb recommended
construction of a rock fill dam of about the same height (60 m) at this
non-hazardous location. Feasibility stage investigations, completed in
August 1977, did not reveal any adverse feature of significance.  Foundation
conditions were, in fact, regarded as good for the type of dam proposed. No
significant hazards were anticipated with regard to either leakage from the
reservoir or major instability of reservoir margins.
4.;L6     An extensive program of design stage investigations, including
driLlling of 42 holes and some deep trench excavations at Monasavu dam site
were completed iin January 1978. It has revealed that Monasavu will be a simple
rockfill dam with all materials for the core, filters and rockfill available
close at hand. The site permits a simple, safe, and readily designed spillway
arrangement.  Dam construction is simplified by the fact that the foundation
level for the earth core is readily defined by the abrupt change (in less
than a foot) from mud to acceptable hard rock. Grouting of the rock will be'
reqjuired, but the cores indicate that the quantity of grout will be moderate.
The bottom elevation of the grout curtain can be predicted with unusual
accuracy since practically all the grout will go into the sandstone rock
forming the abutments, but none will be needed in a watertight igneous layer
underlying the sandstone at about stream bed level. On the basis of these
results, optimization and detailed designs of the Monasavu dam are in progress.
4.JL7     An impediment to fast construction of the core is rainfall which
averages 3,300 mm per year and which occurs on the average of 200 days per
year. This means that core construction will be impossible on many days and
slow on others. For instance, if a compacted core layer six inches thick is



- 17 -
achieved in one day and rained upon, the top two inches may have to be
scalped off because it is too wet for another layer of core to be constructed.
This does not mean that rain makes the construction impractical since similar
work has ben done under these conditions in Fiji and at many tropical locations.
The high degree o' stoppages would increase construction costs and this has
been allowed for in the cost estimates.
4.18      Instability of the steep slopes in the Wailoa basin rules out
construction of surface penstocks which would otherwise have been more
economic for the small quantities of water involved. Underground pressure
shafts and tunnels are therefore proposed. From the results of about eight
drill holes along the route of the tunnels, it is expected that rock condi-
tions would be generally good for the proposed tunnels and surge shaft.
Nevertheless, designs have been based on concrete lining throughout. This is
acceptable. The pressure shaft has been conservatively designed, assuming,
due to lack of data on rock properties, e.g. deformability, that no pressures
will be transferred to the surrounding rock. However, a 300 m section of the
high pressure tunnel is currently being driven to its full diameter to carry
oit jacking tests which will determine structural properties of the rock.
The design of steel lining will be reviewed at this stage (July 1978) as
there is a possibility of substantial economies if the rock conditions permit
reduction in the thickness of lining.
4.19      Investigations and studies carried out have satisfactorily estab-
lished technical feasibility of the project and provided a sound basis for
preparing a basic project design, an appropriate construction program and
realistic estimates of its cost.
4.20      Project Cost Estimate.  The estimated cost of the project is
summarized in the table below, and is detailed in Table 4.2.

4.21      The cost of the dam has been estimated on the basis of feasibility
stage designs, expected quantities of work and unit rates with adequate (20%)
physical contingencies. The quantities have been worked out on the basis of
preliminary designs which allow for high earthquake intensities. Core
material has been assumed to be drawn from upstream borrow pits though spillway
excavation might actually be used to economize. Such work not having been
done so far in Fiji, unit rates have been built up on the basis of rates
actually obtained for a similar size rock fill dam recently constructed in
Australia by contract. The rates were suitably adjusted taking into account
the differences in rates of labor, construction materials and equipment costs,
and inflation. An allowance was also made for possible difficulties in
compaction of soils under conditions of high moisture content (para. 4.17).
4.22      Quantities for tunnelling were based on limited overbreak (10-15%).
Rock conditions are expected to be generally good for tunnelling. However,
to be on the safe side, supports have been assumed for 60% of the length.
Additionally, a 20% provision has been made for contingencies. Tunnelling
costs are based on recent construction costs in Australia adjusted upwards
for conditions in Fiji. The excavation costs were then checked with actual
experience of EGM in its mining operations in Fiji which is both extensive
and relevant being very near the project area.
4.23      Steel lining inside the pressure shaft is a highly specialized
item of work for which Gibb has used an adjusted budget estimate of an
experienced contractor. Prevailing costs of steel in Australia (which are
high) were used and due allowances made for supply, erection and grouting.
4.24      In general, rates assumed are reasonable and designs are conservative
on presently available information. All factors which could have an impact
on construction costs have been considered and reasonable physical contingen-
cies have been provided.  They vary from 5% on steel lining to 20% for the
main civil works. Price contingencies have been provided for the foreign
component of costs at 9% during FYs78 and 79, and 8% during FYs 80 and 81,
and on the local costs at 7.5% during FYs78 and 79, and 7% during FYs 80 and
81. Foreign costs have been worked out taking into account the extent of use
of local labor and materials.
4.25      Unit Costs.  The cost of the project works out to about US$1,350 per
kW installed in the first stage. It is representative of prevailing investment
costs for relatively small hydroelectric projects where extensive underground
construction is involved.
4.26      Project Consultants.  FEA appointed Gibb as the main consulting
engineer for engineering and construction supervision after inviting proposals
from interested firms. The Bank agreed as Gibb, associated with Merz and
McLellan (M/M) for engineering of electrical and mechanical works, has the
necessary expertise. Its performance on this project so far has been satisfac-
tory. Gibb and M/M should be able to competently handle all the functions
expected of them on this project. ADAB has agreed to finance the entire cost
of the engineering services. Continued employment of consultants for the
project under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of
the proposed loan.



- 19 -
4.27      Special Board of Consultants.  FEA has appointed a Special Board
of Consultants (SBC) to review the project designs in detail as they evolve
throughout the construction stage primarily from the standpoint of ensuring
safety. SBC consists of a team of three experts comprising an expert in
soils, an expert in design/construction of embankment dams, and an expert in
rock mechanics. At FEA's request the Bank and EIB jointly suggested suitable
names and they have been agreed to. One of the experts chosen has consider-
able experience in force account construction also. It is expected that his
advice will be fully utilized by FEA on inspection of construction to doubly
ensure that specifications laid down for the civil works are being adhered
to (para. 4.31). FEA has proposed the first meeting of the SBC in July 1978.
The cost of the SBC will be financed jointly by IBRD/EIB (para. 4.38). Since
signing of the proposed loan may be delayed until after the SBC meeting, we
recommend that the Bank-financed portion of the estimated cost of the first
meeting (US$11,000) be considered for retroactive financing.
4.28      FEA has agreed to prepare and implement a program of inspection
and maintenance of the works which is satisfactory to the Bank throughout
the operational period of the project.
4.29      Method of Construction and Special Project Division.  Considerable
thought has been given by FEA, Gibb and the Government to decide on the best
method of constructing the Project taking into account:
(a)  the remoteness of the small country from the main industrial
economies;
(b)  the need to complete dam construction by 1981 (para. 3.08);
(c)  the need to strengthen Fiji's civil construction industry in the
context of FEA's and the country's development programs; and
(d)  problems of cost overruns and delays which have been experienced in
Fiji when relying solely on foreign contractors.
Their decision, with which the Bank has agreed, is that:
(a)  the construction of the main embankment dam, spillway, intake,
and powerhouse civil works (accounting for about 25% of the project
cost) would be carried out by force-account through a Special
Project Division (SPD) to be established within FEA with complete
autonomy (para. 4.30);
(b)  work such as tunnelling, steel lining, and supply and erection
of generating plant and ancillary equipment will be carried
out by contractors, selected after international competitive
bidding (ICB); and
(c)  access and project roads, construction camps and a permanent
colony will be executed, as at present, by the Public Works
Department (PWD) and FEA's own organization.



- 20 -
4.30      The SPD will be a construction division under the umbrella of FEA,
organized as a separate and autonomous unit and equipped mainly through
an Australian Development Aid Bureau (ADAB) grant directed towards consultants
services and the. portion of the project to be constructed by SPD. It will
be directed and controlled by a superintending engineer who will be respon-
sible to the general manager of FEA. He is an Australian, selected by FEA
in consultation with the Bank and EIB, who took over his duties in February
1978.  The next tier of key specialists have been recruited. Lower level
skilled and semi-skilled personnel are available in Fiji and will be recruited
as necessary.
4.31      The organizational structure of SPD is shown in Chart 4.5
and will function in accordance with procedures set out in FEA's "Establishment,
Conditions of Operation and Standing Instructions" (see Project File). This
code sets out the powers and duties of the SPD, its conditions of operation
and procurement procedures. Gibb will assist FEA in preparing job specifica-
tions, advertising and in selection of personnel for the SPD. The engineer
will also perform a vital role in supervising the works, examining and
testing materials to be used or workmanship employed, and advising SPD on
procurement. This will not, however, relieve SPD of its duties and obligations
set out in the code. Gibb will discharge this role of supervision of construc-
tion by SPD through an experienced Resident Representative who has already
been appointed. The Bank felt that some independent inspection should be
injected into the system. FEA and Gibb agreed. It is therefore proposed
that SBC would also be required to review construction methods, particularly
those being used on force-account work and to suggest any improvements, if
called for.
4.32      During negotiations FEA agreed to the following conditions under
which the Bank would have no objection to FEA setting up SPD for force-account
construction of the Monasavu dam, spillway, intake structure and powerhouse
civil works:
(a)  continue employment of SBC to review project designs before and during
construction and to review construction (see para. 4.27 and 4.31);
(b) preparation of plans, construction drawings, specifications and
detailed cost estimates before undertaking any construction (for
proper control);
(c)  maintenance of separate accounts by SPD;
(d) consulitation with the Bank on the organizational structure
of SPD and on the appointment of key personnel; and
(e) consulitation with the Bank before SPD undertakes any additional
work oither than that specifically agreed (to ensure that SPD
moves on rapidly to the status of an independent contractor).
4.33      The construction arrangements proposed by FEA would enable completion
of construction by the target date (1981). Local expertise would be developed



- 21 -
to assist FEA in implementing its long-term development program, and the SPD
would meet the country's need for developing a competent local construction
organization.
4.34      Program of Construction.  Gibb has prepared a detailed construction
program based on the method of construction explained in para. 4.29. It is
set out in Chart 4.4. Substantial completion of the Monasavu dam and commis-
sioning of the power station is scheduled for July 1981./1 The program is
tight, but workable. A detailed list of construction equipment required has
been drawn up; its timely procurement is crucial to successful implementation
of the program. With the appointment of the head of SPD, procurement action
on equipment for construction has been speeded up. The stone crusher, and
concrete batching and mixing plant have been ordered. By mid 1978 purchase of
equipment costing about F$5.5 million, would have been committed. Equally
important is completion of the program of testing of construction materials
and rock in the horizontal reach of the pressure tunnel (para. 4.18) - a
necessary prelude to invitation of bids for tunnelling and its steel lining.
Gibb and FEA are conscious of the constraints to the program and are making
every effort to overcome potential problems in time.
4.35      Land Acquisition.  The Project, being located in a remote area of
the island, requires a considerable amount of preparatory work such as
access roads, construction camps, and a permanent colony. Land has to be
acquired for these purposes as well as for the reservoir to be formed
covering about 400 ha. It is proposed to be cleared of forest. The land for
the Project is owned partly by Government (crown lands) and partly by native
Fijians and is administered by the Native Land Trust Board. The land for the
associated transmission system includes some freeholds. Acquisition has to
be done by FEA through Government channels. There has not been any undue
delay so far in regard to land acquisition for construction of access roads.
However, as these activities are on the critical path of the construction
program, EIB included in its loan documents, which were negotiated in November
1977, a covenant requiring the Government to guarantee that FEA will have
available by July 1, 1978, all land necessary for implementation of the
Project including associated transmission. In conformity with the EIB covenant,
a similar condition requiring FEA to take all action necessary to acquire by
July 1, 1978, the right to use all land required for the construction of the
project including associated transmission was incorporated in the documents of
the proposed loan. Failure to comply with this condition means that the loan
cannot be declared effective (Section 12.03(b) of the General Conditions
Applicable to Loan and Guarantee Agreements). However, FEA has now acquired
most of the rights to use the land necessary for the project, and no difficul-
ties are expected in completing land use acquisition. No resettlement is
involved as the area is largely uninhabited.
/1 To allow for unforseen occurrences, the Loan Agreement provides for
a project completion date of December 1981.



- 22 -
4.36      Procurement.  Procurement of the goods and services will be handled
separately for those sections of the Project to be constructed by force
account and through contract. Procurement of the former will be the respon-
sibility of SPD and will be carried out, in consultation with Gibb and in
accordance with the code drawn up (para. 4.31). Bank guidelines will be
followed for all other work to be procured by contract, through International
Competitive Bidding (ICB). There are no regional preferences. No local
preference for equipment will apply since Fiji does not manufacture the
equipment required for the project. Fiji, by virtue of its high per capita
income, is ineligible for any local preferences for its civil works contracts.
The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan, together with contributions of EIB,
would finance the estimated direct foreign cost of construction contracts
for all the tunnels (including steel lining), the supply and erection contracts
for generating equipment (and auxiliaries) in the Wailoa power station, and
the cost of SBC. Contractors for Bank financed civil works will be prequali-
fied in consultation with the Bank. FEA's intention is to indicate in the
bid documents that it would supply concrete from its central batching plant
to be set up by SPD to the successful civil works bidder for reasons of
overall economy and speed of construction. The prices, arrangements for
testing, etc. will be set out in the bid documents.
4.37      Project Financing and Loan Disbursements.  The funds necessary to
implement the project will be raised through co-financing arrangements
involving the Bank, EIB, the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC),
ADAB, the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) and other local financing
institutions, and the Government of Fiji. There are certain constraints in
drafting the financing plan due to the following preferences of the various
financing agencies:
(a) EIB prefers to enter into a joint financing rather than a parallel
financing arrangement with the Bank;
(b) ADAB provides grant funds to the Government for financing mainly
the cost of consultants, experts and equipment needed for construc-
tion of the project, which are procured in Australia. However, to
some extent excess funds available can be used in an untied fashion
for financing other items; and
(c) CDC, FNPF and other local banks provide general purpose financing./l
4.38      Considering the above co-financing possibilities and constraints,
the following financing plan is envisaged for the Project:

/a The financial requirement comprises the total project cost of US$54.0 mil-
lion, estimated interest during constuction of US$5.3 million, and that
portion of the plant and establishment cots of SPD (US$4.1 million) which
is not included in the cost of the proposed project and will be charged
to other projects.
4.39      The proposed Bank loan will represent 24% of the total financial
requirement. Disbursements will be made for 44% of the total cost of the
eligible items up to US$15 million on the basis of certified invoices. EIB
will disburse jointly with the Bank at the rate of 42% of the total cost.
This is appropriate in the context of the co-financing arrangements. Signing
of the EIB and CDC loan documents is a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed loan.
4.40      Environment.  Surveys carried out by Gibb in consultation with the
Environmental Adviser to the Fiji Government have revealed no significant
disbenefit as a result of the project which involves creation of a relatively
small reservoir in the remote forests of the Nandrau plateau. There is no
habitation in the waterspread of the proposed reservoir, or fish in the



- 24 -
Nanuku river, nor are there any artifacts of any significance which will be
affected. The Department of Health has opined that there are no diseases
existing in the rest of Fiji which do not exist in the area adjacent to the
darm site. The environmental effects of the project are therefore likely to
be minimal and within the capacity of the Fiji authorities to cope through
consultants, who have coordinated the collection of basic data with the help
of all concerned agencies. Although the scheme has some potential for develop-
ment of fisheries and recreational facilities, the benefit of electricity
generation is by far the most significant. Regulation of river flow afforded
by the reservoir would no doubt constitute some irrigation potential downstream
or conceivably help increase river flows for other downstream uses. Gibb's
studies however show that these are not of any great economic significance.
A minor identified disbenefit is that the diversion of Nanuko stream flows to
the Wailoa river which might affect fishing in the short 6 km stretch of the
Wainivondi river up to its confluence with the Wainisavulevu. Should this
occur, inhabitants of two small villages would have to traverse slightly
longer distances for their catch - a problem which FEA and Government believe
can be easily handled.
Risks
4.41      The risks associated with the proposed project are the uncertainties
inherent in all hydroelectric projects, such as possible geological problems,
hyrological complexities, and similar matters. However, the competent prepara-
tory work undertaken by FEA and the consultants as well as the precautions
taken in organizing and supervising the construction work (such as the estab-
lishment of the Special Board of Consultants) are expected to keep the risks
to a minimum.

5. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
General
5.01      The Government's decision to embark, in the national interest, on
a comparatively large hydroelectric development program will have far reaching
implications on FEA's finances. During the next several years FEA's financial
situation will be characterized by the fact that large investments will be
superimposed on a comparatively narrow financial base./l Consequently, for
some time, FEA will have to maintain tariff levels above the long-run marginal
cost of supply, the rates of return on average net fixed assets in operation
will have to be high, the internal contribution to investments, as well as
the debt service coverages will be low, and large amounts of capital contribu-
tions will be required to keep the debt/equity ratio within reasonable levels
and the debt service requirements in manageable bounds. In this context it
should be noted that none of the expected lending agencies for the Project
are prepared to finance interest during construction which further aggravates
FEA's finances. However, FEA's competent management is expected to exert the
financial discipline necessary to implement the Project and the hydro program
under difficult circumstances and also to be capable of raising additional
funds if necessary.
Past Performance
5.02      FEA's cost of providing electricity is high.  In FY77 it amounted
to FU 7.6 per kWh generated (USd7.8 equivalent) and it is expected to increase
to Fd 8.0 per kWh (USM8.8) in FY78. The main reasons for this are:
(a) the high cost of diesel fuel which presently accounts for 40%
of the annual cost of electricity supply (in FY74, before the
full impact of the large fuel price increase was felt, it accounted
for only about 30%); and
(b) FEA's operations which involve small and fragmented subsystems
which are not fully interconnected and expensive to operate.
Nevertheless, during FY76 and FY77 FEA has been able to set its tariffs at
levels which resulted in rates of return on average net fixed assets in
operation of about 12% in FY76 and 8% in FY77, whereas before, in FY74 and
FY75 it had achieved returns of about minus 8% and plus 1% only. The
improvement was made possible through two tariff increases in FY76 totalling
about 36%.
/1 Even after takeover of SCCED, which will considerably broaden FEA's
operations, FEA's fixed assets are expected to increase about 2.5 times
over the present level of SCCED's and FEA's combined fixed assets.



- 26 -
5.03      No recent financial information on SCCED's operations is available
and data covering earlier fiscal years must be considered unreliable.  The
most striking feature, however, of SCCED's past operations is that it has
paiid comparatively large annual amounts (between F$190,000 and F$300,000) to
the general funcl of the city which were used for meeting general expenses.
SCCED, therefore, has not been in a position to maintain its plant properly
and the inadequate physical state of its installations is largely a consequence
of this drain of funds (para 1.22). Despite a recent increase of about 20%
(para. 1.28) SCCED's level of tariffs is lower than that in FEA (Ff9.00 =
US.9.9) with average revenues per kWh sold at FJ8.0 (USd8.8). The tariffs
will be brought to FEA's level on August 1, 1978 (para 1.29).
Financial Covenants
5.04      After the tariff adjustment in the SCCED supply area on August 1,
1978, FEA plans to raise tariffs in step with the increases which would have
been required if, instead of the hydro development, the equivalent thermal
(diesel) development had been undertaken. This to avoid placing a heavier
financial burden on its customers than the alternative thermal development
would have required. Present projections indicate (see Table 5.1) that
these increases will be necessary only until FY83/84; after that date the
stabilizing effe,ct of the hydro development is expected to occur with no
need for additional increases, and tariff levels are expected then to remain
substantially beLow those of the equivalent thermal expansion.
5.05      At present, FEA and SCCED are recording their assets at historic
cosl-. A part of the assets is outdated and, in the case of SCCED, their
remaining useful lives may be shorter than the date of purchase suggests
due to inadequate maintenance in the past. Furthermore, Fiji does not
compile indices monitoring price trends in the construction industry on
whi(h a reasonable asset revaluation could be based.  However, in discussions,
FEA officials agreed to undertake a proper asset valuation after physical
takeover of the SCCED assets and to design a practicable revaluation mechanism
to be applied later. This initial valuation will probably be made on the
basis of engineering appraisals and with the assistance of experts. Conse-
quently, the following tariff covenant is proposed:
(a)  revaluation of assets, based on a method acceptable to the Bank, as
of the end of FEA's FY79 and continuously at the end of any fiscal
year thereafter; and
(b)  in agreement with the Bank, establishment of an appropriate rate
of return on currently valued average net fixed assets in operation
as shall be sufficinet to cover FEA's operating expenses, interest
and repayment of debt and annual compensation payments to the Suva
City Council for the assets of SCCED, and to finance a reasonable
portion of FEA's investment program.



- 27 -
The above covenant indicates a tariff level at least equivalent to the
long-run marginal cost of electricity supply, probably somewhat higher.
5.06      The financial projections show that, despite the high level of
tariff, between rL78 and FY81 (project construction period) FEA will go
through a period of extremely tight financial conditions (Table 5.2). For
instance, FEA is expected to be able to contribute from net internal sources,
before allowing for compensation to SCC, only about F$ 1.2 million to its
investments (about 1%) during the project constuction period FY78-8l./1
It was therefore essential that a firm commitment be obtained from the
Government requiring it to provide in any given year the funds which are
necessary for the execution of FEA's invesLment pogram and which cannot be
raised through borrowing on reasonable terms from abroad or in the domestic
capital market. Consequently, agreement was reached during negotiations
that the Government will contribute to FEA in the form of equity not less
than F$ 23.76 million (this includes the ADAB grant of F$ 10.50 million) in
accordance with a timetable to be agreed upon.
5.07      For the reasons outlined in paragraph 5.06, FEA has agreed to
consult with the Bank prior to finalizing its annual financing plans during
execution of the project. Furthermore, to ensure that FEA maintains a
reasonable capitalization, its debt/ equity ratio should remain at a maximum
level of 70/30, unless the Bank otherwise agrees.
Financing Plan
5.08      FEA's financing plan for the construction period of the Project is
characterized by a joint effort on the part of the Government and several
financing institutions to overcome FEA's financial difficulties. The Bank
and EIB will enter into a joint financing arrangement to finance major
equipment and civil works awarded to contractors selected through interna-
tional competitive bidding, ADAB is expected to bolster the Government funds
through grants, and CDC and local financing institutions (including FNPF)
plan to provide general purpose financing. In addition, ADB is considering
financing the foreign exchange component of the transmission project which
is required to market the output of the Project. At present, the proposed
financing plan is as follows:
/1 This is not in contradiction to the tariff covenant explained in paragraph
5.05, which requires financing of a reasonable portion of FEA's investment
program through internal cash generation. The low level of about 1%
during FY78-81 is reasonable in the context of extremely heavy invest-
ments in this period and tariff levels above the long-run marginal costs
of supply. With the tariff level as envisaged, FEA is expected to
finance about 26% through internal cash generation during the period
FY82-86.

5.09      FEA will have to make compensation payments to SCC for the elec-
tricity assets taken over. The amount to be paid is not known at present
and will either be fixed in negotiations on the basis of a fair market value
or, if no negotiated agreement can be reached by the Supreme Court (para.
1.27). For the purpose of the attached financial projections it has been
assumed that FEA will take over the responsibility of servicing SCCED's debt
and, in addition, will have to make annual compensation payments of F$200,000.
5.10      Above financing plan clearly shows the large financial efforts
FEA and the Government will have to make in carrying out the Project and the
hydroelectric program. Government contributions are expected to reach a level
of about 23% of the required funds during the Project construction period.
This is a very heavy burden on the Government budget and shows the Government's
firm commitment to the Project and the program. However, these efforts are
worthwhile undertaking because of the large financial and foreign exchange
benefits accruing to the Fiji economy. During the life of the Project the
foreign exchange savings for the country at present day prices are expected
to reach about F$160 million. Besides, electricity tariffs would be stable
after 1983-84, even lower in real terms.
Accounting, Billing and Collection
5.11      FEA's accounting department is well staffed and fully capable
of handling FEA's accounting now and after SCCED's takeover. Until recently,
the average arrears from sales of power were about three months, a not better
than average performance. However, the present management has introduced
efficient meter reading/billing/disconnection policies which considerably
shortened the collection time to about 1-1/2 months. In view of this
excellent performance no particular covenant on arrears is proposed.
Audit
5.12      The Fiji office of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Company has audited
FEA's accounts in the past and has provided satisfactory service. FEA plans
to continue to use this firm which would be acceptable to the Bank. During
negotiations FEA will be asked to send the audit report annually to the Bank
not later than four months after the close of the fiscal year.
Tariffs
5.13      FEA's present average tariff of F 9 per kWh (US9.9 equivalent)
is high, about 10% above the long-run marginal cost of energy consumed 11
(based on FEA's nine-year investment program). The charges for the various
consumer classes, in force since February 1, 1976, are as follows:

Although FEA uses a declining block rate structure, the tariff in all
categories is nearly the same or higher than the long run marginal cost of
about: Fi9.0 per uniit. This rate structure needs to be eventually changed
and FEA agrees. A representative of FEA has recently been nominated to
attend a Bank-sponsored seminar on tariffs, after which necessary steps
would be taken, and the changes incorporated in the tariff to be effective
August 1, 1978.

/a  Takeover of SCCED assumed as of August 1, 1978.
/b  See Chapter 3 for basic assumptions.
/c  In accordance with FEA's notice of April 12, 197B, a unified tariff has been assumed for the whole of Fiji starting FY78/79.  Upon its
introduction, this tariff will result in average revenues per kWh sold of not less than PEA's present tariff. Future tariff adjustments
in step with the increases which would have been required if, instead of the hydro development, the equivalent thermal (diesel) develop-
ment would be undertaken, have been assumed until FY83/84. After FY83/84 no further increases appear to be required indicating the
stabilining effect the hydro development has on the tariff levels.
/d  FPA purchases small amounts of electricity, predominantly from the Emperor Gold Mine.  These purchases are expected to discontinue after
1978/79.
/e  At present, FEA pays about F$136 per ton for diesel oil, the only kind of fuel it uses.  For the financial projections, annual price
increases of about 8% have been assumed.
/f  Although FEA expects to be able to reduce the number of operatiosal personnel somewhat through transfer of excess personnel to the
special projects division, no reduction has been assumed in the financial projections. Consequently, this item may include a reserve.
/g Generally, the cost of operation, maintenance and administration is based on historic development and takes into account FEA's maintenance
plans. Allowance has been made for extraordinary maintenance of SCCED facilities (F$930,000 in FY78/79 and F$130,000 in FY79/80). With
the introduction of hydro generation in 1981/82 and retirement of outdated diesel plant, a noticeable reduction in the cost of maintenance
can be expected.
/h FEA uses straight line depreciation in accordance with the expected useful lives of its plant. Some typical depreciation rates are:
diesel generation plant 5%, lines and cables 5%, buildings 1.25%, tools 10%, cars and trucks 20%.

6. JUSTIFICATION
Least Cost Soli-ion
6.01      It has been explained earlier (para. 3.08) that additional
generating capacity would be needed in Viti Levu by 1981 as the growth of
demand would exceed the firm capacity of the existing power systems.  Studies
have been carried out to establish that the Monasavu - Wailoa hydroelectric
project represents the next step in the least cost sequence of expansion of
generating capacity on the island.  These are described in the following
paragraphs.
6.02      The most economic sequence of thermal/diesel expansion schemes
until the end of the century was first established. This involves isolated
development of the various subsystems of Viti Levu as their interconnection
would not be economically justified during the study period. The program
comprises addition of a series of diesel generating sets, the maximum unit
size of 20 MW being required only towards the end of the century.
6.03      Available hydroelectric sites were costed and ranked in order
of their economic importance on the basis of their estimated capital costs,
their utilizable energy potential assessed through reservoir and system
operation studies, and energy costs calculated on an annual cost equivalent
of 11%. The results are summarized in Table 6.1. The Monasavu-Wailoa
hydroelectric project has the lowest cost of energy generation. The next
lowest cost is that of the Nanuku-Singatoka-Koro scheme, which is a mutually
exclusive alternative to the Monasavu-Wailoa project. The latter scheme was
investigated, first by ENEX and then by Gibb. Apart from higher costs of
development, which could well increase after further detailed investigations
of the Nanuku dam site (these are considered necessary to fully establish
technical feasibility), the Nanuku-Singatoka-Koro scheme has the disadvantage
that it would limit ultimate development of the energy potential of the
Singatoka valley schemes. Further consideration of this scheme was therefore
given up.
6.04      A number of hydroelectric development programs were compared on a
present worth basis taking into account both construction and operating costs.
Computerized system operation studies were used to optimize dam heights and
installed generating capacities, and also to assess their utilizable hydroelectric
potential and consequent thermal generation requirements of the system. It was
established that within the range of the discount rates chosen (9-13%) the
sequence of schemes outlined in para. 4.02, with Monasavu-Wailoa as the initial
project, provides the lowest costs.
6.05      The least cost hydroelectric program (including the necessary trans-
mission system and all associated costs) was then compared with the least cost
thermal alternative. The discount rate at which the present worth of the cost
of the hydroelectric development program described above equals that of the



- 32 -
thermal alternative is 13%. The results were tested for demand growth rates
higher and lower than the median forecast adopted for the program.  With the
low rate (which is less than half the recent historic growth rate), the
equalizing discount rate falls to about 11%. The higher rate of growth would
call for acceleration in the sequence of construction of hydroelectric
projects (which is considered feasible) and additions to thermal capacity at
the end of the period.
6.06      For economic comparison, shadow prices were used for foreign
costs. Project costs were broken down into components of skilled, semi-
skilled and unskilled labor to which factors of 1.5, 1.0 and 0.5 respectively
were applied. The results of the economic analysis carried out are detailed
in Tables 8.13 to 8.18 of the Project Report Volume I (see Project File).
They are acceptable.
Internal Economic Rate of Return
6.07      The internal economic rate of return of the Project (IERR) is
the discount rate which equalizes the economic costs and benefits attributable
to the project. The project costs and benefit streams are shown in Table 6.2.
The costs are net of taxes and include those associated directly with the
Prcoject, the entire costs of the first stage of FEA's 132 kV transmission
project and an allowance for distribution. Ideally the benefits should be
measured in terms of the consumers' willingness to pay, but since this is
practically impossible to evaluate, the incremental revenue of the Project
was used as a proxy for total benefits. This is a minimum measure of the
Project benefits as consumers surpluses are ignored in the analysis. On this
basis, the IERR is at least 18%. The high return reflects the average tariff
level which is higher than the long run marginal costs.
