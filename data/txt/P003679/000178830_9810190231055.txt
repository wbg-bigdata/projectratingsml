MONASAVU-WAILOA HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              The Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA)
Guarantor:             Fiji
Amount:                US$15.0 million
Terms:                  15 years, including 3 years of grace, with interest at
7.5% per annum.
Project Description:  The project is the first stage of Fiji's hydroelectric
development program and includes construction of: a
60 m bhigh embankment dam; a water conductor system;
and an overground power station with an initial capacity
of 40 MW, which can be extended to 80 MW later. The
project will help minimize further expansion of
the diesel generating capacity, with corresponding
savings in foreign exchange which would otherwise be
required for importing fuel. The foreign exchange savings
at current prices are expected to be about US$180 million
during the life of the project. Additional benefits would
arise from an institutional reform of Fiji's power sector
and a stabilization of electricity tariffs which would
make electricity more affordable for rural customers. The
risks associated with the project are those inherent in
all hydroelectric projects, such as possible geological
problems and hydrological uncertainties, but the investi-
gations carried out indicate that they would be minimal.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is expected to finance
as a separate project the transmission facilities necessary
to market the energy produced by the proposed project.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE FIJI ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF FIJI
FOR THE MONASAVU-WAILOA HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA) with the guarantee of Fiji for
the equivalent of US$15.0 million to help finance the Monasavu-Wailoa hydro-
electric project. The loan would have standard terms of 15 years, including
3 years of grace, with interest at 7.5% per annum. The European Investment
Bank (EIB) has agreed to lend to FEA US$14.3 million, on the basis of joint
financing with IBRD, for a term of 15 years including 4-1/2 years of grace, at
interest of about 5.4% per annum. The Australian Development Assistance Bureau
(ADAB) will provide US$11.5 million of grant money, and the Commonwealth Devel-
opment Corporation (CDC) will provide US$9.1 million for a term of 20 years
including 4 years of grace, at interest of 8.75% per annum. The Fiji National
Provident Fund (FNPF) will lend to FEA US$3.6 million for a term of 20 years
including 4 years of grace, at interest of 7-1/8% per annum. The terms of the
remaining local loans of US$1.3 million are being negotiated.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Background
2.         A report entitled, "Economic Situation and Prospects of Fiji" (No.
1296-FIJ, January 17, 1977), was circulated to the Executive Directors on
January 27, 1977. Basic country data are given in Annex I.
3.         Fiji became independent on October 10, 1970, and is now a member of
the British Commonwealth. It is composed of a group of over 300 islands in
the South Pacific with a total land area of some 18,000 sq km. It has a
population of about 580,000 of which about 90% live on the two main islands,
Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. The gradual transfer of political power was
accompanied by a program of local recruitment at all levels of Government
which has helped to ensure competent leadership and a well-managed adminis-
trative system after independence. Since the first post-independence election
of April 1972, the Alliance Party, based largely on the support of Fijians
(44% of the population) and European and Chinese minorities (5%), retained
political power. The National Federation Party, which is in the opposition,
is supported mainly by the citizens of Indian descent (about 51% of the
population).
Past Developments and Growth Prospects
4.         Over the past decade, real gross national product has increased by
about 7% a year reaching US$1,150 per capita in 1976.  Until the early



sixties, Fiji was primarily an agricultural economy which relied heavily on
sugar production as the main generator of incomes, employment and export
earnings. However, the last decade has witnessed a significant structural
change with tourism and related activities emerging as the most important
source of economic growth. During the last decade, output in agriculture,
forestry and fisheries has remained stagnant and, as a result, this sector's
share in GDP has fallen from about one third to one fifth.  It now contributes
less to GDP than wholesale and retail trade. The expansion of the services
sector, which now contributes about two thirds of GNP, has been due mainly to
the rapid growth in tourism which created a demand for different kinds of
services, such as construction of hotels and other infrastructure, transport,
hotel labor, and distributive trades. This expansion has attracted a large
number of people from rural into urban areas.
5.         Tourism growth has been the most important factor cont#ibuting to
a rapid increase in investment which accounted for almost one quarftr of GNP
in 1973. As economic activity worldwide slowed down and tourism growth
declined, investment dropped to 18% of GNP in 1976. The growth in the
tourist industry has been largely responsible for increasing the dependence
of this open economy on imports (at present about 60% of GNP) and a risfug
share of foreign capital in the financing of gross investments (at present,
about one third).
6.         A noteworthy feature of Fiji's development has been the significant
reduction in the rate of population growth from 3.3% in the early 1960s to
about 1.6% at present. The fall in the rate of growth can be explained by
changing social habits, rising incomes, the Government's family planning
program, reduced fertility, and an increased rate of net migration to other
countries. However, the rate of growth in the labor force during the past
decade has remained at about 3% a year and, despite the reasonably rapid
growth of output in the nonagricultural sectors, employment growth has not
kept pace with the growth of the labor force. While employment increased by
about 2.5% a year during the past ten years, the level of unemployment
increased from 4% to 7%.
7.         The Government's fiscal effort in the past decade has been impres-
sive. The current revenues averaged about 23% of GNP and Government savings
have averaged about 3% of GDP. However, the expansion of the civil service
and the significant increases in Government salaries have resulted in a
slightly smaller current surplus in recent years.
8.         Fiji's Seventh Development Plan for 1976-80 projects a GNP growth
rate of 7% a year to be achieved mainly through increasing exports and
tourism, and wider Government participation in the development process. The
Plan also emphasizes development of those regions, particularly the rural
areas, which have not yet benefited significantly from previous economic
development. This would be accomplished through the identification of
potential growth centers which would then become focal points for agricultural,
industrial and other investments. The Plan also attaches high priority to
providing employment for the rapidly growing labor force.



- 3 -
9.         Taking into account Fiji's natural resources, the small size of
the domestic market and limited industrialization possibilities, the Plan
places a heavy reliance on increasing agricultural production. The basic
objectives of the Plan are: to increase agricultural output both for export
and domestic food consumption; to create rural employment opportunities; to
raise farm incomes; and to improve the quality of rural life relative to that
in urban areas.
10.        The overall rate of growth of investment is projected at about 11%
a year until 1980, which is considerably higher than the projected rate of
growth of 7% for the economy as a whole. Government investment is projected
to grow at 12% a year, a rate considered necessary to achieve the development
targets, and private investment is projected to expand at 10% a year. A major
structural change in the composition of the Government's capital investment
program under the new Plan compared with the previous Plan is the increase in
the share allocated to agriculture and rural development (from 16% to 23%).
In addition, the allocation for power has been considerably increased, mainly
for a phased development of hydroelectric schemes, which would reduce Fiji's
reliance on imported oil. About a quarter of the Government's program would
be financed from current savings, another quarter from domestic borrowing,
and the remaining half from external grants and loans.
11.        Fiji's impressive economic growth during the past decade was
mainly due to exogenous factors - tourism growth and high sugar prices - the
prospects of which do not appear bright at present. As the Government has not
yet worked out a concrete action program to deal with the revised economic
situation, the Plan targets should now be considered somewhat optimistic.
External Sector
12.        The short-term outlook for the balance of payments will depend
largely on the performance of sugar exports and tourism receipts. Export
earnings declined in 1976 by about 15%, mainly as a result of the decline in
the price of sugar. In 1977, they recovered somewhat following an increase
in sugar exports and a slight recovery in tourism. An increase in both
official and private capital inflows in 1977 helped Fiji to offset the
overall deficit in the current account. For the rest of the decade, it may
be expected that capital inflows will continue to offset the trade and
services deficits, so that Fiji should not encounter serious balance of
payments difficulties. Fiji's external reserves are at present equal to
about three months of imports.
13.        At the end of 1976, the level of external debt was about
US$130 million, of which about US$55 million was public. By the end of the
decade, the level of debt could increase to about US$300 million with public
debt accounting for about US$140 million of the total. Debt service payments
in 1976 were about 12% of export receipts. For the rest of the decade, the
debt service ratio is expected to remain at a level of about 15% to 16%. At
present, the Bank's share in Fiji's total debt outstanding is about 8% and in
total debt service about 2%. These ratios are expected to rise only moder-
ately in the years ahead.



- 4 -
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       The Bank has so far made five loans totaling US$35.2 million to
Fiji, which together have helped to finance four projects. (One of the five
loans provided supplemental financing for a highway project.) This lending
has been distributed among sectors as follows: transportation 46%; telecom-
munication 20%; and agriculture 34%. Implementation of these projects has
generally been satisfactory, but the highway project was subject to delays
and cost overruns.  Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as
well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
15.       The strategy for future lending is founded essentially on three
considerations: import substitution; export expansion; and assistance for
Fiji's subsistence population through the creation of rural employment
opportunities. In view of the severe limitations on Fiji's overall absorptive
capacity and the necessary constraints on Bank activity due to Fiji's small
size, Bank involvement will be limited to the agriculture and power sectors
and only four projects are proposed through FY83.
16.       Increasing agricultural production continues to be a utajor objective.
The agricultural sector represents Fiji's best potential for raising rural
incomes, substituting for imports, and expanding exports. Realization of
this potential would call for a larger allocation of resources to the sector,
diversification of crops, development of new land, and raising productivity.
Programs for agricultural development must also take into account the differing
characteristics of the two rural communities - the Fijians and the Indians.
Fijian agriculture is largely traditional subsistence farming based on the
cultivation of root crops. Indian farming, on the other hand, is more
market-oriented and consists of smallholder sugarcane with subsistence rice
and vegetable production.
17.       Two agricultural projects are under consideration.  The first would
assist Fiji's pine plantation scheme. Aside from its employment-creating
potential, the scheme offers considerable scope for diversifying Fiji's
exports. The second, and much more difficult project in the agricultural
sector, would aim at assisting smallholder development through the provision
of infrastucture, extension, credit, marketing, processing, and storage
facilities and would encompass both Indian and Fijian farmers in the subsis-
tence or near-subsistence sector. For some years now, the Bank has been
discussing possible forms of assistance for the subsistence sector, but thus
far no project has materialized.  This delay clearly reflects Government's
lack of basic knowledge about the subsistence sector and the recent origin
of their concern with subsistence agriculture. Bank staff will continue to
work with the Government to develop a project, but it will probably be
several years before project preparation can be completed.
18.       Meanwhile, the power sector offers an appropriate channel for
development assistance both for financing a priority project and as a basis
for a dialogue on general development policy. At present Fiji is totally
dependent on imported oil for its energy needs and therefore the worldwide
energy crisis affected Fiji severely. Despite strong efforts at conservation,



oil imports increased from US$10 million in 1973 to about US$25 million in
1976, or from 5% to 11% cf Fiji's total imports. The proposed project would
represent the first stage of developing Fiji's considerable hydroelectric
potential. A second stage project is anticipated in FY81.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Sectoral Background
19.        Provision of economic and reliable electricity is essential for
Fiji's development. However, at present the power sector comprises small and
isolated diesel power systems which do not permit further expansion on an
economic basis. The hydroelectric development program, of which the proposed
project forms the first stage, will help combine the existing systems into
one economic and integrated system, stabilize the cost of electricity, and
save large amounts of foreign exchange by sharply reducing the demand for
imported fuel.
Energy Resources
20.        Fiji has no krnown indigenous source of commercial energy other
than the substantial hydroelectric potential which exists around the Nandrau
Plateau of Viti Levu Island, an area of about 600 sq km at an average altitude
of 1,000 m and subject to an average annual rainfall of about 3,300 mm. The
available potential is estimated at about 2,000 GWh annually, of which about
80% could be economically developed by the end of the century, making it
unnecessary for Fiji to resort to any further increase in its diesel
generating capacity in Viti Levu until then.
Government Policy in the Power Sector
21.        In 1973, the Government constituted an Alternative Fuels Technical
Committee to deal with the difficult situation caused by the rapid escalation
of oil prices. The Comm:Lttee advised utilization of domestic rather than
imported energy resources to the extent possible, rationalization of the
power supply industry, and provision of electricity at the least possible
cost. It also recommended an extension of rural electrification. These
principles are incorporalted in Fiji's energy policy.
Structure of the Power Sector
22.        The power sector consists of two public undertakings, the Electricity
Department of the Suva C:Lty Council (SCCED) and the Fiji Electricity Authority
(FEA), and two major industries, sugar and gold mining, with captive generating
plants. The public undertakings account for about 75% of Fiji's power market
and the industries for the rest.  SCCED has about a two-thirds share of the
public supply and FEA about one-third.
23.         SCCED, a department of the Suva City Council and a licensee of
FEA, introduced electricity supply in Fiji in 1920. Today it operates 53 MW
of generating capacity, 20 MW of which was added in 1977, and it has about



- 6 -
23,000 consumers. SCCED's area of supply is confined to the capital city of
Suva and its environs. Lack of technical staff in SCCED has caused deterior-
ation in the reliability of electricity supply in the Suva city area with
frequent power cuts.
24.       FEA was established in 1966 with the sole responsibility for
electricity supply in Fiji, which it can discharge either by constructing and
operating its own installations or through its licensees. FEA's autonomy
is far-reaching and includes the power of borrowing, employing its staff,
and setting tariffs for itself and its licensees. FEA also has the power
to acquire licensees' installations. Initially, FEA had almost unlimited
power to acquire any property, particularly land, but this power has been
restricted after the promulgation of Fiji's 1970 Constitution. Approval by
the Supreme Court is now necessary when FEA resorts to compulsory acquisition
of property.
Reorganization of the Power Sector
25.       Reorganization of Fiji's power sector, which is now underway,
was urgently needed for the development of the country's hydroelectric
resources. The scope of the proposed project is too large for the FEA or
SCCED markets in isolation, but is appropriate when they are combined and an
integrated system is created. The heavy financial requirements for the
country's hydroelectric development program can only be met by a most effi-
cient system operation and by pooling of all sector revenues. In addition,
continued fragmented system operation will not attract a sufficient number of
capable, experienced management staff needed to operate the system efficiently
and to accelerate the training of Fijian staff.
26.       The practical way to develop an integrated power system in Fiji is
for FEA to take over SCCED and establish itself as the sole power authority
in the country. Recognizing this need for sector reorganization, FEA, with
the authorization of the Government, issued on January 25, 1978 a six-month
notice to take over the assets of SCCED and assumed responsibility for
SCCED's management, effective April 17, 1978, through an exchange of letters
between FEA and the Chief Administrator of the Suva City Council (letters
dated April 7 and 14, 1978).
27.       Completion of the acquisition of the SCCED assets requires an
approval of the Supreme Court which, under the Fiji Constitution, has, inter
alia, to ensure that any compulsory acquisition of land or property is in
the public interest. FEA has applied to the Supreme Court for such an approval,
and expeditious action by the Supreme Court is expected. To ensure that
implementation of the project is not jeopardized later by unforeseen compli-
cations in the takeover process, formal acquisition of the SCCED assets by
FEA has been made a condition of effectiveness of the loan (draft Loan
Agreement, Sections 4.03 and 7.01(c)).



-7-
28.       The question of- compensation to be paid by FEA to SCC for the
SCCED assets to be acquired continues to be an issue although it does not
restrain a legal merger of FEA and SCCED. Under the applicable legislation,
compensation has to be aigreed by the parties concerned within 30 days of
the Court order approving the takeover; otherwise the Court will determine
the amount of compensation. The compensation issue has been under active
discussion between FEA and the Chief Administrator of SCC, and FEA expects to
reach an agreement soon on terms and conditions acceptable to it. In order
to protect FEA's financial viability, the Government has agreed to ensure, in
particular by arranging ior FEA's tariffs to be set at a sufficient level,
that FEA has available at: all times sufficient funds for proper functioning
of its operations and for fulfilling all its financial obligations when they
become due (draft Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.02).
Unification of Tariffs
29.       In the past, SCCED, with the advantage of a limited supply area
and a larger scale of operations than FEA, has been able to maintain its
tariff levels about 30% below those of FEA. However, even if SCCED remained
independent, it would not: be able to maintain these low tariff levels in the
future because of the need to expand its diesel generating capacity with
increasing fuel cost. In fact, the tariffs in the SCCED supply area were
raised by an average of 20%, effective May 1, 1978 through a notice issued
by the Chief Administrator of SCC. Recognizing the need for unified tariffs
which would approximate the long run marginal cost of supply and would
provide necessary funds for Fiji's hydroelectric development program, FEA
has issued, with Government agreement, a notice that, as of August 1, 1978,
a nationwide standardizecd tariff will be introduced. This standardization
would result in an averagre revenue from all future FEA service areas (inclu-
ding the present SCCED supply area) no lower than FEA's current yield.
The Borrower - Fiji Elect:ricity Authority (FEA)
30.       FEA's corporate powers are vested in its Board, which consists of a
Chairman, a Deputy Chairman, and five members (not more than three public
officers), all of whom are appointed by the Minister of Communications, Works
and Tourism. The day-to--day duties are performed by FEA's staff, headed by a
General Manager. The incumbent General Manager is serving a three-year term,
which began in 1976. Administrative control of FEA rests with the Chairman
who is authorized to delegate his powers to any person he chooses. The
arrangement is working satisfactorily with the General Manager effectively in
control, but he has no statutory basis for the extensive authority he actually
wields. The Government has indicated its willingness to amend the FEA Act to
accord statutory recognition to the position of the General Manager, making
him a member of the Boardl. This change will be part of a more comprehensive
amendment to the FEA Act which is expected in about one year. A satisfactory
interim arrangement has been made by the Chairman formally delegating his
powers of administrative control to the General Manager under the existing
legislation.



-8-
31.        By 1986, FEA would require about 130 trained technicians and
25 assistant engineers, who, together with the existing nucleus of FEA's
top management, will enable FEA to develop its power system and operate it
efficiently. To meet these personnel requirements, FEA has established a
training center and developed a comprehensive training program.
32.        FEA's organization and management are efficient and well-equipped
to cope with present and future responsibilities. The organization is
led by an experienced and dynamic General Manager and by a small number of
dedicated professional engineers and administrators - mostly expatriates or
former expatriates turned Fiji citizens.
Status of Electricity Supply
33.        Except in the SCCED area, the reliability of supply is satis-
factory and distribution losses are reasonable. About 50X of the population
has access to electricity. The impact of the high cost of electricity is
discernible everywhere; demand growth is suppressed and there is little
waste.
Rural Electrification
34.       Rural electrification is being undertaken by both FEA and the
Public Works Department (PWD) of the Ministry of Communication, Works and
Tourism. FEA provides electricity to rural areas on a commercially viable
basis through the extension of its network. FEA's average annual rate of
connection to rural customers has been about 350. FWD deals with Government-
subsidized electrification of very remote areas through isolated diesel
generating sets. Since 1974, PWD's program has slowly gained momentum and so
far about 500 dwellings have been electrified. Surveys are being continuously
undertaken to determine the need for additional rural electrification.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Historical Background
35.       In 1972, preliminary investigations established that practical
schemes could be developed to utilize the hydroelectric potential of the
Nandrau Plateau. Between 1972 and 1975, detailed site investigations and
studies for a long-term power system development were carried out. On this
basis, a 20-year development program was drawn up which identified the
following schemes suitable for immediate development:



-9-
Installed    Estimated year
capacity     of completion
(a)  Monasavu-Wailoa Stage 1            40 MW           1981
(the proposed project)
(b)  Monasavu-Wailoa Stage 2             - /a           1982
(c)  Wainisavulevu 1                    30 MW           1984
(d)  Wainisavulevu 2                    15 MW           1986
/a  This project provides incremental energy generation only.
No increase in generating capacity is needed.
Oblectives of the Hydroelectric Development
36.       The hydroelectric development has the following objectives:
(a)  fuel savings:  recent estimates indicate that, during
the period FY82-86, savings in diesel fuel of about
420,000 barrels a year can be expected. The proposed
project alone would save around F$160 million (US$180 mil-
lion) in foreign exchange at present prices during the
life of the project;
(b)  institutional reform of the power sector through integ-
ration of the existing systems; and
(c)  reducing the need for tariff increases after FY84.
Items (b) and (c) in part:Lcular would facilitate rural electrification since
they would make electricity service affordable to low-income rural customers
who are presently beyond the reach of the urban power systems.
37.       Further expansion of the diesel generating capacity would not be
consistent with the objecitives described above. Therefore, FEA has agreed
that, before commissioning of the proposed project, no expansion of the
diesel generating capacity will be undertaken in the island of Viti Levu
without prior consultation with the Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.02).
FEA's Development Program and Its Costs
38.       FEA's development program consists of a series of hydroelectric
generating projects, a 132 kV transmission system, and an extension of the
existing 33 kV subtransmission systems and the low voltage distribution
network. The cost of the program during the period FY78-86 is summarized
below:

Total cost                  61.9   158.8    220.7
/a  Including the cost of future investigations.
Demand Trends and Forecasts
39.       During the five-year period, 1967-1972, electricity consumption as a
whole increased at an average annual rate of 18%. There was little growth in
1974 when steep tariff increases followed a quadrupling in the fuel costs.
Since then growth has been between 8% and 12% per annum.
40.       During 1972/73, consultants (ENEX) carried out a detailed survey
of the power market. In 1976, the power market was reviewed again by other
consultants (Gibb) and projections were made up to 1983, with trends extended
to the end of the century. The average growth rates are expected to be
about 8.5% per annum until 1983 and about 7.4% thereafter. The market
surveys carried out were adequate and the forecasts are realistic. They
indicate that additional generating capacity would be needed in the SCCED
supply area by 1980, and in the FEA area by 1981.
The Prolect
41.       The proposed project involves the construction of:
(a)  a 60 m high, 200 m long, embankment dam across the Nanuku River,
upstream of the Monasavu Falls (see map), and a diversion tunnel,
5 m in diameter and 325 m long;
(b) a concrete-lined low pressure tunnel (2.5 m in diameter and 2.4 km
long) terminating in a surge shaft;
(c) a steel-lined pressure shaft, 1.8 m in diameter, with an 850 m
sloping section (40 degrees), and a horizontal length of 2 km; and



- 11 -
(d) an overground power station on the right bank of the Wailoa River
designed for an ultimate installation of four 20 MW generator sets
of which two sets will be installed initially.
42.       Technical feasibility of the project has been well established,
providing a sound basis for the project design, the construction program and
the cost estimate. Detailed investigations have revealed that the Monasavu
dam will be a simple rockfill dam, with all materials for the core, filters
and rockfill available close at hand. Dam construction is further simplified
by the fact that the founLdation for the dam core is well defined. Only
moderate grouting will bE required.  The investigations have also revealed
that the tunnels would traverse mostly through sound rock.
As-ociated Transmission Facilities
43.       The first phase of FEA's transmission system development (Wailoa
Transmission System) consists of 140 km of single circuit 132 kV transmission
lines connecting the proposed project with Suva and Vunda, and a 132 kV
substation near the Wailoa Powerhouse. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is
considering financing th:Ls transmission system as a separate project. ADB's
appraisal mission conclucled that construction of the 132 kV transmission
lines should be completed a year ahead of the Monasavu-Wailoa Power Station,
to derive the beniefits of an integrated system operation and to avoid further
increase in the costly diesel generating capacity. Since timely completion of
the transmission facilitLes is essential for the operation of the proposed
project, satisfactory conclusion of the financing arrangements for these
transmission facilities laas been made a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed loan (draft Loan Agreement, Section 7.01(a)).
Project Implementation
44.       The Government, FEA, and its consultants have considered at length
the best method of constructing the project. In particular they took into
account Fiji's geographic remoteness, the need to commission the project by
1981, the need to strengthen Fiji's construction industry, and the cost
overruns and delays which have often occurred in Fiji when relying only on
forcign civil works contractors. On the basis of these considerations, they
decided to carry out the construction of the main embankment dam, spillway,
intake and powerhouse (about 25% of the project cost) by force account
through a Special Projects Division (SPD) to be established within FEA.
Contractors, selected after international competitive bidding, would be used
for other major civil works such as tunnelling, steel lining, and for supply
and erection of a generating plant and ancillary equipment. PWD and SPD
would build the access roads and the construction camps.
45.       SPD will be a construction division within FEA, organized as a
separate and autonomous unit. It will be mainly funded through the grant
(US$11.5 million) from the Australian Development Assistance Bureau (ADAB).
It will be headed by a superintending engineer who will be responsible to the



- 12 -
General Manager of FEA. The superintending engineer was selected by FEA in
consultation with the Bank and EIB, and took over his duties in February
1978. Consultants will supervise the construction work, examine and test
materials and workmanship, and advise SPD on procurement matters.
46.       In consultation with the Bank, FEA has appointed a Special Board of
Consultants (SBC) to review project design and construction, primarily for
ensuring safety of the project works, and to review the construction by force
account. Continued employment of consultants for such purposes on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of the proposed loan
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.02). As the first meeting of SBC is planned
for July 1978, which may fall before the signing of the proposed loan,
retroactive financing is proposed for the cost of the first meeting (esti-
mated to be US$11,000).
47.       FEA has also agreed to the following requirements related to the
establishment of SPD for force account construction of the items mentioned
in para. 44 above (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.06):
(a) preparation of plans, drawings, specifications, and detailed cost
estimates before undertaking any construction (for purposes of
control);
(b) maintenance of separate accounts by SPD;
(c) consultation with the Bank on the organizational structure of
SPD and on the appointment of its key personnel; and
(d) consultation with the Bank before SPD undertakes any additional
work other than that specifically agreed upon (to ensure that SPD
develops rapidly to the status of an independent contractor).
48.       The construction arrangement proposed by FEA, with the safeguards
described in para. 47 above, would enable completion of construction by the
target date of 1981 and would help develop local expertise and the construction
industry for major civil works of the future power development program.
Engineering
49.       After a review of proposals from interested firms, FEA has appoint-
ed Gibb as the main consultant for engineering and construction supervision.
Agreement has been reached on the preparation and implementation of a
satisfactory program of inspection and maintenance of the project works
throughout the operational period (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.04).
Land Acquisition
50.       Land acquisition for the proposed project as well as procurement
of the right-of-way for the associated transmission lines are on the critical
path of the construction program. Consequently, EIB included in its loan
documents, which were negotiated in November 1977, a covenant requiring the



- 13 -
Government to guarantee that FEA will have available by July 1, 1978 all
land necessary for implementation of the project. In conformity with the
EIB covenant, a similar condition has been incorporated in the documents of the
proposed loan (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.05). However, FEA has now
acquired most of the rights to use the land necessary for the project, and no
difficulties are expected in completing land use acquisition.
Cost Estimates
51.       The total project cost is estimated at US$54.0 million, of which
US$40.3 million (about 75%) would be in foreign exchange. The details of
the cost estimates are given in the Project Summary at the beginning of this
report. The estimates are based on late 1977 prices. The costs for the dam
have been calculated on the basis of preliminary designs. The cost estimates
for tunnelling are based on surveys made and on recent construction experience
in Australia, and those for equipment are based on enquiries with potential
manufacturers. Physical contingencies varying from 5% for steel lining to
20% for main civil works (dam and tunnels) have been allowed. Price contin-
gencies for the foreign costs have been provided at 9% during FY78-79, and
8% during FY80-81, and for the local costs at 7.5% during FY78-79, and 7%
during FY80-81. No customs duties or local taxes are being levied on
imports or services.
Financing of the Project
52.       The funds necessary to implement the proposed project would be
raised through co-financing arrangements involving the Bank, the European
Investment Bank (EIB), the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), the
Australian Development Assistance Bureau (ADAB), the Fiji National Provident
Fund (FNPF) with other local financing institutions, and the Government of
Fiji. Signing of the EIB and CDC loan agreements has been made a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan (draft Loan Agreement, Section 7.01(b)).
There are certain constraints in the financing plan due to the following
preferences of the various financing agencies:
(a) EIB prefers to enter into a joint financing arrangement with the
Bank;
(b) ADAB intends to provide grant funds to the Government for financing
the cost of consultants and the cost of experts and equipment for
construction, procured in Australia. However, some additional funds
are expected to be made available in an untied fashion for financing
other items; and
(c) CDC and FNPF intend to provide general purpose financing;
53.       Considering the above co-financing possibilities and constraints,
the following financing plan is envisaged for the project:

(c)  Total financing requirement                                      63.4 /a
/a The financing requirement comprises the total project cost of
US$54.0 million (para. 51), estimated interest during construction
of US$5.3 million, and that portion of the plant and establishment
cost of SPD (US$4.1 million) which is not included in the project
and will be charged to other projects.
Disbursement
54.       The proposed Bank loan of US$15 million represents about 24% of the
total financing requirement. Disbursements would be made for 44% of the
total cost of the eligible items on the basis of certified invoices. EIB
will disburse jointly with the Bank at the rate of 42% of the total cost of
the same items as the Bank. This is appropriate in the context of the
co-financing arrangements.
Procurement
55.       Procurement of the goods and services would be handled separately
for those sections of the project to be executed through contracts and those
executed by force account (para. 44). For all goods and services procured by
contract, and jointly financed by the Bank and EIB, international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines would be used. No local
preference for equipment would apply since Fiji does not manufacture the
equipment required for the project. The country is also ineligible for local
preference for civil works contracts due to its high GNP per capita level.
Contractors for Bank-financed civil works would be prequalified in consul-
tation with the Bank. Procurement for force account work would be the respon-
sibility of the Special Project Division and the consultants.



- 15 -
Financial Position
56.       The Government's decision to embark on a large hydroelectric program
was made to stabilize the high cost of electricity (presently about USJ 7.8
per kWh generated, mainly due to the high cost of diesel fuel and expensive
operation of small and fragmented subsystems), to save large amounts of fuel
and foreign exchange, and to utilize the domestic energy resources to the
extent possible. However, financing of the program will place a heavy burden
on the Fijian economy and FEA, particularly during the early years of program
implementation (FYs 78-81). To enable implementation of the proposed project,
about 80% of the financial requirement has to be raised from sources abroad.
This appears very high, biut is still justified in the light of Fiji's small
economy which, despite a comparatively high per capita GNP (US$1,150 in
1976), has not developed a domestic capital market strong enough to finance a
larger portion than 20% of the financing requirement.
57.       Although FEA's tariff levels would be set approximately at the
level of the long-run marginal cost of supply, there would still be a need
for large amounts of Government capital contributions, because FEA's own
contribution to investment as well as debt service coverage would be relatively
low. After adjustment oif tariffs in the SCCED supply area to the national
level (para. 29), FEA plans to raise tariffs in step with the increases which
would be required if, instead of the hydro development, the equivalent diesel
development were undertalken, to avoid placing a heavier financial burden on
its customers than the alternative thermal development would have required.
58.       At present, FEA and SCCED are recording their assets at historic
costs. A large part of their assets are outdated and, in the case of SCCED,
the remaining useful life of the assets may be shorter than the date of
purchase suggests due to inadequate maintenance in the past. Fiji does not
compile indices monitoring price trends in the construction industry on which
a reasonable asset revaluation could be based. However, FEA officials have
agreed to undertake a proper asset valuation after physical takeover of the
SCCED assets and to design a practicable revaluation mechanism. The initial
valuation would be made on the basis of engineering appraisals with the
assistance of experts. Consequently, the following tariff covenants
have been incorporated (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.05 (b), (c)):
(a) that FEA would revalue its assets, based on a method acceptable to
the Bank, from FY79 and continuously thereafter at the end of each
fiscal year; and
(b) that FEA, in agreement with the Bank, would establish an appropriate
rate of return on revalued average net fixed assets in operation
(which will be sufficient to cover its operating expenses, interest
and repayment of debt, annual compensation payments to SCC, and a
reasonable portion of its investment program) and would maintain
its tariffs at levels necessary to produce such annual rate of
return.
59.       Despite the high level of its tariffs, FEA will go through a period
of tight finances during the project construction period. For instance, no



- 16 -
significant internal cash generation can be expected between FY78 and FY81.
Consequently, an agreement has been reached that FEA would consult with the
Bank prior to finalizing its annual financing plans during the project construc-
tion period (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.04). Furthermore, an agreement
was reached on Government capital contributions of not less than F$23.76
million /1 in accordance with FEA's financial requirements (draft Guarantee
Agreement, Section 2.02). To ensure a reasonable capitalization, agreement
was also reached that FEA would maintain a maximum debt/equity ratio of 70/30
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.05(a)).
Project Justification
60.       On the basis of the demand forecast (para. 40), additional
generating capacity will be required by 1981. In the studies which compared
the least-cost hydroelectric development program with the most economic
alternative of thermal/diesel expansion, it was established that the hydro-
electric program represents the most economical solution for meeting the
expected demand for discount rates up to 13%. It was also established
that, within the range of the discount rates chosen (9%-13%), the sequence of
projects with the proposed Monasavu-Wailoa project as the initial stage has
the lowest cost. The internal economic rate of return of the project is 18%;
this is high and reflects the policy that the tariffs would be set at a level
at least equal to the long-run marginal cost of supply. The proposed project
is expected to bring about foreign exchange savings of US$180 million
during its life through conservation of diesel fuel (para. 36). The project
would also improve Fiji's power supply industry through the proposed integra-
tion of FEA and SCCED.
Environment
61.       No significant environmental problems will result from the
project as it would only create a relatively small reservoir in the remote
forests of the Nandrau Plateau. There is no habitation in the waterspread of
the proposed reservoir, or fish in the Nanuku River, nor are there any
artifacts of any significance which will be affected. According to
the Department of Health, there are no diseases existing in the rest of Fiji
which do not exist in the area adjacent to the dam site. The environmental
effects of the project are therefore likely to be minimal and within the
capacity of the Fiji authorities to cope with.
Risks
62.       The risks associated with the proposed project are the uncertainties
inherent in all hydroelectric projects, such as possible geological problems,
hydrological complexities, and similar matters. However, the thorough and
competent preparatory work undertaken by FEA and the consultants, as well
as the precautions taken in organizing and supervising the construction work
(such as the establishment of the Special Board of Consultants), are expected
to keep the risks to a minimum.
/1 This includes the ADAB grant of F$10.5 million (US$11.5 million equivalent).

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
63.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Fiji Electricity
Authority, the draft Guarantee Agreement between Fiji and the Bank, and the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank are being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors.
64.       Special conditionis of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III. Formal acquisiltion of the SCCED assets by FEA, signing of EIB and
CDC loan agreements, and conclusion of satisfactory financing arrangements
for the Wailoa Transmission System have been made additional conditions of
effectiveness of the proposed loan (draft Loan Agreement, Section 7.01).
65.       I am satisfied tlhat the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
66.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 771-FIJ          First Highway Project:  US$11.8 Million Loan of
June 30, 1971 and US$4.2 Million Supplementary Loan
of February 1, 1973; Effectiveness Dates: September 24,
1971 and March 5, 1973; Closing Dates: December 31,
1977 and March 31, 1978.
The first Bank project in Fiji provided financing for: detailed
engineering of the 110 mile Nandi-Suva road in three sections, (1) Nandi-
Korotongo (41 mi), (2) Korotongo-Deumba (43 mi), and (3) Deumba-Suva (26 mi);
construction of Sections (1) and (3); and supervision of construction by
consultants. The construction of section (1) was completed in August 1976,
and that of section (3) is nearing completion. Sharp price increases in fuel,
materials and labor since the contract was awarded in May 1972 have substan-
tially increased the project cost. The supplementary Bank loan covered part
of this cost overrun. The Government is providing the rest of the required
funds.
Loan No. 833-FIJ          First Telecommunications Project: US$2.2 Million
Loan of June 23, 1972; Effectiveness Date: September 28,
1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
The project financed part of the 1971-75 development program of the
Department of Posts and Telecommunications (P&T). The project works are
virtually completed and the loan will be closed in mid-1978, one year behind
the original schedule. P&T's financial position is sound and will be improved
following the Government's recent approval of tariff increases.
Loan No. 1140-FIJ        Second Telecommunications Project: US$5.0 Million
Loan of July 16, 1975; Effectiveness Date: October 23,
1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1980.
Execution of the project is proceeding satisfactorily with delivery
and installation of equipment in progress, but the completion is expected to
be delayed by about one year.
Loan No. 1226-FIJ        Sugar Development Project: US$12.0 Million Loan of
April 23, 1976; Effectiveness Date: July 13, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project includes land clearance, farm development and settlement
of 400 families for growing sugarcane; construction and upgrading of main and
feeder roads; a sugar tramline extension; sites and services for a township;
construction of seawalls, tidal gates and drainage systems; and procurement
of tractors, transport vehicles and equipment for road construction. The



ANNEX II
Page 3
project is progressing satisfactorily. Settlement is progressing generally
in line with appraisal esl:imates, while drainage improvement has fallen about
one year behind schedule due to staffing problems which are slowly being
overcome. Disbursements to date are about 30% behind schedule. Higher land
clearing, production, harvesting and transport costs, and a slower buildup of
project benefits have reduced the estimated economic rate of return for the
settlement part of the project from 20% to about 15%. There have been some
departures from the agreed guidelines for settler selection, but the project
management is taking firm steps to ensure that the guidelines are strictly
followed in the future.
