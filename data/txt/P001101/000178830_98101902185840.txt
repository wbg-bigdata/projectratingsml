REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST
FOR THE THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Loan to the Republic of the Ivory Coast for the equivalent of US$17.5
million to help finance a project for road maintenance and improvement.
The loan would have a term of 22 years, including five years of grace,
with interest at 7-1/4 percent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on the Ivory Coast, Report No
AW-28a, "Economic Growth and Prospects of the Ivory Coast", Summary and
three volumes, November 9, 1971, confirmed the country's creditworthiness.
This report analyzed the country's economic growth record, which had been
very favorable by international standards. It concluded that prospects
for further development remain excellent and that the Government's devel-
opment efforts deserve continued support from external aid donors. For
the near term (1972-74), however, the report foresaw a temporary setback
in growth. The economic mission, which visited Ivory Coast early this
year and which is now preparing its report, found these conclusions largely
confirmed. Annex II gives the country data for the Ivory Coast.
3.        Throughout the post-war period, Ivory Coast's economic growth
has been spectacular. GDP has grown at a rate of seven percent per year
in real terms and per capita GDP (about US$300) has more than doubled
since 1950. This success can-be largely ascribed to the Government's
liberal and pragmatic economic policies, the availability of ample land
and timber, the. unchecked inflow of foreign capital and know-how and the
immigration of large numbers of African workers from neighboring countries.
Pn important feature of development policy was the emphasis which was placed
on the diversification of agriculture, especially cash crops, and the en-
couragement given to industry.  As a result of these measures, the Ivory
Coast is gradually becoming less dependent on a few major export commod-
ities.
4.        The Government's development strategy remains essentially directed
towards further diversification of production.   The Five-Year Development
Plan 1971-75 sets out the Government's principal objectives. These are (a)
continued diversification and modernization of agricultural production; (b)
industrialization geared to import substitution as well as the stimulation
of non-traditional exports; (c) balanced regional development with increased
emphasis on the less developed north and south-west parts of the country;
(d) improved social conditions, particularly housing, urban development and
health; (e) increased participation of Ivorians at all levels of the economy.



-2-
5.        On the whole, these objectives correspond well to the needs and
the possibilit-ies of the country. -The emphasis on certain social needs
and regional balance is much stronger than in the past Plan. This cor-
responds to an increased awareness on the part of the Government that
the benefits of progress should be shared by all sections of the population
and in all parts of the country. In spite of this awareness the Plan does
not come to grips fully with urbanization and urban unemployment as well
as inequality of incomes. In spite of these shortcomings, the Plan remains
a useful guide for action.
6.        While the main emphasis in the Development Plan is on fostering
directly productive activities in agriculture, forestry and industry, the
Plan does reserve a sizeable proportion of funds to the expansion of econ-
omic infrastructure. Projects in power, transportation, telecommunications,
water supply and urban development are together to receive 44 percent of
total public investment under the Plan. This attention to infrastructure
needs is a continuation of one of the features of past development strategy.
However, in spite of heavy investments throughout the 1960's, the Ivory
Coast is still in need of vital improvements in its infrastructure. Devel-
opment objectives in agriculture, forestry and industry cannot be achieved
without these investments. Transportation projects serve to open up re-
mote areas of the country thus providing the basis for balanced regional
development, which is one of the Plants key objectives. As will be dis-
cussed in part IV, the project under consideration has been designed to
serve these objectives.
7.        Past and ongoing development has laid a solid foundation for
further growth. Possibilities in many areas remain excellent and the in-
tense investment activity of the Government and the private sector indicate
that these possibilities are being recognized and exploited. Despite un-
certainties of a few large investment projects and of the market prospects
for major export commodities, growth in the next ten to fifteen years is
likely to remain well ahead of population growth (3.5 percent a year).
The Development Plan estimates that economic growth during the 1970's
will be close to eight percent a year in real terms. Although the Plan
appears in some respects too ambitious,the longer term growth potential
is probably not much below the high growth rates of the past.
8.        While long-term growth prospects therefore are favorable, the
economy is currently experiencing a slight setback which is likely to
continue for the next few years.  Economic growth during 1972-74 is
likely to be at most five percent a year. There are several reasons for
the temporary slowdown in growth.  First, terms of trade have become less
favorable and are unlikely to-improve in the near future. Import prices
have been rising fast since 1970 while cocoa prices dropped to almost half
the level of early 1970. Second, the growth impetus of the three major ex-
port commodities has drastically declined. Since cocoa and coffee will con-
tinue to face saturated markets, there is no sound basis for large pro-
duction increases. Timber production has reached a plateau, because the
most valuable species are becoming scarce. Third, production increases
from past diversification in plantation agriculture and industry will
only occur in the second half of the decade. The result of all this is
likely to be lower than usual economic growth during the next few years.



-3-
9.        The slowdown in economic growth which has manifested itself
since 1970 is leading to a declining growth of government revenue and
a drop in public savings. In particular, the sharp drop of cocoa prices
has hurt public savings. The shortfall in public savings due to this
cause was equivalent to one-sixth of public investment last year and
will be the equivalent of about one-fourth of public investment in 1972.
The resulting tight financial situation moved the Government to introduce
austerity policies in the 1972 budget with regard to public spending. In
spite of these measures it was necessary to reduce total budgeted public
investment by 16 percent below the 1971 level. To finance its essentially
sound development program, the Government will, therefore, have to make
further adjustments particularly with regard to administrative expenditures.
Education expenditures have also been rising rapidly and even though the
needs in this sector are large, economy measures may be in order.
10.       In spite of certain shortcomings in current expenditure policies,
the Government is continuing its impressive fiscal performance. Compared
with other developing countries, the Ivory Coast has a high level of tax
revenues - 20 percent of GDP plus sizeable quasi-fiscal revenues - and
high public savings - 10 percent of GDP in 1968-70 and 7.5 percent in
1971.  The austerity measures show the Government's determination to main-
tain this record in the face of more difficult economic circumstances.
11.       Even if the Government's efforts at resource mobilization are
successful, the implementation of the Development Plan will require a
large increase in foreign aid'. For 1972-74, the needs for aid disburse-
ments (grant and loan funds) are estimated at $140 million per year as
compared to about $70 million'in 1970 and $100 million in 1971. The prin-
cipal sources of development finance for the Ivory Coast remain France and
the European Economic Community. The United States, the Federal Republic
of Germany, Italy and Canada will probably furnish moderate amounts of
capital. In the past'several years, four donors supplied nearly all foreign
aid disbursements: France, 50 percent; Italy, 17 percent; EEC, 13 percent;
and USA, 8 percent. Italy granted. more than half of all supplierst credits.
12.       With these large aid requirements, the terms of aid are becoming
increasingly important. To prevent an excessive increase in debt service,
the Government intends to limit the use of commercial credits. At the same
time, sources of official development assistance should be prepared to soften
the terms of their aid. In view of its favorable level of external reserves,
its satisfactory growth prospects and its still not excessive debt service
ratio, the Ivory Coast should be able to service additional debt on conven-
tional terms. However, the rapid increase in aid requirements could soon
lead to debt service difficulties, particularly from the fiscal point of
view,and a certain amount of concessionary financing is therefore desirable.
13.       At the same time, aid donors should be prepared to finance a
relatively high proportion of'project coat, including part of the local
expenditures of projects with low import content. The recent economic
mission estimates that given appropriate fiscal performance, about 40
percent of public investment during 1972-74 will be financed from public
savings. Hlowever, a sizeable proportion of public investment consists of
projects which are not likely to attract foreign financing such as admin-
istrative buildings and certain investments in social infrastructure. To
avoid1 serious financial difficulties for the Government, external financing
should average about 70 percent of project cost.



PART II --BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE IVORY COAST
14.       The Bank's role in development financing in the Ivory Coast has
expanded rapidly since 1968. Since that date, the Bank has made nine loans
to the Ivory Coast totalling US$68.9 million. Two of these have been for
roads; five were made to the member companies of the SODEPALM Group for the
-development of oil palm and coconut plantations and the construction of two
oil mills; the remaining two loans were for education and cocoa. A loan for
a rubber plantation project, US$6.7 million, is expected to be negotiated in
the near future.
15.       The First Highway Project (Loan 542, June 21, 1968, US$5.8 million)
provided for the construction of the Abengourou-Agnibilekrou road (60 km.)
and feasibility-and engineering studies. It was amended in 1971 to include
additional detailed engineering, and has now been substantially and success-
fully completed. Part of the detailed engineering for the Second Highway
Project (Loan 761, June 22, 1971, US$20.5 million), which included the con-
struction of the Yabayo-Man and Bouak6-Katiola roads (287 km.), was financed
under Loan 542. Execution of the second project is proceeding on schedule
with the award of the construction contracts having been made in March and
April of this year. Annex I contains a summary statement of Bank Loans and
notes on the execution of on-going projects with particular reference to those
which are encountering problems in execution and giving rise to delay in dis-
bursement.
16.       Although the Ivory Coast is making a major effort to broaden the
base of its economy through industrialization, the principal foreign exchange
earner and domestic employer remains the agricultural sector. Agriculture
has demonstrated the greatest comparative advantage and since it is agricul-
ture that will continue to provide close to 90 percent of exports, create job
opportunities, help to stabilize an increasingly mobile population and bring
development to remote areas of the country, the Bank's principal efforts in
the identification and preparation of projects is in this area. Other aid
suppliers such as the European Development Fund, the Fonds d'Aide et de
Cooperation and the Caisse Centrale de Coop6ration Economique (CCCE) have
also been active in financing agricultural development. We expect, however,
to continue to direct a substantial proportion of our lending to this sector.
We are currently financing cocoa studies under Loan 686 which should lead to
a project by 1975 and are participating with the CCCE in preparing a rice
project in the West of the Ivory Coast. A 13,500 ha. rubber plantation pro-
ject is nearing the point of negotiation and should be presented to the Board
early in FY 73. We expect that the Ivory Coast may seek our assistance in
additional oil palm, coconut and rubber development.
17.       In support of agricultural development, we have placed secondary
stress on transportation, and the Bank has become the principal lender for
this sector. This is largely due to the fact that the Bank was closely as-
sociated, as Executing Agency, with the UNDP Transport Survey of the Ivory
Coast. We expect that projects identified by this survey will continue to
be submitted to the Bank for financing in the next few years, in particular
the Abidjan-Sikensi, Abidjan-Agboville, Yabayo-Gagnoa and Katiola-Badikaha
roads.



-5-
18.       Urban infrastructure and education are two important social sec-
tors in which we have a role to play although our financial participation
is expected to remain relatively modest. The UNDP has financed a study
of the sanitation needs of Abidjan and it is expected that the first phase
of this study will provide the basis for an urban sanitation project for
Abidjan in the near future. Substantial investments are also foreseen for
telecommunications and, in the later years, for industry, power, and pos-
sibly tourism, areas in which we have not previously been involved, but
in which the Government foresees the need for the Bank's participation.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
19.       The country's basic network of first class roads has not kept
pace with its economic development. The road network has developed rapidly
since the mid-forties, growing from some 10,000 km. to over 30,000 km. Over
6,000 km. of these roads are designed for heavy traffic, but only about
1,300 km. have been given a bituminous pavement. In spite of widely dis-
persed economic activity and a scattered population, the highway network
serves adequately most of the country except some undeveloped areas which
are not tied into the road system.  The rapid growth in economic activity
was accompanied by a substantial traffic increase which resulted in dete-
rioration of the network because, in spite of the Government's efforts,
maintenance has not kept pace with requirements. The project will assist
the Government in correcting this deficiency.  Whdle roads form the major
transport infrastructure of the country, the main link with the north of
the country and Upper Volta is the railway line between Abidjan and Ouaga-
dougou. External commerce is carried out principally through the port of
Abidjan; the new port of San Pedro has, however, commenced operations in
1971.
20.       In 1968, the United Nations Development Programme, with the Bank
as Executing Agency, financed a transport survey of the country. The con-
clusion the survey reached in its first phase was that major emphasis must
be-given to upgrading the country's basic road network, which is the back-
bone of the transport system. The survey calls for the construction or
improvement of more than 1,700 km. of roads including strengthening of,
about 400 km. The Government's new Five-Year Plan also points out the
need to reduce the cost of transport by improving the quality of the road
network to encourage comnerce and assist in the development of areas of
the country which are remote from the coast.
21.       The transport sector absorbs a large part of public investment.
In 1970 and 1971 investments were high because of the San Pedro project,
the first stage of which is nearing completion. The three-year invest-
ment program lists road projects totalling CFAF 11.0 billion (75 percent
of transport investment) in 1972, CFAF 10.2 billion in 1973 and CFAF
12.1 billion in 1974. The Government's road development plans for the
next several years include the following major elements: better main-
tenance and improvement of the road infrastructure in agricultural areas



-6
including secondary roads; strengthening and paving the road links bet-
ween Abidjan and the West of the country; and the improvement of the
direct route north to Mali and Upper Volta, which parallels the railroad
but carries a substantial volume of local traffic. Redirection of the
western timber traffic along new roads toward the port of San'Pedro is
already being done. Studies of a coastal road link with Ghana are also
being undertaken.'
22.       Transport regulations, which concern mainly road transport
because of its predominance in the country, are established by the Gov-
ernment. They are aimed at the creation of a road transport industry
which is economically viable, efficient and responsive to changes in cost
and demand. On the whole it appears that these objectives are being met.
An area of governmental policy where changes might,be advisable in the
near future is road user taxation. In'order to formulate a more rational
road user taxation policy a study is being carried out with funds remain-
ing in the budget of the UDNP Transport Survey. The Government is also
aware of the need to coordinate investments between competing modes of
transport and studies,are now being made of the relative merits of ini-
vestment in the railway and the roads where they serve the same areas.
23.       In recent years, the Ivory Coast has undertaken a major program
of road construction. The maintenance capacity of the Public Works Depart-
ment has not, however, kept pace with the growth of the network and main-
tenance was neglected.  The need to maintain existing'road infrastructure
has, therefore, become a priority of the Government. The present project
will allow the Government to consolidate the progress made in the extension
and improvement of the road network.
PART IV -. THE PROJECT
24.       The project consists of the'following elements with a capital
cost of US$29.0 million including taxes (see' Annex III):
a)  a.four-year maintenance program which is a first
phase of a long-term program, providing for: i)
the improvement of routine maintenance operations
on about 70 percent of the highway network; and-
ii) the execution of betterment works on about
1,600 km. of gravel and earth roads;,
b) the strengthening, partial realignment and widening
of about 110 km. of existing paved highways between-
Sikensi-NtDouci, N'Douci-Divo and N'Douci-Toumodi
and the reconstruction of a bridge on the Boubo river;
c) supervision by consultants of the strengthening works;
and
d) a feasibility study and detailed engineering of an
urban development project in Abidjan.



-7-
25.       The project was identified by the UNDP Transport Survey and
was appraised in November-December of last year. An appraisal report
(PTR-115a, dated June 2, 1972) entitled "Third Highway Project" is being
distributed separately. The preinvestment studies for the maintenance
and betterment program and the road and bridge construction were carried
out by the French consulting firm SETEC, under a Transport Survey of the
Ivory Coast financed by UNDP. The detailed engineering for item b)
above was also prepared by SETEC, but with funds provided under Loan No
542 (First Highway Project), as amended. Negotiation of the project took
place from the 17th to the 20th of May of this year. The Ivorian dele-
gation was led by Mr. Hovine, Director General of the Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement, and included Mr. Boni, the Director General of Public
Works, Mr. Kra, Ministry of Planning, Mr. Cames, Atelier d'urbanisme
d'Abidjan, and Mr. Naka, Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement.
26.       The maintenance program will benefit mainly four of the seven
regional divisions of the Public Works Department, and is expected to
improve maintenance on about 70 percent of the country's road network.
The appraisal report notes that the country's road network has deterio-
rated over the past five years, and that there is a backlog of deferred
maintenance.  This situation is due largely to the insufficiency of funds
allocated to maintenance and the lack of qualified personnel. The pro-
ject provides for the provision of new workshops and offices, additional
equipment and vehicles and technical assistance. The Public Works'
Planning Unit will also be strengthened and a classroom constructed
to provide additional training capacity for the Department's Equipment
Division.
27.       Approximately 1,600 km. of secondary roads will be improved
under the project. The roads to be improved will be selected annually
in consultation with the Bank; the works, which include regravelling and
improved drainage, will be executed by the Periodic Maintenance Division
of' the Public Works Department. The Bank would participate in financing
equipment, culverts and technical assistance required in the operations
of the Division. The Bank would also finance the fuel and spare parts
required to operate the units carrying out the betterment works, and
which constitute part of the capital cost of these works. Disbursement
for these items, which are expected to cost about US$1.8 million in
foreign exchange, would be made on the basis of a fixed amount of
US$1,100 per km. of road improved.
28.       The other major part of the project consists in the strengthen-
ing, partial realignment and widening of the roads between Sikensi-N'Douci
and N'Douci and Divo and Toumodi. These three sections of road lie at the
heart oi- the Ivory Coast's principal road axis from Abidjan to the Center,
North and 'West of the country. They were paved to low engineering stand-
ards more than 12 years ago, presently carry heavy traffic and have reached
the stage at which rapid' deterioration of the pavement is imminent. A
bridge on the Boubo river near Divo would also be reconstructed to replace
an existing bridge which is closed to heavy vehicles because of structural
failure, thus obliging 'such vehicles to make a 42 km. detour. Recon-
struction of these roads and the bridge is expected to effect substantial
road user and maintenance savings.

Taxes represent US$5.2 million.   Of the net cost of US$23.8 million, the
Bank would finance US$17.5 million, US$16 million representing foreign
exchange expenditures, and US$1.5 million, local costs.   The Government
of the Ivory Coast would contribute US$6.3 million to cover the remaining
local costs and would also contribute US$44.8 million over 4 years to'cover
the recurrent costs of the highway maintenance program'. Assurances were
obtained from'the Government during negotiations that sui'ficient funds will
be allocated for road maintenance.
30.       The Bank would thus be financing 60 percent of project cost in-
cluding taxes, or 73 percent net of taxes. This is a somewhat larger pro-
portion of project costs than it has covered in the past for Ivorian pro-
jects. As noted above (paragraph 9), the price decline of some of the
Ivory Coast's major export commodities will result in a shortfall of gov-
ernment revenues, compared to the period 1968/70, of about CFAF 10 billion
representing close to one-fourth of the Ivory Coast's annual public invest-
ments. The Government has taken measures to reduce the growth of current
expenditures, but it will still be forced to curtail planned investments.
Under the circumstances, I consider it reasonable'to accede to the Gov-
ernment's request to finance a larger proportion of project cost than in
the past, thus permitting it to carry out a larger program of needed in-
vestments than would otherwise be possible. The Bank loan would be for
a term of 22 years, including a grace period of 5 years. The term of the
loan is based on the expected life of the road strengthening, bridge and
other construction works included in the project.
31.       Procurement:  The Public Works Department in the Ministry of
Public Works and Transport will be responsible for the execution of the
project and will be assisted by consultants. The betterment works'will
be carried out by departmental forces. Workshop and road maintenance
equipment and vehicles, and culverts for the betterment works, having
a;total cost of about US$5.5 million, would be procured in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines. The Ivory Coast extends preferential duties
on imports from EEC countries; however, the Government will evaluate bids



_ 9-_
for equipment and supplies to be utilized by the Public Works Department
on the basis of c.i.f. cost. The civil works for the strengthening and
realignment works and bridge construction, costing US$8.3 million, would
be carried out by contractors and will also be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding. Construction contracts for workshops,
offices and a classroompabout US$400,000, would be bid separately because
of different timing requirements. Although international competitive bid-
ding would apply, contracts would be advertised only in West Africa,
because of their small size. Consultants' services, including experts
for the maintenance program and the betterment works, supervision of
construction and the urban development study, costing a total of US$3.3
million, would be contracted with consulting firms, although the Ministry
may hire some of the experts on an individual basis. Fuel and spare parts,
costing about US$3.0 million, for the betterment works would be procured
on the basis of quotations from local suppliers.
32.       The Government requested that the Bank permit a preference for
local suppliers of vehicles for the projectj, and the Bank has agreed to
a preference of 15 percent or the amount of the duties on the trucks and
cars whichever is lower, provided that the price of the locally assembled
vehicles includes at least 20 percent of value added in the Ivory Coast.
33.       urban giyvlonaLtnsv:      The loan would provide funds for an
urban transport and infrastructure study costing about US$850,000. This
study was identified by a Bank mission in September 1970 on the basis of
a master plan for the city of Abidjan which gives a high priority to the
development of the, Banco zone directly west of Abidjan proper. It includes
feasibility studies and detailed engineering of an urban road system needed
to improve the connection between the Banco zone and the rest of the city,
and the study of the necessary infrastructure for development of low-income
residential areas within the Banco zone, primarily of local streets, water,
sanitation, and power distribution. The terms of reference for the study
were prepared by the Special Projects Department and the Government selected
the BCEOM consulting firm to carry out the study, after inviting proposals
from five international consulting firms. No work has yet been undertaken
by BCEOM on it and the terms of reference for the study will have to be
revised to take account of a transit study the Government is undertaking
and of new development, in particular,public housing programs, taking
place in the Banco area.
34.       Rate of Return: The four main parts of the project have been
analyzed separately on the basis of savings in transport costs. The
internal rates of return of the maintenance and betterment works were
each found to be about sa percent or more, and a sensitivity analysis,
using conservative assumptions .indicated that the rates of return would
not be less than 25 percent. With regard to the strengthening works, the
rate of return was found to be between 16 percent and 29 percent, and not
less than 12 percent using conservative assumptions. The rate of return
for the Boubo bridge would be over 50 percent. All of the investments
would, therefore, appear to be well justified for the Ivory Coast.

36.       The Loan Agreement conforms substantially to the pattern of
recent agreements used for highway projects. As a condition of effec-
tiveness of this Loan, the Borrower is required to employ consultants
acceptable to the Bank for the supervision of construction of the roads
included in the Project, the highway maintenance program and the reor-
ganization of the Department of Public Works.
37.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
36.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan.

B.        The five loans to the SODEPALM Group (Loans 611, 612 and 613,
June 13, 1969, US$17.1 million, First Oil Palm and Coconut Project; and
759 and 760, June 22, 1971, US$7.0 million, Second Oil Palm and Coconut
Project) are being implemented satisfactotily, although disbursements
have been slow due to the availability to the Group of local short-term
funds and a better cash flow than was expected. Disbursements are now
resuming. The last two loans to the Group, Nos. 759 and 760, have not
yet become effective, although the project is proceeding well. Failure
of the loans to become effective is due to the fact that the Government
enacted a new Companies Law, which could affect our Loan Agreements with
the SODEPALM Group.  This-matter is in process of being resolved.
The Education Loan, Loan No. 667, April 27, 1970, US$11.0 million
was amended to exclude from the project one of the 11 educational institu-
tions to be constructed and to reallocate the proceeds of the loan to take
account of modified architectural standards. These changes were notified
to the Executive Directors by a President's 'Memorandum (R71-246) dated
November 3, 1971. The project is now being executed normally.
The Cocoa Loan, No. 686, June 5, 1970, US$7.5 million was slow
to start.  A proposal to amend the Cocoa Loan to provide for an increased
number of hectares to be rehabilitated is presently under consideration
by-theCGovernment. The project is otherwise proceeding satisfactorily.
