COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is a completion report on the Lofa County Agricultural Develop-
ment Project (LCADP), for which Credit 577-LBR in the amount of US$17.0
million was approved on June 22, 1975. The Credit was closed in September
1982, nine months after the original closing date. A small balance of
US$51 .995.68 still remains to be disbursed.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Western
Africa Regional Office. It is based on several sources of information: pro-
ject files, Staff Appraisal Report (No. 744a-LBR dated June 27, 1975),
President's Report (No. P-1671-LBR dated July 9, 1975), Development Credit
Agreement dated August 1, 1975, Supervision Mission Reports and a first draft
of the PCR prepared by the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the Project. The
Project Performance Audit Report (OED Report No. 3008 dated June 3, 1980) on
the preceding project - Liberia, Agricultural Development and Technical
Assistance Project (Cr. 306-LBR) - was also consulted.
A completion mission visited Liberia in April 1982. Discussions were
held with Project Management, Government officials and with representatives of
institutions participating in the project. Field visits were also undertaken
and farmers interviewed. The information obtained and observations made
during those missions are reflected in the PCR. The PCR was substantially
completed and submitted to OED on October 28, 1982. The project was not
selected for audit by OED and the PCR was sent to the Borrower on February 2,
1983 for comments by April 13, 1983. However, no comments were received from
the Borrower by that date.
The Western Africa Regional Office gratefully acknowledges the
valuable assistance provided by the Government and project staff, as well as
the officials involved in the project. Their assistance greatly contributed
to this report.

LIBERIA
Lofa County Agricultural Development Project
(Cr. 577-LBR)
COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The Lofa County Agricultural Development Project was the first major
integrated agricultural development project in Liberia. The project was
identified by GOL/IDA and was prepared by consultants as part of the Liberian
Agricultural Development and Technical Assistance Project (306-LBR) financed
by IDA, USAID and the Government of Liberia. The primary objective of the
project was to increase production of smallholder rice, cocoa, and coffee in
two districts of Upper Lofa by means of an intensive extension system with
supporting services such as credit, input supply and cooperative develop-
ment.. In addition, the project included feeder road rehabilitation, well
construction and the provision of some buildings.
The agricultural targets attained by the project compared to those at
appraisal were 98% for swamp rice, 93% for upland rice, and 51% and 78% for
new -plantings of coffee and cocoa respectively in terms of hectarages de-
veloped. The project area now has 49 tree crop nurseries. About 7,430 far-
mers or 93% of the appraisal target of 8,000 farmers directly participated in
the -project. The project established its own training facilities and adaptive
research into farming systems. Through its unit designed to carry out small
road maintenance and the construction of access tracks, the project completed
a substantial program of construction and reconditioning of 557 km of feeder
roads and tracks, 503 culverts, 370 stream crossings, 3 bridges, 195 wells and
78 latrines. Overall management of the Project was satisfactory with local
staff taking over complete responsibility from expatriates by Year 3.
Total costs up to the end of September 1981 were US$15.59m or 92% of
appraisal estimates. Expenditures for IDA-funded components totalled US$6.3m,
an overexpenditure of US$0.3m, which was met by the Government of Liberia
(GOL). The actual costs exceeded appraisal estimates in building and con-
struction materials, vehicles, vehicle operating expenses and development
operational costs, but were less for equipment, consultants, Agricultural and
Cooperative Development Bank (ACDB) and farm inputs.
The economic rate of return is estimated at over 12%, lower than the
appraisal figure of 25.9% due mainly to the late start of the tree crop pro-
duction and lower than estimated yields of all crops, resulting in lower
actual incremental production. In line with observed yield performance,
future expected yields have also been adjusted downwards compared to appraisal
yields.



- iv -
As the first attempt at integrated agricultural development, the
project has been reasonably successful in effecting improvements in the
agriculture of Upper Lofa and in setting standards for Liberia even though
problems were encountered in full farmer adoption of improved swamp rice
techniques, rehabilitation of cocoa and coffee, achievement of acreage targets
of cocoa and coffee and yield targets of all crops and development of
cooperatives. The physical achievement, mobilization of farmers, institu-
tional performance and development of a trained and motivated management and
extension cadre have been satisfactory overall.
The main lessons which emerge from the project's implementation
experience include: (i) the complexities of changing traditional subsistence
farmers into modern farmers, even in a highly receptive farming community,
should not be underestimated (paras 8.02, 9.02 and 9.03); (ii) given the weak-
ness of research institutions, recommended technological packages in projects
should be kept under constant review (para 9.05); (iii) project M&E units can
play a very effective part in introducing beneficial policy changes in project
mid-stream (paras 3.18 and 9.08); (iv) optimum use of available resources
should be made and duplication of functions avoided to improve cost-effective-
ress of projects (para 9.10); and (v) the experience with cooperatives
underscores the need for effective supervision of key project components
(paras 8.02, 8.03 and 9.09).
Other points of interest are:
-    complete and effective Liberianization of management had taken place
by the end of the third year of the project (para 7.03);
-    the semi-autonomous status of the project combined with a good
management team, which judiciously used this status, served to
facilitate implementation (para 9.01);
-    the lack of integration of the project with the MOA which continued
to carry its own agricultural staff located but not working in the
project area was criticised (paras 7.02 and 9.10);
-    the project elicited considerable community self-help in the
construction of physical infrastructure (para 9.07); and
-    the strategy of integrated agricultural development can satisfy both
growth and equity objectives (para 9.11).,



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Liberia: Lofa County Agricultural Development Project
(Credit 577-LBR)
I. BACKGROUND
Sector Background
1.01     Agriculture is the largest sector in the country contributing about
32% to GDP (14% from monetary and 18% from traditional sector). Three dis-
tinct types of farming systems characterize the sector: (a) foreign-owned
plantations of rubber and forestry concessions producing exclusively for ex-
ports; (b) Liberian-owned commercial and state farms, engaged primarily in
rubber production, but also in coffee, cocoa and oil palm, and gradually
moving into other activities, such as poultry and pig production; and (c) tra-
ditional farms consisting of smallholders (90% of all agricultural households)
who produce mainly for home consumption with small surpluses sold for cash
purposes.  The principal cash crops are rubber, coffee and cocoa.  Annual rub-
ber production is currently about 82,000 tons, of which 70% is produced by six
foreign concessions. Coffee and cocoa exports were about 10,000 tons and
3,400 tons respectively in 1980/81. Rice and cassava are the main crops of
traditional smallholders, with annual production estimated at about 280,000
tons (paddy) and 155,000 tons, respectively. Crop yields on traditional farms
are low. Except for those within the agricultural development projects
(ADPs), farmers have little access to capital and agricultural inputs; agri-
cultural technology is rudimentary and infrastructure is inadequate. Coffee
and cocoa are the main cash crops for smallholders, who also sell kernels from
the harvested fruit of wild oil palms.
Sector Objectives and Strategy
1.02     During the project period, Government sector objectives were to sti-
mulate increase in productivity, employment and income of Liberian farmers,
particularly smallholders, and promote diversification of production in the
sector. To achieve these objectives, the Government's strategy in agriculture
has given priority to:  (a) improving the institutional atructure to plan and
carry out development programs more effectively; (b) improving price incen-
tives for increased production by adopting an active price policy and improv-
ing the marketing system and the infrastructure; and (c) provision of a pack-
age of measures - extension, input supply, credit and marketing - to tradi-
tional farmers in order to raise their level of production. In line with this
strategy, the Government has pursued and is pursuing the decentralization of
its agricultural services and improving the administration of agricultural
programs and the development and improvement of agricultural research, exten-
sion and training. The project under review was designed to meet Government
objectives of stimulating increase in productivity, employment and income of
smallholders.



- 2-
Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.03     Bank Group lending in the sector supports Government's objectives of
increasing smallholder productivity, diversification of production and
strengthening of institutions. The Bank Group's involvement in the sector
commenced in 1972 with the Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 306 - LBR for
US$1.6 million). 1/ The objectives of this projec-t included the carrying out
of a series of feasibility studies. Under that project, foreign consultants
carried out the studies, the first of which resulted in the Lofa County Agri-
cultural Development Project (Cr. 577-LBR for US$6.Om, 1976), subject of this
report, followed by the Bong C.ounty Agricultural Development Project (Cr. 700-
LBR for US$7m), and the Rubber Development -Project (Cr. 786-LBR/Ln. 1544-LBR
for US$13m). A Forestry Development Project (Cr. 839-LBR for US$6 million)
and an Oil Palm Project (Ln. 1765-LBR for US$12m) have since been added. A
second phase of the Lofa County project (Cr. 1242-LBR for US$15.5 million) was
approved by the Board on May 4, 1982. The performance of Lofa I (reviewed in
this report) was overall satisfactory. The Bong Project, after a slow start
(1978) and initial management problems, is also being implemented satisfac-
torily. The Rubber Project which became effective October 1978 aims at
strengthening Liberian-owned rubber production, but because of management
problems, poor pricing, and a shortage of processing facilities, this project
has been revised. The Forestry Project became effective in July 1978, and is
designed to strengthen forestry institutions through training and technical
assistance and to establish trial plantations. The performance of this
project in general has been satisfactory. The Decoris Oil Palm project became
effective in February 1981, and is designed to establish oil palm plantings on
a nucleus estate, and associated smallholders plots. In spite of considerable
delay in meeting conditions for effectiveness and financial constraints,
project implementation is progressing reasonably well.
Preparation and Appraisal of the Project
1.04     Preparation of the Lofa Project was completed in August, 1974.
Appraisal took place in January 1975, with a mission of seven persons, includ-
ing one from USAID.  The USAID had decided to consider participation in the
proposed project in view of a previous commitment to assist the Liberian
Government in the area of rural development, for which some US$5 million had
already been programmed.
1.05     Government asked the appraisal mission to consider:  (i) Liberia's
agricultural credit policies; (ii) strategies for development of nucleus
estates with outgrower plantations for irrigated rice, oil palm, coffee and
cocoa; (iii) the inadequacy of the extension service; and (iv) lack of exper-
ienced Liberian managers capable of running an externally financed project.
The appraisal mission proposed: (a) an integrated system of support services

to aid approximately 8,000 farmers in the Upper Lofa area in growing swamp
rice, upland rice, coffee and cocoa; (b) a project management unit; (c) a
development authority in the project area responsible for agricultural ser-
vices inicluding extension, credit and training; (d) assistance to help modern-
ize and expand Liberia's agricultural extension services; and (e) setting up a
schistosomiasis surveillance unit.
1.06     By April 1975, USAID confirmed that they would cofinance the project
on a parallel basis. Negotiations took place June 3-6, 1975, and the project
was approved by the Board on July 22, 1975. The credit agreement was signed
August 1, 1975, and the USAID Loan Agreement was signed November 10, 1975.
The project became effective May 26, 1976.
1.07     Total project costs were estimated at US$17.0 million, and the IDA
approved credit for US$6.0 million and USAID financing of US$5.0 million were
to fund 65% of the costs, while Government funding was estimated at US$6.0
million.
II. THE PROJECT
The Project
2.01     Project Area.  The project area is centered on Voinjama in Lofa
County in North West Liberia. It is bordered by Sierra Leone to the West and
by Guinea to the North East. The project area covers some 3,300 km2 and
containi nearly 14,000 farming families (90,000 people). The project area has
ample rainfall of over 2,500 mm. It is drained by three major rivers and
intersected by numerous streams. Swamps are formed from bottomland which is
permanently or temporarily waterlogged. Swamp and bottomland rice is tradi-
tionally cultivated. Women generally grow rice in these lowland areas on a
semi-continuous basis, abandoning them only in years where the upland rice
field is a considerable distance away. In some areas, improved swamp rice
cultivation has been successfully introduced, replacing the traditional
practice.
2.02     Shifting cultivation is the prevailing farming system in the project
area. Fallow periods vary mainly as a consequence of population pressure,
ranging from 5 to 12 years. Upland rice is the main crop and is generally
sparsely inter-cropped with vegetables, cassava and pulses. Cocoa and coffee
are grown as smallholder cash crops. The project introduced improved planting
and cultivation methods for these crops.
2.03     The project comprised:  the provision of development loans and
seasonal credit to some 8,000 farmers to develop and improve a total of about
12,600 ha of swamp and upland rice, coffee and cocoa; the provision of tech-
nical and administrative staff and support facilities for project implemen-
tation; staff and farmer training centres and their operation; construction of
village wells; setting up a schistosomiasis surveillance unit; assistance in
establishing a branch of the Liberian Bank for Development and Investment



- 4 -
(LBDI) in the Project area, and the provision of consultant services. In
addition, Government was to have undertaken, independently, the construction
of new and rehabilitation of existing feeder roads in support of the project.
2.04     Crop Development.  The project was to provide credit for farm inputs,
including hired labor for swamp development, tools and equipment, seeds, seed-
lings, fertilizer and chemicals for: upland rice improvement (5,600 ha); the
rehabilitation of some 500 ha of rainfed swamp rice; cultivation of 1,400 ha
of new swamp of which some 400 was to be double cropped; the rehabilitation
of 500 ha of existing coffee and new planting of 2,300 ha; rehabilitation of
800 ha of existing cocoa and the development of 1,500 ha of new cocoa.
2.05     Supply of Inputs.  The project was to supp:Ly long-term loans to
farmers for swamp rice, coffee and cocoa rehabilitation and new planting.
These loans were to be in kind for tools and equipment, coffee and cocoa seed-
lings, fertilizers and chemicals during the development period, and in cash
for hired labor for swamp development. Short-term or seasonal loans were to
be provided for upland and swamp rice to cover seed and fertilizer, chemicals
and replacement sprayers. Delivery of these inputs was to be carried out
through farmers' cooperatives. A revolving credit fund was to be established
with and administered by the LBDI to finance inputs to farmers on a permanent
basis. A branch of the LBDI was to be estabLished in the project area for
this purpose.
2.06     Staffing.  Some 276 administrative, technical and commercial staff
were expected to implement the project, and it was anticipated that up to ten
of these would be recruited internationally t,o fill positions for which suit-
able Liberians would not be available.
2.07     Training.  The project was to carry out staff training in basic man-
agement, organizational and technical skills at a residential training center
to be established under the project at Voinjama, supplemented by on-the-job
training. Further staff training was to be obtained through the Agricultural
Extension Training Center in the Monrovia area, for which the project was to
have constructed a dormitory block. Four full-time cooperative officers were
to provide internal training and support to cooperative staff under the direc-
tion of a cooperative training officer. Farmers' training was to be conducted
at Kolahun, where a resident training center was to be constructed under the
project. Additionally, on-farm training through demonstrations was to be
carried out.
2.08     Village Wells.  The project was to assist villages in the construc-
tion of 100 hand-dug wells on a self-help basis with the project providing ma-
terials and technical advice.
2.09     Schistosomiasis Surveillance.  A small laboratory and staff were to
be provided to monitor swamp areas being developed for rice production under
the project for schistosomiasis in support of existing health programs in the
area.



2.10     Road Improver.ent.  Some 100 km of new feeder roads in the project
area were to be constructed and 500 km of existing upgraded and maintained by
the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) in agreement with the project, specifically
to facilitate project activities. Some US$1.5 million were to be provided
under a Bank-financed highways project (Ln. 1156-LBR). A small road main-
tenance program for minor feeder roads and tracks was to be undertaken by the
project.
2.11     Project Benefits.  The appraisal report anticipated the following
agricultural yield increases:

The project, through its support services including farm inputs, credit and
marketing was to enable farmers to increase both areas under cultivation and
crop yields. Secondary benefits were to be derived from the provision of
improved roads, banking, education and health facilities, and the strength-
ening of MOA's technical capabilities in agriculture and cooperatives.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.01     Effectiveness.  The credit was expected to be effective by
November 3, 1975, but this had to be extended first to December 31, 1975,
then to February 28, 1976, and finally to May 31, 1976 but the Credit was
declared effective on May 26, 1976. The conditions of effectiveness were:
the signing of the USAID Loan Agreement and effectiveness of this agreement,
the appointment of a Project Manager, Agricultural Manager and Training
Manager and the opening of a project bank account with an initial deposit of
US$100,000. While the condition in relation to the USAID Loan was fulfilled
in November 1975, and Government had opened the project bank account early in
1976, there were delays in finalizing the appointments of the three managers.
At Government's request, the Bank assisted in recruiting international



- 6 -
staff. Government did not always accept the first choice of candidates, and
it was also obvious that the lack of facilities, such as adequate housing and
schooling, made these positions less attractive to candidates. The Project
Manager and Training Manager had been chosen by the end of 1975. However, the
appointment of an Agricultural Manager was only finally settled in May 1976.
It should be mentioned that by this time, an e-xpatriate Financial Controller
had also been appointed, thus ensuring a relatively early establishment of
project accounting systems.
3.02     Organization.  A Projec: Steering Committee (PSC) was appointed by
the Head of State comprising the .inisters of Agriculture (Chairman), Finance,
Planning and Economic Affairs, Local Government, and Rural Development and
Urban Reconstruction with the Project Manager Ras the Committee's secretary.
Although on rare occasions the respective Minister attended meetings of this
Committee, generally, Deputy or Assistant Ministers represented them, and this
ensured a degree of continuity in the Committee's make-up. This Committee had
overseeing responsibility for the project. A 'Project Advisory Committee was
also established consisting of local officials such as the County Super-
intendent and paramount chiefs for the purpose of getting local residents
involved in the project taking into account local conditions, customs and
attitudes. The Project Management Unit (PMU) was headed by the Project
Manager responsible through the PSC to the Minister of Agriculture.  Six
Divisions were established, each headed by a manager: administration and
personnel; finance; training; cooperatives and credit; land development; and
agriculture. At year 4, a plant production and research division was created
to produce coffee and cocoa seedlings, and carry out some adaptive research
and demonstration. An evaluation and planning unit was set up to support the
Project Manager through monitoring and evaluation activities. A schistosomi-
asis surveillance unit was also established.
3.03     Staffing.  Although the appraisal report adopted the principle of
filling all positions with qualified Liberians, it recognized the existence of
a shortage of suitably qualified experienced Liberians and identified ten key
positions which were likely to require international recruitment. Nine ex-
patriates were employed during the first three years of the project (2 funded
under the USAID Loan Agreement for cooperatives and credit) eight of whom had
local deputies. With the exception of the Evaluation and Planning Officer
position which was created later, all key posts were filled by 1976. Project
Management had full control over recruitment, and there was no shortage of
personnel working in the project. The administrative and personnel matters
were under the charge of a Liberian Manager, while a qualified supervisor
headed the Schistosomiasis Unit for which a consultant was retained to plan
and supervise programs. A good working relationship existed during the period
cf expatriate management, and it was felt that after 3 years local deputies
were capable of taking over the management of the project. All expatriates,
including the Project Manager, satisfactorily completed their contracted 3
year assignment period with the project. Thereafter, the project continued to
be satisfactorily run under local management. The organizational and staffing
eLspects of the project were, therefore, successfully implemented.
3.04     Physical Implementation.  Project achievements are shown below
against appraisal estimates at Year 5. Details are at Annex 1.

Crop Development and Improvement
3.05     Overall, 75% of the planned hectarage benefitted under various crop
development programs. Details at Annex 1 show that coffee and cocoa new
plantings remained consistently behind appraisal targets every year. So was
the case with upland rice except in 1980. Swamp rice acreage consistently
exceeded the yearly appraisal targets for new swamp development except in
1981. The reasons for variable performance of these crops are discussed in
the following paragraphs.

3.06     Upland Rice.  The original upland rice package of improved seed and
fertilizer evoked very little response and was de-emphasized in favor of the
more popular package of improved seeds alone, which was generally provided
through seed-exchange. However, the overall achievement under the upland rice
program was nearly 93 percent of the target. Project's agricultural division
reported a higher figure of 5,843 ha developed by them, based on the seeding
rates initially assumed under the project. The evaluation surveys reported
that the actual seeding rates were higher. The seeding rates were subsequent-
ly revised from 40 kg/ha to 60 kg/ha. The figure of 5,218 represents the area
based on the actual seeding rates adopted by the farmers.
3.07     Swamp Rice.  Rehabilitation program for 500 ha of existing swamps was
not taken up as it was found that the amount of work involved in rehabilitat-
ing these swamps was so high that it did not constitute rehabilitation. Ef-
forts were therefore concentrated on new swamp development. It was found
practicable to encourage this development in areas where the population densi-
ty exceeded 70 persons per square mile since, in low population density areas,
labor shortage deterred swamp production. However, an important phenomenon
was noticed that while new swamps were developed every year, farmers periodi-
cally abandoned swamps developed in the early years, a situation exacerbated
by the April 1980 disturbances, with the result that the area operated in 1981
was 1,273 ha or about 70 percent of the developed area (see paras 5.04-5.05
for an explanation of this phenomenon). Through increased project interven-
tion and continuous contact of extension workers with the project farmers, the
project estimates that this percentage would go up to 90 from 1982 onwards,
that is, some 1,680 ha (of the total 1865 developed) would be under production
each year. A second crop was taken on some of the swamps, the yield of the
second crop being generally lower than the first crop. The area under the
second crop of rice which was around 356 ha in 1980 went up further by 111 ha
in 1981.
3.08     Coffee.  The achievement of new planting was some 51% of the target,
while a program of rehabilitation was dete!rmined by the Project in the initial
years to be extremely difficult with the inexperienced staff of the project
and the time needed to demonstrate the necessary techniques. Further, a sur-
vey revealed that in most cases over 60% replacement of trees would be neces-
sary and this level does not constitute rehabilitation. Moreover, farmers
were not interested in cutting trees or losing even one years' production
involved in pruning. A decision was taken that project staff would concen-
trate initially on new planting. While farmer acceptance was no problem
because of the attractive returns from coffee (para 5.10), the shortage of
seedlings resulted in shortfall in acreage targets. LPMC 1/ supplied the
project's seedling requirements from its nurseries in the area, but they en-
countered difficulties in getting coffee seed on time and in adequate quanti-
ties. In 1979 LPMC indicated that it could no longer supply seedlings and the
project was forced to set up its own nurseries. Unseasonally cold nights
affected seedling development in 1980. The problem of timely procurement of

seed from the Ivory Coast also persisted. In Year 4, the project's agricul-
turists carried out demonstrations of rehabilitation techniques on selected
coffee farms. By Year 5, some 50 hectares had been accomplished, with addi-
tional farms planned for future rehabilitation under Phase II.
3.09     Cocoa.  Although it was initially felt that cocoa rehabilitation
could be carried out on a limited basis, farmers were not enthusiastic about
this activity because of reasons similar to those for coffee (para 3.08) and,
as in the case of coffee, the project concentrated on new planting. At first,
insufficient areas were found suitable for cocoa in the project area and hence
project targets were not met. After further search, relatively large areas
suitable for cocoa growing were located in excess of project demands, but as
for coffee, availability of seedlings became the problem. Thus, despite
farmer interest because of attractive returns from cocoa (para 5.10), only 78
percent of the acreage target was achieved during the project period, with the
promise of further development under Phase II.
3.10     Input Distribution  The quantities of inputs actually distributed to
farmers over the project period are shown below:

3.11     Cooperatives and Credit.  Before the initiation of the project there
were four farmers' produce marketing cooperatives with some 3,700 members in
the project area. The project attempted to build up a viable cooperative sys-
tem to handle credit, input supply and marketing of output. However, these 4
cooperatives were located in the towns, and in order to facilitate farmer in-
volvement, small village level units called town cooperative units (TCU) were
set up to facilitate the processing of credit. The cooperative structure at
the end of 1981 consists of 259 Town Cooperative Units with an average member-
ship of 32 farmers per unit affiliated to five larger cooperative societies,
the fifth one having been organized in 1979. The total number of cooperative
members is 11,242 with a share capital of $56,200.
3.12     Due to organizational and management problems, the cooperatives have
not been able to discharge their input supply and credit functions satisfac-
torily. Credit recovery fell gradually over the project period as will be
seen from the data given below:

The political upheaval in 1980 and the resulting uncertainties were the major
factor which disrupted, among other project activities, the credit recovery
process. Moreover, the flight of capital and the liquidity squeeze in the
local Agricultural and Cooperative Development Bank (ACDB) branch after the
political upheaval resulted in a shortage of cash for the cooperatives in the
project area to pay farmers for their produce, with the result that many far-
mers sold their produce to private traders and defaulted on loan repayment.
The mismanagement and corruption of cooperatives was also a factor and the
actual rate of credit recovery from farmers was not reflected in the payment
made by cooperatives into the ACDB revolving fund. The project is trying to
recover both 1980 and 1981 seasonal loans.
3.13     Civil Works.  The funds for the rural feeder roads program were to
have been provided by the GOL outside the project funds. However, due to
shortage of operating funds and increase in costs, the Ministry of Public
Works could only complete 280 km of new and rehabilitation of existing roads
against the target of 600 km. On the other hand, the Project's own unit, ori-
ginally designed to carry out small road maintenance and the construction of
access tracks, completed a substantial program of construction and recondi-
tioning of 557 kms of feeder roads and tracks, 50-3 culverts, 370 stream cross-
ings and 3 bridges. The project also constructed 195 wells and 78 latrines.
The other civil works undertaken by the project included a farmer training
center, a staff training center, 27 farm service sub-centers, a workshop,
storage sheds and other office buildings. This component of the project was
very successfully implemented.
3.14     There was considerable community self-help assistance in the con-
struction of roads, stream crossings, bridges, wells and latrines. Latrines
were included in the project at the reques-t of the then Head of State during a
visit to the project area. However, unlike the village wells program, where
the utilization was satisfactory, the latrine program needed many adjustments
in organizing and acceptance. Although a final design acceptable to most
people has been adopted, they are still no-t fully utilized. No active health
education program exists in the project area.

3.15     Disease Control.  The Schistosomiasis Surveillance Unit was estab-
lished to determine and monitor any presence or prevalence of schistosomiasis
in swamps to be developed for rice production in the project area. Of the 841
swamps surveyed, 77 were found to be infected (9%). Around 18,560 stools were
collected, of which about 80 were positive for schistosomiasis. The schisto-
some organism most prevalent in the area was haematobium (out of 26,500 speci-
mens collected during the five year period, 2,500 were positive for haemato-
bium - that is, 9%). The mansoni schistosome was present in smaller quanti-
ties. Farmers, school children and project extension staff who had contact
with swamps were tested for this disease, and, with the help of local medical
authorities, treatment was administered where necessary. The activities of
this unit contributed greatly to the implementation of the swamp rice program
of the project.
3.16     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E).  The Planning and Evaluation Unit
(PEU) was set up in April 1978. The Unit carried out farm business surveys
and crop cutting surveys on swamp rice and upland rice. The Unit also con-
ducted traffic surveys with the part time help of students on summer vaca-
tion. A Weekly Farm Record of selected farmers was also maintained and ad hoc
special farm surveys were undertaken according to needs.
3.17     Considering that the M&E systems, especially with regard to develop-
ment projects in developing countries, are still in the embryonic state, the
M&E work that has been done in Lofa is quite impressive. An IDA supervision
mission that looked into the M&E work in May-June 1981 found a few shortcom-
ings in the design, analysis and interpretation of some of the evaluation
studies, but concluded that these were attributable largely to staff and re-
source constraints inherent in such small evaluation units. These deficien-
cies are to be rectified in Lofa II.
3.18     A number of reports were brought out by the Unit.  The subjects cov-
ered included: crop yields, migration, labor, traffic loads and costs, gaso-
line consumption, substitution of swamp rice for upland rice and special
survey in Zorzor. The Unit also prepared a first draft of the PCR. In fact,
the basic data used in this PCR have been collected by the Unit. By being
closely associated with PMU, the PEU has also been able to influence many of
the policy changes made in the project. Examples are changes in the seeding
rate a,nd de-emphasising upland rice credit package.
3.19     Consultant Services.  At appraisal 14 manmonths for periodic tech-
nical advice to strengthen and oversee the cocoa and coffee development pro-
gram eLnd 6 manimonths of periodic visits by a WHO specialist to advise on the
schistosomiasis surveillance program were provided. During project implemen-
tation, a consultant was employed to plan and supervise the schistosomiasis
program. A financial consultant was also employed to integrate commercial
services accounts with the general accounts of the project (para 7.10). The
consultants' performance was satisfactory. In retrospect, it would have been
beneficial to the project to utilize consultants for the tree crops develop-
ment program considering the problems encountered in cocoa and coffee develop-
ment (paras 3.08, 3.09 and 7.03).

3.20     Establishment of ACDB Branch  Instead of LBDI branch provided for at
appraisal, a branch of the Agricultural and Cooperative Development Bank
(ACDB) was opened at Voinjama with project assistance. The branch provided
normal banking services and administered the project's revolving credit fund
satisfactorily. However, after the political upheaval in 1980, the branch
experienced cash shortages which affected marketing and credit recovery by
cooperatives in the project area (para 3.12).
IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Costs
4.01     The actual cost of the project up to the end of September 1981 was
US$15.59 million as compared to US$17.0 million estimated at appraisal. As
the physical and price contingencies are not separately indicated in the SAR
for the individual categories of expenditure, overall contingencies are ap-
plied to each category as follows:

11,996             17,000       15,588       92
4.02     The actual costs exceeded the adjusted SAR estimates in building and
construction materials, vehicles, vehicle operating expenses and development
operational costs (general services costs), but were less for equipment, con-
sultants, LBDI and farm inputs. The cost overrun in the building component
was principally caused by increase in prices of construction materials much



- 13 -
above appraisal expectations. Moreover, construction continued in the fifth
year compared to appraisal estimate of construction completion by year 4.
With regard to vehicles, appraisal overestimated the useful life, with some
vehicles expected to be replaced in five and some in four years when in fact,
due to the bad road condition, pickups and cars, in particular, had to be re-
placed after two and a half years. Unit costs of some vehicles in later years
of the project were also higher than anticipated at appraisal. The increase
in vehicle operating costs was principally due to a three to fourfold increase
in cost of spares and fuel not anticipated at appraisal. However, greater
cost-consciousness by the project might have led to economy in this item.  The
development operational costs (general services costs) were also higher due to
escalation in cost of office materials, stationery, etc. However, this cost
item could also have been reduced with stricter cost control. As regards cost
of consultants, a greater use could have been made of consultant services
(para 3 19). The ACDB costs were lower then at appraisal since ACDB provided
a much greater share of expenditure from its own resources than anticipated at
appraisal. Farm inputs cost was only 25% of appraisal estimates since there
was a substantial shortfall in acreage targets of cocoa and coffee (Tables 3.2
and 3.3), fertilizer was excluded from the upland rice package (para 5.03) and
fertilizer application by farmers was lower than recommended doses for swamp
rice as well as cocoa and coffee.
Financing
4.03     USAID, as a cofinancier, financed the cost of the cooperative/credit
divisioin, imported farm inputs and hired labor for swamp development, the
schistosomiasis unit and the construction of a dormitory. At the originally
agreed disbursement percentages, IDA funding would have totalled US$6.33
million. The difference of US$0.33 million with the Credit amount was met by
the GOL. Financing of project costs was as follows (details are at Annex 2):

Procurenient
4.04     No major procurement problems arose under the IDA Credit during pro-
ject implementation. It was noticeable that there were very poor responses to
ICB in Liberia in respect of this project (and the Bong Project Cr. 700 LBR).
In those few cases where no response was received, the Project resorted to
local purchasing in consultation with IDA.

Disbursement
4.05     Disbursements took place slower than the appraisal estimates through-
out the life of the project partly because expenditures were made at a slower
rate and partly because disbursement applications were delayed. As of
December 31, 1981 some US$5.35 million had been disbursed against the IDA
Credit, with commitments in excess of US$6.0 million up to March 31, 1982.

V. PROJECT IMPACT
5.01     The principal program of crop development in LCADP was to develop an area
of 12,600 ha through improvement of upland rice cultivation, developing new
swamps for rice cultivation and rehabilitating as we-Ll as bringing new areas
under coffee and cocoa production. A more refined assessment of the impact of
the project would have been possible, had there been time series data giving
the area and production of crops in the Lofa County. Unfortunately, such time
series are not available either at the county or at the national level since
1978.
Crop Yields
5.02     A Liberian Agricultural Survey has been carried out annually by the
Ministry of Agriculture up to 1978.  For 1977 and 1978, the survey indicated a
yield per ha for rice in Lofa County of 1266 kg and 1278 kg respectively. No
further survey data are available.  However, the project's Planning and
Evaluation Unit (PEU) started collecting its own yield data in the second year
of the project (1978 harvests).  A 1981 supervision mission recognized that
the statistical design and methods of analysis adopted for the surveys by this
unit needed considerable improvement. In spi-te of these limitations, the data
give a general indication of the trends and orders of magnitudes of the yield



- 15 -
differences between the project and non-project farms over the years. The
assessments which follow are based on the data collected by the PEU.
5.03     Upland Rice.  The SAR estimated that the yields of upland rice farms would
improve from 1,000 kg/ha without development to 1,700 kg/ha with development,
with the adoption of a package comprising improved seed, fertilizers and
associated agricultural practices. As mentioned earlier in para. 3.06 seed-
exchange proved to be more popular than seed-fertilizer package and this was
confirmed by the crop yield data. The project staff also concluded that in
the shifting cultivation system of agriculture where planting takes place
after a normal fallow period (10-15 years), there is little advantage gained
in applying fertilizer. Further, although recognizing the value of improved
seed, farmers were reluctant to take fertilizer on credit for their staple
grown in the traditional way and to introduce other improvements in their
cultivation methods, such as more timely planting, proper seed distribution
and weeding. As a result, the yield difference between the traditional and
project farms was of the order of only 230 kg/ha (Table 5.1) attributed mainly
to seed quality as compared to 700 kg/ha anticipated in the SAR which was
based on the assumption that farmers would adopt the complete package.

1/   Data for 1981 are provisional.
5.04     Swamp Rice.  In the case of swamp rice, it was expected that single
crop yields after full development would increase to 3,500 kg/ha starting with
1,800 kg/ha in the first year as farmers gradually improved their cultivation
techniques in line with the recommended practices. In fact, this did not take
place. The highest average yields were attained in the first year (3,192
kg/ha for 74 ha) but this was never sustained for a variety of reasons. Pro-
ject farmers for the first time had been introduced to a technological package
which involved some basic engineering (designing, laying out and constructing
an irrigation system), followed by substantial clearing of trees and bush,
nursery preparation, transplanting, water control, fertilizing, weeding and
disease and insect control, if necessary. Extension staff in the flush of
starting the project carefully supervised the activities in the first year but
did not provide the same level of supervision to farmers in the succeeding
years. It was also found that the more accessible swamps were developed
first, with relatively easier supervision by project staff, but swamps with



- 16 -
relatively more difficult access did not receive adequate supervision. As was
found in an earlier Sierra Leone Eastern Area Agricultural Development Project
(Cr. 568-SL/Ln. 1138-SL), follow-up supervision in the second year is neces-
sary since, given the labor-intensiveness of the operation and a labor availa-
bility constraint in the peak demand period, the farmer is inclined to cut
corners and sacrifice standards. Experience also showed that complete clear-
ing of the swamps took more than the first year, and renovation of the engi-
neering was vital at the commencement of the second crop year. It is well
known that the more frequently a swamp is cultivated, the easier working it
becomes, since tree stumps are removed, there is less bush regrowth between
crops, and with proper maintenance the engineering works become consolidated
and settled. However, no provision existed in the project for further
developmental loans to farmers, and it was left to farmers' own initiative to
continue this development without much guidance from project staff. Farmers
returning to the swamps in the second year were confronted with, in addition
to tree stumps, substantial shrub regrowth and need for repair work on dykes,
bunds and canals.  With relative returns from rice not attractive enough for
cash cropping of rice (para 5.10), many farmers compromised on technology and
with a lower labor input settled into a form of cultivation which resulted in
lower production.
5.05     Many farmers attended to the demands of swamp rice cultivation only
after they had completed their traditional upland rice clearing, brushing and
planting, thus making a late start in preparing swamps. This meant the farmer
divided his efforts between the two crops, at the expense of swamp rice pro-
ductivity. The PEU discovered that farmers reduced the quantities of ferti-
lizer applied but that where farmers applied the recommended quantities,
yields as high as above 4,000 kg/ha have been obtained. There were delays in
procurement of fertilizers in 1979; they were not received until they could no
longer be applied..  More extreme situations arose where farmers did not con-
tinue swamp rice production, or reduced the acreage under cultivation. The
PEU estimated that the actual area under production in PY5 would be some 18%
less because of farmers dropping out of the swamp rice program. This repre-
sents jailed farmers, disinterested farmers, and farm families where death or
movement of the able-bodied or responsible family member has occurred and a
very small number of dropouts due to faulty engineering and the presence of
leeches in the swamp, for which no feasible solution has been found. The
political upheaval in April 1980 also affected swamp rice development as well
as other project activities. During 1980, the yield (1751 kg/ha) from swamps
was the lowest during the project period.
5.06     The above trends in no way affected the popularity of this crop, and
it is obvious that its appeal with farmers is largely due to the higher yields
obtained.  There are enough good swamp rice farms throughout the project area
to prove this popularity. Some farmers, however, are unable to apply the
discipline and technology needed for this crop. They may still continue to
grow swamp rice at yield levels similar to upland rice (about 1000 kg/ha) thus
depressing the project's yield averages or abandon their efforts (about 10% of
the farmers estimated). On the other hand, the PEU reports that in the Foya
District, nearly all of the cultivable swamps are now in production (because
of a shortage of upland areas) and, where farmers are unable to cultivate



- 17 -
swamps, others, who are able, take over. The yield assumptions in the
appraisal report were too optimistic in view of the lack of experience with
traditional upland farmers adapting to swamp rice cultivation. Nevertheless,
it has been demonstrated that with the adoption of the full technological
package, and good supervision beyond the first year, average single crop
yields in excess of 3000 kg/ha can be obtained.
5.07     Coffee.  It was estimated in the SAR that new plantations of coffee
would start yielding benefits in the fourth year after planting with a yield
of 300 kg/ha going upto 1000 kg/ha in the sixth year. The 105 ha of new cof-
fee planted in 1977 were due to yield fruit in 1981. Some of the trees, how-
ever, started bearing coffee in 1980, though as expected the yield harvested
was low--116 kg/ha. Further, experiences in Sierra Leone and other West
African countries indicate that under smallholder conditions a peak yield of
1000 kg/ha is too optimistic, and that 800 kg/ha would be more realistic with
good management.  Yields from rehabilitation in 1981 of some 50 ha of selected
coffee would be assessed after two years, but indications are that favorable
results could be expected.
5.08     Cocoa.  As in the case of coffee, SAR estimated that new cocoa plan-
tations would start bearing fruit in the fourth year after planting, yielding
a harvest of 200 kg/ha--going up to 850 kg/ha in the seventh year. The 78 ha
of cocoa planted in 1977 was due to yield cocoa in 1981. Some of the trees
however started bearing fruit in 1980, though the yield was only 55 kg/ha.
The results of 1981 harvest are not yet known. Future cocoa yields have been
estimaLted, starting at 150 kg/ha and going up to 500 kg/ha. The experience of
cocoa production using improved plant material under smallholder conditions in
Liberia is limited and though estimates based on research findings elsewhere
indicate that average yields of 850 kg/ha can be obtained under good manage-
ment, based on the pattern of husbandry so far exhibited for cocoa in this
project (which would be improved in future), it is more reasonable to assume
an average yield of 500 kg/ha.
Prices-
5.09     The SAR estimated the following farmgate prices in 1975 constant
terms:
US$ per ton
1980                    1985
Economic   Financial   Economic   Financial
Rice in terms of paddy        233         214          233         214
Coffee Cherries               829         586          861         609
Cocoa Beans                   982         692          999        706
5.10     The purchase price of paddy from the farmers was kept at 12 cents per
lb ($264 per metric ton) by the LPMC throughout the project period.  Details
are at Annex 3. Using this financial farmgate price for rice, the revised



- 18 -
crop budgets (Annex 4) show that both coffee and cocoa gave higher returns per
manday at Year 5 than rice ($4.00 for cocoa, $4.50 for coffee and $1.08 for
swamp rice). There was greater incentive to produce coffee and cocoa for cash
purposes than rice. Thus while farmers continue to produce rice for subsis-
tence, the adoption of improved swamp rice techniques for cash purposes has
not been profitable enough compared to tree crops, partially explaining the
slow adoption of improved swamp rice techniques. The purchase price of paddy
was increased for 1982 crop season to 18 cents per lb ($396 per metric ton).
Even the milled rice equivalent of this paddy price, without adding milling
and handling costs, is about $600/m.t. which is substantially higher than the
c.i.f. cost of imported rice of $435/m.t. The increased purchase price would
significantly improve relative returns from rice thus providing incentives for
faster adoption of improved techniques.
5.11     Though financial farmgate prices for cocoa and coffee were only about
half of f.o.b. prices during most of the project period, they provided
attractive returns relative to those for rice (para 5.10). LPMC marketing
costs remained high. Moreover, part of the margin between f.o.b. and farmgate
prices was deposited in an Agricultural Development Fund and a Price Stabili-
zation Fund. With decline in world prices for cocoa and coffee, these Funds
have become inoperative. However, LPMC costs continue to be high. With pro-
jections of continuing real decline in world cocoa and coffee prices, improve-
ments in LPMC efficiency to prevent substantial decline in producer prices are
urgently needed.  Measures to improve LPMC efficiency have been included under
Lofa II.
5.12     In evaluating financial and economic benef:its, the following finan-
cial and economic farmgate prices in 1981 constant terms were used.  Details
are at Annex 5.

VI. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
6.01     The economic rate of return for the project has been computed based
on the cost data obtained from the Project Management Unit and data on crop
yields, areas, and costs of production from the PEU. The assumptions used in
the economic analysis are:
(a) Hired labor was valued at $2.00 per day and the cost of family labor
at $1.00 per day in constant 1981 prices. The opportunity cost of
family labor is estimated to be lower because the more mobile members



19 
of the farm family would have joined the hired labor market, and the
returns to family labor in their alternative uses range between $0.55
to $1.00 per man day. At appraisal, all family and hired labor was
costed at 50% of the estimated wage rate ($1.00 per manday).
(b)  Actual project costs were included up to September 30, 1981, and
these costs were converted into 1981 constant terms using rates of
domestic inflation (based on Monrovia cost of living index) for the
domestic component, and the inter ialional inflation rate for the
foreign exchange component. Training costs, which were excluded at
appraisal having been regarded as technical assistance for subsequent
projects, have been included at completion. All road investment
costs were included at appraisal.  At completion, about one-third of
these costs (equal to the share of MPW in total road construction and
improvement) has been excluded on the assumption that general bene-
fits to the farming community (not included in the benefits stream of
the project) would offset these costs. The community self-help com-
ponent of physical infrastructure costs has also been excluded on the
same assumption. Apart from these, all costs have been included in
full.
(c)  Economic farm-gate prices are based on actual international prices in
1981 constant terms and IBRD projections for 1985 in 1981 constant
terms.
(d)  Although secondary benefits may be attributed to roads, wells,
latrines and disease control, these have not been quantified and were
not taken into account in calculating project benefits. These were
not taken into account at appraisal either.
6.02     Based on these assumptions, the economic rate of return (ERR) is
estimaated at a little over 12% (Annex 6) as compared to 25.9% at appraisal.
The main reasons for the shortfall are that tree crop production started later
than expected, and all crop yields were lower than anticipated, resulting in
lower actual incre-ental production. In line with observed yield performance,
future expected yields have also been adjusted downwards compared to appraisal
yields. Sensitivity analysis shows that, compared to assumptions at comple-
tion, if benefits are lower by 10%, the ERR will be about 11%; with 20% lower
benefits, the ERR will be about 9%. It should be pointed out that the ERR
would have been higher then estimated at completion if future acreage and pro-
duction increases of coffee and cocoa made possible by the experience gained
during the Project period (paras 3.08 and 3.09) were taken into account.
VII. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
7.01     Project Management/Staffing.  The arrangement of having a Project
Management Unit as a semi-autonomous body under the Ministry of Agriculture
was seen at appraisal to be the best arrangement in view of the constraints of



- 20 -
management capability and a poorly organized Ministry of Agriculture. The
then Minister of Agriculture readily concurred with this proposal in the
interest of effective project implementation. Similarly, the staffing of the
unit through international recruitment was accepted by Government. The assem-
bled management team consisted of British, Philipino, American, Sri Lankan,
Indian and Liberian nationals. However, it was envisaged that this structure
would exist only during the life of the Project, after which the project's
extension staff, better equipped and more experienced, would revert to MOA or
a special development authority which was proposed to be established as a
supervisory body for successor and other projects. At the same time, consul-
tants were expected to make proposals for the reorganization of the MOA. which
they did in 1975. As it turned out, the Government rejected the consultants'
report (see OED Report No 3008 - Liberia Technical Assistance Project Cr. 306-
LBR), and no further studies were carried out. At this time the need for re-
structuring MOA still exists.
7.02     Responsibility for project implementation, therefore, rested entirely
on the PMU with little or no direct connection with any of the Government
Ministries (except MPW in relation to the feeder roads construction). The
Project Manager exercised full control over the project, reporting informally
to the Minister of Agriculture and formally to an active Project Steering
Committee whose actions supported this independent approach to project imple-
mentation. This system worked well in the interest of project implementation,
and permitted the expatriate managers to function with the least interference
and red tape. However, some Government officials and local administrators
viewed the project as one in which their Government had little or no influ-
ence, and misunderstood the objectives of the project. Project Management
corrected this through a public relations campaign of publicising project ac-
tivities and inviting persons to visit the project area. However, from time
to time the autonomous and independent form of management was criticized on
the grounds that the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) was unable to influence its
actions, and that this type of organization was counter productive to the
development and improvement of the MOA, particularly since MOA continued to
carry its own agricultural staff located but not working in the project
area. The criticism became more pronounced because this management arrange-
ment was used for other World Bank funded projects. The Government, the Bank
and USAID have long recognized the increasing need to strengthen the Ministry
of Agriculture, and a number of proposals f'or this exist, including consul-
tants' studies under the IDA Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 306-LBR),
incomplete proposals by a Rural Development Task Force which emphasized decen-
tralization, the Ministry's own policy document which set out a new structure
of the Ministry and a national extension project which was being prepared by
USAID till recently. However, because of the political adjustments and the
financial constraints since 1980, no comprehensive restructuring of the
Ministry has as yet taken place, and, although new projects fall more directly
under the administration of the Ministry, they cannot as yet be fully accom-
modated within the existing structure of the Ministry. The criticisms of the
Project Management Unit's approach for this project, while not unfounded,
generally fell flat for want of a viable alternative. However, future pro-
jects' design should keep this criticism in view (see para 9.10).

7.03     A remarkable institutional performance of the project was that, by
the end of the third year of the project, complete Liberianization of manage-
ment had taken place. However, a 1979 supervision mission identified that al-
though the agricultural manager was competent to manage the extension program,
neither he nor the other graduate agriculturists on his staff possessed the
right background and experience in the technical aspects. The mission,
therefore, recommended the recruitment of an expatriate agriculturist with
strong tree crop experience to assist the project in this area. Government
agreed to this recommendation, and requested the Bank to assist in recruit-
ment. An Indian agriculturist with cocoa, coffee and rice experience in
Malaysia was identified and approved by Government, but his recruitment was
interrupted by the April 1980 change of Government, and subsequently the Bank
was informed -that Government would no longer pursue this recruitment. The
relevance of this occurence is that although project agriculturists have done
reasonably well in attaining area targets for tree crops and rice (given the
constraints beyond their control), crop husbandry standards were not high
enough to bring about optimum yields. Some efforts were made late in the life
of the project to improve the situation, and the Agricultural, Research and
Project Managers paid visits to the Philippines, India, Brazil and Nigeria.
Undoubtedly, these visits helped to improve the technical understanding of
Proje!ct staff, and resulted in some recommendations for improving tree crop
cultivation, and an enthusiastic introduction of an adapted version of the
Training and Visit System. However, further exposure and training of
technical staff is required in order to bring about higher levels of
improvements than those attained under the project.
7.04     The number of Project staff as a whole increased above appraisal
estimates. The largest increase occurred in the Administration and Finance
Division which includes the Planning and Evaluation staff and Internal Audit,
for which the SAR underestimated. Notwithstanding these, and other under-
estimates in staff requirements, this division was considerably overstaffed
which led to unnecessary ince~ase in project costs which could have been
avoided through stricter control by Project Steering Committee. In contrast,
the Agricultural Services Division carried a staff complement of 112 in PY4
versus 153 estimated in the SAR because the recruitment, training and equip-
ping of agricultural staff accompanied by assessment at different stages was
more difficult than the straight recruitment of administrative staff. The
expanded roads, wells and latrine program also necessitated increased staff.
The SAR envisaged that there would be a substantial reduction of staff by Year
5 in the Agricultural, Commercial and Land Planning Divisions. It was expec-
ted that staff would be transferred out of the Project area to "other projects
or development schemes". No such transfers took place in view of the fact
that a second phase project is about to commence. Staff adjustments under the
second phase would include reductions in some divisions and expansion in
others and minimizing overstaffing, particularly in Administration and Finance
Division.
7.05     Extension and Training.  The Project recruited its own extension
staff, and by offering better salaries and conditions than MOA, was able to
exercise a high standard of selection. The Training Division carried out
training of all staff, specifically in the crops to be grown, and in extension



- 22 -
techniques.  Prior to the Project, a core of extension agents of MOA was
located in the area, but, poorly trained and ill-equipped, had no significant
effect on the farming community. Also, Government and LPMC were involved in
land clearing and tree crop planting in some districts, but both schemes en-
countered difficulties and had to be abandoned. The Project, on the other
hand, encountered a higher response from farmers to the technological and
credit packages offered by the Project except for coffee and cocoa rehabili-
tation. Extension staff with the cooperation of the local administration
reached farmers fairly easily, and, although many of these were young and in-
experienced, they were readily accepted by farmers. Short training sessions
to introduce improved techniques were also conducted for farmers. Training
was continuous for Project staff as short refresher courses were carried out
from time to time. In 1980, the Project introduced a modified version of the
Training and Visit system. So far, both project farmers and staff are enthu-
siastic about it.
7.06     Cooperatives, Credit and Marketing.  This component was funded by
USAID.  A Commercial Manager was recruited, who, under the Credit Agreement,
was to have been appointed an Assistant Registrar of Cooperatives in order
that he might carry out supervisory, auditing and other functions normally
associated with this position. Government wras never able to fulfill this com-
mitment, since the Cooperative Department of MOA was in a constant state of
adjustment during most of the project period, and was generally ineffective
with regard to the project. There were changes of Registrars, and finally,
after Bank supervision missions' insistence, it was discovered that the
appointment of Assistant Registrars and Registrars was the prerogative of the
Head of State. Events such as the change of Government, and the creation of
the Cooperative Development Authority followed soon after. By the time the
subject could be raised again, the Project was almost at an end, and a compre-
hensive review of Lofa cooperatives by consultants had been planned.
7.07     There were four existing cooperatives in the Project area at apprais-
al, and it was intended that these societies would be used for (a) mobilizing
the interest and participation of farmers and organizing them into small
village groups or cooperatives, (b) organizing a system of delivery of inputs,
credit distribution and recovery for participating farmers, and (c) providing
assembly, storage, transportation, handling and other marketing functions. In
order to accomplish these goals, the Project was to have trained coop/credit
officers who would then train district cooperatives' management staff in the
operational aspects. In effect, the need to get inputs to farmers in a timely
and efficient manner became more dominant than the need to reorganize the co-
operatives. The project had the procurement and distribution means, and,
while organizing village level cooperatives (Town Cooperative Units - TCUs) to
facilitate the processing of the in-kind credit, the Project proceeded to
maintain the required records, etc. for these transactions, and helped to get
the project implemented. At the start of the project, the district coopera-
tives or main cooperatives were found to be chaotic, badly managed, and had
not been properly audited, nor had recent elections been held. The project
encountered obstacles in its efforts to improve these cooperatives, and even
though the organization of the small units (TCUs) was successful, the project
was unable to break the grip that local administrators and politicians had



23 -
over the 4 cooperatives (one was chaired by a mayor, and two by Paramount
Chiefs), whose interests and influence often ran counter to those of the
project and the cooperatives. In Year 5, finally through the participation of
TCUs in the elections of 3 of these cooperatives, members were able to elect a
management slate of their choice.
7.08     In PY5, a team of cooperative consultants from India studied the
functioning of cooperatives in the Project, and found that these cooperatives
possessed chaotic accounts, were inadequately audited, were poorly managed by
unqualified staff; elections were infrequently held, with management commit-
tees serving beyond the period allowed in the by-laws; general meetings were
not regularly held and the presentation of accounts and budgets to these
meetings were often ignored. They also reported that the Chairmen and
lIanagers of cooperatives often conducted transactions independent of each
other, and that the Chairmen wielded their influence in an autocratic man-
ner. Supervision by the Cooperative Department was weak and without impact,
inferring that the Department had no influence over politically powerful
Chairmen of societies. This was further compounded by the failure to appoint
the Manager of the project's Commercial Services Division as an Assistant
Registrar of Cooperatives in order that he would be able to exercise statutory
power. In hindsight, since the Manager in the initial years was an expatri-
ate, it is not certain that he would have been effective in what was clearly
seen as a political situation.  Through the local Deputy Project Manager (and
later as Project Manager) the project was actively advocating the reform of
the cooperative structure to permit greater involvement of the growing number
of members entering these cooperatives through the Project. In the absence of
a stronger Cooperative Department, these efforts were without success. The
Project was unable to fulfill its commitment to train cooperative staff in
farmer credit, input supply, marketing, management and organization, so that
after the development period, full responsibility would be taken over by the
cooperatives.
7.09     Notwithstanding the difficulties recounted above, the consultants
were of the view that these cooperatives could be viable and efficient enter-
prises, and made far reaching recommendations in this respect. Government
accepted most of these recommendations in principle. In July 1981, a semi-
autonomous Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) came into effect (based on
the recommendation of USAID cooperative advisors), replacing the Cooperative
Department of the Ministry of Agriculture. The CDA held the promise of
reorganizing cooperatives to bring about the much needed improvements. How-
ever, budgetary constraints may adversely affect its development. The propo-
sals for cooperatives in the Lofa II Project address the major issues raised,
and improvements (largely due to the changed political climate) have begun
with elections of new executives.
7.10     Accounting and Reporting.  In keeping with the requirements of the
Credit Agreement, the Project's accounting section has performed creditably
throughout the life of the Project. In the early years of the Project, ac-
counting records of the Commercial Services Division which dealt with inputs
and cooperatives were maintained in that Division. This occurred because the
Division was principally funded by USAID. However at IDA's insistence and



- 24 -
with Government's approval, these accounts were interfaced with those central
to the Project. The expatriate Financial Controller handed over responsibili-
ties to his Liberian deputy who continued to maintain the same standard of
accounts. The audit requirement was fulfilled satisfactorily. Full and com-
prehensive quarterly reports were prepared and circulated in a timely man-
ner. Each report was a consolidation of reports from divisions, with the in-
volvement of the Planning and Evaluation Unit. In addition, budgets and fi-
nancial statements were prepared regularly. However, it is not certain
whether good use was made of these reports by project management and Govern-
ment officials. One criticism of the reporting procedure is the shortage of
details of planning by each division which serve as the basis for budgeting.
This aspect needs improvement.
VIII. PERFORMANCE OF THE BANK
8.01     Preparation and Appraisal.  In view of the lack of prior experience
and knowledge of the sector, Bank performance was reasonably satisfactory,
particularly in designing a package which integrated schistosomiasis monitor-
ing, feeder roads, inputs, extension and training. The use of a project man-
agement unit made sense at that time and was in line with the wishes of the
Liberian officials; so too was international recruitment of key staff in view
of the shortage of experienced qualified Liberians. Adequate resources were
provided to help the Project meet its objectives and targets, and a flexible
approach to the project as it evolved was evident in the beneficial organiza-
tional changes introduced (such as the establishment of a strong M&E Unit --
which was not clearly specified at appraisa,. -- a Plant Production Unit and an
Internal Audit Unit), in the sensible adjustments of the crop development
targets, and in the expanded program of feeder roads and other construction.
8.02     The major flaws in Project design were related to the lack of exper-
ience with and understanding of Liberian conditions. Principally, the Project
was least successful in the development of cooperatives. At appraisal, the
assessment of the four existing cooperatives did not take enough account of
the entrenched political forces who as executives ran the cooperatives with
almost no accountability to their members, and the weakness of the Cooperative
Department. This Department was unable to effectively supervise, audit, and
generally enforce the laws governing cooperatives. The appraisal also signi-
ficantly underestimated the complexities of changing traditional subsistence
farmers into modern farmers, particularly with regard to adoption of improved
swamp rice farming techniques for cash purposes. The projected adoption levels
of the crop improvement packages by traditionally subsistence farmers were too
optimistic, the fact that the estimated yieLds of rice, although attainable,
were not sustainable without close supervision, was not taken into account and
cocoa and coffee yield estimates were too high. Moreover, lack of enthusiasm
of farmers to rehabilitation of cocoa and coffee was evidently not known at
all at appraisal.
8.03     Supervision.  Bank supervision was on the whole satisfactory.  During
start-up, the Bank effectively supported inexperienced Project staff in the



25 
areas of procurement, project planning and recruitment of staff, helped
establish good relations between Government and the expatriate staff, and in
genereLl guided Government in its first large project in the sector. In the
first years, there were joint supervisions with USAID. Later, with USAID
personnel changes, supervision was done separately. Supervision missions
freque!ntly briefed USAID officials on their assessment of the Project and
generally cooperated with the cofinanciers. The Project utilized supervision
missicins as an analytical mechanism, and often raised proposals for mission
reaction. Supervision of the agricultural aspects of the Project was gener-
ally satisfactory, but cooperatives should have been supervised midway through
the project by a cooperative specialist. The inability of the cooperatives to
take over the input supply and credit functions and the consequent performance
of these functions by the Commerical Services Division of the project reduced
the project's cost-effectiveness. This aspect should have been looked into
seriously by Bank supervision missions. It is also questionable whether the
project management and Bank supervision missions made full use of M&E data on
swamp rice farming problems (paras 5.04-5.06) and introduce policy changes as
they did for upland rice (para 3.18). One policy change, that is, continua-
tion of development credit for the second year, has been introduced under Lofa
Phase II. However, the need to introduce viable labor-saving techniques and
penetration of social and cultural barriers to adopting rice farming for cash
purposes (para 9.02) has not yet been effectively addressed.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01     The Lofa I Project has had a smooth organizational passage from con-
ception to completion and a few factors are the obvious contributors to this
process.  The Government was eager to have an area based agricultural project,
to demonstrate in a concrete way its interest in pursuing a policy of develop-
ing smallholder agriculture. Lofa County residents were already well known
for their industriousness and were actively interested in development pro-
posals. They were far enough away from the influence of the city and were
less sulspicious of Government than farmers in the areas with easy access to
Monrovia. They were therefore receptive to extension advice, supervision and
controL of the Project.  The semi-autonomous status of the Project combined
with a good management team, which judiciously used this status, served to
facilitate implementation.
9.02     The difficulties of changing farmers from the traditional to the im-
proved methods of cultivation were underestimated at appraisal, and notwith-
standing the willingness of the Lofa farmer to improve his level of techno-
logy, a better understanding of his needs, and how far he could be expected to
go along with project recommendations, would have been beneficial to the Pro-
ject. Traditionally, farmers produce rice for family consumption as a primary
objective, and buying and selling rice has a social significance which bears
little relationship to wealth enhancement. To sustain substantial surplus
production as is expected under improved swamp rice production requires that
the farmer accepts rice as a cash crop similar to coffee and cocoa. Pricing
and marketing improvements would be obvious incentives to increase production



- 26 -
under new swamp techniques. But, perhaps equally important, technical and
extension services are necessary to penetrate the social barriers to produc-
tion of rice as a cash crop. Moreover, introduction of available and viable
labor-saving techniques for swamp development has to be seriously pursued by
integrated agricultural development projects while a much greater research
effort than evident so far in Liberia has to be directed to development of
technically and economically efficient labor-saving techniques and adjustments
in the cropping calendars to distribute labor requirements to the various
crops more evenly over the year.
9.03     The time required to effect permanent changes in traditional agricul-
ture, even in a highly receptive farming community, is much longer than the
funding period of a project, and requires good introduction and follow-up ex-
tension beyond the first year. Farmers who adopted the recommended packages
and persisted in their use obtained yields far superior to the traditional
system.
9.04     No provision had been made for adaptive research at appraisal, and
the Project introduced some research into farming systems. There is need for
continuing research specific to the Project area in order to refine and im-
prove the technological packages which lack adequate testing.
9.05     The economics of rehabilitation and farmer acceptance of rehabili-
tation packages for cocoa and coffee need to be examined seriously in ongoing
and planned projects. The reluctance of farmers to use fertilizers for cocoa
and coffee and the agronomic and financial justification of fertilizer use for
these crops, also need to be examined. In general, technological packages for
cocoa and coffee should be kept as simple an(d inexpensive as possible.
9.06     Project supervisory training needs were reasonably covered by its
Training Division, and a good collection of training material has been de-
signed specifically for the Project, but which could be used throughout
Liberia. Senior staff have carried out visits to other projects and agricul-
tural institutions overseas. However, there is need for more concentrated
management and technical training to substantially increase their technical
capabilities.
9.07     The feeder roads and wells programs have been enthusiastically re-
ceived and elicited good community participation. The linkage of road con-
struction with improved crop production has been successful, and helped to
facilitate a general improvement in the movement of inputs and produce. The
latrines construction program, added in project mid stream, required more
preparation of the people in conjunction with Health and Education authori-
ties. The community self-help in the construction of physical infrastructure
is an important feature of the project.
9.08     The experience with M&E of the project showed that with good staff-
ing, close supervision and management support, project M&E units can play a
very effective part in introducing beneficial policy changes in project mid-
stream (para 5.18).



27 -
9.09     The experience with cooperatives (paras 7.06-7.09 and 8.03) provides
useful lessons for ongoing and planned projects in Liberia and underscores the
need for serious efforts towards their development.
9.10     Two interrelated issues of integration with MOA and cost-effective-
ness which have emerged from implementation of this and other agricultural
projec-ts in Liberia deserve to be mentioned. With an autonomous management
unit, the project hired its own staff at salary levels higher than those in
MOA while MOA continued to carry its own agricultural staff located but not
working in the project area. The project also provided its own training
facilities and physical infrastructure which further added to costs. While
this approach could be justified under the circumstances prevailing at project
appraisal (para 7.02), it is clear that with this approach the MOA remained
weak and outside the sphere of this major development effort, rendering later
integration more difficult, while the duplication of functions increased costs
rendering replication of this particular project approach on a national level
unlikely considering the financial constraints of the Government. Under Lofa
Phase II, integration with MOA has been initiated with the project covering
entire Upper Lofa and the Project Manager taking over the MOA county office as
County Agricultural Officer. With the strengthening of cooperatives, envis-
aged under Lofa II, and a possible handing over of input supply and credit
functions of the project to cooperatives at a later date, project costs should
be reduced substantially. The issue of strengthening MOA and other national
institutions, making optimum use of MOA's available resources and the re-
sources of other institutions and Ministries involved in rural development,
and thereby minimizing investment and recurrent costs, should be borne in mind
while designing future agricultural development projects.
9.11     In summary, while problems were encountered due to inadequate know-
ledge at appraisal, and the complexities of changing a largely subsistence
agricu:Lture and weaknesses of national institutions, the project, as the first
major effort at integrated agricultural development, was reasonably successful
in effecting improvements in the agriculture of Upper Lofa and set many stan-
dards for Liberia. It also demonstrated that in counties like Lofa, with
relatively higher population density (Upper Lofa areas), with presence of
thousands of smallholders cultivating multiple crops with significant
potential for increasing productivity, and large pay-offs possible from
construaction of physical and social infrastructure, the strategy of integrated
agricu:Ltural development would satisfy both growth and equity objectives of
the Government.
