INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA FOR A LOFA COUNTY
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Liberia for the equivalent of US$o.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance an Agricultural Development
Project in Lofa County. The United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) is making a parallel loan of US$5.0 million; the loan
would have a term of 40 years, including 10 years of grace, with 2 percent
interest during the grace period and 3 percent during the following 30
years.
PART I  -  THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Liberia in March 1973.   Its report
"Liberia: Growth with Development - A Basic Economic Report" (No. 426a-LBR
dated March 1, 1975) has been distributed to the Executive Directors. Country
data sheets are contained in Annex I.
3.        During the 1950s and 1960s Liberia experienced an unprecedented
rate of economic expansion, averaging close to 7 percent in real terms. This
rapid expansion has enabled the Government, for the first time in the country's
150-year history, to undertake significant investments in essential economic
and social infrastructure.
4.        The growth has been essentially based on foreign enclaves -- iron
ore mines, rubber plantations and forestry concessions -- with few linkages
between the concessions and the rest of the economy. As a result, the benefits
of growth have been unevenly distributed. Annual repatriation by foreigners
of profits and savings equals about 20 percent of gross domestic product;
about 4 percent of the Liberians have per capita income levels above US$3,000,
while the vast majority are near subsistence level with incomes below US$100.
To help redress this imbalance the Government proposes to increase its earnings
from the enclaves and use the resources to diversify the economy with increased
participation of Liberians.
5.        To help achieve these objectives, the Government is preparing a
national development plan for the period 1976-1979. In this exercise, it is
assisted by a planning team financed jointly by the Bank, UNDP, USAID and the
Government (President's Memorandum R74-61 of March 25, 1974). Further improve-
ment of public administration, the availability of foreig_n c*pItal and
technical assistance will, in large part, determine the size of the public
development program. The Government has initiated a major effort to improve
its administration and increase its capacity to plan and implement investment

programs. The United States, the Federal Republic of Germany and the
Barik Group have been, and. are expected to remain, the principal sources of
external capital. UNDP and USAID are expected to be the main donors of
technical assistance grants.
Recent Trends (1970-1974)
6.        With the transition from the 28-year rule of President Tubman to
the new admiriistration of President Tolbert in 1971, the Government initiated
a number of necessary fiscal reforms, including tighter expenditure control
and renegotiation of concession agreements. This action has resulted in a
significant improvement of the Government's fiscal performance. Nonetheless,
the economy, particularly the non-enclave sectors, has been under severe
strain since 1970. Initially this was caused by uncertainty in the private
sector following the change in administration, and was accentuated by the
fact that rubber -- which, in addition to being an enclave industry, is.also
the principal export crop of Liberian farmers -- experienced a price deterio-
ration cluring 1970-1971 and again in 1974.
7.        The economic setback in the non-enclave economy has persisted until
the first months of 1975 because of the continued contraction, in real terms,
of the public sector and a significant, almost completely imported, inflation.
Three key items illustrate this inflation. First, rice: the domestic retail
price for a 100 lb bag in March,1973 was about US$10; at the end of 1974 it
was US$25. Rice is the staple food of Liberians and dominates the cost of
living index. Second, the impact on internal transportation of higher petroleum.
prices; this has produced an increase of about 40 percent in the price for
transporting goods and people. In addition, the. cost of power has also gone
up. Third, the price of imported machinery and equipment has increased signifi-
cantly in the past two years. This, in turn, has seriously affected overall
investmant costs, particularly in agriculture and road building.
8.        On the export side, each of the three major exports -- ru-bber,
timber an(d iron ore -- has been affected differently in the past two years.
Rubber prices rose during 1973 and peaked in early 1974, dropping sharply
thereafter as the recession in industrial countries set in. In the timber
industry, demand has continued unabated for choice primary species, but has
fallen off significantly for secondary ones. In the iron ore sector, the
general shortage of raw materials experienced in 1974 and the relative
accessibility of Liberian ores have enabled the concessions to negotiate
compensation for higher energy costs and a further increase in the contract
prices for 1975 (30 percent higher for ore, 50 percent for pellets). At the
same time, serious interest is being expressed by foreign groups in the
development of three more iron ore deposits in Liberia. In the most optimistic
scenario, all three will be in production by the mid-1980s, doubling the
national output from the present annual 24 million metric tons to close to
50 million. Concession agreements for two of these new iron ore mines are
almost completed. While this would certainly be a welcome development, it
does not lessen the need to pursue a development strategy of diversification.
OpenLing of new iron ore mines will only delay the inevitable decline of this
sector by a decade or so.



- 3-
9.        Owing in part to a successful program of fiscal reform implemented
by the Government, the fiscal picture for Liberia looks reasonably good for
the next five or six years. Manpower constraints are likely to be the main
development bottleneck in the immediate future.
Balance of Payments and Creditworthiness
10.       Since Liberia uses US dollars as the medium of exchange, balance
of payments analyses are at best tenuous. In the 1964-1972 period exports
grew at 10 percent and imports by 5.9 percent annually. Thereafter, from
1972-1974, following international inflation, imports rose by 29 percent
annually, exceeding the export growth of 22 percent a year. Oil irnports
increased from US$12 million in 1972 to US$56 million in 1974. Nevertheless,
Liberia achieved a trade surplus of US$96 million in 1974 which was more than
sufficient to offset a deficit on current invisibles.
11.       External public debt outstanding and disbursed was estimated at
US$155 million in December 1974. The debt service ratio was 5.3 percent in
1974, as compared to 7.1 percent in 1972. The ratio is projected to fall
further in the next few years as final portions of heavy debt incurred in the
early 1960s are paid off. The Government has contracted little new debt in
recent years and most of it at concessionary terms. The proportion of out-
standing debt owed to the Bank/IDA is currently about 15 percent of the total.
Even with an expanded public borrowing program and assuming the most adverse
external conditions, Liberia's debt service ratio through the 1 980s is estimated
to remain below 5 percent of exports. The country should, therefore, be
regarded as creditworthy for some additional Bank lending:
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA
12.       The Bank Group has made 10loans for projects in Liberia totaling
US$32.7 million; 3 IDA credits totaling US$11 million and one technical
assistance grant of US$200,000 for development planning (paragraph 5). IFC
has made one equity investment: US$250,000 in the share capital of the
Liberian Bank for Development and Investment (LBDI). The Bank loans have
been for roads, port expansion, power and LBDI; the most recent operation
was a loan of US$1.8 million approved on July 8, 1975, to help finance a
technical assistance program in the power sector. IDA credits have been for
education and agriculture. Annex II cantains a summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as at May 31, 1975, and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
13.       The objectives of Bank Group operations are:  (a) to increase the
absorptive capacity of the economy and enable Liberians to take greater
initiatives in developing their own resources for the benefit of their own
people; (b) to support policies and programs leading to a broader sharing of
the friits of economic progress; (c) to help the Government in broadening
the economic base; and (d) to assist the Government in mobilizing development
resources for sound projects from other external agencies.



- 4 -
14.       The proposed Lofa County Agricultural Development Project, which is being
co-financed by USAID, is an important step towards these objectives. In
addition, a road project has been appraised and is expected to be submitted
to the Executive Directors in the next few months. A second education
project, a rubber rehabilitation project benefiting small indigenous
plantations and an agricultural development project for Bong County are in
preparation. The Government is examining the possibility of convening a
conference of donors for a coordinated program to assist the rural sector of
Liberia.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
15.       The structure of Liberian agriculture is characterized by (a) foreign
concessions, (b) Liberian-owned commercial farms, and (c) small traditional
farms that comprise more than 90 percent of agricultural holdings. Foreign
concessions are limited principally to large rubber plantations and logging
operations. The Liberian-owned commercial farms primarily produce rubber, but
they are increasingly expanding into poultry, livestock, coffee, cocoa, oil
palm and rice. The traditional sector is largely outside the monetized economy,
located in areas with minimal infrastructure.
16.       The average income of the traditional smallholder is about $70 per
capita, compared with a national average of about $250. Traditional agricul-
ture is based on staple crops, such as rice, and occasional cash crops such
as cocoa, coffee and oil palm. The value of total agricultural output rose
from an estimated US$68 million in 1964 to US$95 million in 1972 -- an annual
increase of almost 5 percent in real terms. However, most of this growth
was in rubber, forestry and fisheries; traditional agriculture grew by a
modest 2.4 percent a year in real terms between 1964 and 1972.
17.       Production of food marketed for cash by farmers is estimated to
have grown at 3 percent per annum in recent years. This rate fell short of
demand, which was rising 7 to 9 percent a year because of population growth
(3 percent per annum) and the increase in disposable incomes in the modern
sector. As a result, Liberia's dependence on food imports has increas2d, the
rice deficit alone increasing from 2,600 tons a year in the 1949-1953 period
to about 45,000 tons in recent years. Liberia also imports meat, sugar and
wheat flour.
18.       The Government has, in recent years, shown genuine concern for
smallholders and has been assisting them in increasing rice and tree crop
production for the market. Initially, the Government undertook semi-
mechanized land clearance and settlement in the interior. This produced
limited results,and the Government is now designing several integrated
agricultural development projects for improving the health, education and
production capability of   smallholders.  Two such projects -- in Upper Lofa
and Bong counties (see map) -- have been prepared by consultants financed
under the first agricultural credit (Credit no. 306-LBR of May 1972). The
USAID is helping to improve rural health facilities in these areas,and the
production program, as in the project under consideration, is closely
linked to health support under a complimentary USAID financed project.



Similarly the educational needs of the rural population are proposed to be
met under the IDA-assisted education projects (Credit no. 305-LBR of May 1972
and another in preparation), CARE and local self-help programs. Transportation
support is being provided under crop extraction and trunk road programs
financed by the Bank Group, the UNDP, USAID and Germany. Thus, the Lofa
County Agricultural Development Project is an integral part of a comprehensive
rural development program being launched by the Government in consultation
with several aid donors. It is intended to mark the beginning of significant
involvement of the people of the interior in the national development effort.
19.       Simultaneously with this effort, the Government is also studying
measures for promoting commercial plantation agriculture on the Ivorian
pattern. The Government is conscious of the need to diversify the economy to
adjust to a declining minerals sector within the next few decades (paragraph
8) and wishes to promote a plantation program with the help of external aid
agencies. However, this is still in a design stage,and it is too early to
evaluate its likely impact on Liberian agriculture.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
20.       The Government commissioned the services of consultants (Agrar und
Hydrotechnik of Germany) to prepare the project in Lofa County and requested
IDA and USAID for financial assistance. The project was appraised in January,
1975, and a report entitled "Appraisal of Lofa County Agricultural Development
Project" (No. 744-LBR dated June 27, 1975) is being circulated separately to
the Executive Directors. A Credit and project summary is presented in Annex
III. Negotiations took place in Washington on June 3 and 4, 1975. The Liberian
negotiating team was led by Mr. Louis Russ, Deputy Minister of Agriculture.
Project Objectives
21.       The project has two major objectives:   (a) to raise the income and
improve the quality of life of some 8,000 of the poorest farm families in
Liberia (each with average holdings of less than 4 hectares) through improved
cultivation practices, better transportation, provision of reliable water
supplies and disease control, and (b) to help establish sound, reliable
institutional and technical support agencies for implementing this and future
projects for smallholders. The risks involved in such a project are not incon-
siderable. The project site is in a relatively remote section of the country.
The intended beneficiaries typically work by traditional methods, barely
participate in the market economy, live in poor social conditions and subsist
on a modicum of food production from their farms. The risks are worth taking,
however, since the Government of Liberia is now firmly committed to small-
holder development and seems willing to consider bold, innovative measures to
help achieve that objective. A similar project across the border from Lofa
County in Sierra Leone, financed by the Association (Credit 323-SL of June 30,
1973) and involving peoples of similar tribal and economic backgrounds, has
been successful. The Lofa undertaking is the result of careful planning and
is regarded by the Government as a model for future projects.

Project Content
22.       Specifically, the project will include the following elements:
provision of seasonal and development credit to assist project farmers
develop and improve production of 5,600 hectares of upland rice, 1,900
hectares of swamp rice, 2,800 hectares of coffee and 2,300 hectares of
cocoa; construction of 100 viLlage wells; provision of a schistosormiasis
surveillance unit; construction and operation of staff and farmer training
centers; recruitment and training of Liberians for extension, cooperative
credit and project management; introduction of an agricultural credit system
through new institutional arrangements such as creationi of a special revolving
fund and the establishment of a branch of the Liberian Bank for Development
and Investment at the project center in Voinjama (see map)!
23.       During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that it would construct up to 100 km of new feeder roads in the project area,
rehabilitate up to 500 km of existing feeder roads, and maintain the main
primary road through the project area as an all-weather road    (Section
5.04 of Draft Credit Agreement). It is proposed that -this road component
be financed under the Third Highway project, which will be submitted shortly
to the Executive Directors (paragraph 14). However, if for some reason
tins assistance is not forthcoming, the Government itself has agreed to
provide $1.5 million for the road work. As stated earlier,the project is
part of a wider area development program in Lofa County. Other features of
the program include: (i) Lofa County rural health project, a comprehensive
health improvement program assisted by USAID and costing US$5 million over
the years  1975-1979;   (ii)  educational reform and extension under
the Government's "Connunity Schools Program", for which assistance is
proposed under the next IDA education project; and (iii) a rural water supply
and sewerage program assisted by Germany, UNDP and WHO. The institutional
aspects of this project (paragraphs 26 and 27) are des:Lgned to coordinate
development activities in the region and to harmonize production programs
with welfare activities so that effective continuity will be maintained in
the post-project period.
Project Cost and Financing
24.       Total cost of the project is estimated at US$17.0 million, net of all
identifiable taxes and duties, during the five-year development period, 1976-1980.
The foreign exchange component would amount to US$7.8 rmillion (46 percent of
total project cost) and would be financed partly by IDA (US$4.8 million) and
partly by USAID (US$3 million). The balance of the IDA credit (US$1.2 million)
and USAID loan (US$2 million) would finance local costs. Despite the measures
taken to improve the fiscal situation, the Government is not in a position to
fully finance the local costs of its stepped-up development program and the
IDA and USAID loan proposals reflect the fact that some financing of local
costs by external lenders is required, particularly for high priority projects
in sectors such as agriculture where the foreign component of project costs
tends to be relatively low. A total of US$6.0 million (or 35 percent of the
project cost) would be financed by the Government of Liberia. Formal authoriz-
ation and effectiveness of the IJSAID loan is expected shortly and will be a
condition of effectiveness of the credit (Section 7.01 (a) of the Credit
Agreement). The following tables summarize project costs and their financing.

25.       The USAID loan would mainly finance the credit component for farm
inputs (fertilizer, pesticide, seeds, farm tools and equipment, and hired
labor for swamp development) and related technical assistance, administration
and construction costs. It would also finance the schistosomiasis surveillance
unit and dormitory facilities for training. IDA will finance the extension
service, well drilling program and other project items. Details are in
Annex III.
26.       A project management unit would be established with headquarters
at Voinjama. It would be headed by a project manager responsible, through a
project steering committee, to the Minister of Agriculture or his designee.
The unit would consist of six divisions: administration and personnel;
finance; -training; cooperatives and credit; land development; and agriculture.
The project would be staffed by qualified local staff wherever possible, but
because of shortages of experienced Liberians, certain key positions may
initially have to be filled with expatriates. The expatriates will be given
a timetable within which Liberian counterparts are to be trained to take over
the responsibilities. To facilitate operations of the project management
unit, a project bank account will be established by the Government with an
initial deposit of US$100,000. Opening of this account will be a condition
for effectiveness (Section 7.01 (c) of the Credit Agreement).



27.       A project steering committee and a prolect advisory committee would
be set up respectively to help ensure coordination:   a among government
departments and (b) among tribal heads and other leaders in the project area.
The latter committee would consist of the Lofa County superintendent, paramount
chiefs and heads of cooperatives in the area. The former committee would
include the Ministers (or their Deputies) of Agriculture (Chairman), Finance,
Planning, Local Government and Rural Development and would ensure interministerial
coordination in execution of the project. In addition, the Government will,
in the context of a current study being carried out by the Minis,.ry of Agricul-
ture, examine the possibility of establishing a rural development authority
to assume overall responsibility for execution of the project and to plan and
manage future rural developraent projects in the country. During negotiations
Government agreed that institutional matters involving the Ministry and the
proposed rural development authority would be discussed with IDA within six
months of submission of the consultants' report (Section 5.02 of Credit Agreement).
Agricultural Credit and Marketing
28.       The project would help strengthen four existing cooperatives in
the area, and rely on them for delivery of farm inputs and credit, and for
providing improved marketing facilities to project farmers. A revolving
fund for farm credit would be set up and administered by the Liberian Bank
for Development and Investment (LBDI) under an agreement between the Govern-
ment and LBDI. A branch of LBDI would be established in the project area
for channelling credit funds through the farmer cooperatives. LBDI would
lend to the farmer cooperatives, which, in turn, would advance development
loans and seasonal credits to farmers. A credit advisory committee consisting
of local chiefs, representative farmers, project and extension staff would
screen loan applications prior to PMl4 approval. LBDI would also introduce,
for the first time, full banking facilities in the project area.
29.       The total amount of credit per farmer, including incremental
seasonal credit, is not expected to exceed $1,000 and would enable small
farmers to expand into permanent crops, swamp rice, coffee and cocoa, thereby
reducing their dependence on the traditional shifting cultivation system.
Development loans (3-12 years repayment, depending on the crop being developed,
at 10 percent interest per annum) would be provided for swamp rice, coffee
and cocoa, to cover land development costs, hired labor (swamp rice only),
farm tools and equipment, seedlings, fertilizer during establishment of
coffee and cocoa, and agricultu,ral chemicals. Seasonal credit (at a flat
service charge of 10 percent l) would be provided for upland and swamp rice,
coffee and cocoa for seed, fertilizer, agricultural chemicals and sprayers.
The project revolving credit fund would be built up through repayments of
seasonal credits and development loans. At the end of the project develop-
ment period in 1980, the fund would amount to an estimated $3.8 million
(excluding interest income). In the credit scheme, a 3 percent margin (about
8 percent on seasonal funds) would be provided to the farmer cooperatives to
cover administration and bad debts. LBDI would receive a 2 percent commission
on disbursed credit.
1/ Equivalent to 15 percent per annum for average seasonal
credits with a maturity of eight months.



-9-
Training
30.       The project would provide a combination of short courses, inter-
spersed with practical field instruction, for staff at all levels. A new
training center would be established. Cooperative staff training in credit,
input supply, marketing and management and organization would be undertaken
by the project management unit.  Farmer training would be provided thr xgh a
combination of short residential farm family courses at the farmer training
center, demonstration farms and farm visits. Emphasis would be placed on
the demonstration effect of the more progressive farmers.
Procurement and Disbursements
31.       Procurement of vehicles, plant and equipment valued at more than
US$25,000, and estimated to total US$0.9 million, would be financed by IDA
through international competitive bidding.  Domestically manufactured goods
would be allowed a 15 percent preference or the applicable duty, whichever is
lower, when comparing domestic bids with those of foreign manufacturers.
Items valued between US$5,000 and US$25,000 would be procured on the basis
of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the Association. Contracts for items costing less than US$5,000
would be procured through customary local procedures satisfactory to the
Association.
32.       Proceeds of the Credit would be disbursed over five years -- 1976
to 1980 -- to cover 35 percent of total project costs. The IDA credit would
be disbursed against: (a) 100 percent of foreign or 80 percent of local
expenditure for vehicles and equipment not financed by USAID, for certain inter-
nationally recruited staff and consultants services and for LBDI assistance;
(b) 90 percent of expenditure for civil works and construction materials;
(c) 90 percent of local expenditure for administation and operating costs.
Retroactive financing of up to US$100,000 is proposed to cover the costs of
early recruitment of the project manager, training and development controller
and agricultural manager prior to credit signature.
Project Benefits
33.       The economic rate of return is estimated at 26 percent.  At project
maturity in 1987, incremental annual production would amount to 7,300 tons of
milled rice, 2,500 tons of coffee and 1,600 tons of cocoa with a total foreign
exchange benefit of US$9.3 million. About 8,000 farm families, with average
holdings of less than 4 hectares per family, would directly benefit. The
average net farm family income is estimated to increase from the present $313
to $913 at project maturity. Apart from these direct benefits to participating
farmers, the project would have important secondary benefits, largely unquanti-
fiable, for the community as a whole from improved roads, banking, education
and health facilities, including improved drinking water supplies. The project
would also strengthen the Agriculture Ministry's technical capabilities, its
cooperative/credit extension, agricultural research, and project management
for future development activities.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 617-IBR                         Port Development Project; US$3.6 million-
Loan of June 20, 1969; Closing Date:
May 31, 1975.
This port project involved dredging the approaches and an area within
the Monrovia port to accommodate bulk ore carriers and tankers; provision of
two tugs and a pilot launch, as well as additional buoying and lighting of the
navigable channels; consultants' services for individual advisers and feasibility
studies for the development of road approaches to the port. Project execution
has been satisfactory.   The Bank has agreed to the Government's request that
funds still undisbursed be used to help finance an overall study of port develop-
ment needs in Liberia, which was stipulated in the project. Government signed
a contract in May 1974 for the port development study.
Loan No. 684-IER                         Power proJects; US$7.7 million Loan of
June 4, 1970 (fully disbursed) and US$7.6
Loan No. 778-LBR                         million Loan of October 26, 1973; Closing
date: June 30, 1975.
The loans to the Public Utilities Authority (PUA) have helped finance
the expansion of the Mount Coffee hydroelectric plant, the installation of two
gas turbines at the Bushrod (Monrovia) plant; procurement and erection of 42
miles of overhead lines in Monrovia and 54 miles in outlying areas; establish-
ment of a new substation and related facilities. There have been cost overruns
mainly due to international currency fluctuations and the purchase of larger
generators than originally anticipated. A supplemental loan of US$2.9 million
was provided in October, 1973 to cover the cost overruns, and project imple-
mentation is proceeding satisfactorily.   On July 8, 1975, the Board approved
a technical assistance loar of $1.8 Tlillion for PTTA.

Credit No. 306-LBR                Agriculture project; US$1.2 million
Credit of Ma      , 12  Cosing date:
December 31, 1976.
The agriculture credit includes feasibility studies and
preparation of detailed investment proposals for integrated rural
development projects; a phy-sical survey and detailed study of the
Liberian-owned rubber industry; a pilot rubber scheme to provide
Liberian rubber farmers with credits to rehabilitate untapped or
poorly tapped rubber; improving rice research; reorganization of
the Ministry of Agriculture and training for Liberians to prepare
investment projects. Effectiveness of this credit had to be post-
poned because of difficulties in obtaining necessary staff for the
project unit. A project administrator was designated in January,
1973 but left after a month because of irreconcilable differences
with the Ministry of Agriculture. A replacement served for a year
and a half but recently was forced to resign because of illness.
The Government has decided to carry on the project using staff from
the ministry. Consultants will be retained to carry out the reor-
ganization study of the Miristry of Agriculture.
Loan No. 839-LBR                  Development Finance CoZ2a ; US$1
million Loan of June 26, 1972;
Closing date:
Loan No. 1055-LBR                 December 31, 1976 and US$4 million
Loan of December 3. 1974; Closing
date June 30. 1979.
The first loan contributed to foreign exchange costs of
industrial projects financed by LBDI in 1972 and 1973. This loan is
fully committed.    The second loan would help LBDI meet its finan-
cial requirements through calendar year 1976.
Credit No. 907-LBR                Highway Project; US$3.0 million Loan
of June 13. 1973: Closing date:
December 31. 1977;
Loan No. 395-LBR                  and US$2.6 million Credit of June 13,
1973; Closing date: December 31. 1977.
Implementation of the maintenance program, which started
about six months behind schedule, is progressing slowly.  Further
delays.were caused by a US$4.0 million cost overrun on the US-financed
maintenance equipment, and a delay in its delivery. USAID has agreed
to provide supplementary financing.  Contracts for all engineering
studies have been signed, and work progress is satisfactory. The
construction contract for the Monrovia Bypass has been awarded and
work has begun.

Credit No. 305-LBR                Education project; US$7.2 million
Credit of Mav 17, 1972; Closing
date; March 1, 1978
The education credit is helping to finance construction of,
and provide equipment for, two new multilateral high schools in the
north and the east, each offering a wide curriculum in agriculture,
mechanics and academic subjects; construction of and equipment for a
new college of agriculture and forestry; expansion of a rural teacher
training institute and construction of an adjacent demonstration
school, technical assistance and fellowships for manpower and education
planning, technical teacher training, secondary education and project
implementation. Some delay was encountered initially in obtaining
requisite expatriate staff for the project unit and the original
effectiveness date had to be postponed. This problem has been over-
come and project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.
