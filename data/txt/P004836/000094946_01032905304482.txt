3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3 1 Original Objective
The main objectives of the Project as stated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) dated April 14, 1995 are
to (a) assist the Government in optimizing its investment decisions and help meet demand growth, (b) help
improve the efficiency of the power supply system by (i) rehabilitating and reinforcing transmission and
distribution systems, (ii) converting generating plants from open to combined cycle operation, and (iii)
installing modem load dispatch centers, (c) strengthen the planning, administrative and management
capabilities of the power companies through technical assistance and training, (d) rationalize and strengthen
the training system for the power sector, and (e) assist in the review of issues and options in the promotion
of electricity energy efficiency and demand side management
The objectives were realistic in scope, relevant, important, and consistent with the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (Report 13545) which sees IDA's role as working with Government to continuously
update its development plan, taking into account of changing economic conditions, to improve the
efficiency of electricity utilization through proper pricing and conservation, and to strengthen power
agencies through technical assistance and training The objectives are also consistent with the
Government's aim to improve basic infrastructure and its commitment to improving efficiency, and
encouraging private sector participation The project design is directly relevant toward achieving the above
objectives
3 2 Revised Objective
The original objectives remained unchanged
3 3 Original Components
The Project originally financed (a) for PC2 (i) rehabilitation and reinforcement of the distribution system
in Ho Chi Minh City, (ii) conversion of three 37 5 MW open cycle turbines to a 170 MW combined cycle
unit at Ba Ria, (iii) establishment of the Southem Region Load Dispatch Center, (iv) establishment of the
Southem Region Training Center, (v) resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected by components
a(i) and a(ii), and (vi) consulting services for detailed engineering, procurement and construction
supervision, and an engineering study for the Dai Ninh Hydropower project, (b) for PC3 (i) rehabilitation
and reinforcement of the distribution systems of the cities of Hue and Nha Trang (ii) construction of the
220 kV Krong Buk-Nha Trang transmission lines and 220 kV substations at Krong Buk and Nha Trang,
and expansion of the 110 kV substation at Nha Trang, Cau Do and Lien Tri, (iii) establishment of the
Central Region Load Dispatch Center (due to shortfall of funds it was financed by EVN, refer to 4 2 (g)),
(iv) establishment of the Central Region Training Center, (v) resettlement and/or compensation of persons
affected by component b(i) and b(ii), and (vi) consulting services for detailed engineering, procurement, and
construction supervision The Project also included (a) for MOE (i) expansion of the National Load
Dispatch Center, (ii) procurement of equipment for the National Training Center, and (iii) engineering
studies for the Son La Hydropower project, and (b) for the Power Sector (i) technical assistance in
strategic planning, MIS, human resource development, financial management and materials management,
and (ii) technical assistance in demand-side management and electricity efficiency improvement Also, in
association with ESMAP, a study was conducted on Power Sector Reform and Restructuring, based on the
principles of (a) improving the operational efficiency of the sector, (b) commercializing and corporatizing
of the constituent operations to provide greater managerial and financial autonomy, (c) developing an
appropriate legal and regulatory framework that would allow for greater autonomy and requisite
government regulatory oversight, and (d) a financially viable and open sector structure that allows the
increased private involvement in financing sector expansion

3 4 Revised Components
The original description of the components was not revised
3 5 Quality at Entty
Quality of entry is rated as satisfactory, in spite of the 10 months delay in declaring credit effectiveness due
to the reorganization of the sector in 1995 The IDA Credit was only declared effective on March 8, 1996
With the creation of EVN in 1995 and the subsequent restructuring of the PCs some changes were made in
implementing agencies and reflected in the legal documents Originally PC2, PC3 and the Ministry of
Energy (which ceased to exist) were the implementors of the project components falling under their
respective jurisdictions With the creation of EVN and the restructuring of the PCs, the new implementing
agencies were (i) PCI for the National Training Center, (ii) PC2 for the Southern Regional Load
Dispatch Center and the Southern Region Training Center components, (iii) PC3 for the Central Training
Center, as well as the Upgrading of Hue, and Nha Trang Distribution and Central Load Dispatch Center,
and (iv) EVN, through its Management Boards, for the Ba Ria Combined Cycle add-on, 220 kV
Transmission Line and associated 220 kV and 110 kV substations, and the National Load Dispatch Center
The project design followed comprehensive technical and economic analysis by means of feasibility studies
that were carried out before appraisal and reviewed by IDA and technical experts Proper skills mix
characterized the project team composition during project preparation The project design includes some
elements of best practice in defining specific project performance indicators, clear implementation
arrangements, setting up a procurement monitoring group, and providing for independent monitoring
agencies to control RAP implementation
Project ownership was high Project Management Units (PMUs) handled day to day problems during
project preparation/appraisal process, and later during implementation, including RAPs
The Bank's safeguard policies on environmental and social issues were duly considered and addressed
during project preparation RAPs including land acquisition and compensation were conditions for
appraisal
-3 -



Institutional strengthening was a major focus during project preparation Extensive support was provided
to EVN by the Ministries concerned in the drafting of the Electricity Law and Regulatory Framework,
through workshops and on-the-job training
Assessment of risks was marginally satisfactory Although the risk of demand not materializing was
rightly assessed as low, subsequent events proved that the crisis in the region did not materially affect the
demand as the Project focused on potential high growth areas However, several risks were not adequately
assessed and mitigated The risk of institutional changes caused by the restructuring of the sector and the
creation on EVN in January 1, 1995 was not flagged at appraisal and its potential impact on
implementation arrangements and responsibilities, which caused a delay in the original schedule, right at
the start of the Project The assessment also did not consider the risk of protracted delays in reaching
agreement with the Government regarding a sufficient tariff adjustment that would enable EVN and the
PCs to meet the cash generation covenant At appraisal it was assumed that the Government would support
a tariff rate adjustment that would improve the financial performance of the power utilities Subsequent
events proved this assumption to be too optimistic (see Financial Objectives and Compliance with
Covenants) Consequently, the lack of agreement on implementing a tariff increase resulted in a
downgrade of the Project's DO rating (para 4 1)
Although the risk of sufficient gas supply for the Ba Ria power plant was not considered at appraisal, EVN
has recently obtained a commitment from PetroVietnam for adequate supplies of gas and hence long-term
supply arrangements have been made However, there will be a limited period in 2001/2002 where the total
gas available for all the power plants in the Ba Ria/Phu MY complex will not be enough to supply expected
levels of demand With limited gas supply, although for a brief period, the Ba Ria power plant, which
was intended as a base load plant, may only be used for peaking, hence, limiting its benefits
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4 1 Outcome/achievement of objective
The overall outcome of *.iis Project is rated as satisfactory despite implementation delays At loan closing
(in June 30, 2000 after a one year extension), almost 100% of the physical components were completed
The Project made significant contributions towards improving the efficiency of the power sector, in
reducing losses and improving system operation and control In addition, the power sector institutions have
been strengthened, by capacity building, including the establishment of regional training centers, and
focused technical assistance IDA worked closely with the Government in assisting EVN to get on its feet
in 1995, in analyzing the issues in power sector institutional strengthening, and in formulating a concrete
strategy for DSM However, due to the reorganization of the sector (para 3 5), a delay running from 6-18
months for the various components was already reported in June 1996, resulting in the downgrade of the
Project's implementation rating (refer to IP Rating in Section 4 2)
In June 1998, the DO rating of the Project was also downgraded to 'Unsatisfactory' due to the uncertainty
in reaching agreements with the Govermment on sufficient tariff adjustments However, the rating was
upgraded to 'Satisfactory' later in the year when the Government agreed to a progressive schedule of tariff
increases The Project closed with a satisfactory IP and DO ratings In view of the satisfactory financial
performance of EVN and the PCs throughout the project period, the ICR concurs with this assessment
However, a tariff increase particularly in FY0O-01 is key to achieving satisfactory future financial
performance and compliance with financial covenants by EVN and the PCs The achievement of each
project objectives is summarized below
-4 -



PDO 1 Assist the GOVin optimizing its investment decisions and help meet demand growth This
objective has been achieved satisfactorilv, despite implementation delays The infrastructure investments
carried out under the Project were all part of EVN's and the respective PCs least cost plan and investment
program Electricity sales increased by about 14% on average during the period 1995-2000 with the highest
growth rates in the south of Vietnam With investment in generation (Ba-Ria Combined cycle add-on) and
in expansion and reinforcement of the transmission and distribution networks, the Project met the demand
in these years and improved reliability and quality of service
PDO 2 Help improve the efficiency of the power supply system by (i) rehabilitating and reinforcing
transmission and distribution systems, (ii) converting generating plantsfrom open to combined cycle
operation, and (iii) installing modern load dispatch centers This objective has been achieved
satisfactorilj as follows
Distribution losses improved considerably as shown below in a comparison to the targets set at appraisal
and actual losses
Distribution Loss Targets at Appraisal (%)  Actual Distribution Losses (%)
Entity/Year      96    98      00  Entity/Year     96     98     00
HCMC             16    13    10  HCMC             13 3    10 7    9
Hue              17    14    12  Hue               12    93      8 8
Nha Trang        12    10       8 Nha Trang        12    9.3    8.3
Non-technical losses were reduced considerably, with reported losses less than 3%, for Hue, Nha Trang
and HCMC This was accomplished by frequent oversight and improved management
Efficiency. The conversion of Ba Ria from open cycle to combined cycle (i e 3x37 5 MW combustion
turbines and installation of 3 heat recovery boilers and a 57 MW steam turbine) improved the efficiency
and environmental impact of the existing gas turbines by lowering the temperature of the exhaust gas
Plant factors improved from 0 895 before conversion to about 0 98 at present In addition, unit heat rates,
which are reflected in plant efficiency, improved from 13,300 BTU/kWh before conversion to 8,453
BTU/kWh after conversion
The establishment of modem load dispatch centers improved the efficiency of the system by allowing for
economic dispatch to be implemented, enabling better monitoring and supervisory control of the power
system for a more efficient utilization of available resources, and increased security of supply by
shortening the time for power supply restoration after a disturbance The supervisory activities would
prevent outages and premature aging caused by overload The economic dispatch function would ensure
the most economic power production by close monitoring and matching of supply and demand and optimal
unit commitment
PDO 3 Strengthen the planning, administrative and management capabilities of the power companies
through technical assistance and training This achievement of this objective is satisfactory Relevant
accomplishments include
(a) Establishment of an Environmental Management Unit at Ba Ria Power Station, with environmnental
-5 -



supervision undertaken every six months during project implementation and sent to relevant authorities
The guidelines and principles discussed and agreed upon are being used in other projects thus strengthening
the management capabilities of the entities involved
(b) The institutional strengthening studies were essential in the reform and restructuring of the sector and
the creation of EVN and other entities, and for the development of a more commercialized attitude within
EVN and the PCs
(c) The first independent audit of the financial statements of EVN and the PCs were concluded under the
Project (in 1997) EVN is now convinced of the significance of an independent audit in ensuring reliability
and confidence in its financial statements
(d) Promotine Power Sector Reform and Draftinfz of the Electricity Law  There is still much to be done to
promote sector reform as the monopoly of EVN has been identified as a significant constraint to efficiency
The 12th draft of the Electricity Law and draft decrees on tariffs and regulation are being discussed and
some policy issues are still to be resolved by a Working Group (i e long-term market structure,
establishing regulatory certainty/stability in the primary Electricity Law, and clarifying tariffs and pricing
principles), before National Assembly approval
PDO 4 Rationalize and strengthen the training systemfor the power sector This objective has been
achieved satisfactorily  Training centers were established which allowed for (a) an improvement in the
quality and quantity of students and teaching personnel, and the management of the training centers, (b) a
more cost effective and well coordinated procurement of testing equipment, and (c) a revision of outdated
teaching materials   The end result is an improvement in the effectiveness and efficacy of the training
centers Another side benefit included the creation of additional job opportunities in the region
PDO S Assist in the review of issues and options in the promotion of electricity energy efficiency and
demand side management This objective has been satisfactorily achieved The recommendations of the
study provided the basis for the formulation of the DSM components of the Transmission Distribution and
Disaster Reconstruction Project (Cr 3034)
Financial Objectives and Compliance with Covenants
The financial objectives of the Project, as reflected in the covenanted financial ratios, were substantially
achieved The financial performance of EVN, HCMC PC, PC2, and PC3 has been satisfactory EVN's
profitability and strong performance are reflected in the financial ratios from FY96-99, operating margin
(earnings before interest and taxes) averaged 18%, and self-financing ratio, 38% The satisfactory financial
results of the PCs and compliance with IDA covenants are guaranteed by the bulk supply tariff charged by
EVN to the PCs It is noteworthy that enormous progress has been achieved in improving their accounting
systems and procedures
EVN. In spite of the regional financial crisis in mid-1997 and export stagnation which affected energy
consumption in all economic sectors, EVN continued to record satisfactory financial performance and
achieve strong earnings in FY98 Because of the continued growing demand for power, albeit at a slower
rate than the pre-1997 pace, and increased revenues from electricity sales, sufficient revenues were
generated by EVN to cover all operating and maintenance expenses (including depreciation) and interest
expenses Except for FY98, EVN was in compliance with all the financial covenants during the project
period While operating results were positive, audited figures showed that EVN fell a little short of its
obligation to contribute at least 30% of intemally generated funds to investment, posting a self financing
-6-



ratio of only 27% in FY98 The shortfall was caused primarily by an increase in working capital
requirements due to significant trade prepayments at the end of the year, which tied up necessary funds In
FY99, the self financing ratio recovered to 34% due to robust demand, reduction in power losses, and a
tariff increase
The financial strength of EVN and the power sector as a whole is a key development objective of IDA in its
involvement in Vietnam's power sector Hence, the sector reform program required an increase in average
tariffs to reflect the true cost of electricity supply to consumers The long-run marginal cost of electricity
was estimated in 1993 to be in the range of 7 US/kWh and the Government, at the time of project
appraisal, expressed its commitment to increasing tariffs to this level by 1999 Electricity tariffs were
raised periodically during the project period in June 1995, April 1996, and May 1997 In January 1998,
IDA approved the third Vietnam Credit for the Transmission, Distribution and Disaster Reconstruction
Project, which was conditioned on the Government's actual approval to raise electricity tariffs to 7
US/kWh by 1999 However, while the Government agreed to the tariff conditionality during negotiations,
they were not prepared at Credit signing to be bound by a tariff increase within a year's time Furthermore,
the impact of the regional financial crisis and continuing devaluation of the Dong against the dollar, raised
major concerns in the Government This led to an 18-month impasse, a delay in Credit signing and a
downgrading of the Project rating to unsatisfactory After detailed discussions with the Government, the
issue was finally resolved and agreement was reached to raise average retail electricity tariffs according to
a progressive schedule (a) 5 2 US/kWh by July 1999, (b) 6 2 US/kWh by July 2000, and (c) 7
US/kWh by March 1, 2001 In March 1999, EVN proposed a restructuring of tariffs within categories
and an increase in the average retail tariff to 5 2 US/kWh which the Government approved, effective
October 1, 1999
The delay of the next tariff increase which was scheduled by July 2000 is a serious concern for the
financial health of EVN A tariff increase particularly in FYOO-0 1 is key to achieving satisfactory future
financial performance and compliance with financial covenants
PCs The past financial results of PC2, 3 and HCMC PC were also satisfactory and complied with
financial covenants under the Project Power sales in GWh for the period FY96-99 grew on average by
6%, 18%, and 18%, for PC2, 3, and HCMC PC, respectively Revenues of the three PCs were sufficient to
cover operating expenses and debt service, enabled the PCs to eam sufficient net income to contribute to
expansion of assets Growth in revenues mirrored increasing power consumption of a growing economy in
the PCs' service area Operating margins of the three PCs, however, continue to decrease The cost of
supplying electricity, particularly purchased power from EVN and power construction costs, are the main
expense items that affected the PCs' bottom line The average operating ratio of the three PCs in FY99
was 94% with HCMC PC recording the highest increase, largely due to the sharp increase in purchased
power in FY99
At appraisal, PC2's financial results were projected to be satisfactory on the strength of robust sales and
upward adjustment in tariffs With this scenario, it was assumed that PC2 would be able to finance about
35% of its future investments from internal sources Despite the spinning off the operations of two
lucrative industrial and urban areas (Ho Chi Minh City and Dongnai), from PC2, healthy financial results
were recorded from 1996 to 1999 Energy sales revenue grew on average by 10% and covenanted
financial ratios were met from FY96-99
Although there was a serious concern with PC3's financial situation at appraisal, as PC3 serves mainly
rural and agricultural areas, this concern turned to be unwarranted due to an overall positive economic
performnance PC3 recorded an increase in energy revenues by 21% on average during the project period
- 7-



Covenanted financial ratios, i e operating ratio not higher than 100%, debt service coverage ratio 1 3
times, and accounts receivables to be no less than four months of sales revenue, were met during FY96-99
Other reasons for PC3's and PC2's financial improvement and covenant compliance, include the fact that
their operations were scaled back as a result of the reorganization PC2 and PC3 no longer incur expensive
costs associated with transmission and distribution above a certain voltage In addition, prior to the
reorganization and EVN, transfer prices for power were mandated by the Government with no regard for
profit or losses, until IDA imposed some financial discipline and covenants
HCMC PC reported satisfactory result for the same project period However, in FY97, it recorded a self
financing ratio of only 13%, because of substantial cash requirements for working capital for advance
payments to contractors and suppliers for materials and equipment
4 2 Outputs by components
As the Project components were already running late in June 1996, and to make up for lost time, a
Procurement Monitoring System, within the PMUs, was set up to track procurement for all contracts In
addition, all implementing agencies were asked to prepare updated/revised implementation schedules and to
submit to the Bank quarterly reports that were thoroughly reviewed The approval process for feasibility
studies and contracts for consulting services and equipment was streamlined also with the purpose of
making up for lost time
Due to the substantial start-up delays, the IP Rating was downgraded to "Unsatisfactory" in mid-1996
The rating was subsequently changed to satisfactory as the Project picked up speed in late 1996 The
Project closed with a "Satisfactory" IP rating With almost 100% completion of all financed components
the ICR agrees with the IP ratings throughout project implementation
The two main common factors that contributed to delays in implementation in many of the components and
to various degrees were (i) the restructuring/reorganization of the power sector consequently postponing
Credit effectiveness declaration, and (ii) the cumbersome government approval processes Other factors
that contributed to implementation delays are described in the appropriate sections
I Physical Components
(a) With the construction of the Krong Buk-Nha Trang 220 kV transmission line and associated 220 kV
and 110 kV substations in Central Vietnam, it is now possible to evacuate power from the 500 kV
North-South transmission system, and to minimize the overload and undervoltage conditions The
recurrent problem of power shortage in Central Vietnam was also resolved considerably With the
extension of the 110 kV Cau Do and Lien Tri substations in Central Vietnam, the power distribution
network in Danang became stable thus increasing security of supply The same outcome has been achieved
at the seaside resort of Nha Trang when the 110 kV Nha Trang substation was put in service Power
losses of the PC3 network were reduced from 11 4% at the beginning of the Project to 9 1% at present
The implementation of this project suffered about a two year delay caused by - in addition to the factors
mentioned above - the termination of contract for consulting services, in October 1997, in the amount of
US$ 495,000 between the Central Power Projects Management Board (CPPMB) and the consortium of
Merz & McLellan and Lahmeyer International on April 24, 1996, which necessitated the mobilization of
Vietnamese experts who were able to provide the design, engineering and project management expertise for
supervision of the project On the positive side, this bespeaks of the improvement in skills in Vietnam
which were partly obtained by well focused technical assistance provided by IDA lending program to
-8 -



Vietnam In spite of implementation delays, the output of this component is satisfactory
The RAP for this component was implemented successfully and completed on August 29, 1999 For the
220 kV transmission line, a total 119 houses were removed and the PAHs received just compensation For
the 220 kV terminal substations at Krong Buk and Nha Trang, 12 PAHs were also justly compensated
Total compensation, including for trees and crops affected by the ROW, amounted to VND 6 4 billion
With the money received, the PAPs built new houses of much better quality and had some spare money to
purchase a few things for their new homes PAPs were also allowed to remove and reuse some parts from
their old houses which were removed In addition, PAPs were allowed to remain in their present house
until their new houses were completed, which contributed to a socially positive environment that was
essential to the success of the RAP implementation Danang University Environmental Research and
Protection Center carried out the Independent Extemal Monitoring activities for this project component,
and the monitoring report of June 2000 is available on file Tables 1 and 2 in Section 10 provide some
additional details
(b) The Ba Ria Combined Cycle Add-on Conversion plant was first synchronized to the grid on February
12, 1999, and fully completed on August 20, 1999 with performance tests and hand over on September 11,
1999 The operation of the Ba Ria add-on combined cycle plant was a success with real efficiency and
environmental benefits, as evidenced by an analysis of operating data
This project component suffered about a 26 month delay Factors which contributed to this delay, apart
from those mentioned already, were (i) design changes needed for a change over to air cooling after a
recommendation made by the Consultant (ESBI), (ii) shortages of generating capacity to allow shut-down
of GT for add-on works, (iii) ineffective coordination among members of the consortium
(Nem-Mitsui-Siemens), and (iv) justifiable rejection by IDA of the first bid evaluation report on the basis
of a faulty bid selection/evaluation on the part of PMBRMB/EVN, which resulted in IDA's
correspondingly lengthy review In view of the benefits obtained since commissioning, the overall output
of this component is satisfactory
An Environmental Monitoring Unit was established at the Ba Ria Power Station in September 1999 to
monitor environmental impacts during the operation of the combined cycle plant The environmental
impacts are within guidelines (refer to Table 3 in Section 10) Mitigation measures included (i) treatment
of waste water from the Ba Ria combined cycle plant so as not increase the salt, or other chemical agents,
concentrations which are flushed into the discharge culvert or to the Dinh River, (ii) erection at the site
perimeter of a berm with planted trees and shrubs for noise mitigation, and (iii) acoustic insulation of
nearby houses In addition, Ba Ria operators have received extensive training in operation and
maintenance works, which have produced an excellent environmental operating record
(c) Rehabilitation and reinforcement of the distribution systems of Nha Trang and Hue In Nha Trang,
this component covered the first stage of Khanh Hoa plans for rehabilitation and expansion of the
distribution system in central Nha Trang City, occupying about a quarter of Nha Trang's area All
equipment and materials were delivered by credit closing date (June 30, 2000) Although the 22 kV MV
component and the step up 6 3/22 kV transformer at Chut Power Plant were completed, completion of the
400 V network was expected in December 2000 The status of completion of the LV networks at credit
closing was as follows (i) 92% of the main LV networks, (ii) 20% for service lines, (iii) 5% for meter
boxes, and (iv) 35% for meters Since this project component was expected at appraisal to be completed in
January 1997, the project would have been almost 3 years delayed due mainly to its late start (March
1998) In Hue City, in particular, due to the severe floods in November 1999, some parts of the power
system in the city were severely damaged, and about 51 substations under the Project were submerged
-9-



However, full commissioning of all components was achieved by credit closing
Positive impacts at both Nha Trang and Hue Cities include, in particular, an improvement in voltage
quality at the 22 kV, 6 6 kV and 400 V levels, and a reduction of losses (para 4 1) Another positive
benefit of this component is the increase in safety with a 67% decrease in number of accidental deaths
Quality of service, despite the unfavorable conditions in late 1999 to August 2000, also improved with a
decrease in the number of faults in the system resulting in a more than 80% decrease in unserved energy at
both Khanh Hoa and Thua Thien Hue provinces at project commissioning in 1999 The Project also
contributed positively to an improvement in institutional efficiency, as shown in the table below (both Nha
Trang and Hue)
Item          1995      2000
Customers/Employee     72        94
Sales/Employee (kWh)   385,050  629,871
The RAPs for both Nha Trang and Hue, which were approved by the Government on March 27, 1995,
were successfully implemented (RAP reports prepared by PC3 are available on file) The Nha Trang
Teacher's College was the Independent Monitoring Agency which supervised RAP implementation In Nha
Trang, there were 73 PAHs which received about 28,663,440 VND in compensation No houses were
removed Living standards were not affected and were even improved somewhat by the Project For Hue,
434 PAPs in 20 communes received compensation amounting to 860,107,516 VND A total of 12 PAPs
out of the 343 PAPs lost their houses, were moved to new land, and bought houses which were more
spacious then their older houses In all cases, their living conditions improved
(d) HCMC Distribution Rehabilitation  Overall, the output of this component is satisfactory  It was
completed on May 30, 2000, with about 2 years delay from scheduled completion at appraisal date In
addition to the common causes for implementation delays mentioned previously, lack of coordination
between HCMC PC and local authorities also contributed to some delay The benefits include (i)
reduction of losses (para 4 1), (ii) standardization of the distribution network of HCMC PC, (iii)
improvement in the quality of service, and (iv) increased safety  Due to the rehabilitation of the network
provided under this Project, HCMC PC was able to increase the total number of customers by 42%, and
the sales by 37% from 1997 to 2000 However, because of increased coverage of the networks in the rural
areas in the last 3 years, where the consumption per customer is much lower than in the urban areas and
operating expenses are higher, the customers/employee ratio remained unchanged and sales per employee
decreased by 5%
Item           1.997     2.000       Diff
Customers            604,096    860,000     42%
Number of Employees    3,396     4,865      43%
Sales (GWh)            3,897     5,320      37%
Customers/Employee      178        177       0%
Sales/Employee (hWh)  1,147,527  1,093,525  -5%
The RAP, which was approved by the Government on March 27, 1995, was implemented satisfactorily
between January 1997 and June 2000 HCMC PC divided the affected households (98 PAHs were
processed) into the various affected areas and signed contracts with the local authorities to assess the level
of damage and compensation required to all affected households, according to the agreed guidelines Most
- 10-



PAPs are satisfied with the compensation payment and resettlement policy However, an independent
review carried out by an Independent Monitoring Team, found that in certain areas PAPs were paid only
70% of the total compensation in the first installment, while the remaining 30% were paid in the second
installment after land clearance This compensation arrangement was clearly not in line with the RAP
policy Although no major complaints were recorded and PAPs moved voluntarily, the relevant authorities
agreed to develop a standardized organizational arrangements for future RAP implementation, to enable
coordination of all activities and provide just compensation according to the RAP guidelines
(f) National Training Center The provision of new equipment for the National Training Center was
completed on June 30, 2000 Consulting services for project management to assist in engineering, design,
procurement and construction supervision were effectively provided by a consortium of ESB Intemational
(ESBI) and Swedpower Since the appraisal agreed target for completion of the National Training Center
was June 1997, in effect, there was a completion delay of about 3 years Shortage of funds and the
resulting lengthy construction period also contributed to the delay
Overall, however, the output of this component is satisfactory Direct benefits of the component include
technology transfer in project planning and control, resource management and safety measures in the use of
teaching and other laboratory equipment and materials Output benefits include an increase in the
qualification of teachers, an almost 200% increase in the number of qualified students, upgrading of
laboratory equipment, allowing for better teaching methods, and a more participatory student/teacher
interaction Teaching materials were also updated and classroom environment improved by good
ventilation and lighting
(g) Central Region Load Dispatch Center (CRLDC) The shortfall of funds in the IDA Credit (due to the
depreciation of the SDR vis-a-vis the US$), required EVN to raise altemative financing for the CRLDC
component of the Project The component is underway and expected to be completed by June 2001
(h) The Central Region Traininz Center has been operational since June 7, 1998, about one year behind the
schedule agreed at appraisal Benefits include (i) improved the quality of teaching personnel and the
quality and number of students (i e about a 20% increase) applying for training, (ii) an increase in the
capacity of the training center from 300 to 1,000 students, (iii) new laboratory equipment purchased under
the project component, which allowed for better hands-on teaching, and (iv) expanded facilities to include a
dormitory, and yards for sports and a gymnasium A total of 45 teachers received training varying from
3-7 weeks duration The output of this component is satisfactory.
(i) Southem Region Load Dispatch Center (SRLDC) The SRLDC was completed and operational since
June 2000, almost three years behind the schedule agreed at appraisal due to the two main factors
mentioned previously Expected benefits include (i) improved operation of the power system, including a
more economic and rational approach to the operation of the interconnected regional power networks, (ii)
reduced time for system restoration following a disturbance, (iii) continuous monitoring of the system
preventing outages and premature aging of equipment caused by overloads However, due to financing
constraints of the Credit, a few items were left out of the contract (i e short circuit analysis, automatic
generation control, and updated conununication links) Nevertheless, the output of this component is
deemed to be satisfactory.
(j) The Southem Region Training Center was completed in September 1999, 15 months behind the agreed
schedule at appraisal The Southem Region Training Center was upgraded, and as a result, the quality of
students and instructors improved, and the number of students seeking training increased by 300% A
survey of trainees showed that, at present, they have a better grasp of power system operation and
- 11 -



mechanical and electrical systems due to the practical training exercises received There is a better
student-instructor interaction with the essential objectives of the training explained from the beginning
Some implementation problems brought on by foreign consultants who were not entirely aware of the
southem power network, and the training system and approaches used in Vietnam caused some initial
friction and delay The output of this component is satisfactory.
II Technical Assistance
The Demand Side Management Studv, financed by a Japanese Grant Facility and ASTAE of the Bank,
was completed in March 1997 The recommendations of the study provided the basis for the formulation
of DSM components of Cr 3034 The Hvdropower Ranking Study on the five hydropower schemes
selected following the consultant's inception report was completed in December 1997 The Institutional
Development Study, financed by a Japanese Grant Facility, was completed in February 1997 Based on
the findings and recommendations of this study, EVN prepared a training program (financed and
implemented under IDA Cr 2820)
Regarding the establishment of the ReMulatorv Framework and Electricity Law, the process is proceeding
much slower than expected (ADB financed part of the TA necessary for the detailed drafting of the
attendant decrees while the Bank worked on the draft of the Electricity Law) To expedite matters, three
workshops were held by MOI in late 1999 to obtain suggestions and comments from provincial authorities
and large electricity consumers In addition, a Working Group completed the last version of the Law,
which incorporates the findings and recommendations of the workshops However, the Electricity Law has
not yet been approved by the National Assembly, approval is expected in early 2001 Although the
Vietnamese authorities accepted, in principle, the establishment of a separate "decision making" regulatory
body, the passage of the Electricity Law is delayed by the backlog of other laws in queue at the National
Assembly and ongoing political debate about the structure and role of the regulatory agency MOI held a
Roundtable Session in September 2000, in consultation with the Bank and ADB mainly to identify the
issues constraining the finalization of an effective electricity law for Vietnam, and provide a review of the
12th Draft of the Electricity Law and draft decrees on tariffs and regulation It is expected that to move
the process forward and to submit the Electricity Law for approval to the National Assembly, MOI should
decide and formulate policy guidance on a number of key issues (i e power sector market structure,
regulation, tariff policy and rural electrification) and identify key areas of technical assistance Overall,
and in view of the significant achievements in moving the process towards a comprehensive reform and
formulation of the Electricity Law, the outcome of the technical assistance is deemed satisfactory
4 3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return
Rehabilitation and Expansion of HCMC. Hue and Nha Trann Distribution Networks  At appraisal, the
economic analysis for the distribution components assumed two scenarios (a) "with project", and (b)
"without project" The "with project" scenario was based on incurring the full investment (in the
distribution system and upstream sub-transmission) for meeting the forecast demand and a progressive
reduction in losses and unserved energy The "without project" scenario assumed that the system would be
able to meet the full forecast demand growth with zero investment but with a progressive increase in losses
and unserved energy Incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs were conservatively assumed
to be the same for both scenarios Annex 3 provide more details
- 12 -



EIRR at Project EIRR at Project
Appraisal     Completion
Rehabilitation of HCMC Distribution Network  47 9      48 3
Rehabilitation of Hue Distribution Network  16 1        21 8
Rehabilitation of Nha Trang Distribution Network  23.6  46.4
The results indicate that the re-evaluated EIRRs at project completion for the distribution rehabilitation
components of the Project remain robust to justify these components at this time Although the SAR
provided four EIRR scenarios, a comparison was made only with the more realistic "demand decrease by
10% case" scenario, since this reduced demand case was based on the more realistic, less optimistic
demand realization
Conversion of Ba Ria Open Cycle Turbines to Combined Cycle Operation. Following the methodology
used at appraisal, the EIRR was calculated for the least-cost option assuming the plant running at an
annual capacity factor of 68% for an economic life for 20 years Based on actual cost of the project and
the actual benefits gained, the EIRR for this project component was re-evaluated to be 17% compared with
18% at appraisal The results indicate that the EIRR of the project component remain robust, and the
project could be justified at present Annex 3 provides additional details
Load Dispatch Centers. To recalculate the EIRR for the LDCs, the same methodology at appraisal was
used The benefits gained from the improvement in upgrading load dispatch centers were due to (i) better
dispatch of generating plants, (ii) reduction in faults and clearance times, (iii) reduction in the number of
staff; and (iv) reduction in the requirement of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) Based on the actual
costs and benefits gained from the project after completion, the re-evaluated EIRR was 42% compared
with 27% at appraisal, which is not surprising, due the factors outlined above Details and assumptions of
the EIRR evaluations are given in Annex 3
4 4 Financial rate of return
A financial rate of return for the Project was neither calculated at appraisal nor at completion
4 5 Institutional development impact
Overall, the institutional development impact is substantial despite delays and slow pace in establishing the
legal and regulatory framework An Electricity Law (12th Draft) is now only expected in early 2001
The Project was instrumental in
* maintaining Government's commitment to power sector reform and restructuring Due to the continued
dialogue during project implementation and in subsequent projects, Government's commitment to
sector reform remains high and the Electricity Law and secondary regulation are expected to be
approved in 2001,
*   promoting good environmental practices, with the preparation and satisfactory implementation of
RAPs, and minimized environmental impact during construction and operation of the combined cycle
plant,
*   contributing to a satisfactory performance in a reduction of EVN power losses from 24% in 1995 to
15 8% in 2000 due to its success at upgrading and rehabilitating transmission lines and substations,
* rationalizing and strengthening the training centers in Vietnam with the establishment of training
centers in North, Central and South Vietnam,
*   improving the efficiency of the sector by converting the Ba Ria gas turbines to a combined cycle plant,
- 13-



as well as strengthening and/or establishing the National and Regional Load Dispatch Centers
allowing economic dispatch and better monitoring and utilization of facilities,
*  maintaininz Government's commitment to improving the commercial operation of the sector and for the
need to increase tariffs a 4% increase in average tariffs was obtained which allowed EVN to (a) fully
cover operating and maintenance expenses, increasing debt service payments and finance 34% of
capital investments, and (b) comply with financial covenants
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5 I Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency
*   GDP growth in 1999 was the lowest growth rate in a decade The slowdown in economic growth
limited the expansion of electricity demand to about 8% in 1998 and 1999, half the growth rate in the
mid-1990s, which led EVN to lower its load forecast for the next 5 years,
*   Suppliers performance deteriorated during the financial crisis in the region which caused delays in
mobilizing capital and in shipment of goods,
*   Shortage of funds in the IDA Credit due to the depreciation of the SDR vis-a-vis the US$, forced EVN
to finance the Central Region Load Dispatch Center component of the Project through a French Credit
of FF 72 million for the supply of equipment,
*   Shipwreck caused a delay in the implementation of the Ba Ria combined cycle add-on component,
3   Undue delay of responsible authorities in the approval process for bid evaluation results, construction
permits, and land acquisition and resettlement formalities,
5 2 Factors generally subject to government control
- The reorzanization and rationalization of the sector in early 1995 which included the establishment of
EVN and the abolition of MOE, prolonged the signing of the credit agreement by almost a year,
* EVN's financial sustainability which is largely dependent on government support through periodic
tariff revisions, without this support, EVN would not be able to generate consistent cash flow to
maintain operations, service its debt, and fund further capital investments,
-   Pace of establishing a legal and regulatoW framework An Electricity Law is now only expected in
early 2001 The legal and regulatory framework has not yet developed to respond to the evolution of
the sector, in terms of structure and commercial arrangements, and the participation of the private
sector,
-   Continued strengthening of weak sector institutions Much of the weakness results from inadequate
staff skills and organizational systems not adept at operating in an increasingly commercial
environment,
*   Inability to decentralize decision making and increase autonomy in sector institutions has caused low
operating efficiencies and productivity,
*   Long delays in obtaining government approval/agreement on bid evaluations and permits for land
acquisition resulted in delays in project implementation
5 3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control
* During the implementation of the Ba Ria Add-on Combined cycle plant, adequate design cooperation
was not achieved for proper control system integration and as result some systems had to be almost
completely redesigned and implemented during commissioning significant time was lost throughout
this project component in integrating the various control systems into a complete and workable
package,
*   Inadeguate cost estimation caused some difficulties in implementing all the project components,
*   Risks of foreign exchange variations were not adequately investigated hence, the scope of some
contracts had to be reduced and/or alternative financing source sought,
*   Coordination problems due to shortage of technical capacity caused a delay in the implementation of
- 14 -



the Ba-Ria Combined Cycle add-on since planned maintenance of the gas turbines need to be delayed,
*   Unreliable load forecasts caused some transformners to be overloaded right after commissioning for the
Nha Trang and Hue distribution systems
5 4 Costs and financing
Estimated total project cost at appraisal was US$239 1 million equivalent while the actual project cost was
US$175 6 million equivalent (based on EVN and PCs' latest disbursement records), of which, the Bank
loan provided US$137 1 million (US$ 165 0 million at appraisal) and the Government provided
US$48 7million (US$82 0 million at appraisal), and the balance of US$0 9 million (US$0 9 million at
appraisal) from other financiers Total savings in US dollar terms were US$63 5 million equivalent (27%)
The reasons for the cost savings mainly include lower cost of materials and equipment for the Ba Ria
conversion, lower cost for consulting services and savings in compensation to PAPs In total, 72 contracts
were signed for the Project totaling US$154 1 million equivalent
However, the depreciation of the SDR against the US$ during the project period and the delay of project
implementation caused a shortfall of funds in the IDA Credit in SDR terms EVN sought altemative funds
including its own source for the Central Region Load Dispatch Center and the National Load Dispatch
Center The final disbursement ratio of the IDA Credit was 93%
6. Sustainability
6 I Rationale for sustainability rating
Sustainability of the Project is likely for the following reasons
*   The Ba Ria Combined Cycle Add-on power plant is well maintained and satisfactory arrangements
have been made for environmental control of emission and effluents The Environmental Monitoring
Unit has monitored the plant continuously since commissioning
*  The 220 kV transmission lines and 220 kV and 110 kV substations are essential for the evacuation of
power from the North-South 500 kV line via the Pleiku substation With the increased capacity,
additional demand can be met with improved reliability and quality of service The transformers and
substations were built with modem technologies, and with good maintenance are expected to provide
good service for many years
*   The load dispatch centers, with their SCADA/EMS systems, are modem well designed facilities
manned by qualified operators and are almost maintenance free They will allow real-time information
to be obtained and better decisions to be made, based on the actual status of the system Quality of
supply has been improved in terms of voltage variability
*  The new training facilities, better teaching materials, and better prepared instructors, will produce
better students, enhance their opportunities for obtaining betterjobs and hence contribute to the
economic development of the country
* The rehabilitation/reinforcement and expansion of distribution facilities at Hue. Nha Trang. and Ho
Chi Minh Citv are assisting the power sector in meeting an ever increasing demand, and improving
reliability and quality of service The facilities replaced an old, unreliable and overloaded network,
with high losses System overloads and power losses are now reduced and well-maintained facilities
better utilized
*   The substations and overhead transmission lines of the Project were built in accordance with
Vietnamese Environment and Safety Regulations which specify that the design and layouts of
substations at rated voltages of 110 kV or higher be subject to approval by the Fire Protection
Authority
*   Due compensation was provided in all cases to ensure that PAPs are satisfied with the end result and
- 15-



their improved standard of living The Project posed no significant negative threat to the enviromnent
*   The Project is considered cost-effective since all the goods and services were procured through ICB
procedures with competitive prices
6 2 Transition arrangement to regular operations
Well-trained operation and maintenance personnel are now in charge of operating the new facilities under
the Project with clear and comprehensive O&M Manuals Financial, economic, and environmental
policies required for continued operation and maintenance are in place The enactment of the Electricity
Law and regulatory framework is likely to promote a more commercial and stable environment and more
efficient operation Monitoring of distribution losses and plant availability at the Ba Ria Combined-Cycle
Add-on will be continued under ongoing projects
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7 1 Lending
IDA's performance in all phases of the Project is satisfactory Identification of project components and
environmental and technical/economic assessments were conducted satisfactorily and in a participatory
marmer Preparation and appraisal were satisfactory and complete Due to the sector reorganization in
1995, the legal document needed revision, which delayed project implementation A collaborative effort
between MOE (now abolished)/EVN and ESMAP investigated the needs and priorities of power sector
reform in May 1995, followed by a training workshop in July 1995 A draft overview of the scope and
outline of the Electricity Law, prepared by ESMAP, was forwarded to MOI for the first time on September
23, 1996 All of this contributed to the strengthening of planning, administrative, and management
capabilities of the power sector, and smoothed the transition to the new sector organizational structure
The project objectives dici not need reformulating due to the reorganization, however, implementation
responsibilities were changed and legal documents revised appropriately
7 2 Supervision
Supervision is rated satisfactory and adequate with typically two to three missions per year Beginning in
late 1996, increased re.ponsibility for supervision was transferred to the Resident Mission in Vietnam
(RMV - located in Hanoi) As the implementation of the project components was significantly delayed at
the time by the sector reorganization, RMV's first tasks included instituting a monitoring system of the
procurement process of EVN and the concemed implementing agencies and consolidating implementation
schedules to monitor progress of the project components This assisted in flagging implementation
bottlenecks, and if at all possible, preventing them, and in upgrading the implementation rating to
"Satisfactory" in October 1996 The technical assistance activities for Demand Side Management,
Institutional Development Study and Hydropower Master Plan were finalized by end of 1997, thus
completing the institutional development components associated with the Project As for the physical
components, by early 1998, project implementation had gathered momentum and RAP implementation was
proceeding well Extemal monitoring agencies were contracted by the implementing agencies to monitor
RAP implementation and their report were adequately reviewed
Some credit shortfalls were also experienced in 1998 due to appreciation of the US$ against the SDR As a
result, a few contracts for various components were financed by other sources or the scope reduced

7 4 Preparation
The reorganization of the power sector caused some concern during project preparation as to which agency
would take over the Project Nevertheless, EVN, the respective Project Management Boards, and the PCs
were active in assisting IDA missions in the overall design and in providing relevant inputs on technical,
financial, environmental, and institutional aspects The feasibility studies carried out by Consultants were
comprehensive and helpful in the design of the projects scope In sumrnmary, the Government and EVN's
performance is satisfactory during project preparation
7 5 Government implementation performance
The Government's performance is mixed Although good relations existed among the various entities
during project implementation, there were complaints of inordinate delays by the Government, which
affected well-defined project schedules Many complaints were registered by implementing agencies on the
large number of official formalities that needed to be complied with prior to obtaining approvals and
permits for land acquisition Difficulties were also experienced in the revision of the various designs for the
distribution networks, particularly for the 22 kV network, as up-to-date regulations, standards, and
necessary technical procedures for designing, reviewing, were outmoded and not suitable for the Project
Nevertheless, the Government followed IDA guidelines and supported the PCs and the Management Boards
during the discussions and decision for compensation for the PAPs Governnent regulation on
socio-economic development and compensation and resettlement, were progressive and in line with just
principles, hence, support of the PAPs was readily obtained Counterpart funds were sufficient
7 6 Implementing Agency
Overall, the performance of the implementing agencies is satisfactory Project implementation was marked
by many contracts being completed satisfactorily, in spite of some foreign exchange shortfalls, and
financial problems of suppliers and contractors caused by the economic downturn in the region However,
this affected delivery of equipment and materials despite good coordination amnong the various parties and
carrying the work out on a best effort basis To expedite matters, staff of the various implementing
agencies were permanently present at the ports of arrival and at site to coordinate the work Some delays
were also experienced, and adjustments were made because the implementing agencies were not too
familiar with ICB procedures and sufficient information was not available to them Implementation of the
RAPs is satisfactory In all cases, the PAPs standard of living improved, which reflected the goodwill
exerted by the various implementing agencies No grievances by PAPs were noted
7 7 Overall Borrower performance
The Borrower's overall performance is satisfactory The Borrower and the implementing agencies showed
unwavering commitment to the Project
8. Lessons Learned
Although there are many specific lessons leamed for this Project (summarized in the Completion Reports
available on file), the main lessons leamed that may be applicable to future projects are
*   The purpose of commissioning is merely to verify flaws in the working system and not to develop a
working system hence, good control system integration and design cooperation are required to the
successful implementation of any project
*   Good load forecasting is required during project preparation so that transformers and other equipment
are not overloaded a few months after being commissioned
*   The appointment of Independent Monitoring Agencies for RAP is instrumental to control RAP
implementation It worked very well in the present Project Thorough RAP preparation is absolutely
essential in avoiding complaints by PAPs during implementation They were able to identify problem
- 17-



areas quickly on land clearance and compensation and provide timely support to avoid disputes later
on As well, the Project PMUs must coordinate closely with local authorities and PAPs so that mutual
acceptable solutions are found
* There are no short cuts to a successful complex operation such as this Project above-average inputs
of IDA resources and broad skills mix for project design, appraisal and supervision are required
* The establishment of a Procurement Monitoring System. within the PMUs, provided an effective
control mechanism on intemal procurement decisions
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency
Phu Mv Ba Ria Power Projects Management Board. Through the Ba Ria Combined Cycle project,
PMBRMB has learned many experiences in several fields, including international competitive bidding,
preparation of detail design and bidding documents, bid evaluation, negotiation, contract signing, and
carrying-out of turnkey contracts These experience will be helpful for incoming power plant projects
Central Power Proiects Manaeement Board Good Bank perfornance was recognized in all project stages,
Bank's instruction were of much importance for CPPMB in the assessment of project impact and benefits,
preparation of ICB bidding documents, and in the evaluation for the procurement of goods
Much attention was paid by the Bank to the RAP, especially the task of monitoring PAP's situation after
the project's completion The Bank emphasized that the RAP had an importance equal to that of the
project, without which, the project could not be carried out This point of view was shared by the
Government whose policies toward PAPs were strictly executed by CPPMB
Some factors which affected project implementation included delay in Credit effectiveness, actions taken
by authorities for approval, for environment and for customs which must follow many fornalities,
environmental and resettlement issues were resolved at the beginning of project implementation, good
coordination among parties
EVN/NLDC Regarding some lessons learned (i) close coordination between the Bank and project
implementing agency was critical to the successful implementation of the project, (ii) it is better to have a
complex project for all regional control centers and NLDC than separate projects since these systems are
connected with one another and a delay in one project will cause delay in another Also, EVN may save
some money in consulting services
Khanh Hoa Power Department Power losses in the MV network at Nha Trang have been reduced
considerably, by replacing the 6 6 kV voltage level to a more standardized 22 kV level, with a reduction
from 7 2% to about 3 1% after the replacement In those existing sections of the 6 6 kV network, voltage
quality has been improved as well with a voltage variation below 5% from peak to off-peak periods In
addition, the overloading of the substations under the projects have been either eliminated or reduced
considerably, so that additional customers can now be connected The project was successful in reducing
overall losses and in reducing the incidence and the duration of faults To ensure good progress of work
and to reduce outages, construction works needs to be undertaken by zones
