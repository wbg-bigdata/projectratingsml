Legal, Policy And Admninistrative Framework
I.      This environmental impact assessment report (EIA) addresses the impacts of
a project to expand the power generating capacity at Ba Ria Power Station in
South Vietnam. The proposed development is the conversion of five existing
GE Model 6541 (B) type gas turbines to combined cycle plant thus providing
80MW additional generation. capacity. The project is likely to proceed in two
stages
*       firstly, the conversion of three gas turbines into a 3-3-1 (306)
combined cycle plant by the addition of three waste heat boilers
and one steam turbine.
*       secondly, the conversion of the remaining two gas turbines into a 2-
2-1 (206) combined cycle plant by the addition of two waste heat
boilers and one steam turbine.
The Developer
1.2     The developer of the proposed project is Power Company No. 2 (PC2), a state
owned company which is responsible for supplying power to the southern
region of Vietnam. The regional population is about 24 million, including Ho
Chi Minh City.
1.3     Shortage of adequate base load capacity together with a high growth in
demand has led PC2 to develop this additional power generation capacity.
Natural gas from the offshore White Tiger gas field will be available to the
existing gas turbine plants at Ba Ria in early 1995 making this power station
an ideal candidate for conversion to combined cycle plantl
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (aBRD) Requirements &
Guidelines
1.4     This environmental assessment report is prepared for PC2 according to the
scope and format detailed in IBRD's Operational Directive OD 4.01. It is
IBRD policy that all major projects shall be subject to an environmental
assessment.
1.5     Environmental Guidelines have been issued by the IBRD to cover a wide
range of specific industries. Each guideline contains emission limits as well
as permitted ambient levels for all relevant media and likely contaminants.
Values mostly relate emissions to units of production. These guidelines are

summarised in Appendix IV. Required enviromnental control technology is
also specified in the guidelines. It is IBRD policy that where there exist
different limits between its guidelines and national controls, the stricter of the
two shall be applied.
Vietnamese Environnmental Policy And Regulations
1.6     A comprehensive environrmental plan was adopted by Vietnam in 1991 called
"The National Plan for Ervironment and Sustainable Development: A
Framework for Action". This plan provides the framework for establishing
strategies, policies, institutions, laws and regulations for addressing
environmental issues. The implementation of this plan rests with the Vietnam
State Committee for Science and Technology (SCTC).
1.7     Within this context national regulations and guidelines have been adopted
giving permitted levels of contaminants in air, water and soils. These
regulations are addressed where appropriate in this report and the relevant
guidelines are summarised in Appendix IV. Several provincial centres
including Ho Chi Minh City have also issued local enviromnental guidelines.
1.8     It is also under this plan that the new Law on Protection of Environment was
enacted in December 1993. This law (a) identifies in general terms the
responsibilities of the state, organisations and individuals to prevent and
remedy enviromn!ental deterioration and pollution and carry out specified
environmental protection functions; (b) provides for development of
environmental criteria (standards) and submission of environmental impact
reports on new and existing facilities; (c) provides for responsible parties to
pay compensation for environmental damage; (d) establishes the right of
individuals and organisations to petition for enforcement of environmental
regulations; (e) calls for civil and criminal penalties for violations; and (f)
encourages  international  environmental  co-operation.  The   full
implementation of this law will require the issuing by the Govermment of
detailed environmental regulations.
1.9     This law extends environmental impact assessment requirements to a broad
range of public and private sector development activities, proposes
procedures for screening and incorporting of mitigation plans into project
design, and explicitly links EIA review to the project approval process. The
core agency with environmental mandate is the Ministry for Science,
Technology and Environment (MSTE) which was formed in 1992 from the
State Committee for Science. Within MSTE, the Department of Environment
and Natural Resources (DENR) is the enviromnental arm with the main
responsibility for carrying out these enviromnental functions.
EBIU14REp                              1-2



1.10    Responsibility for project approval, for projects such as the current one, under
Vietnams irnvestment policy, is given to the National Project Evaluation
Board (NPEB) under the chairmanship of the State Planning Commission
(SPC). As a member of the NPEB, the Ministry for Science Technology and
Enviroranent has the formal authority to comment on environmental aspects
of the project.  This function would nonnally be carried out by the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
1.11    At the provincial level Environmental Committees also have formal authority
to review and comment on environmental aspe;cts of investment applications.
The Environmental Committee at Ho Chi Minh City is the one of most
relevance to the present proposed project.
1.12    Within the IBRD EIA's are reviewed and assessed by the appropriate
division. Both the EIA and the EIA summary are made available for public
scrutiny.
SNmmrary of Main Environmental Issues
1.13    The proposed development has major environmental benefits in the provision
of an extra 80MW generation capacity without the consumption of extra fuel
or additional emissions to the atmosphere. It will allow the strengthening of
the power supply system, the improvement of living standards, and the
development of industry and other economic activities in the PC2 region.
1.14    The main environmental issue that arose was in relation to the proposed
cooling system. The initially selected system, which was a direct cooling
system taking water fom the nearby Dirdh river estuary, was not suitable for
environmental reasons as described later. The system eventually selected was
an air cooled condenser.
-U5    Mitigation measures already in hand include the selection of an air cooled
condenser as mentioned above. Planned mitigation measures include noise
control by the acoustic insulation of proposed new plant as well as the
treatment of all waste streams to the required standard before discharge.
Because of the minor residual negative impacts of the proposed development
no fiurher mitigation measures are required.
1.16    It is recommended that environmental monitoring programmes be carried out
to improve base line data and for control of the inplementation of the project.
These programmes will not impinge on the time schedule for the development
and will have only minor cost impacts. It is also recommended that, as PC2
expands, an enviromnental co-ordinator be established with the function of
developing environmental policy and ensuring compliance with regulations.

management group in order to promote strategies tor tne protecuon o0 me
coastal zone. Through activities such as this PC2 could positively promote
the protection and sustainable development of the delicate coastal zone. As
described later it is also recommended that procedures be put to place for the
reduction of the (already existing) risk of oil spillage from the transport by
barge of this fuel.
Project Description
1.17    The project is the addition of waste heat boilers and steam turbines to five
existing GE model 6541 (B) gas turbines at Ba Ria in South Vietnam. This
will allow the additional production of about 8OMW by utilising the hot gases
from the gas turbines which are presently discharged to atmosphere. This
process will be without the combustion of any extra fuel and will lead to an
increase in generation efficiency from 30% to 45%.
1.h8    No increase in the rate of emissions of air pollutants will occur because of the
development. However, because of lower exit temperatures, dispersion of
pollutants into the atmosphere will be less efficient, resulting in higher local
ground level concentrations. As the plant will nornally be burning natural
gas, which has negligible sulphur content, the main emissions of concern will
be oxides of nitrogen. Particulates, carbon monoxide or volatile organic
compounds are not emitted in significant amounts.
1.19    Condensation of the steam from the steam turbine cycle will be by an air
cooled condenser which will discharge the heat to the atmosphere. No
aqueous discharges will arise from this process.
1.20    Fresh water will be provided from the Ba Ria town supply through an existing
supply pipe. The boiler make up requirement of 15 m3/hr will be purified in a
new water treatment plant. Regeneration of the resin in the water treatment
plant will produce chemical waste requiring treatment in the neutralisation
tank. No new transmission lines will be required to deliver power from the
development.
1.21    It is planned to develop the project in two stages. The conversion of the first
three gas turbines (3-3-1) is scheduled for completion by early 1997 while the
following 2-2-1 development is planned for completion one year later. See
Figures 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 which illustrate the location and layout of
the project
Baseline Data
L22     As the existing baseline data is not sufficiently detailed in some areas, extra
monitoring, much of it already planned, is required as indicated below in 1.28
- 1.30. This should not affect the implementation schedule of the project or
are the  sults anticipated to affect significantly the assessment of the
enviromnental impacts of the proposed development made in this report.

1.23    Limited air monitoring at the site shows very low ambient ground level
concentration of S02 (3.5 pg/rn3) and N02 (< I ,ig/m') indicating little
impact from the existing gas turbines. No data on particulate levels are
availabie but the concentrations are considered to be very low.
1.24    Noise levels within the plant are, as expected for gas turbines, rather high.
The limited data available indicates a noise level of 94 dBA at the gas
turbines and 64 dBA near the administration building. The limits for noise
level at one or two houses near to the site perimeter may not be complied
with, particularly at night. A baseline noise survev of the existing plant will
be carried out and its results will determine the mitigation measures required
for the new development (1.35).
1.25    Thmere are no notable or endangered habitats or species of plants or animals in
the area. The most significant ecological system is that of the Mangrove
forest and associated fish and shell fish species which occur extensively in the
estuary.
The Mangrove forest ecosystem appears under threat in this region as it is in
many parts of South East Asia due to
n       Excessive siltation and organic pollution.
*       Harvesting for firewood and charcoal manufacture.
Operation of shrimp aquaculture enterprises, particularly those wsith
high stocking intensity requiring the use of biocides, artificial food
and pumped fresh water.
1.26    The main socio-economic activities are farming and shrimp aquaculture.
Shrimp aquaculture at low stocking intensity (using natural food) and
medium intensity (with some artificial feeding) is practised extensively in
areas adjacent to the estuary as indicated in figures 3.2 and 3.5. Mangrove
trees also grow extensively in this area providing shade and habitat for the
shrimp as well as stabilising the dykes. The most intensive form of shrimp
aquaculture with fonnulated artificial feed and very high shrimp stocking
levels, which is the kind most damaging to the environment, is not practised
in this area.
1.27    The Dinh river estuary, which is the receiving water for minor aqueous
discharges from the proposed plant, flows alongside the sit-. During the wet
season .there is a major flow contribution from the Dinh river but in the dry
season (from November to April) this is negligible and the tidal flow is
dominant
Gaps in Data
1.28    Extension of the air monitoring programme is required in order to get a better

1.29    Exension of noise monitoring to nearest residences will be shortly carried
out. The results of this survey will allow the specification of levels of
acoustic insulation required for the new plant as well as mitigation measures
which may be needed.
1.30    A baseline ecological survey of the Dinh river estuary is recommended in
order to confirm the prediction of negligable ecological impacts from the
proposed plant. as well as to monitor natural changes.
Envirornental Impacts
1.31    Ground level concentrations of N02 from the burning of natural gas are
predicted by computer modelling, for full base load operations to be
*      Maximum hourly value at day  154 pg/rn3
n      Maximum hourly-value at night 22 pg/rn
This is equivalent to a daily maximum of 35 pg/rne N0 and an annual
average maximum of <9 pg/rm3. These are low values and would niot cause
any signifcant impacts. Tables 1 and 2 sumnmarise main environmental
impacts from the proposed development, as well as relevant guidelines.
L.32    Maximum ground level values for S02 from buming stand-by diesel fuel are
also predicted to be low with a daily maximum of 47 pg/m' and an annual
average maximum of <1 gg/m3
1.33    Aqueous dischaiges from ihe proposed development will include
a       Waste from regeneration of ion exchange resin in the water
treatment plant with acid and alkali
*       Station surface drains
*       Boiler blow down
*       Increase in station sewage discharged from the administration
block
a        TIregular discharges including boiler washes and accidental
spillages
These relatively minor discharges will be treated as required by
neutralisation tank, oil traps, sewage plant The final discharge will not have
any significant impact on the receiving water or the ecology of the area.

134    Socio-economic benefits include the strengthening of the power system in the
PC2 region and the resulting ability to supply new industries and consumers.
The plant will create 40 newjobs.
1.35    A noise survey vill be carried out in the first half of 1995 in order to
deternine noise levels at the site perimeter and nearest residesce*. Based on
the results, the acoustic insulation for the new development will be specified
so as to comply with noise regulations. Depending on the results of the
survey other mitigation measures may be put in place such as berms (earthen
mounds) planted with trees and shrubs for screening noise or the acoustic
insulation of residences near the site perimeter. As a result of thesc measures
noise impacts from the proposed development will not be significant.
Sumnmary Of Alternatives
1.36    Alternatives to the proposed project should be seen in the context of a high
predicted growth in electricity demand in the PC2 region over the next twenty
years. A mixture of thermal and hydropower plant, which are to a certain
extent complimentary to each other, is required to satisfy this demand. A
natural gas fired combined cycle plant, such as the present proposal, has cost
and environmental benefits over all other thermal plant options. Given these
considerations the main alternative of interest is tie desig of the cooling
system.
1.37    Mechanical cooling towers using fresh water as make up would be an
attractive option from an economic and environmental view. Its main extra
environmental effects would be a blow-down discharge, containing small
amounts of residual chlorine into the Dinh River estuary. This would not
cause any significant impacts on the receiving water. However this option is
ruled out because it requires make up water of about 100 litres per second of a
quality which is not available in the Ba Ria locality. If a suitable source was
located then this would be the most attractive cooling option.
1.38    The direct cooling option, using cooling water abstracted from and retumed to
the Dinh river estuary would also be economically somewhat more attractive
than the air cooled condenser. It was not selected because of delays and
uncertainties associated with environmental issues detiled below.
139    The direct cooling option would require the constuction of systms for the
intake and discharge of cooling water. The intake structure would consist of a
40 hectare dyked lagoon necessitating the dredging of 800,000 tonnes of
material. The outifll would require the construction of a 3km long pipe line
to discharge the warm cooling water to a suitable large body of water (See fig
3.5).
EBIu14.RE.P                           1-7



1.40    The main environmental impacts associated with the direct cooling water
option are
The disposal of 800,000 tonnes of dredged material.
The destruction of mangrove trees in the area of the intak-e lagoon
and along the 3km pipeline.
The displacement of shrimp farmers currentlv located in the area of
the intake lagoon.
The thermal impact of discharge of cooling water at 60C above
ambient at a rate of 7.5m'Isec and with a chlorine residual level of
0.02 ppm.
1.41    While these impacts are not major and mitigation measures are possible.
further studies are required to prove that their impacts are acceptable.' This is
particularly so in the case of the thermal discharge where measurements of
tidal flow are required to show that the' heat can be dispersed w%ithout
ecological impact The cost of delays and uncertainties associated xit these
studies have ruled out this option in favour of the air cooled condenser.
Summway of MAigation Measures
1.42    In order to reduce environmental impacts from the proposed development
mitigation measures. summrised below, have already been put in hand as are
planned. Apart from these, and taking into account the minor residual
impacts of the proposed development no further mitigation measures are
considered necessary.
L4.3    The selection of an air cooled condenser as the cooling option for the
proposed development as opposed to the direct cooling option using water
abstracted from the Dinh rinver estary will avoid the environmental impacts
associated with the latter option already described in 1AO.
1.44    Available data on existing noise at the site are limited, but indicate that there
may be a danger of breaching guideline levels at nearby residences. A survey
to be shortly carried out will give a much better picture of the present
sitation. Depending on the results the level of acoustic cladding and other
silencing equipment for the new development will be specified such that
noise emissions from the site will comply with the regulations. The cost of
the additional acoustic insulation would be small compared with ihe overall
project cost.

L45    Depending on the outcome of the survey findings two alternative noise
mitigaticn measures may be feasible. T.hese are (a) the erection at the site
perimeter of a berm (earth mound) with planted trees and shrubs to insulate
noise emissions and (b) the acoustic insulation of residences where indoor
noise is high. The cost associated with both these mitigation measures are
mmior.
L.46    Waste water streams from the proposed development are minor both in terms
of quantity and environmental significance. They include (a) water plant
treatment waste, (b) sewage, (c) surface drains (d) boiler blowdown, (e) boiler
acid cleaning effluent and these will all be treated, as required, so that the
effluent discharged satisfies Vietnamese waste water effluent regulations and
will cause no significant impact on the receiving water.
Environmental Management And Training
147    It is recommended that an environmental unit be set up as part of the
management structure in the new development at Ba Ria. The main function
of this unit would be the monitoring and control of waste water streams from
the plant This function could be combined with the already plamed water
quality analysis programme at little additional expense.
L48    It is also recommended that as PC2 expands its generton programme, an
environmental co-ordinator be established with the finction of developing
envionmenal policy, issuing  in-house  guidelis and  establishing
corrpiPance with standards and regulations and setting up an environmental
nagement system.
E8I1.REP 1.10



1.49    It is futer recommended that this co-ordintor would also liaise with other
groups such as a coastal zone management group in order to promote
strategies for the protection of the coastal zone. Through activities such as
this PC2 could positively promote the protection and sustainable development
of the delicate coastal zone.
LSO     One of the major environmental risks from the existing plant at Ba Ria is for
an oil spill into the sensitive mangrove ecosystem. Even though this risk will
be greatly reduced by the changeover to natural gas in early 1995 it is
recommended that, in order to minimise this risk, written procedures be set up
to cover
Unloading of oil tankers including training of persormel.
Inspection of fuel oil tanks, pipework and valves.
*       Inspection of fuel oil tank bunds.
*       Emergency oil spill plan including provision of equipment and
trained personnel.
Environmental Monitoring
rLC1    In order to fill gaps in baseline data as well as control of the implementation
of the proposed project it is recommended that the following monitoring
prgramme be put in place :-
v       Monitong programme of the waste water streams from the new
project
*       Extension of the existing air monitoring programme.
Extension of noise monitoring to the nearest residences outside the
site perimeter.
*       A baseline ecological study of the Dinh river estuamy particularly in
the area near the power plant site.
These monitoring pmgramumes can be carmied out by local groups or PC2
itself with little cost impact They should have no impact on the time
schedules of the project.
Conshadtoin With Affected Groups
L52    Consultations have taken place over a period in late 1994 between PC2 and
the local co-operative representing shrimp farmers who cultivate shellfish in
ponds adjacent to thei site. There had been a concem with the original plan
for the development which would have involved a direct cooling water
system requiring the acquisition of 40 hectares of their land for a cooling
Esuuprp                               1-11



water lagoon during the construction phase as well as the discharge of warm
water from the plant during the operadon phase (see fig 3.5). In order to
avoid these potential problems the cooling system for the development as
changed to an air cooled condenser which will have no aqueous discharges.
In fact the quality of the receiving water should be improved overall as a
result of the newv development because of treatment of previously untreated
sewage from the plant and lower risk of oil spills. On this basis there were no
objections from the co-operative to the proposed development.
1.53    PC2 has also consulted with the town council of the local town of Ba Ria and
informed them of their plans to extend the planL Benefits to the town include
the provision of extra jobs during the construction and operation phase as
well as an overall strengthening of the electricity supply network. As there
are no significant negative impacts arising from the development there vere
no objections to it.
1.54    The only goup directly affected by the proposed development consists of a
small number of residential units close to the site perimeter who may be
impacted by noise emissions from the existing and proposed plant (1.44).
Consultation with these on noise reduction measures will take place. after the
completion of the planned noise survey. During the commissioning phase of
the development steam blows will be carried out to clean out pipework. This
Will cause high levels of noise, restricted to day light hours, over a period of
seveal days. Local residents will be given prior notice of these events.

CHAPTER 2
P-OLICY. LEGAL A ADMINISTPATIVE FRAMEWVORK
Introductioi
Z.1     This environmental assessment report (EIA) addresses the impacts of a
project to expand the power generating capacity at Ba Ria Powver Station in
South Vietnam. The proposed development is the conversion of five existing
GE Model 6541 (B) type gas turbines to combined cycle plant thus providing
80MW additional generation capacity. The project is likely to proceed in two
stages :-
*       firstly, the conversion of three gas turbines into a 3-3-1 (306)
combined cvcle plant by the addition of three waste heat boilers
and one steam turbine.
secondly, the conversion of the remaining two gas turbines into a 2-
2-1 (206) combined cycle plant by the addition of two waste heat
boilers and one steam turbine.
The Developer
i2      The developer of the proposed project is Power Company No. 2 (PC2), a state
owned company which is responsible for supplying power to the southern
region of Vietnam. The regional population is about 24 million. including Ho
Chi Minh City.
2.3     Shortage of adequate base load capacity together with high growth in demand
has led PC2 to develop this additional power generation capacity. Natural gas
from the offshore White Tiger gas field will be available to the existing gas
turbine plants at Ba Ria by early 1995 making t'iis power station an ideal
candidate for conversion to combined cycle plant. (Ref. 17)
International Bankfor Reconstrucdion and Development (IBRD) Requrements &
Guidelines
2.4     This envirommental assessment report is prepared for the PC2 according to
the scope and format detailed in IBRD's Operational Directive OD 4.01 (Re.
15). It is IBRD policy that all major projects shall be subject to an
environmental assessment.
2.5     Environmental Guidelines have been issued by the IBRD to cover a wide
range of specific industries. Each guideline contains emission limits as well
as permitted ambient levels for all relevant media and likely contaminants.
Values are intended as a guideline and mostly relate emissions to units of
production. These guidelines are addressed where appropriate in assessing
EBSJ4.E                               2-1



the impacts of the proposed development, and the ones relevant to this
proposed project arc summarised in Appendix IV. Suitable environmental
control technology is also specified in this document. It is IBRD policy that
where there exist different limits between its guidelines and national controls.
the stricter of the two shall be applied.
Vietnamese Environmental Policy And Regulations
2.6     A comprehensive environmental plan was adopted by Vietnam in 1991 called
"The National Plan for Environment and Sustainable Development: A
Framework for Action". This plan provides the framework for establishing
strategies, policies, institutions, laws and regulations for addressing
environmental issues. The implementation of this plan rests with the Vietnam
State Committee for Science and Technology (SCTC) (Ref 14).
2.7     Within this context national regulations and guidelines have been adopted
giving pennittecd levels of contaminants in air, water and soils. These
regulations are addressed where appropriate in this report and the relevant
guidelines are summarised in Appendix IV. Several provincial centres
including Ho Chi Minh City have also issued local environmental guidelines.
28      It is also under this plan that the new Law on Protection of Environment was
enacted in December 1993. This law (a) identifies in general terms the
responsibilities of the state, organisations and individuals to prevent and
remnedy environmental deterioration and pollution and carry out specified
environmental protection functions;  (b)  provides for development of
environmental criteria (standards) and submission of enviromnental impact
reports on new and existing facilities; (c) provides for responsible parties to
pay compensation for envirnmental damage; (d) establishes the right of
individuals and organisations to petition for enforcement of environmental
regulations; (e) calls for civil and criminal penalties for violations; and (f)
encourages international co-operation. The full implementation of this law
will require the issuing by the Government of detailed environmental
regulations.
2.9     This law extends environmental impact assessment requirements to a broad
range of public and private sector development activities, proposes
procedures for screening and incorporating of mitigation plans into project
design, and explicitly links EIA review to the project approval process.
2.10    The core agency with enviromnental mandate is the Ministry for Science,
Technology and Environment (MSTE) which was formed in 1992 from the
State Committee for Science. Vithin MSTE, the Department of Environment
and Natual Resources (DENR) is the environmental arm with the main
responsibility for carying out these environmental fimctions.
ER11&REP                              2-2



EIA Review And Approval Process
2.11    Responsibility for project approval. for projects such as the current one under
Vietnams investment policy is given to the National Project Evaluation Board
(NPEB) under the chairmanship of the State Planning Commission (SPC).
As a member of the NPEB, the Ministry for Science Technology and
Environment has the formal authority to comment on environmental aspects
of the project.  This function would nornally be carried out by the
Department of Environrent and Natural Resources.
2.12    At the provincial level Environmenal Committees also have formal authority
to review and commnent on environmental aspects of investment applications.
The Environmental Committee at Ho Chi Minh City is the one of most
relevance to the present proposed project.
2.13    Within the IBRD EIA's are reviewed and assessed within the appropriate
divisions. Both the EIA and the BA summary are made available for public
scrutiny.

CLMERJ
DENCRITIONV OF PROJEC
Introdrction
3.I     The proposed project is the conversion to combined cycle of existing gas
turbines at Ba Ria Power Plant in South Vietnam. This involves the addition
of waste heat boilers and steam turbines which allows for the generation of
additional electrical energy from the hot turbine exhaust gases which are
presendy discharged to the atmosphere. The overall thernal efficiency is
increased from 30% to 45% without increasing the emissions of air
pollutants.
3.2     The developer of the project is Power Company 2 (PC2) which is responsible
for the supply of power to the southem region of Vietnam including Ho Chi
Minh City.
The proposed project, when complete, would add about SOMWe capacity to
PC2 which is required under its development plan in order to satisfy its
predicted demand in the late nineties.
Existing Power Plant At Ba Ria
3.3     The existing plant at Ba Ria consists of five GE Model 6541 (B) gas turbines
with a nominal site rated capacity of 33MW each and two GE type PG 5371
PA gas turbines with a nominal site rated capacity of 23MWe each. The GE
Model 6541 (B) gas-turbines operate at a load factor of about 90%, burning
diesel fuel oil at a rate of 2.6 kgtsec each during base load operation while the
two smaller gas turbines are used for peaking duty. The diesel fuel has a
0.8% sulphur content and is imported via the nearby port at Vung Tau from
where it is transported by barge in 300 - 400 tonne loads to Ba Ria. The oil is
stored in several tanks, all fully bunded, with a total capacity of 12,700
tonnes. (Ref. 11)
3 4     The main air emissions from the existing plant consist of sulphur dioxide
(SO2) at 42 g/s and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) at 52 gts for each GE Model
6541 (B) gas turbine on base load. Because of the high temperatue of the
exhaust gas (553'C) the impact of these emissions on ground level
concentration locally is predicted to be very low (Ref. 10), and as described
later (4.2), measured ambient values at the site are also very low. Natral gas
will be available to the plant from the White Tiger offshore field by early
1995 and this will be the main filel for the gas turbines thereafter. Diesel oil
usage will be relegated to standby status for such times as when gas is not
available, for whatever reason. Emissions of SO2 wUll become insignificant
While burning natural gas as this gas has no sulphur content, while emissions
Of NOx will also drop to 31 g/s for each unit because of the lower NOx
generated in the gas turbine when using natural gas.  Pariculates, carbon
monoxide and volatile organic compounds are not emitted in significant
quantities from these type of plants.



3.5     Aqueous emissions from the existing plant are minor consisting of sewage
(untreated) and surface drains which are discharged via oil interceptors.
Geographical And Social Contexi Of Thte Development
3.6     The Ba Ria site is situated in the Vung Tau Province of Vietnam about 90 km
south east of Ho Chi Minh City. It is located about I km from the village of
Ba Ria with a population of 37,000 and 22 km from the town of Vung Tau
which is the provincial capital and also a deep sea port taking ships up to
7000 dw tonnes. Figures 3.1 and.3.2 illustrate the location. The site is
adjacent to the Dinh river estuary which is a potential source of cooling water
for the proposed plant. The Dinh river has a large flow during the wet season
(which occurs between months May and November) but very small in the dry
season when all the flow is tidal.
Technical Description Of Thte Project
3.7     The scope of the project is the conversion of the five existing GE Model 6541
(B) gas turbines to combined cycle plant. This will likely be scheduled as
firstly a 306 plant which consists of three gas turbines, three waste heat
boilers and one steam turbine, followed by a 206 plant consisting of the
remaining two fiwne 6 gas turbines with one waste heat boiler each and one
steam turbine. (Ref. 3, 9)
3.9     Combined cycle plants utilise the following process
Gas turbines burn either gaseous or liquid fuels with the hot gases
driving a turbine linked to a generator, to produce electricity.
*       The exhaust gases from the gas turbines, typically at a temperature
of over 5000C, pass through heat recovery boilers to generate
steam. The exhaust gas then leaves the waste heat boilers through
stacks, in this case 25m high, and at a temperature of about 140°C.
*       The steam generated in the heat recovery boiler is used to drive a
steam turbine which in tum drives a generator to produce further
electrical erergy, in this case an extra 80MW. (48MW from the
306 and 32MW fronm the 206 plant).
*       Tzhe steam is condensed in an air cooled condenser and the
condensate is retuned to the boilers. The heat is dissipated in the
atmosphere
The benefits of combined cycle plant are
*       High overall efficiency which is 45% compared with about 36% for
conventional themdal plant or 30% for stand alone gas turbine
plnt3
flhI44~~~~~~~~p ~3-2



As a result, low consumption of fuel per unit of electricity
produced and lower emissions of pollutants.
Low capital cost and fast erection times.
Low rejection of heat per overall unit of electricity generated.
Figure 3.3 illustrates the combined cycle process.
Structures Required By T7he Proposed Development
3.10    The development will involve the erection of the following structures
*       5 heat recovery boilers each enclosed in a building.
*       Two steam turbine buildings.
A laboratory and water treatment plant.
Extension to the existing electrical building.
Raw water reservoir and treated water storage tanks.
*Unit and auxiliary transformers.
,Air cooled condenser and associated pumps, fans and ducts.
A preliminary layout is shown in Figure 3.4
Description of Proposed Cooling System
3.11    Condensing of the steam from the proposed steam turbine will be by means
of an air cooled condenser which avoids any cooling water discharges. With
this type of cooling, steam is condensed inside of tubes which have extemal
fins. The tubes are grouped in rectangular sections and these are generally
installed in a roof-like fashion as A - frames to conserve space. Fans are
mounted on a horizontal deck below the A - frames discharging air upwards
past the tubular surfaces which removes heat from the steam. The area
required for a unit for the initial 306 development would be about 50 x 25m
as shown in figure 3.4.
Sources Of Emissions From  ite Proposed Plant
3.12     rhe main emissions are aqueous and atmospheric; little solid waste is
generated. The only atmospheric discharge of significance is NOx (oxides of
nitrogen) which will be discharged at the same rate as for the existing plant
when converted to natumal gas (31 g/s for each gas turbine). However, the
EBRI4.qjp                              3-3



exhaust gas temperature will be lower (t4u-t- as opposeu to    '.-)j icauiiig
to lower dispersion rates and higher ground level concentration, which are
calculated in 5.4.
3.13    The main aqueous discharges. will be the following
Water Treatment Plant Waste.
Sewage Discharge.
Boiler Blowdown.
Surface Drains.
Occasional waste from boiler acid and water washes and chemical
spillages.
Consumption Of Natural Gas And FreskV Water
3.14    The consumption of natual gas at about 2.6 kg/sec per gas turbine will be the
same as for the existing gas turbines when they change over to natural gas in
early 1995. The annual consumption of gas will depend on the load factor
which is predicted to be 68% on a long term basis as opposed to the current
figure of 90%. (Ref. 1 1)
3.15    Fresh water for boiler make up will be required at a rate of 15 m'/hr and this
will b: supplied Erom Ba Ria townsw ;ter supply through an existing pipe
with capacity of 750m' per day. The water will be stored in a reservoir on
site before supply through the water trea:tment plant for demineralisation to
produce the requisite boiler feedwater quality. Well water at a flow rate of 60
m'/hr is available on the site as back-up-supply.
Transmission Line Requirements
3.16    An existing 220kV line and a 11 OkV line currently deliver the power from Ba
Ria. This is also sufficient to take the power from the new development
Project Time Schedule
3.17    The initial 306 project is planned for commissioning in January I February
1997. The following 206 plant is planned for 1 year later.

BASE LIE DATA
Study Area
4.1     The impacts of aqueous, air and noise emissions from  the proposed
development would not extend more than a few kilometres from the plant.
The study area for base line data is taken to be a 5 km radius of the plant.
Ambient Air Quality
4.2     The only air monitoring data available at Ba Ria is a single sample analysed
by Ho Chi Mih City Health Centre. The result shows a level of SO  of
3.5pglm' and a level of N02 of c Iiggrn3. Particulates were not measured
but are considered to be at a very low concentration. The above results are
low, but not exceptional, given the rural location, the low levels of traffic and
the low impacts on ground level concentration of these pollutants from the
existing plant due to the high exit temperatures and excellent dispersion into
the atmosphere. (Ref. 11)
4 3     As this data is not adequate in terms of giving a spatial and temporal picture
of air pollution in the area it is recommended that an air monitorng
programme be carried out (9.3). However, these is no reason to believe that
the level of air pollution is high in the Ba Ria area nor to anticipate that the
findings of the survey will change in any way, the judgement made in 5.4 5.5
Of the low impacts of air emissions, from the proposed development.

Noise
45S     From the environmental point of view the baseline noise data of mast
relevance is the level at the sma[l number of residences which are close t the
site perimter.
4.6     The Vietnamese regulations (Ref 6) put the permitted levels of noise at
public places at 55 dBA during day time and 45 dBA at night where dBA is
the measured sound pressure in decibels corrected to the A scale in order to
reflect the perception of the hbmnn ear. These levels are permitted to rise
E8114.EPp                              4-2



depending on the percentage of time spent at a panrcuwr LUaLLILl UA     vI.
factors (see Appendix IV). The permitted levels indoors are 40 dBA during
day dme and 30 dBA at night.
4.7     The IBRD guidelines for noise state that the limits at residences should be
Ldn 45 indoor and Ldn 55 outdoors where Ldn is the day - night average A
weighted equivalent sound level with a 10 decibel weighting applying to
night time levels. (Ref 16)
4.8     The dominant existing sources of noise are the gas turbines which are usually
a source of continuous noise emissions occasionally with some tonal content.
The only noise data available, which are from measurements carried out by
Ho Chi Minh Health Centre, indicates levels of 94 dBA near a gas turbine and
64 dBA outside the administration building.
There is no data on noise measurements at the site perimeter or nearest
residences. However, based on the above noise measurements, and distan:e
to the neamrst residences, it would appear that there is a danger that noise
levels at the nearest residences, particularly at night, could break the above
regulations. No complamts on this matter have been received by the power
station.
4.9     It is planned that a noise measurement programme will shortly be canied out
by Ho Chi Minh City Health Centre, under contract with PCQ This
measurement programme will monitor the noise levels both indoor and
outdoor, during day and night, at the nearest residences, the site perimeter and
other locations. The results of the study will be the basis for specifying the
required acoustic insulation required for the new development in order to
prevent breaching of noise guidelines and the implementation of mitigation
measures if these are found necessary. As indicated in Section 5.18 no
difficulties are anticipated in putting these measures into place.
Ecology Of Local Area
4.19    The original rain forest in the local area has long been removed and now only
cultivated plants and trees are found. There are no national parks or wild life
reserves in the study area or any notable or endangered species.
4.11    The Dinh river estary cames a heavy silt burden with very large amounts of
alluvial waste deposited each year or removed from place to pla  Migratory
fish which lived in the estuary have disappeared since the constuction of a
dam across the Dinr river 10kIm upstream of the station. Very little fishing
takes place. During low tide large areas of mud flat are exposed in which
shrimps and other shellfish are found. Little plant life, apar from mangroves,
are found because of high turbidity in the water and shifting bottom material.
4.12    The most significant ecosystem is that associated with the mgrove forest
which is extensive in the estarine region indicatee in Trigure 3.5. These
forests are one of the main primary producers in the coastal region providing
Ehl4.REP                               4-3



nutrients, food. shelter and habitat to many species of fish and shellfish.
Mangrove forests and the natuml fisheries associated with them are under
increasing threat here as in many parts of Se   East Asia from
Increased siltation in rivers.
Pollution levels, particularly sewage and herbicides.
Harvesting of mangroves for firewood and charcoal.
Coastal developmenL
*       Shrimp aquaculture.
The greatest single threat probably comes from the development of shrimp
farms which are a fast growing activity in many parts of South East Asia as
well as the Ba Ria area. The damage comes from the cutting down of
mangrove trees to construct the ponds for shrimp aquaculture, as well as the
polluted water, containing biocides and other waste material, released back
into the estuary. (Ref. 4, 8; 12)
4.13    As indicated in 4.16 there are various levels of shrimp aquaculture and it is
the intensive levels with very high stocking rates of shrimps which cause the
main enviromnental damage described above. With the low to medium
intensity systems of aquaculture which are currently practiced in these areas
environmental damage is much 1ess and mangrove trees are an essential part
of the aquaculure system in providing stability for the dykes and shade and
habitat for the shrimps. The area where shrimp fanring is practised near the
power station is shown in Figure 3.5; (this is indicative only) this area also
contains relatively large numbers of mangrove trees.
4.14    As described in Chapter 5 the construction and operation of the proposed
development will not have any significant impact on the delicate mangrove
forest ecosystem.
Socw Economics
4.15    As in many areas in Vietnam the economy is underdeveloped with low annual
incomes and poor housing and infriastructure. The main economic activities
are farming, aquaculue and processing of food for distribution to cities as
well as the export market The rice fields in the area are low lying and suffer
from contaumination with salt water leading to loss of fertility. Cashew nuts,
sweet potato, and bananas are also cultivated in the area
4.16    Shrimp and other shellfish are extensively cultivated in ponds along the Dinh
river estuay for several kilometres down river of the power station as
indicated in Figure 3.2, 3.5. These are an important local source of income.
The water to replenish the ponds is let in from the Dinh esmary and
controlled by a system of dykes and gates. There are several diffnt levels
EBRm ,                                 4-E



of shrimp cultivation as indicated in Table 4.1. It is the intensive method of
cultivation, with high stock-ing levels and resulting waste as well as the
requirement for fresh ground water and biocides that cause the majority of the
enviromnental problems associated with shrimp farming. (Ref. 12). Such
intensive shrimp farning is not practised in the Ba Ria area.

4.17    Harvesting of Mangroves for firewood or charcoal, though banned by local
regulations, continues to a certain extent. The station itself employs 150
people, mostly from the local area consisting of 60 shift staff 80 maintenance
staff and 10 admistatve staff.
Physical And Chemical Characteristics Of Thae Dinh River
4.18    The Dinh river has a large flow during the wet season (for 10%/o of the time
the flow is greater than 343m3/s) but a negligible flow during the dry season.
The main flow during the dry season is therefore tidal and this has been
measured at the power stadon to have a mean of WmAs for the flood tide and
16m3/s for the ebb tide. Upstream of the power staijon the estuary is narrow
reducing at low tide to a small channel. Downstream it widens and deepens
before dividing into several channels which meet the South China Sea (See
Figure 3.5).
E5Bl4.REP                               4-S



4.19    The Dinh river and estuary is characterised by very heavy salit loads wnicn
rise to over 1 00 g/m'. This leads to large sediment loads of alluvial material
being deposited in the water channel each year. The temperature of the
estuary is 00°C with litt:e variation by season or depth. There are no major
industrial plants discharging into the estuary although the town of Ba Ria
discharges untreated sewage just upstream of the station. The water quality.
as indicated in Table 4.2, is unremarkable for estuarine water. There are no
data available for BOD or dissolved 02. (Ref. 11)

Visual Aspects
4.20    The area around Ba Ria is flat and not particularly scenic. The plant itself is
not visually obtrusive with no tall buildings. It is also kept remarkably clean
and tidy.
New Devdopments
4.21    No new industrial developments are planned for the Ba Ria atrea There are
planned developments in Vung Tau, 22 km distance from Ba Ria, which
include expansion of the deep sea port and development of tourist and other
industries. A new highway to Vung Tau which is planned for the late
nineties will pass through Ba Ria and require a bridge over the river close to
the station. PC2 are confident that the river and lagoon crossing can be built
without affecting station operation.

Gaps In Data
4.22    As the existing baseline data is not sufriciently detailed extra monitoring,
much of it already planned, is required as indicated below in 4.23 - 4.25. This
should not affect the implementation schedule of the project or are the results
anticipated to affect significantly the assessment of the environmental impacts
of the proposed development made in this report.
4.23    Available noise data is very limited. However noise measurements will be
carried out, at nearest residences and other locations, in order to confinn
adherence to regulations. The specification of acoustic silencing for the
proposed development will be based on these results as well as mitigation
measures, if required, as described in 5.17.
4.24    Due to the limited data available on air pollution in the Ba Ria area it is
recommended that a monitoring programme be carried out (see 9.3) in order
to obtain a broader picture of the existing situadon as well as confiming the
predicted impacts (5.4, 5.5) when the station is in operation.
4.25    Although the proposed development will not impact significantly on the Dinh
river estuary it is worthwhile carrying out a baseline survey to confim this as
well as monitoring any natural changes. Such a survey should include
bacteriological testing of the river water.

IMPACT OF AIR EMUISSIONS
Introduction
5.)     The air emissions of environmental significance in a gas burning combined
cycle plant are sulphur dioxide (Sz2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and carbon
dioxide (C02). Oxides of nitrogen are made up of NO and N02; for
simplicity, and to take the worst case, all such oxides are considered as N02.
Particulates, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds are not emitted
in significant quantities. The pollutants SO2 and N02 can cause health
problems, particularly to the respiratory system at high local ground level
concentrations. They are also responsible for causing acid rain effects when
transported over long distances. Carbon dioxide has no local impact but has
been implicated as a green house gas causing global warning and with world
wide efforts to control and stabilise the quantities emitted.
Quantities and Rates ofEmission
5.2     The quantities and rates of emission are not affected by the proposed project
assuming, as seems the case, no increase in load factor over the current 90%
(long term projected 680%). These rates are, when buning natual gas, for each
gas turbine on base load (Ref. 11) -
NC)x (given as N02)     31 g / sec
SO2                     °g/sec
Particulates            cl g I sec
When burning stand by diesel, at a sulphur content of 0.8%, the rate of
emission of S02 would be 42 g /sec for each gas turbine.
The total quantities of pollutants, emitted per annum, assuming 90% load
factor and 5% use of diesel would be for all five units approximately.

impact on Ground Level Concentration
5.3     The only impact the proposed development has on air quality is to increase
ground level concentration of the emitted pollutants because of a reduced exiL
temperature and hence a lower dispersion rate.
In order to predict these ground level concentrations the computer software
programme Screen was used which is one of a suite of air dispersion models
approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The following inputs
to the program were used with the N02 emission rate being that for all five gas
turbine units on base load burning natural gas while the S02 emission rate is
for all units buming back up diesel fuel
INPUTS TO DISPERSIO MODEL

S02 Emission Rate       210 g/s
5.4     The model was run for the two typical weather conditions at the site which are
Day:         Stability B + C, Wind Speed 4 m/s
Nighr:       Stability D, Wind Speed 4 m/s
The results indicate a maximum hourly concentration of N02 of 154 pg/nm
during day and 22 pg/rne during the night. These are low figures and
particularly taking into account the existing low ambient level of NO2 (<1 .
g/mn, based on a single sample) would not give rise to any impact on health or
ecology. The maximum daily values would, bv conservative rule of thumb, be
a factor of OA of the hourly value which is taken to be a mean of the day and
night values above. The maximum annual value would be, by similar rule of
thumb, reduced by a factor of 0.1 from the hourly value. This would give a
daily marximum at Ba Ria of the order of 35 pg/rn of NO2 and a maximum
annual value of about 9 pg/r'. (Ref. 1). I r comparison the World Bank
guidelines are 100 pg/m3 as an annual mean while the Vietnamese regulations
state an average daily value of 85 jLg/m'. (_f. 5). For completeness the
model was also run for a combination of the worst weather conditions, which
was stability Class C and a wind speed of 10 n/s. The results indicated a
maximum hourly NO2 ground level concentration of 222 pg/mr' which is still a
low value particularly as this weather condition occurs rarely.
*  5.5  The equivalent SO2 maximum hourly ground level concentrations would be,
for all units on base load buniing diesel, 208 pg&/n during the day and 30 p
gln? at night This is equivalent to a maximum daily value of 47 pLg/mr for
Lii .jp                               5-2



S02. The maximum annual value for SO2, taking into account the expected
load factor on diesel of 5%, would be less than I jtg/m3n. These are low values,
and given the existing low ambient values of 3.5 j1g/m3 (based on single
sample) would have little environmental significance. For comparison World
Bank guidelines are 500 jggr  for daily maximum SO2 level and Vietnamese
regulaiions state a limit of 50 pg/m3 for the daily maximum.
5.6     The stack height used in these calculations was 25m.  Based on "good
-                  engineering practice" (GEP) for stack height design for the proposed project as
well as on final boiler design the stack height may need to be extended. Any
increase in stack height would reduce the ground level concentration of
pollutants predicted above.

Environmental Benefits of Combined Cyde Plant
5.7     Because of the incrased efficiency of the proposed combined cycle plant (45%
as opposed to 30%/e) and the resulting lower air emissions per unit of electricity
generated, there are significant environmental benefits compared to the exsting
gas turbines or conventional thermal plant  This is particularly so for
emissions of CO2 from a combined cycle plant burning natural gas waich will
cmit about 50% less CO2 per kWh generated, than either a coal or heaw fuel
oil fired generating unit.
AQUEOUS EMSSIONrS
Sources and Nature of Emissions
5.8     The aqueous discharges likely to arise from the proposed development are as
follows -
*       Waste water arisn  from regeneration of ion exchange resin with
acid and alkali.
*       Station sewage discharged from the administation block.
*       Station surface drains.
*       Boiler blown down.
*       Irregular discharges including water and acid boiler washes, and
accidentl spillages.

Water Treatment Plant Effluent
5.9     Fresh water for boiler make-up is required at a rate of 15 m3/hr for the
proposed development. The source of this frwh water is the Ba Ria town
supply originally coming from the Dinh river reservoir upstream of the tidal
area. The quality of this water is given in table 5.4. (Ref. 11).

Hardness (CaCO3)        33 mg/l
5.10    This water is furither purified in the wate treatment plant by filtation and by
demineralisation in cation, anion and mixed bed ion exchange units. The waste
fom the plant comes from the regeneration of the ion exchange resin with
caustic (sodium hydroxide) and acid (either hydrochloric or sulphuric). The
waste is collected to a neutralisation tank where it will be neutralised to a pH
between 6 and 9. The effluent from this tank consists largely of a solution of
sodium chloride (or sodium sulphate) as well as smaller quantities of whatever
material had becn removed from the fresh water supply which is mostly
calcium and magnesium salts. This discharge would not breach any
environmental standards or have any significant impact on the receiving
waters.
kfnor Station Discharges
5.11    The sewage discharge arising from the 40 new staff as well as the 150 existng
staff would be treated biologically to a minimum effluent quality of 20mg/I
BOD and 30 mg/l suspended solids. A tertiary filtration will ensure a final
effluent quality of 10/10. This will satisfr Vietnamese regulations.
5.12    The routing of all drains through oil interceptors will prevent contamination
from any oil spillage as is currently the practise with exdsting plant The oil
interceptors will be inspected and cleaned regularly and any sludge taken off
site for disposal. The drainage effluent will be tested for oil contmination to
ensure the Vietnamese regulations of 10 ppm is complied with.
EBu14REP                               5-6



5.13    Blowdown of the drum in each waste heat boiler would take place for a few
hours each week. The blowdown water will be discharged via a pressure
reducing flash tank to the station drains. This very pure water only contains
traces of ammonia and sodium triphosphate at a concentration of a few ppm
and requires no treatment before disposal. Acid cleaning of the boilers will
normally occur during comnmissioning and at irregular intervals of about 5
years. Hydrochloric or hydrofluoric acid is usually used for this cleaning with
the effluent largely containing compounds of Iron. The effluent from this
process would be neutralised with either lime or sodium hydroxide and the
precipitated material would be collected and taken off site for disposal in a land
fill site while the liquid portion would be safely discharged. Water washing of
the gas side of the boiler is occasionally required to remove deposits. With
natural gas or distillate as the fuel, these deposits are not significant.
5.14    The danger of spiUage of chemicals will be avoided by proper bunding of the
containers of the two main chemicals to be stored on site. -- Sodium
Hydroxide and Hydrochloric (or Sulphuric) Acid. Appendix VII gives details
of procedures for management and storage of chemicals.
5.15-   Oil spill risks associated with delivery of oil to the plant will be reduced due to
the changeover to natual gas in early 1995. As the oil storage tanks are
bunded the main risk is during the delivery process. In order to reduce futher
the risk of an oil spill into the sensitive mangrove ecosystem safe handling
procedures as well as an oil spill response plant will be implemented as
described in 8.5.
Noise Impacts
5.16    The main sources of noise from the operation of proposed development are
*       Steam Turbines
*       Air Cooled Condensers
*       Waste Heat Boilers
Ancillary Equipment including transformers, fins, water treatment
plant and cooling water pumps would be minor.
The level of noise emissions from these sources would be considerably less
than that from the existing gas turbines. However, because eisdng noise
levels are close to the permitted levels (see Section 4.8) acoustic insulation of
the proposed plant or altenative rmedies as stated below will be required.
5.17    The steam turbines and waste heat boilers will be enclosed in buildings which
will allow for the easy addition of acoustic cladding and exhaust silencing.
The air cooled condenser will be insulated, if required, by acoustic baffles or
by specification of low noise fans. The level to which this insulation is
required wiU depend on the outcome of the detailed noise survey to be shortly
carried out and wiU be such that noise emissions from the site will comply with
the regulations. This can be achieved without major cost inputs.
EBllI.REP                              5-7



5.18    If, as a result of the noise survey, the noise regulations are found to be breached
at the nearest residence then simple mitigation measures could be put in place.
If the high levels are outdoors then a berm (mound of earth) will be considered
at the site perimeter planted with trees and shrubs to shield noise emissions. If
the high levels are found indoors the acoustic insulation of the residences in
questian would be the cheapest solution.
Noise During Construction and Commissioning
5.19    During Construction the main extra source of noise will be piling operations.
Restricting this to daylight hours, as is customary, will prevent disturbance to
neighbouring residences.
S.20    When the waste heat boilers are being commissioned, steam is blown through
the turbines and boilers to purge them. This steam is exhausted to atmosphere
causing high noise levels for several hours per day over a few days. The
procedure is a once off occurrence and confined to daylight hours. Silencers
will be used to reduce the impact and local residents will be given prior notice
of these events.
Socio-Economic Impacts
5.21    A major and positive impact will be the provision of extra generation capacity
of 80MW which, at a predicted long term load factor of 68%, would produce
477 million kWh extra per annum with no added fuel consumption. This will
impact on a regional basis by strengthening the electricity supply network and -
allowing the connection of extra consumers and the development of industry
and services in the region.
5.22    A positive local impact will be the provision of 40 extra jobs at the plant as
well as the provision of housing for these new staff and their families. During
the construction of the new plant over 100 temporary jobs would be provided
extending over a period of 2 - 3 years. Traffic is not a problem in the area and
increased traffic is not anticipated as most of the new staff will be local.
Visual Impact
5.23    No new buildings above 25 m will be added to the plant for the new
development and as a result no significant visual impact is anticipated from the
proposed developmnent.
Impact on Ecology
5.24    Summarising the chapter above, no significant ecological impacts are
anticipated from the proposed development

ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVFS
Introduction
6.1     The evaluation of altematives to the proposed project of Ba Ria should be seen
in the context of existing very low electricity usage per head of population in the
PC2 region (about 180 kWh/vear) and a high predicted growth in demand to the
year 2100 in order to allow for the expansion of the economy and the
improvement in living conditions. (Ref. 17). This requires the addition of new
generating plant of 1 50 to 200MW per year during the 1990's.
6.2     The key strategic issues relating to the development of generation capacity in
the PC2 region over that period for supply of this demand are as follows:
The potential for hydro development within the region
The availability of imported power from the PC1, PC3 region,
utilising the new 5OOkV line
The availability of natural gas from off shore fields from the mid
nineties.
The possibility of importing coal from the north of the country.
T he current poor state of much of the region!s steam and diesel plant.
Limited availability of investment funds, particularly foreign
currency.
*       Environmental issues which are viewed on a national basis as putting
some constraints on hydro and coal -development but with little
impact on gas-fired plant developments.
63      On the basis of the predicted demand forecast and the above issues the
generation requirement and breakdown of type of plant used till the year 2005
has been evaluated. (Ref. 2, 3). This will consist of a mixtue of thennal and
hydro plant which is required to provide a balanced mixture of peak and base
load plant over the wet and dry seasons. The present proposal, which consists
of add-on waste heat boilers and steam turbines to eisting gas turbine at Ba
Ria, is planned as the first new thennal plant for base load operation because of
its perceived low capital and opertional costs, low environmental impacts and
short construction schedule.
EBRI4.REP                             6-1



6.4     Within the above context the altematives tD the proposed project at Ba tia
evaluated here are
!*      Alternative designs
* +     Altemative generation sources to include
!              o      ~~~~~~Hydro
Thermal plant
*      Importation of power via new 500kV line.
Alternative Design
6.5     Given that the proposed project is an add on to an existing plant the
possibilities for design altematives are limited but include:
General layout, size and number of steam turbines.
Single or dual pressure system.
Vertical or horizontal type boilers.
*       Alternative cooling systems.
A study carried out by ESBI (Ref. 2) has optimised the project design
features. Environmental impacts related to the first three design options are
not significant The fourth item has environmental implication and is
discussed below.
Alternative Cooling Systems
6.6     A dirmct cooling water system is usually economically favourable where an
adequate supply of cooling water is available and this option was thoroughly
analysed. However because of the lack of flow in the Dinh river durng the
dry season this option would have required the following works.
Construction of an intake lagoon by dredging an area of 40
hectares.
r-onstruction of a cooling water pipeline 3 km long in order to
discharge to a suitably large body of water.
Construction of cooling water pump house and chlorine treatment
system.
These are sbown in figure 3.5.
E.BZE.XREP                             6-2



6.7     The main environmental impacts associated with the construction and
operation of such a system would be:
*       The acquisi.-on of 40 hectares from local farners and shrimp
fishennen.
*       The dredging and disposal of 800,000 tonnes of material from the
proposed intake lagoon.
*       The destruction of mangrove trees in the proposed lagoon area as
well as along the route of the 3km pipeline.
*       The discharge of cooling water at a rate of 7.5 m3lsec, at a
temperature rise of 6°C and with a chlorine residual level of 0.02
PPmL
1 68    While these impacts are not major, further studies are required to prove that
this is so. particularly in relation to the hydrography and ecology at the Dinh
river estuary. (Ref 13). This would have the effect of delaying the project by
several months. Although the direct cooling water option has at first sight an
overall cost benefit of about $1.6 million compared with the air-cooled
condenser option. delays caused by environmental uncertainties, which are
costed at about $0.8 million for a full months output, would leave this option
as unviable even without taking into account residual negative environmental
impacts associated with direct water cooling.
6.9     Mechanical coo'ung towers have the advantage of minor environmental impacts
consisting of a blow down discharge containing small amounts of residual
chlorine. This minor dischawge would have no significant impact on the
receiving water. They also have an economic advantage relatve to air cooled
condensers by providing an extra 5MW outputL However they are not feasible
in this case because of the large water make-up requirement (100 Vsec) for
which no suitable source is avaiiLabe. If a suitable source was located this
would be the most attractive cooling option.
Alternative Generaion Source - Hydro Power
6.10    Vietnam has a theoretical hydro potential of 300 billion kWh/year with a
technically exploitable hydro potential of about 91 billion kWh/year of which
only 2% has been so far hamessed. In the PC2 region there are existing
hydrostations at Da Nhim (160MW) and Tri An (400 MW) while two firther
stations are under development at Han Thuran (470 MW) and Thac Mo
(15OMW). These will come into operation in the mid to late nineties and their
output has already been factored into the predicted power requirements for PC2.
611     Several potential hydro sites are also under consideration and preliminary
feasibility work has been carried out. The levelsed cost for hydro generation
from some of these plants are in general higher han those costs for the
conversion of gas turbine plant to combined cycle plant (Ref 17). Also the time
scale for the commissioning of any new hydro schemes would be into the next
century, while the requirement for power from the present project is from 1998
onwards.
EB114.REP                              6-S



6.12    While the development of hydro power will certan,y play a major role in
providing future generation capacity it does not represent a viable altemative to
the present project at Ba Ria, particularly as the base load combined cycle plant.
which will be required for operation in the next few  years will be
complir.mentary to hydro power development.
New Thermal Planr As An Alternative
6.13    The PC2 region has 193 MW  of conventional thermal plant in operation
currently. A further 140OMW is under development with expected commission
dates in the period 1998-2003. The output from these plants has already been
factored into PC2s predicted power requirements. The levelised cost of
generation from a conventional thermal plant is higher than that from the
conversion of Ba Ria to a combined cycle plant. (Ref. 17). The environmental
impacts of a conventional thermal plant, even when buming gas, would always
be greater for atmosphere - emissions because of the greater efficiency of
combined cycle plant and particularly the present proposal which has no
additional air emissions.
6.14-    While a new combined cycle plant could be an attractive investment a recent
study (Ref. 3) has looked in more detail at several options for converiing
existing gas turbine at Ba Ria to combined cycle plant and concluded that the
levelised cost was lower than that for a new combined cycle plant or new gas
turbine plant.
* The Importation Of Power Via The 500kV Line
6.15    This 1500 km transmission line, completed in 1994, is intended to provide for
the transmission of surplus hydro power from PCI network to PC2 and later,
from the large new hydro development at Yali in PC3 to PC2. The supply is
envisaged by PC2 as supplying base load at a level rising from 200MW in 1994
to 500MW in 1998 and eventually to 55OMW by 2001. This output has already
been factored into the predicted PC2 power requirement.

MITIGAH MEA 4SURES
7.1     In order to reduce environmental impacts from the proposed development
mitigation measures, which are summarised below, have already been put in
hand or are planned. Apart from these, and taking into account the minor
residual impacts of the proposed development, no further mitigation measurcs
are considered necessary.
7.2     An air cooled condenser was selected as opposed to a direct cooling water
system in order to avoid environmental impacts associated with the
construction and operation of a direct system as described in 6.7.
7.3     Available data on existing noise at the site are limited, but indicate that there
may be a danger of breaching guideline levels at nearby residences. A survey
to be shortly carried out will give a much better picture of the present
situation. Depending on the results the level of acoustic cladding and other
silencing equipment for the new development will be specified such that
noise emissions from the site will comply with the regulations. The cost of
the additional acoustic insulation would be small compared with the overall
project cost.
7.4     Depending on the outcome of the survey findings tvo altemative mitigation
measures may be feasible. These are (a) the erection at the site perimeter of a
berm (earth mound) with planted trees and shrubs to insulate noise emissions
and (b) the acoustic insulation of residences where indoor noise is high. The
costs associated with both these mitigation measures are minor.
7.5     Waste water streams from the proposed developmernt including (a) water
plant treatment waste, (b) sewage, (c) surface drains, (d) boiler blowdown and
(e) boiler acid clean will all be treated, as required, so that the effluent
discharged satisfies Vietnamese wastewater effluent regulations and will
cause no significant impacL

CHAPTER
EN!VIRONMENTAL MANAGEMNT AND TRAIN
Li      Environmental awareness is recent in Power Company 2. The Companv has
no experience with environmental management.
For the implementation of the present proposal the establishment of an
environmental unit at Ba Ria is of most importance. A laboratory is already
planned for the Ba Ria combined cvcle development and the chemist I
technician who would run the water quality analysis programme would be the
obvious choice to run the environmental unit. The most important fimction of
this unit would be monitoring, control and optimisation of the waste water
streams described in 5.8. The procedures are standard and a university
trained graduate chemist, for example, would be able to take on this role with
little further training.
8.2     As PC2 expands the establishment of a central environmental co-ordinator
with the following functions is recommended
*       Ensuring compliance with standards and laws.
I   *   Developing environmental policy.
*       Issuing in-house guidelines and standards and procedures.
a       Co-ordinating information and public relations.
Carrying out environmental studies.
*       Setting up an enviromnental management plan
8.3     One cther important fiunction would be liaison with other environmental
groups such as a Coastal Zone Management Group in order to co-ordinate
strategies for the protection of the coastal environment. Through activities
such as this PC2 could positively promote the protection and sustainable
development of the coastal zone. The impact of power station development
on the Dinh river system is a minor factor in its effects on this important local
resource. The development of farming and aquaculture, the management of
d-er flow and the levels of sewage and industrial pollutant are quantities
which are less well documented and are likely to have a far greater imoact
than the proposed combined cycle development. The interests of all activities
utilising the Dini river system would be best served in the long term by a co-
ordinated management approach.   The establishment of an overall
maagement system may requir. a co-ordinating authority with the necessary
powers to prevent uncontrolleC development, monitor environmental quality
and encourage the sustainable Ievelopment of the delicate estwarine region.

8.4     [lhe main training requaLcat±aita ItLUSb LU    -. r
proposed project are:
For Station Managtment, training in the overall environmental significance of
the station activities and enviromnental management systems.
For the manager of the environmental unit at Ba Ria, training in the
monitoring and contro of station emissions. A period of time spent as work
experience in a well run power plant of similar type would be a good way of
achieving this.
For the environmental co-ordinator, when appointed, training will be required
on the environmental aspects mentioned in 8.2 as well as the overall
ecological dynamics of systems such as the Dinh river estuary.
For all station staff, basic training should be provided in the environmental
aspects of their work including storage and handling of bulk chemicals and
fuel oil, procedures to be followed in the event of emergency situations,
handling of station waste and emissions and reporting procedures for
environmental issues.
One of the major environmental risks from the existing plant at Ba Ria is for
an oil spill into the sensitive mangrove ecosystem. Even though this risk will
be greatly reduced by the changeover to natural gas in early 1995 it is
recommended that, in order to minimise this risk, written procedures be set up
to cover.
*       Unloading of oil tankers including training of personnel
a       Inspection of fuel oil tanks, pipework and valves
*       Inspection of fuel oil bunds
*       Emergency oil spill plan including provision of equipment and
trained personnel.
Standard procedures for oil spill control are summarised in Appendix VI.

CHAPTER 9
ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN
9.1     ln order to fill gaps in baseline data as well as control of the implementation of
the proposal project. the following monitoring programme is recommended;
WVaste Water iMonitoring
9.2     The most important monitoring requirement for the proposed development is
that of the various waste water streams described in *.3 which is one area
where the station has control over its discharges. This monitoring should be
carried out by the chemist / technician in charge of the laboratory. The
laboratory and equipment as well as its technical staff are already costed into
the project. Extra costs for equipment and instruments for waste water
analyses would not be significant. A summnary of a typical monitoring
programme for station aqueous effluents is given in Appendix V.
Air Monitoring
9.3     Some monitoring at the site has been carried out by officials of the Ho Chi
Minh City Health Centre under contract to PC2. It is satisfactory to have an
outside body carry out this fimction as the station has little control over its air
emissions which are set by design factors and fuel usage. However, the
monitoring should be extended in time and area in order to get a better
baseline picture and to confirm the predicted low overall impact of the plant
on ground level concentrations. Monitoring should include particulate matter
as well as SO2 and N02. Routine measurements of SQ2 or NOx
concentration in the exhaust gases themselves are not usually required as
these are set by sulphur content of the fuel for S02 and design factors for
NOx. An occasi'nal check for NOx values would be useful.
Noise
9.4     Noise measurements within the existing plant have been carried out by
officials of Ho Chi Minh City Health Centre under contract to PC2. No
measurements were made outside the site perimeter.  A  monitoring
programme should be carried out to get a better picture of the existing noise
environment during different weather conditions, during day and night and
both outdoor and indoor at nearest residences. The survey results will allow
the specification of the level of acoustic cladding required for the new
development as well as other mitigation measures that may be required (see
5.18).

9.S     After completion of the programme a iurLIlCI 1IUL; StAUAt&t... r  --
should be undertaken to confinm the effec; of these measures as wvell as
monitoring non - power plant impacts on the noise enviromnent. The costs
for these monitoring programmes would be minor
Ecology Study
9.6     An ecological study of the Dinh river estuary. particularly in the area near the
plant, should be carried out before the commissioning of the first unit. This
will establish a base line against which to measure any changes caused bv the
new plant as well as monitoring ongoing natural changes. Such a study could
be carried out bv. for example the Ecology Department at the University of
iHo Chi Minh City, at relatively little cost.

A PPFNDIX LIII
CONSULTATION WITHAFFECTED GROUPS
Consultations have taken place over a period in late 1994 between PC2 and the local co-
operative representing shrimp farmers who cultivate shellfish in ponds adjacent to the
site. There had been concern with the original plan for the development which would
have involved a direct cooling water system requiring the acquisition of 40 hectares of
their land for a cooling water lagoon during the construction phase as well as the
discharge of warm water from the plant during the operation phase (see fig. 3.5). In order
to avoid these potential problems the cooling system for the development was changed to
an air cooled condenser which will have no aqueous discharges. In fact the quality of the
receiving water should be improved overall as a result of the new development because of
treatment of previously untreated sewage from the plant and lower risk of oil spills. On
this basis there were no objections from the co-operative to the proposed development.
PC2 has also consulted with the town council of the local town of Ba Ria and informed
them of their plan to extend the plant. Benefits to the town include the provision of extra
jobs during the construction and operation phase as well as improvements on a general
basis to the electricity supply network. As there are no significant negative impacts
arising from the development there were no objections to it.
The only groups directly affected by the proposed development consist of a small number
of residential units close to the site perimeter who may be impacted by noise emission
from the existing and proposed plant (.17/18). Consultation with these groups on noise
reduction measures will take place, after the completion of the planed noise survev.
During the commissioning phase of the development steam blows will be carried out to
clear the pipework. This will cause high levels of noise, resticted to day light hours,
over a period of several days. Local residents will be given prior notice of these events.

In general the main source of water pollution arises from the discharge of untreated
seuage. The contribution of power plant operations to water pollution is not significant.
The discharge of aqueous effluents from power plant must comply viith Vietnamese
Environmental Criteria 6 entitled " Maximum Limit for Wastewater Constiuents
Discharged to Water Sources " whose 21 characteristics and parameters are detailed in
Table IV.1. Different limits apply depending on the quality and use of the receiving
waters. (Ref. 7).
Class 1 receiving waters includes those which are a source for water supply systems,
amenity for tourism or fishing resource. All effluent discharge points should be located
at least 50Dm fron the protected area. Class 2 receiving waters are not used for any of
the above.

It is likely that any dust emissions will arise during the construction phase and
not during subsequent plant operation. The impact of dust on human health and
the environment depends on the particle size distribution, rate of deposition, and
on the chemical and physical nature of the particulates. A guideline has been

*       Emission Levels: these specify pennitted limits for the control of
S02 emitted from a pollution source, depending on air quality
within its immediate area.

World Bank procedure on the control of S02 emissions is based on 2 criteria.
Each criteria specifies an upper concentration limit for SO2 which must not be
exceeded. Where the actual concentrations resulting from the development
exceeds either of these limits the largest excess will determnine a sulphur
removal requirement  (SRR ). The criteria are based on different inputs and
may both yield different SRR values. The largest of the SRR is the one which
must be applied.
Areas are classed as unpolluted to highly polluted depending on the measured
ambient conditions. For each of these classes a limit is imposed under Criteria
I and nI. The definitions of each criteria are as follows;
Criteria I:   defines the maximnum  permitted uncontrolled SO- emission and is
dependent on the fuel sulphur content.
Criteria II:  this fixes the permitted increase in ambient ground level SOr
concentrations. A dispersion model will be required to determine these
values.
Table IV3 details the ambient air quality limnits for each of the four area
classifications. Alongside are the respective limits which must be complied

Emissions of SO2 from the natural gas fired combined cvcle plant at Ba Ria
will not result in any significant increase in ambient S02 concentrations in the
vicinity of the plant. This is by the nature of the fuel itself which has an
extremely low sulphur content. For this reason there will not be a requirement
to control S02 emissions.
(3)     Nitrogen Oxides: Standards for the control of NOx emissions are similar to
those that exist for SO7, in so far as both standards for ambient air quality and
emission levels are specified. All World Bank projects must meet an ambient
air quality of lI00pg[m  as an annual arithmetic mean. Guidance values for
emission levels include 8Sng/J of heat input for steam generators fired on
gaseous fossil fuels. All limits are specified as NO,.

The environmental impact of noise can adversely affect the qualitY of life of people
living close to a source of obtrusive sound. This is of particular concern during the night
time hours when noise levels may interrupt the sleeping pattems of the local population.
In evaluating the possible impact a project may have in terms of noise, it is necessary to
quantify any increases in noise levels during the construction and operational phases of
the project.
In the NVorld Bankl guideline on noise pollution figures are quoted from the US EPA on
levels to ensure adequate protection of public health and welfare (Table IV.7). Noise
pollution values for the area classification "Residential with Outside Space and Farm
Residences" shall not exceed 55 dBA as a day/night average. The night time levels have
a 10 dBA weighting.

The influx of population to a previously rural area can cause a severe deterioration in the
enviromnent due to an insufficient sanitary infrastructure. This is of particular
importance in relation to sewage collection and disposal. In such instances it is
important to estimate the total influx of population.

APPENDIX VI
Prevention end Management of Oil Spills
1.   Oil Uses mad Srorat
At present the combustion turbines at Ba Ria are fuelled using distillate oil. It is intended
however to switch to natural gas as soon as it becomes available following which distillate
oil will be used as a standby fuel in the event of disruptions to the gas supply. Distillate oil
is currently delivered to the powver station via the Dinh river by marine tanker. The station
has two unloading jetties.
The storage and unloading of distillate oil constitutes by far the largest potential
environmental risk from oil.
The storage and use of general and specialist lubricants is a second potential risk area. This
sterns, not from the volume of lubricant oils stored but the frequent transfer operations
invjolving small quantities.
There is a total of 16 transformers located on-site. The largest transformer contains in
excess of 15,000 litres. Loss of oil from a transformer would constitute a major impact if
the oil were to enter the Dinh river.
Z    OilSirolg  Cnwtainmenh
Fuel Oi
All fuel oil tanks are located within a concrete containment bund sized to hold 110% of the
tank or largest tank within it. All bunds consist of a concrete retention wall and impervious
base to prevent soil and water pollution.
A controlled drain fitted with a stop valve will be provided to remove storm water.
Non-Fuel Oil StoraMr
The storage of steel drums containing lubricating oils shall be within a bunded area. Bunds
shall be
- sufficiently sized to contain potential spillages or rupture of drums
- covered to prevent accumulation of stonn water, and
- provided with a collection sump to facilitate spillage recovery.
A supply of oil absorbent material will be provided to clean up minor oil spills within the
bunded area where oil is transferred from or to delivery drums.
All waste oil shall be stored and managed in a likewise manner.

Izrunformers
All transf'ormers within the station site shall be bunded. Bunds shall be sufficiently sized to
contain any oil leakage or oil/water mixtures which may arise in the event of a transformer
fire.
The bund will be drainable using a controlled shut off valve located outside of the
transformer compound. Drainage shall be diverted to a dedicated oil interceptor serving
only transformer bunds. This oil interceptor will be fitted with a shut-off valve. A retention
pond will be installed upstream of the oil interceptor to collect any oil/water mixture which
may arise in the event of a transformner fire. The mixture will be retained and following
sufficient separation time the water released in a controlled manner enabling collection and
proper disposal of oil.
RondwkerUn/oading aQprgia
At present all deliveries of distillate oil are by marine tanker. In the event of deliveries by
road tanker the following procedures shall apply.
A nominated person shall be appointed by the Senior Site Engineer to control and
supervise the unloading operation. The tanker driver shall report to the nominated person
upon arrival at the station.
The nominated person shall direct the tanker driver to proceed to the designated unloading
area. The nominated person shall prior to commencing the unloading operation:
- determine receiving tank and tanker volumes
- ensure all valves are in correct position including bund valve. The tank inlet valves
shall be kept locked at all times except during unloading.
- ensure oil absorbent material is at hand and any nearby surface drains are sealed
- deploy hazard waming signs: No Smoking/Petroluem Hazard
The nominated person shall monitor the unloading operation and ensure that all
connections are properly secured, remaining at the transfer point for the duration. The
tanker operator shall at all times renain beside the tanker during the transfer operation.
The unloading area will;
- be provided with a telephone in the event of an emergency
- have notices displayed detailing instructions to be followed in the event of fire or
spillage.
- be covered to eliminate storm run-off and contained to protect nearby drains.
