Chapter I
The Energy Sector
A. Overview
1.1        Viet Nam began the transition from a centrally planned to a market economy in 1986, at
the Sixth Congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party. This process was accelerated in 1989 with the
devaluation of the Dong and the decontrolling of most prices. In 1993, Viet Nam obtained access to
concessional international finance, while the US embargo was lifted in early 1994. All these events
provided a stimulus to the economy, which responded with a rapid growth of about 8% per annum
(p.a.) over 1992-1994. GDP is forecast to continue growing at this rate for the rest of the decade. In
the economy's continued transition and growth, the energy sector, which provides approximately one
third of the nation's foreign exchange earnings, will play a vital role.  Viet Nam's economic
development will be closely linked to growth in energy supplies in general, and electricity in particular.
1.2        Per capita consumption of commercial energy in Viet Nam, at around 113 kilograms of oil
equivalent (kgoe), is amongst the lowest in the world. In comparison, per capita consumption is 215
kgoe in the Philippines and 325 kgoe in Thailand. Biomass and fuelwood still account for about 60%
of total primary energy consumption. Petroleum products made up 44% of primary commercial energy
consumed in 1992, with coal (26%) and hydropower (30%) making up the balance. Commercial
energy consumption has grown relatively slowly over the last decade, at 2.5% p.a.. However, over
this period there has been a major shift in its composition, with a decline in the consumption of coal
and an increase in the consumption of electricity (10% p.a.) and petroleum products (9.5% p.a.).
1.3        There are substantial regional differences in the country's energy endowments and the
pattern of energy consumption. The north has an excess of hydro and coal-fired power resources, and
surplus power is now being exported to the center and the south over a recently constructed 500 kV
transmission line. This has to some extent eased the electricity shortages that these two regions had
been suffering during recent dry seasons.  The south, however, is geographically closer to the
hydrocarbon resources that have so far been discovered, and has had a more reliable supply of
petroleum products.
B. Domestic Energy Endowments
1.4        Viet Nam has considerable indigenous primary energy potential, in the form of oil, gas,
coal and hydro. These could not only meet projected national demand, but also allow additional exports
of oil and coal. Viet Nam's energy potential is, however, largely unexplored and under-exploited.
The Oil and Gas Sector
1.5        Viet Nam's hydrocarbon potential is estimated to be in the order of 4,000 - 6,000 million
barrels (mmnb). Proven and probable reserves are currently estimated at around 1,000 mmb of oil and



-2-
3.6 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas, of which 2.3 tcf is associated gas. However, recent discoveries and
further drilling in known fields make it likely that these estimates would be revised.
1.6        By 1992, three offshore oil fields had been discovered - Bach Ho, Rong and Dai Hung.
Production at the Bach Ho field, operated by VietSovPetro. is currently 110,000 barrels per day (bpd),
with potential reserves estimated at over 800 mmb. The Dai Hung field, operated by a consortium lead
by BHP Petroleum of Australia, began production in October 1994, at about 25,000 bpd. The Rong
field contains an estimated 30-40 nmmb, but is not yet being exploited commercially. A subsidiary of
the Mitsubishi Oil Company has recently discovered a significant reservoir of oil to the north of Bach
Ho in the Rang Dong field. Preliminary drilling suggests that this field could be as large as, or even
larger than Bach Ho.
1.7        Offshore gas development is linked to oil production; no free gas fields have been
discovered. Based on production forecasts, Bach Ho alone is not expected to be able to sustain a stable
gas supply for 15-20 years of the size required by downstream users, and will have to be supplemented
with production from Dai Hung. A gas pipeline from Bach Ho to the Ba Ria power plant is scheduled
for completion by mid-1995; the pipeline would be extended overland to the Thu Duc power station site
by end-1995. Based upon existing data, a gas profile of 1.8 to 2 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year is
expected to be achieved around 1996/97 and maintained thereafter for some 15 years. The delineation
of identified gas reserves, such as Dai Hung, Rong and other marginal structures, needs to be expedited
for an accurate assessment of the gas supply base.
1.8        Viet Nam does not yet have an oil refinery, and the entire crude oil production is
exported, the bulk of it to Japan. Refined petroleum products are currently imported to meet demand
and are distributed by truck, rail and barge; there is currently only one pipeline for the transportation of
petroleum products, from Quang Ninh port to the Hanoi area. There are plans to construct a refinery
near Nhatrang by 1999, with a capacity of 6.5 million tons (mmt) (below national demand for oil
products at this date). The refinery is expected to be financed by a consortium composed of Total
(France), the Chinese Petroleum Corporation (Taiwan) and the China Investment and Development
Company (China).
The Coal Sector
1.9        Viet Nam's coal reserves are estimated at 2,345 mmt of anthracite, 78 mmnt of semi-
anthracite, 38 mit of coking coal, 96 mmt of thermal coal and 306 mmt of lignite. The commissioning
of the 1,920 MW Hoa Binh hydro plant in the north has led to a drop in coal demand from the power
sector, and coal mines are currently operating at around 50% capacity. This has pushed up costs of
production by 20%.
1.10       While the production costs of Viet Nam coal are low, the ocean freight rates charged from
Viet Nam ports are two to three times the freight costs of Australian coal to similar Asian and European
destinations. These high costs are due to slow loading rates and smaller ship handling capacity at
Vietnamese ports. Viet Nam exported just under a third of its total coal production of 3.6 mmt in 1992.
1.11       The export market is likely to be the key for future growth in the coal sector. The export
of anthracite and the possible export of electricity to China from coal-fired stations in the north
represent the major export markets for coal. However, the successful export of anthracite will require



-3-
improved port facilities. If this is done, Viet Nam could be exporting as much as 2.3 mint by 2000 and
3.6 mint by 2010.
Hydroelectric Resources
1.12       Substantial hydropower resources exist in Viet Nain, estimated to be in the region of
10,000 MW (3,000 MW in the south and 7,000 MW in the north). The Son La site in North Viet Nam
is the largest of the schemes that could be developed, with a potential of 2,400 MW - 3,600 MW. In
the Southern and Central regions there are 10 as yet undeveloped sites with an aggregate capacity of
2,400 MW, which could be developed before 2010. The largest of these is the Yali project in Central
Viet Namn (700 MW), which is under construction and scheduled to begin operation in 1999. There is
also the possibility of importing hydro power from Laos and Cambodia.
Biomass and Fuelwood
1.13       Biomass and fuelwood currently make up over 60%  of Viet Nam's primary energy
consumption. There are substantial regional variations in the type of biomass used. In the northern
rural areas, rice straws and husks represent the bulk of the fuel used, with wood representing the
remainder. In the Mekong delta in the south, wood, along with coconut shells and woody residues
make up the bulk of traditional fuels, while rice husks and straw play a minor role. The upland areas
of the north, center and south are in general still heavily wooded, although deforestation is proceeding
under pressure from clearing for agriculture, cutting for poles, logging and for fuelwood. As part of a
policy to conserve the forests, the Government has developed an Improved Cooking Stoves Program,
which would need to focus on areas currently having the greatest pressure on fuelwood resources. The
Bank, under Energy Sector Management and Assistance Program (ESMAP), is providing technical
assistance to the Energy Institute of Viet Nam (EI) to help improve the efficiency of the production and
consumption of traditional fuels. Specifically, the TA will assist El in: (i) the design of a phased,
costed commercialization plan for the program to distribute improved cookstoves; and (ii) determining
options for modernizing and improving the efficiency of the coal briquettes industry.
C. Energy Consumption
1.14       Table 1.1 presents the primary commercial energy balance for Viet Nam for 1992,
excluding traditional fuels (biomass and wood). Diesel fuel accounted for just under half of the
petroleum products consumption in 1992, with gasoline and fuel oil accounting for 23% and 24% of the
total respectively.

-4-
1.15       In 1992 electricity accounted for 12%, petroleum products 57% and coal 31 % of the end-
use energy consumption. Commercial energy end-use consimption has grown at only 3 % per year over
the last decade. However, this masks two distinct phases, from 1980-1985 when petroleum products
consumption was held constant and electricity consumption increased by 8% per annum, and from 1985
onwards when there were rapid increases in the consumption of both petroleum products and electricity,
at 9% and 10% per annum respectively. Coal consumption has declined since 1987, due to a shift in
fuel consumption patterns by households and industry.
1.16       Sector-wise, industry accounts for 42%, transport 37%, household/service 16% and
agriculture 5 % of end-use commercial energy consumption. The bulk of energy used by the industrial
sector is coal, although the usage of electricity is expected to rise rapidly with the modernization of the
economy and the introduction of light industries. Around 50% of household consumption is made up of
petroleum products; this sector still consumed, in 1992, twice as much coal, in energy terms, as
electricity.
1.17       Commercial energy consumption is expected to increase rapidly if the forecast GDP
growth target in the order of 8% is realized. Over the last decade, due to the substitution of electricity
and petroleum products for coal, there has been a slow growth in commercial energy consumption,
relative to GDP growth. This situation is likely to change as the demand for electricity and petroleum
products is expected to increase sharply over the next decade. This could yield an overall commnercial
energy consumption growth at as much as 8% - 9% p. a.. The composition of consumption, in terms
of the relative importance of coal, gas, oil and electricity, will depend upon the availability and pricing
of gas. The power sector and the chernicals industry are expected to be the main consumers of gas; it
is unlikely that the household sector will account for a significant share of consumption, at least in the
near future.
D. Institutional Framework
1.18       Much of the energy sector remains under Government ownership and control.  All
authority within the sector is derived from the nation's senior Governmental and political body, the
Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Minister. Institutional arrangements in the sector are
complex, involving several ministries and Government bodies, of which the Ministry of Energy (MOE)
is the most important. The MOE owns and controls the coal and power sectors, through 12 companies
and 3 institutes employing a staff of around 128,000. The Institute of Energy provides planning advice
to the MOE. All mining and mining rights are vested with the Government and mining is conducted by
Government companies only. Responsibility for planning, pricing and foreign investment across the
whole economy, including the energy sector, falls under the jurisdiction of three State Committees
which report to the Council of Ministers. With the continued shift towards a market economy, the role
of these committees is changing from prescriptive to market-based planning.
1.19       The Ministry of Heavy Industry (MHI) was formerly deeply involved in oil and gas
production. Petrovietnam, set up in 1989 under the MHI, managed production sharing contracts for the
exploration of hydrocarbon resources, and consists of 14 affiliate companies, including Vietgas
(responsible for developing natural gas resources) and three joint ventures, including VietSovPetro, the
Vietnamese-Russian company responsible for the exploitation of the Bach Ho field.  In 1992,
Petrovietnam was transferred directly under the Prime Minister.



-5-
1.20       The power sector is currently divided into three distinct regional systems each managed by
a separate power company responsible for generation, transmission and distribution - Power Company
No. 1 (PCI) in the North, Power Company No. 2 (PC2) in the South and Power Company No. 3
(PC3) in the Center. In addition to the power companies, there are two Power Investigation and Design
Companies (PIDC1 and 2) which undertake detailed design and construction management of large
power sector projects, and three Power Construction Companies which undertake construction of major
power projects.
1.21       The Government is developing proposals to restructure the power sector to introduce the
flexibility and efficiency that will be needed if the rapid increase in demand is to be met. On January
1, 1995, the Government created the General Company of Electricity of Vietnam, by decree number
562/TTg, dated October 10, 1994, to manage the entire power sector, with MOE, henceforth, playing
a broad policy-making and oversight role. This General Company is an independent juridical entity
with the legal name of Electricity of Vietnam (EVN). The legal charter of EVN laying out the exact
scope of its responsibilities and the organizational boundaries of the power sector entities under it, is ye,
to be defined. Tentative proposals envisage the creation of multiple independent accounting and legal
entities in the core operational areas of generation, transmission and distribution. The existing three
power companies would be unbundled, each company becoming a distribution company, owning and
operating the transmission and distribution systems at 110 kV and lower, as well as small generating
plant, 60 MW and below. Separate distribution companies would be created for power distribution in
Hanoi and HCMC. A Generation Group would be created which would own and control all the larger
generating plant, with a Transmission Group owning and operating all transmission systems at and
above 220 kV. The PIDCs would be free to split off and operate as commercial consulting entities.
WAhile the details remain to be decided, it is encouraging that there is to be organizational separation of
generation, transmission and distribution operations.  This unbundling of the power sector entities
would make them more amenable to future corporatization and commercialization. Also, being a strong
commercially-oriented entity, EVN would be in a position to play an effective role in negotiating and
finalizing BOT contracts.
1.22       The Bank's ESMAP, through a technical study, Power Sector Reform Restructuring, is
assisting the Government in its consideration of various options for restructuring the sector under EVN
(para. 2.27). To assist the Government and EVN in making the transition from the existing power
sector structure to the new structure, IDA would provide additional technical assistance (under Japanese
Grant funding) for Power Sector Institutional Strengthening (para. 4.18). This technical assistance
would focus on the development of appropriate organizational structures, adoption of commnercial
management practices, budget and control systems, reporting procedures and information flows, under
the reformed sector structure. Separately, the ADB proposes to finance a tariff study and a study to
improve financial and accounting systems, while SIDA of Sweden is planning a managerial training
program for power sector staff (para. 2.28).
E. Energy Pricing
1.23       The Govermment's main objectives in setting energy prices are to ensure the financial
viability of the energy entities, to generate surplus funds for the sector to finance a significant part of
the investment program, to set prices at levels that discourage wasteful consumption and, via taxes, to



-6-
raise revenues for the general budget. However, in the electricity sector in particular, fixed assets are
undervalued and depreciation understated due to the lack of modem financial techniques. Therefore,
the estimated financial costs, which tariffs are due to recover, do not reflect the current or future costs
of production. The ADB-financed studies on tariffs and accounting systems in the power sector would
provide the bases for improving the sector's financial performance (para. 2.28).
1.24       Wholesale prices for petroleum products are set by the Council of Ministers based upon
the CIF cost, the exchange rate and anticipated inflation, and a 15 % import tax for gasoline.
Petrolimex, the national distribution agency, may then set retail prices within plus or minus 10% of the
official wholesale price. However, the tax on gasoline may not be collected if Petrolimex's actual
purchase costs of gasoline are sufficiently above the levels anticipated. The level of taxes on petroleum
products are low compared to neighboring countries like Thailand. Both, in the interest of revenue for
the Government and for energy conservation, there is a strong case for higher taxes on petroleum
products.
1.25       Viet Nam has still to lay down prices for natural gas. The economic cost of gas is
estimated to be in the region of US$1.3 per million BTU (MMBTU); however, further studies are
required to establish the gas base, the costs for development and transport and the correct prices for this
resource in various sectors of the economy. The price of gas to the power sector is currently being
considered in the range of US$2.0 to 2.5 per MMBTU, in line with the fuel replacement value.
1.26       Export prices for coal are determined by market forces; the principal constraint facing
Vietnamese exports is the relatively high cost of freight from Vietnamese ports. Domestic prices are
largely set by market forces, subject to minimum sales prices which are set by the Coal Consumers
Association. The minimum prices are set so that the companies producing coal break even, which
means that coal is sold below full cost. Prices for coal to the power sector are determined through
negotiation between the coal producers and the power companies; in doing this, they follow guidelines
laid down by the State Committee on Planning (SCP).
1.27       Electricity tariffs were increased almost two-fold in 1992, with the average tariff reaching
about 4.5 USc/kWh (para. 2.21). In August 1994, a further tariff reform was implemented, with
higher rates for consumption above minimum  levels for residential consumers.  Currently tariffs
average just over 5 USc/kWh. Although the tariff schedule contains peak and off-peak tariffs for
energy, the absence of time-of-day metering, even for the largest consumers, means that these tariffs
cannot be implemented. The Government has indicated that it wishes to raise tariffs in a series of steps
to 7 USc/kWh by 1999. This represents the LRMC (actually, average incremental cost) of electricity
estimated in the Bank's Energy Sector Review. Allowing for modest inflation of the dollar of around
2.5% p.a. over this period, this means that by 1999 tariffs will be around 90% of LRMC, as compared
to 70% at present.
F. Energy Conservation
1.28       The operation of the centrally planned economy, with energy prices substantially below
cost, monopoly state enterprises with little incentive to increase efficiency and the absence of
competitive markets did not encourage energy efficiency. The transition of the economy to a market



-7-
system, with competition in product markets, and pricing energy products closer to their cost will go
some way towards encouraging energy efficiency.  There is therefore considerable scope for
improvements in the efficiency of energy use in Viet Nam. The capital base of the manufacturing
industry is expected to more than double in the next decade; this will provide opportunities for
introducing energy efficiency technologies, provided the correct incentives are in place.  Energy
efficient household appliances will help to ease the burden that the rapid increase in household
electricity demand is expected to place upon the system. especially in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. Viet
Nam's commercial energy-GDP relationship, given its current GDP of US$16 billion and energy
consumption shown in Table 1.1, is US$2 of GDP per kgoe. In comparison, in 1992 Thailand had a
GDP of US$3.1 per kgoe and the Philippines US$2.7 per kgoe. The industrialization of the country
and the switch to commercial fuels would increase energy consumption per unit of GDP, and it is
important that conservation measures, such as Demand Side management (DSM) are introduced now to
moderate the growth in the demand for energy.
1.29       The conservation of energy and end-use efficiency improvements will need to be an
important component of Viet Nam's energy strategy. Efficiency gains can be expected to be derived
from both the supply and demand sides. In the power sector, the older thermal plants consume at least
20% more fuel per kWh of electricity produced than plants in other East Asian countries. Transmission
and distribution losses are in the range of 20% or more, around two to three times the level in the
OECD. The distribution system rehabilitation components of this project will reduce substantially the
level of losses in the cities of Ho Chi Minh, Hue and Nhatrang (paras. 4.6, 4.8, 4.10).
1.30       Although there is a growing awareness within Viet Nam of the utility of energy efficiency
measures, there has not so far been any systematic evaluation of DSM opportunities. A Demand Side
Management study for Viet Nam is being commissioned under the project, with Japanese Grant funding
(para. 4.17).
G. The Environmental Sector
1.31       In 1991, Viet Nam  adopted the National Plan for Environment and Sustainable
Development: A Framework for Action (NPESD). This provides a comprehensive framework for
establishing, over the next 10 years, the necessary policies, institutions, laws, regulations and programs
for addressing environmental issues. In the energy sector, it acknowledges that programs will be
required for environmental impact assessments (EIAs), watershed management, oil spill contingency
planning, air, water and soil pollution, and energy demand management through conservation programs
or legislation such as fuel efficiency standards for vehicles. The Government is preparing a National
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), building on the Bank's report entitled Environmental Program and
Policy Priorities (Report No. 13200-VN), addressing issues related to land use and management,
reforestation and forest/watershed protection, wetlands, coastal and forest protection, urban and
industrial pollution and policy, institutional and regulatory issues.
1.32       Viet Nam has also begun to establish the legal and institutional framework required to
implement environmental management programs.  The Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (DENR) is the Government's main environmental arm. This department is part of the
Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment (MSTE) which was established in October 1992.



-8-
The Law on the Environment identifies key environmental management functions, but does not define
the role and responsibilities of DENR at an operational level. DENR's capacity to perform these
functions remains limited. Within the line agencies, Departments of Science and Technology have been
instructed to add environmental protection to their mandates.  Therefore, the MOE has an
environmental management role; however, in common with the other line agencies, it lacks the staff
with specialized training and experience, and does not yet have the capacity to develop and implement
sector-specific environmental guidelines.
1.33       A Law on Protection of Environment was enacted in December 1993. Amongst other
provisions it: (a) identifies in general terms the responsibilities of the state, organizations and
individuals to prevent and remedy environmental deterioration and pollution; (b) provides for the
development of environmental standards and submission of environmental impact reports on new and
existing facilities and provides for responsible parties to pay compensation for environmental damage;
and (c) calls for civil and criminal penalties for violations. Several other legal initiatives relevant to the
energy sector have been completed or are being developed.  These include the Act of Forestry
Protection and Development (enacted by the National Assembly on August 18, 1991), a key provision
of which requires compensation if environmental disruption occurs, and designates certain areas as
protected forests for hydroelectric watersheds; and the Regulation on Environmental Protection in
Marine Petroleum Operation (enacted September 5, 1990). Waste water guidelines and regulations, and
a Mining Law are currently being enacted. However, the Law does not make clear, for exanple, who
shall be responsible for preparing the EJAs, or which institutions will have the mandate of reviewing
them.
1.34       It is likely that the next two years (1995-1996) would concentrate on the promulgation of
environmental umbrella legislation, institutional capacity building and drafting of specific regulations on
pollution and environmental management. The implementation and enforcement of selected regulations
in high priority areas will follow on from this.
1.35       In the commercial energy sector, high priority areas are watershed management (affecting
hydroelectric resources) and particulate emissions from thermal plant, and surface disruption by coal
mines. Water pollution from site-specific energy industry investments, and air pollution from sulphur
emissions and NO/VOC emissions may have a relatively low priority, yet it is expected that they will
be addressed in the 1997-2001 time horizon primarily because these problems can be handled using
relatively straightforward control technologies.
H. Energy Sector Strategy and Issues
1.36       In its wider program to reform the economy, the Government is moving from price
liberalization measures, which have so far been very successful, to more difficult institutional reforms,
such as restructuring and privatizing state-owned businesses. The Government plans to restructure the
power sector by creating an umbrella entity, i.e. the General Company of Electricity of Vietnam, and
organizationally separating the core power sector operations of generation, transmission, and
distribution. This operational separation in itself represents a fairly significant step in the right
direction. While the structure will still have a single authority over the entire sector, the Government
would gradually need to sequence further reforms especially in the development of a legal and



-9-
regulatory framework that would allow for strong regulatory oversight and greater autonomy and
financial responsibility at the enterprise level. This careful pacing and sequencing of reforms is
particularly important for the power sector which has strong monopolistic characteristics. The studies
under the proposed project (para. 1.22) will not only assist the Government in making these decisions
and in implementing them but will also allow the achievement of broader objectives of introducing
market-oriented mechanisms in all sectors of the economy.
1.37        The demands placed upon the power sector by the pace of economic growth, in particular
in the cities of Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi, are likely to be severe. This makes the reform of the sector to
introduce efficient and flexible management essential. It will also require the mobilization of financial
resources, internally through changes in tariffs and taxes and in the longer-term externally through
foreign direct equity investment and bilateral/multilateral aid and the implementation of an integrated,
least cost development program for the energy sector. This will require that the MOE maintain its
policy making capacity to provide guidance to the sector as a whole.
1.38        As far as pricing of energy products is concerned, there are two issues which are of
importance. The level of duties and taxes on petroleum products is low compared with successful
neighboring economies such as Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. There is considerable scope for the
Government to raise additional revenue for the budget by raising duties, in particular on gasoline and
diesel fuel. This would also have the benefit of dampening the increase in demand for these products.
Secondly, the price of electricity is substantially below LRMC, and currently, most likely, below the
financial requirements of the power sector. The Government's indication that tariffs will be raised to 7
USc/kWh by 1999 is, therefore, welcome. It is important that electricity is correctly priced to send the
right messages to consumers. The introduction of metering to support time of day tariffs, at least for
the largest consumers, and the possible application of seasonal tariffs; will help to achieve this
objective.
1.39        In the coal sector, the Government agencies should move away from operations and focus
more on policy implementation, research and regulation for safety and pollution control. The success
of exports will depend upon the development of modern handling facilities at ports.
1.40        There is already extensive private sector involvement in the petroleum sector, with the
operation by foreign consortia of oil fields within Viet Nam's territorial waters, and the likelihood of
private sector financing for the refinery. The Government's role within this sector should continue to
be at a regulatory and policy-making level. As far as the development of gas resources is concerned,
the policy should be to ensure correct pricing of gas, and ensuring availability of gas to sectors where
it has the highest value; predominantly in the power sector.






Chapter II
The Power Sector
A. Introduction
2.1        Viet Nam's power sector is divided into three distinct regional systems, each managed by
a separate power company responsible for generation, transmission and distribution - Power Company
1 (PCI) in the North, PC2 in the South and PC3 in the Center. PC1, which serves the areas around
Hanoi and Hai Phong (population 34 million) has an installed capacity of about 2,000 MW and a peak
demand of about 1,000 MW. PC2, which serves Ho Chi Minh City and the lower Mekong Delta
region (population 24 million), has an installed capacity of about 1,200 MW and a peak demand of
about 800 MW. PC3, which serves the areas around Danang and Hue (population 10 million) has an
installed capacity of about 250 MW and a peak demand of about 200 MW. The available generating
capacities are well below installed capacities due to poor condition of the thermal plants.
2.2        The North has abundant coal and hydropower resources; in contrast, the South and Center
regions face acute generation deficiencies and require substantial additions of capacity over the near
future. Fuel options for power generation in the south include: (a) off-shore natural gas (until recently
being flared at a great cost to the economy); (b) coal, imported either from the North or from regional
countries; and (c) hydropower, both from the South and from the two other regions. In Central Viet
Nam, the demands are low and the region has a large hydropower potential which can be tapped for the
benefit of both the Center and the South. A 500 kV line linking the three regions has recently been
completed by the Government; this would facilitate interregional power transfers and an integrated
development of the national grid. In parallel with capacity additions, the Government has plans to
improve generation efficiency by rehabilitating existing coal and oil-fired plants and converting turbines
from open-cycle to combined-cycle operation, and from oil to gas firing.
B. The Power Market
The Growth of Electricity Demand in Viet Nam
2.3        Viet Nam has seen a very rapid growth in the demand for electricity over the last decade,
averaging 9.9% p.a. over the period 1981-1993. This is commnensurate with GDP growth of around
7% over the same period. Sales of electricity in 1993, at just over 8,000 Gwh, were treble the levels
of 1981. Growth was slowest in PC1, although it still averaged 8.2% p.a., with sales in PC2 and PC3
growing at 10.0% p.a. and 12.6% p.a., respectively. There was a slowdown in the growth of sales in
PC2 and PC3 in 1990-1992, due to chronic shortages in electricity supply; since these have eased,
growth has accelerated again.
2.4        Table 2.1 compares sales, losses, and peak demand for the three systems for 1993. For
the country as a whole, average technical losses were about 20% of generation and non-technical losses
were about 6 %.

2.5        Sectorally, industry represents the largest consumer (sales of 3,645 Gwh in 1993), with
sales to residential consumers (3,236 Gwh) comparable in size. Both agriculture (430 Gwh) and non-
industrial (696 Gwh), the latter representing transport and service industries, are still relatively small.
Sales to residential consumers grew at 13.7% p.a. over the period 1981-1993, nearly double the growth
rate of sales to industry (which grew at 7.6%).
Forecasts of Electrcity Demand
2.6        Growth in the demand for electricity in Viet Nam will be strongly driven by growth in
GDP. Following annual growth rates of GDP of 5.1 % in 1990, 6.0% in 1991, 8.6% in 1992, 8.1 % in
1993 and a preliminary estimate of 8.0% in 1994, IDA currently expects GDP growth of 8.0% per
annum to be sustainable over the period to 1997 at least. This assumes that domestic savings will reach



-12-
a level of around 17% of GDP by this time, and that the budget deficit stays at around 4% (or less) of
GDP. Longer term growth prospects are less certain, but it is quite feasible that GDP growth through
to the year 2005 would be 7% p.a. or more.
2.7         There have been substantial regional variations in GDP growth. In 1992/93, the Red
River Delta Province, (which includes Hanoi), grew at 4.6%; in comparison, the Central Coast
Province (covering Danang, Hue and Nhatrang) grew at 6.3%, the Southeast grew at 15.4%, and the
Ho Chi Minh City area (part of Southeast province) grew at over 16%. The slowest growing area was
the Northern Uplands Province, which saw an expansion in GDP of 3.1 %. These estimates may not
accurately reflect economic growth as they do not fully take account of private sector activity. If these
trends are continued in the medium term, sales in PC2 will grow fastest, followed by PC3 and PCI.
2.8         The Energy Institute's sales forecasts for each of the power companies are presented in
Table 2.2. These represent a Base Case and a High Case scenario; the Base Case assumes an average
increase of 12.9% p.a. for the country as a whole until the year 2000, the High Case assumes an
average increase of around 14.2% p.a. over the same period. After this period, lower growth of
around 10% is assumed.

/a August, 1994
2.9         The Base Case forecast is likely to be at the top end of what might be achieved, given
expectations of GDP growth and the real price increases for electricity that the Govermnent has stated
that it is willing to impose. Given current tariff levels, an increase in average tariffs to 7 USc/kWh by
1999 corresponds to an average annual increase of 5% over the next five years. Assuming a GDP
growth of 8% p.a., the apparent income elasticity of electricity demand would have to equal 1.5 (or
more) to generate an average annual increase in sales in excess of 12%. This is at the upper level of
what could be expected in a fast growing developing country over a short period of time. A sales
growth of 14% p.a. (as in the High Case) would most likely require a double digit growth of GDP. In
the longer run, a lower income elasticity - for example around 1.5 - might be expected to hold.



-13-
However, assuming no real price increases, a growth in sales in the range of 10% or more could be
achieved if GDP growth exceeded 7% p.a.; this is consistent with the Base Case forecasts assumption
for the longer term.
2.10       A useful check on these demand forecasts is a comparison against countries in the region
which have experienced similar rates of growth. Both Thailand and Malaysia have seen very rapid
growth in GDP and, correspondingly, in electricity consumption. In Thailand, over the period 1983 to
1993, electricity consumption increased by 12.4% p.a. compared to GDP growth of 8.6% p.a.; the
years 1988 to 1990 saw growth in consumption of as high as 15% p.a., driven by GDP growth rates in
excess of 12%. In Malaysia, the period 1965-1985 saw an increase in electricity consumption of 12%
p.a. on average. Over roughly the same period, GDP increased by 7% p.a.. This suggests that, in the
medium term, assuming GDP growth is in the region of 8% p.a., Viet Nam could expect to achieve
growth in electricity consumption of 12% p.a.; however, it is likely to be damped somewhat over the
next five years since tariffs are expected to increase significantly in real terms.
2.11       In the fastest growing parts of the economy - such as HCMC - the demand for electricity
can be expected to grow faster than that predicted for the economy as a whole. Forecasts of sales
growth for this area are in the range of 18% p.a. on average for the period 1995 to 2000. This accords
with forecast GDP growth in the region of 13% - 15% p.a..
C. Generation and Transmission Facilities
2.12       Annexes 1 and 2, respectively, provide a detailed listing of generation and transmission
facilities for each of PC2 and PC3.
Generation
2.13       Total installed generating capacity in the country is approximately 3,500 MW, of which
PCI has 2,000 MW and PC2 1,200 MW. In the northern region, the completion of the Hoa Binh
hydroelectric plant (1,920 MW and 8,400 Gwh) means that there is now substantial excess capacity; the
three large coal-fired steam generation plants in the region (Pha Lai, Nin Binh and Uong Bi) are
operating at well below 50% of their rated capacities. These plants are of Soviet and Chinese origin,
and are located near anthracite mines. All these plants are in relatively poor condition, due to the
quality of the design, dearth of spare parts, inadequate control systems and poor maintenance. Peak
demand in PCI, at 1,000 MW, is well below installed capacity, although allowance has to be made for
exports to PC2 and PC3 of around 400 MW and the low availability on some of the older thermal units.
2.14       The commissioning of the 500 kV  North-South-Center link has created a single
Vietnanese power grid and has for the time being ended the chronic energy shortages that the South
and Center had been suffering. PC2 anticipates importing 20% of its power requirements through the
link in 1994, rising to 33% in 1995. Unlike the North, the South and Center have suffered from a
deficit in generation, shortages in power being especially critical during the dry season when
hydropower energy is low. The major hydro site in this region is Tri An (400 MW); the Vinh Son (66
MW) and Thac Mo (150 MW) hydro-electric plants are to be commissioned shortly. There are two
principal fuel-oil fired thermal generating stations in the south (Thu Duc, 165 MW, and Can Tho, 33



-14-
MW). New combustion turbines have been added to both Thu Duc (2 x 37.5 MW) and Ba Ria (5 x
37.5 MW). A gas pipeline, from the Bach Ho field, would be laid to the Ba Ria site by mid 1995 (and
will be extended to Thu Duc by early 1996), allowing these turbines to be operated on gas. Despite
these additions, there would be insufficient generating capacity to provide a firm backup to the 500 kV
link (which is single circuit) and therefore the South and Center can expect to suffer from at least
temporary power shortages when the link is inoperative.
Transmission and Distribution
2.15       Viet Nam's transmission and distribution systems are based on multifarious standards and
are old and unreliable, with losses of well over 20% (see Table 2.1). There is an urgent need to
rehabilitate and strengthen the networks to reduce technical losses, improve reliability and thereby
reduce outages, and serve the forecast increases in demand. In PC3's major urban areas such as
Danang, Hue and Nhatrang, 6 kV is the most significant distribution voltage, but in addition there are
some 15 kV and 35 kV networks; some of the 6 kV network was originally designed for operation at
3.3 kV. In HCMC two MV networks (15 kV and 6.6 kV) serve the city. The Government has decided
to standardize the distribution voltages at 0.4 kV and 20 kV for the whole country; there will be a
gradual process of upgrading the country's networks. The proposed project will help to modernize the
networks and achieve these objectives in some of the important cities of Viet Nam.
2.16       As far as EHV and HV transmission are concerned, the commissioning of the 500 kV link
(1,440 km long) represents the first step in the construction of a national grid. Prior to this, there were
two separate interconnected grids in the country, operating at 220/230 kV, 110 kV and 66 kV, with a
total circuit length of about 5,500 km. The development of a national link underscores the need for
modern national and regional dispatch centers and communications systems (para. 4.11).
D. Viet Nam's Power Development Plan
2.17       The Government's objectives for the development of the power sector are: (a) exploitation
of the vast hydropower potential of the country; (b) improvement of supply side efficiency through
reduction of losses in energy conversion, transmission and distribution; (c) promotion of foreign
investments; and (d) increasing the availability of electricity in rural areas.  In line with these
objectives, the Energy Institute has developed a generation expansion schedule, using the ENPEP
model.
2.18       Under this plan there will be a substantial addition of hydro capacity (Vinh Sohn, Song
Hinh, Yali, Dai Ninh and Pley Krong) and of gas-fired combined cycle capacity (Phu My and others).
There is also expected to be development of coal-fired capacity in the north, at Pha Lai and, later, at
Quang Ninh. A total of 2,391 MW is expected to be added by 2,000 and 5,895 MW by 2005. The
plan was developed using the Base Case demand forecast (see Table 2.2), and a planning criteria of
Loss of Load Probability (LOLP) of about 3 days per year.
2.19       Associated with this, it is expected that about 1,440 km of 220 kV lines, 2,070 km of 110
kV lines, 1,376 MVA of 220/110 kV transformer capacity and 2,235 MVA of 110 kV/MV transformer
capacity will be added to the system. Additional capacity on the 500 kV interconnector is expected to



-15-
coincide with the commissioning of the Yali project. The development of the large Son La scheme
(2,400 MW), which is planned for the period after 2005, would require a further upgrading of the link.

2.20        Table 2.4 shows forecasts of the power balance for PCI, PC2 and PC3, for selected years
(the most important dimension as far as medium term planning for the power sector is concerned). It
shows that, despite the addition of generating capacity envisaged under the plan, PC2 and PC3 would
face shortages in generating capacity, and will not have sufficient reserve to back up the 500 kV link.
The correct pricing of power at peak times may help to reduce the incidence of power shortages at
peak. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower would, on an annual basis, furnish to
IDA for its review and comments: (a) a review of the implementation of its power development
program during the preceeding 12 months; and (b) its proposed implementation program for the next
five years, and thereafter carry out the power development program taking into account IDA's
comments.
E. Electricity Tariffs
2.21        Existing tariff levels are provided in Annex 3. Tariffs were rationalized and raised almost
two-fold in March 1992; higher charges during the dry season were introduced for consumption above
set levels, and special tariffs were introduced for foreigners and partially or wholly owned foreign
companies. In August 1994, tariffs were raised to an average of D530/kWh, or just over 5 USc/kWh,
from a level of approximately D450/kWh. With the easing of power shortages in the South and Center,
the higher stepped tariffs during the dry season in these regions were removed, and tariffs were
increased in overall terms. The LRMC of electricity was estimated in 1993 to be in the range of 7



-16-
USc/kWh and the government has expressed its commitment to increasing tariffs to this level.
Assuming relatively low levels of inflation (around 2.5%) in US$ terms, by 1999 tariffs will be
approximately 90% of LRMC, as compared to 70% at present.

2.22         Tariffs are currently uniform across Viet Nam. Industrial consumers face a tariff schedule
that has average, peak and off-peak tariffs, with peak rates being well over double the off-peak rates.
Unfortunately, few, if any, of these customers have time of day metering, and therefore this tariff
schedule cannot be applied. The introduction of these meters, for appropriate consumers, will be an
important step in establishing a cost reflective tariff that will provide incentives for conservation of
energy at peak times. The ADB is funding a tariff study to assist in the development of an appropriate
tariff policy, based on appropriate financial and social objectives (see Annex 7).
2.23         The present tariff structure broadly reflects the differences in costs associated with voltage
level and type of consumer. Therefore, charges to industrial consumers are highest for those supplied
at 6 kV or below, and lowest for those supplied at voltages above 20 kV. There is a subsidy element
in the Residential category: consumers face a rising block tariff, with the lowest block (up to 150 kWh
per month) being priced at D450/kWh, and the highest block (above 250 kWh) priced at D800/kWh.
The tariffs to  commercial customers are substantially above anything paid by other consumers



-17-
(D900/kWh against D550/kWh for LV industrial consumers and D800/kWh for the higher-rate
residential consumers). It is likely that residential consumers will be contributing proportionately more
to the peak than commnercial consumers do, suggesting that this difference is not cost reflective. In
addition, there is a tariff schedule for foreign customers (both business and residential), with tariffs
above the estimated LRMC  of 7 USc/kWh.  The existence of "wholesale electricity vendors",
particularly in rural areas, who buy electricity from the power companies and resell it, metered through
submeters, to small customers, is quite prevalent. The prices the vendors charge are considerably
higher than the official tariffs, ranging as high as Dl,000/kWh. The number of submeters is quite
substantial and, in the case of PC3, by far higher than the total of all its customers. The high prices
charged suggest that the willingness-to-pay for electricity is well above current tariff levels.
2.24        The main reform required at present is an increase in the average rate of the tariff, to
reflect to consumers the true cost of electricity supply. To improve the accuracy of the price signals
sent through the tariffs, the Government should consider: (a) introduction of metering to allow peak and
off-peak tariffs to be charged to large consumers; (b) introduction of demand charges for larger
consumers; and (c) increasing the level of tariffs charged to residential consumers, at least for
consumption over the minimum block. so that the higher rates are at least equivalent to that charged to
comnmercial consumers. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower would, on an annual
basis, furnish to IDA a review of the policy and levels of its electricity tariffs, including proposed
adjustments to meet the objectives of the power development program, and thereafter implement
proposed adjustments taking into account IDA's comments.
F. Sector Strategy
Sector Reform and Restructuring
2.25        The Government is developing proposals to restructure the power sector to introduce the
flexibility and efficiency that will be needed if the rapid increase in demand is to be met. On January
1, 1995, the Governnent created the General Company of Electricity of Vietnam, by decree number
562/TTg, dated October 10, 1994, to manage the entire power sector, with MOE, henceforth, playing
a broad policy-making and oversight role. This General Company is an independent juridical entity
with the legal name of Electricity of Vietnam (EVN). The legal charter of EVN laying out the exact
scope of its responsibilities and the organizational boundaries of the power sector entities under it, is yet
to be defined. Tentative proposals envisage the creation of multiple independent accounting and legal
entities in the core operational areas of generation, transmission and distribution. The existing three
power companies would be unbundled, each company becoming a distribution company, owning and
operating the transmission and distribution systems at 110 kV and lower, as well as small generating
plant, 60 MW and below. Separate distribution companies would be created for power distribution in
Hanoi and HCMC. A Generation Group would be created which would own and control all the larger
generating plant, with a Transmission Group owning and operating all transmission systems at and
above 220 kV.
2.26        In November 1993, the Government issued a decree on Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT)
contracts, designed to facilitate the introduction of this style of project into Viet Nam. The particular
emphasis was on infrastructure, including power. The regulations, amongst other aspects, seek to



-18-
define the terms and conditions under which BOT companies can be established, the taxation that such
projects will attract, and a guarantee regarding conversion of local currency into foreign expenditure.
Several BOT proposals for power generation are currently under Government's consideration.
2.27       IDA would be assisting the Government in the identification of an appropriate long term
structure for the power sector under EVN through a Power Sector Reform and Restructuring study to
be conducted by ESMAP (para.4.3).  This technical assistance is designed to assist the Government
and EVN in making the transition from the existing power sector structure to the new structure. This
effort is based on the principles of: (a) improving the operational efficiency of the sector; (b)
commercialization and corporatization of the constituent operations to provide greater managerial and
financial autonomy; (c) developing an appropriate legal and regulatory framework that would allow for
greater enterprise autonomy and requisite government regulatory oversight; and (d) a financially viable
and open sector structure that allows for increased private involvement in financing sector expansion.
2.28       In addition, IDA and other donors are planning to assist the Vietnamese in institutional
strengthening of the power sector. Funds would be provided under Japanese Grant Facility to help in
power sector institutional strengthening (para. 4.19). This technical assistance would focus on the
development of appropriate organizational structures, adoption of commercial management practices,
budget and control systems, reporting procedures and information flows, under the reformed sector
structure. The ADB is proposing to finance a study to improve financial and accounting systems, and
a second on tariffs; SIDA of Sweden is planning a managerial training program. Agreement was
reached at negotiations that the Borrower would furnish to IDA for its review and comments: (a) the
findings of the ADB sponsored Accounting and Tariff studies; and (b) its proposals for the
implementation of the studies' recommendations, and thereafter implement said proposals taking into
account IDA's comments.
Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement
2.29       There have been no previous IDA operations in the power sector in Viet Nam. However,
IDA has very recently been involved in the resettlement process in its Highway Rehabilitation Project
and the lessons learned from this project in regard to defining project affected persons and the legal
framework for resettlement and compensation have been drawn upon in preparing the proposed project.
Lessons from other power projects that are pertinent to this project are: (a) the need for thorough
investigations in the preparation of technologically complex components. This project is technically
straightforward in as much as the technologies of the various components are fairly straightforward and
familiar to the Vietnamese; where more complex technology is involved (load dispatch centers) adequate
foreign consulting assistance has been and will be availed of; (b) the need for care in preparing the cost
estimates; adequate contingencies have been provided in the project; and (c) the need to strengthen the
implementation capabilities of the institutions. While the concerned Vietnamese institutions are
technically capable of implementing the project documents, they need considerable assistance in
preparing bidding documents, bid evaluations and progress reports. This has been taken care of by
providing expatriate consulting assistance for assisting the Vietnamese in managing each project
component.
Rationale for IDA's Involvement
2.30       The Bank's Energy Sector Investment and Policy Review for Viet Nam (Report No.
10842-VN), has been instrumental in identifying the issues and options facing the energy sector and in



-19-
assisting the Government in developing its first least-cost power development plan. Viet Nam's need for
investment in the power sector is large. While IDA could finance only a fraction of its investment
program, its participation in the sector would help catalyze funds from other bilateral and multilateral
sources. The Government is committed to reforming state enterprises and moving from centrally
planned to market-oriented mechanisms. For the power sector, this would involve a staged process of
transition; first strengthening the existing institutions, then commercializing and corporatizing them and
subsequently introducing reforms and a regulatory framework conducive to private sector participation.
IDA's assistance in this effort would make a major contribution to an orderly development of the
sector. Finally, involvement of IDA in the early stages of development is expected to have a significant
influence on the optimum use of limited resources in fostering efficiency and conservation and an
environmentally sustainable development.
2.31       The project is consistent with IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (Report No. 13545-VN,
September 26, 1994) which proposes working with the Government to continuously update its
development plan, taking account of changing economic conditions; to improve efficiency of electricity
utilization through proper pricing and conservation; and to strengthen power agencies through technical
assistance and training.
2.32       The policies and programs pursued by the Government in the power sector are in
compliance with IDA's policies and guidelines for commitment to efficiency improvement (including
demand-side management and energy conservation), sector reform and restructuring, moving towards
commercialization and corporatization, and encouraging private participation.



Chapter m
The Beneficiaries
A. The Beneficiaries
3.1        The beneficiaries of the proposed credit are: (a) the Ministry of Energy (MOE) for the
National Load Dispatch Center and the National Training Center; (b) Power Company No. 2 (PC2) for
HCMC distribution, the Southern Region Load Dispatch Center, the Southern Region Training Center
and the Ba Ria combined cycle project; and (c) Power Company No. 3 (PC3) for Hue and Nhatrang
distribution, the Central Region Load Dispatch Center, the Central Region Training Center, the 220kV
Krongbuk-Nhatrang line and Krongbuk and Nhatrang substatior,, and the 110 kV substations of
Nhatrang, Cau Do and Lien Tri.
B. Organization and Management
MIinisty of Energy
3.2        The Ministry of Energy (MOE) is responsible for the production, distribution and supply
of electricity and coal. The MOE discharges these responsibilities through several wholly-owned
subsidiaries (Chart 1) under its supervision: the Institutes of Mine and Energy, the PCs No. I (North),
No. 2 (South) and No. 3 (Central), the Power Investigation and Design Companies No. I (North) and
No. 2 (South), the Coal Cornpanies in Cam Pha, Hon Gai and Uong Bi, and the Power Construction
Companies Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Electricity production, distribution and supply is carried out through the
three PCs. Following the creation of EVN on January 1, 1995 (para. 1.21), all entities connected with
the power sector come under its management with MOE retaining a broad policy-making and oversight
role.
3.3        The EVN is currently engaged in drafting its charter that would lay out the exact scope of
its responsibilities and the organizational boundaries of the power sector entities under it (para. 1.21).
To the extent that these organizational changes will affect the implementation responsibilities for the
proposed project, it will be necessary for the Government to define its financial and operational
objectives for the member enterprises and discuss and agree with IDA on appropriate modifications to
the legal arrangements for the project (including appropriate financial and other conditionalities), both
for ensuring satisfactory implementation of the project and for monitoring the operations of the power
sector. Agreement was reached at negotiations that any organizational changes in the power sector, in
so far as they impact on the terms and conditions of the credit, would be discussed between IDA and
the Borrower.
Power Company No. 2
3.4        Organization. PC2 was established as a juridical entity in 1976 (Annex 4) as the "Power
Company of the South", succeeding the "General Department of Power". In 1981 under Resolution
No. 15-DL/TCCB3 its name was changed to Power Company No. 2. Like all SOEs, PC2 had to re-



-21-
register under Resolution No. 388-HDBT in 1991. Resolution No 147-TTG of April 7, 1993
reestablished PC2 with a Capital of Dong 3,831,204 million and PC2 registered under Registration
Certificate No 102618, dated April 23, 1993. PC2 is wholly owned by the Government, and in many
respects has the characteristics of a government department, reporting to the Government through the
MOE. PC2 operates its own bank accounts and can borrow both local and foreign funds. Foreign
borrowing, however, requires the approval of the Government through the State Bank of Viet Nam.
3.5        PC2, headquartered in HCMC, is responsible for power generation, transmission and
distribution throughout the south of the country. Its area of 19 provinces covers Lam Dong and Thuan
Hai in the north and reaches across the Mekong delta in the south, including the province of Minh Hai.
At the end of 1993, PC2 had an installed capacity of 1,358 MW, generating 4,661 Gwh. In 1993 it
had total sales of 3,646 Gwh and served a population of 25.6 million.
3.6        The organization of PC2 is structured along functional lines and is shown in Chart 2. It is
headed by a Director General assisted by four Deputy Directors General for: production, technical
matters, construction supervision, and economics; and a Chief Accountant. The Director General, the
Deputy Directors General and all officials responsible for an "account" (management of funds), i.e. the
heads of power stations and regional offices, are appointed by MOE, while department directors at
headquarters are appointed by the Director General. While PC2's organizational structure appears to
fulfill its current operational needs, it would need to be carefully reviewed in the light of prospective
reforms in the power sector.
3.7        On the whole, PC2's management and staff are technically competent. As of 1993, it had
a total staff of 11,180 of which 1,240 comprise engineers and other university level employees, 645
middle level employees, and 5,323 technicians. The rest are lower level semi-skilled workers. With a
staffing ratio of eight employees per installed MW, the company has the same ratio as for the Thai
power sector. By the end of 1993, PC2 had a total of 736,658 customers of which 655,722 were
classified as residential, 41,330 as industrial, 4,421 as agricultural, 34,475 as commercial and 710 as
"transport customers" (airports, etc.). In addition, there were a considerable number of sub-consumers.
PC2 has about 65 customers per staff which is low, when compared to a figure of about 120 for
Thailand. Significant improvements should be possible in PC2's performance figures over time.
3.8        Operation. Maintenance and Store Keeping.  PC2's operation and plant maintenance
standards and practices are satisfactory. With dramatic shortages of funds and very unreliable spare
part supplies, PC2 has maintained a reasonable standard of operational quality. Plant and warehouses
are meticulously kept and materials and supply are properly recorded. Major maintenance is done by
contractors while routine maintenance is done by company staff. Transmission lines are inspected
routinely and in accordance with fixed schedules. PC2's operations show technical and non-technical
losses of about 20% and 3%, respectively.
Power Company No. 3
3.9        Organization. PC3 was established in 1975 (Annex 4) following a takeover from the
French company of SIPEA. The legal basis, ownership and other institutional features of PC3 are
similar to those of PC2.
3.10       PC3, headquartered in Danang serves the central part of Viet Nam covering a total of 11
provinces, from Quang Binh to Dac Lac and Khanh Hoa, and serves a population of about 11 million.



-22-
At the end of 1993, PC3 had an installed capacity of 214 MW and had substantial power purchases
from PCI and PC2. With the exception of 20 MW in hydro power and 14 MW in gas turbines, PC3's
generating capacity consists of small diesel stations, mostly in isolated areas. In 1993 it generated 255
Gwh; imported 443 Gwh from PCI, 159 Gwh from PC2, and 3 Gwh from larang II, a small MOE-
owned hydro station.
3.11        Chart 3 shows PC3's organizational set-up which conforms with the other power
companies in Viet Nam. PC3's management and staff are technically competent. Of its total staff of
5,875 in 1993, 1,526 are engineers, other university level staff (accountants, computer specialists, etc.),
technicians and draftsmen, 540 are administrative staff, and 3,809 are lower level semi-skilled workers.
By the end of 1993, PC3 had a total of 158,000 customers of which about 6,350 were classified as
industrial, 920 as agricultural, 130,000 as domestic and about 20,730 as others. PC3 employs about 27
staff per MW and has 103 customers per staff. These figures compare unfavorably with those of PC2
and can only partially be explained by the small size and vastly outstretched nature of its operations.
Significant improvements should be possible in these performance figures over time.
3.12        PC3's supply area also includes a large number of "wholesale electricity vendors" or sub-
consumers, particularly in villages, who buy electricit) from PC3 for sale to small customers through
sub-meters. A study carried out by PC3 in 1993 indicated that in addition to PC3's 158,000 regular
customers, there were about 450,000 sub-consumers who pay much more'' than the official tariff
(para. 2.23).
3.13        Operation, Maintenance and Store Keeping.  PC3 conducts regular maintenance of its
plants and warehouses and properly records its supplies. Its transmission lines are inspected at regular
intervals.  However, while the standards observed for major maintenance are reasonable, further
improvements are possible.  Technical losses, including both transmission and generation losses,
amount to about 18% while non-technical losses are about 7% of electricity produced. PC3 would need
to exercise stricter control on its operations to reduce non-technical losses down to about 3 % as planned
by the Govermnent. Agreement was reached at negotiations that PC3 would prepare and implement an
action plan, satisfactory to IDA, for progressively reducing its non-technical losses to a level of 3%.
C. Staff Development and Training
3.14        The training centers of PC2 and PC3 were originally part of the Vietnamese educational
system.   While they are now  under the control of the PCs, they still operate as national
technical/vocational schools and are staffed and equipped for that role rather than for power sector
oriented training. Consequently, their efforts tend to focus on technical education, rather than on
training for the PCs' needs. PC2's training center is the Hocmon College which was built in 1960 and
operated until 1976 by the Education Ministry. The center's role is to provide initial training in power
plant and transmission/distribution for technicians and skilled electrical workers. The training facilities
I/ The sub-charges, which range from D 450 to D 1.000. is further broken down as follows: (a) 31% of sub-consumers paying
D 450 to D 550/kWh; (b) 50% of sub-consumers paying D 550 to D 800/kWh; and (c) 19% of sub-consumers paying D 800 to
D 1,000/kWh.



-23-
are poor and inadequate. The training courses, which are provided on request and tend to be of long
duration, seem to be as extensive as these limited facilities allow. PC3's training center in Hoi-An is
similar to that of other PC training centers in Viet Nam. Equipment for practical training is virtually
non-existent and the training network is inadequate.
3.15       The MOE and the PCs are committed to a program of major upgrading of staff skills,
which is essential if the PCs are able to manage new and sophisticated plants and systems. With
investments under the proposed project, the training departments of PC2 and PC3, would acquire the
capability and resources to supply the required training services (para. 4.13).
D. Billing and Collection
3.16       PC2 and PC3 operate a decentralized billing and collection system through their district
offices. The role of the head office consists of monitoring, collecting and processing of records through
a central computer arrangement where invoices are prepared. Billing and collection are undertaken on
a monthly basis for all customers. Meter readings are done manually and transferred to account cards
in each district office. Personal computers are routinely employed in the districts permitting the
transfer of information to headquarters through diskettes. The billing and collection policy of PC2 is
satisfactory (see Annex 5 for details). The collection performance of PC2 is relatively strong and
comparable with the performance of Thai utilities, holding arrears to about 52 days on average.
3.17       Because of the nature of PC3's market, its accounts receivables at the end of 1993 stood at
D385 billion, equal to about 464 days of sales. About D30 billion in arrears were mostly owned by the
agricultural sector. While PC3's policy is such that an account becomes past due after three months in
arrears, the Government allows them to write-off arrears by way of Government fund transfers. The
latest write-off was done in February 1994 when about D300 million was transferred to PC3 from the
budget. Some of PC3's accounts are not collectable, in particular, farners suffering from poor harvest
but who continue to be provided electricity, and for them, the Government has set aside funds for their
arrears. PC3 needs to bring down the level of its receivables considerably. Agreement was reached at
negotiations that PC3 will prepare and implement an action plan, satisfactory to IDA, to reduce its
receivables. On and after December 31, 1996, its net receivables (after provision for bad debts) should
not be more than four months of sales revenue.
E. Accounting System and Procedures
3.18       The present financial and accounting systems of PC2 and PC3 are inadequate. Prior to
1990, the power subsector operated under the accounting system of centrally-planned economies. In
1990, the system was abandoned and one based on the French accounting standards was introduced
countrywide. However, the modifications to the system, which were specifically aimed at tight
government control, resulted in an unusual accounting system with the following features:
(a)   separate books and accounts are maintained for the construction and operation functions of
the PCs; no consolidated accounts are kept that provide an overall financial picture;



-24-
(b)   official year-end financial statements are not produced and the accounts are not routinely
reconciled, casting doubt on their reliability;
(c)   cash flow statements are non-existent, making it difficult to assess the PCs' cash positions,
allocations of net income, and the extent of Government contributions by way of equity,
subsidies and grants. This information is particularly significant as unusual fund transfers
occur to the Govermnent, by way of regular depreciation charges, and from the
Government by way of budget allocations;
(d)   values of fixed assets are distorted. Upon unification of Viet Nam, the PCs' assets were
valued using standard unit prices, which was typical of the system used by many centrally-
planned economies. These asset values remained on the PCs' books at cost without regard
for the general development of the economy and inflation. After minor adjustments were
made in 1981, 1985 and 1989, a nationwide asset revaluation exercise was decreed in
1990 for all industries using the following parameters: (i) Ruble 1 = D2,400 for assets
procured from the formner Soviet Block; and (ii) US$1 = D2,400 for assets procured
abroad elsewhere. A second nationwide revaluation was undertaken in January 1992 using
the following rates of exchange: (i) Ruble 1 = D110,000 for all assets procured from the
former Soviet Block; and (ii) US$1 = D10,000 for assets procured abroad elsewhere.
Revaluing assets by equating the US dollar to the Russian Ruble is misleading, as the
value of the dollar in relation to the ruble at that time was US$1 = Ruble 100. In
summnary, because of the various accounting actions that have taken place in the valuation
of assets, it is not possible to state definitely whether the assets.are properly valued;
(e)   accounts are kept on a cash and not on an accrual basis;
(f)   depreciation is treated unconventionally, by separating depreciation into regular and
"Major Maintenance".  Currently, regular depreciation charges are remitted to the
Government in cash (except on assets financed by the PCs' own funds) while Major
Maintenance depreciation charges are retained by the PCs. In addition, there are no fixed
depreciation charges; the Government allows variations in the yearly depreciation rates in
order to adjust final financial results. The Government also permits the depreciation of
written-off assets. However, starting 1995, this requirement of separating and remitting
depreciation charges will be discontinued (para 5.9);
(g)   certain expense items such as staff bonuses, staff benefits and office maintenance,
normally recorded in the income statement, are booked as a cash outflow transaction. As
a result, net income is overstated by about 50% on average; and
(h)  land is not valued as only the Government can own land;
3.19       In the context of its upcoming Power Distribution Rehabilitation Project, ADB proposed to
finance a consulting study, "Improvement of Financial and Accounting Systems of the Power
Companies in Viet Nam" (Annex 6), aimed at introducing a modem accounting and management
information system. The Japanese Grant Facility is assisting in carrying out a study aimed at improving
and modernizing the conmmercial systems and institutional strengthening of the power sector (para.
4.19). These studies are crucial for assisting the Government in implementing the important aspects of
its Program of Economic Reforms, and for the PCs in introducing modem financial practices. The



-25-
ADB study is estimated to take about 10 months and should be available late in 1995 or early 1996
while the JGF-assisted study is expected to be completed by the end of 1995.
3.20       Until a major improvement in the accounting system is implemented, it is important to
introduce the following changes: (a) to provide an overall financial picture, consolidate the accounts of
both operation and construction divisions; (b) implement an accrual basis of accounting; (c) discontinue
the depreciation of written-off assets; (d) apply a single depreciation rate for normal depreciation
charges; (e) write off obsolete stock; (f) to reflect actual profits and losses, record all expense items in
the income statement, particularly those that apply to staff bonuses, staff benefits, and office
maintenance; and (g) make adequate annual provision for doubtful debts. Agreement was reached
during negotiations that PC2 and PC3 would introduce the above changes to the accounting system
starting with the financial year 1995.
F. Financial Management and Reporting
3.21       The management practices pursued in PC2 and PC3 are outdated. The existing reporting
system has evolved primarily in response to the Government's external reporting requirements and is
used by the Government for strict monitoring of the PCs. A functional management reporting system
would be difficult to implement despite the new accounting regulations introduced in 1991. A main
drawback of this system, as far as interpreting the financial statements of PC2 and PC3 is concerned, is
that the statements do not focus on financial performance; for example, it-is impossible to calculate a
rate of return on capital invested or any other meaningful operating ratio. The ADB and JGF-financed
studies (para. 3.19) will address this issue and should help the PCs introduce modem financial
practices.
3.22       The accounting staff of PC2 and PC3 are competent, and carry out their tasks of account
keeping and reporting in accordance with the requirements of the Government. The competence of the
accounting staff of both companies should considerably facilitate the introduction of accounting reforms.
The position of the Chief Financial Officer/Chief Accountant within higher management is either
unclear or does not receive due recognition in PC2 and PC3. In PC2, for instance, the incumbent is
subordinate to the Deputy Director of Economics, as far as accounting is concerned, but reports directly
to the Director General in its capacity as Chief Financial Officer. A similar structure exists in PC3.
The arrangement reportedly did not create problems in the past, because in a centrally-planned
economy, the financial activities of PC2 and PC3 were basically confined to bookkeeping, while
financial planning and investment finance were left to the Government as and when required. With the
expected rapid expansion of the power subsector and decentralized financial decision-making transferred
to PC2 and PC3, the position of Chief Financial Officer/Chief Accountant will be crucial, and will need
to be reviewed.
G. Taxes and Insurance
3.23        PC2 and PC3 are subject to the following major taxes: (a) tax on revenues (turnover tax),
levied at 8% of power sales (net of inter-PC sales), and 4%  on other revenues; (b) environmental



-26-
charge (royalty), levied at 2% on the use of water for hydro generation and calculated on the basis of
the PCs' share of revenues from power sales generated from hydro against total generation; (c) tax on
capital, levied at 2.4% of plant in service, less accumulated depreciation and assets financed from the
PCs' own funds, plus working capital; and (d) income tax on net profit, at the rate of 25% as of
September 1993, down from the 30% level of August 1993.
3.24       It has been the Government's practice to reduce the tax rates or even eliminate certain
taxes of PC2 and PC3 completely if the tax charge would result in unfavorable financial outcome for
these PCs.
3.25       In accordance with the general practice followed in Viet Nam, PC2 and PC3 do not carry
any insurance protection for buildings and their contents and for other assets. Nor do they carry any
third party liability insurance. Agreement was reached during negotiations that PC2 and PC3 would
make provisions, satisfactory to IDA, for insurance against such risks and in such amounts consistent
with appropriate practice.
H. The Budget Process
3.26       The existing budget process is designed to support applications by the PCs for funds from
the Government Budget and to provide the Government with a tool to exercise tight financial control.
The PCs' annual accounts at the close of the budget year are considered "closed" only when the
Government, through its auditing process, "approves" the accounts. The budget process also lacks
flexibility. For instance, at the beginning of the budget year, the PCs budget fuel expenses on the basis
of average hydrological conditions. However, should the availability of water during the dry season be
less favorable than anticipated, the shortfall has to be financed from the PCs' own resources, often
through expensive short-term borrowing from local banks, because additional budget funds are not
made available to them. The budget process would need to be critically reviewed under the proposed
Power Sector Institutional Strengthening study (para. 4.18).
I. Audit
3.27       There is no independent external audit of Government entities in Viet Nam. In 1991 the
Government considered establishing an "independent" audit process for SOEs and in the process created
the Viet Nam Auditing Company (VACO). VACO, with three offices in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and
Danang, was created by Government Decree No. 165. TC/QD/TCCB on May 13, 1991. It was created
as a dependent body of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and cannot therefore be considered an
independent auditing firm. However, in a joint venture with a reputable international firm, VACO
audits would be acceptable to IDA. The Govermnent has granted several foreign accounting firms
licenses to operate as independent auditors in Viet Nam. There are currently four independent auditing
firms operating in Viet Nam.
3.28       So far, the annual financial statements of PC2 and PC3, which are not published, have not
been audited by independent auditors and the PCs do not have internal auditing departments. Their



-27-
audits, however, are routinely audited by auditing teams of the MOF and MOE. This audit, which is
also used by the MOF to determine tax liabilities, is usually conducted within one month of submission
of the PCs' annual financial statements. In addition, Government staff carries out controls on special
problems. Realizing that a full conventional and commercial audit by the Government is difficult to
perform prior to upgrading the entire accounting system, and in order to assist PC2 and PC3 to
familiarize themselves with the principles of modem accounting systems, agreement was reached at
negotiations that the Borrower, PC2 and PC3 will appoint independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The
audit report would be made available to IDA within nine months after the close of each financial year.



Chapter IV
The Project
A. Objectives and Description
4.1        The main objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) assist the Government in
optimizing its investment decisions and help meet demand growth; (b) help improve the efficiency of
the power supply system by: (i) rehabilitating and reinforcing transmission and distribution systems; (ii)
converting generating plants from open to combined cycle operation; and (iii) installing modem load
dispatch centers; (c) strengthen the planning, administrative and management capabilities of the power
companies through technical assistance and training; (d) rationalize and strengthen the training systems
for the power sector; and (e) assist in the review of issues and options in the promotion of electricity
energy efficiency and demand side management. Also, in association with the project, the Bank's
ESMAP would be assisting the Government in examining the issues and options in reforming the power
sector through a study entitled "Power Sector Reform and Restructuring".
Project Description
4.2        The proposed project would finance priority investments in the power systems of Southern
and Central Viet Nam falling under the jurisdictions of PC2 and PC3, respectively. Its components
include: (a) for PC2: (i) rehabilitation and reinforcement of the distribution system in HCMC; (ii)
conversion of three 37.5 MW open cycle turbines to a 170 MW combined cycle unit at Ba Ria; (iii)
establishment of the Southern Region Load Dispatch Center; (iv) establishment of the Southern Region
Training Center; (v) resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected by components a (i) and a
(ii); and (vi) consulting services for detailed engineering, procurement and construction supervision, and
an engineering study for the Dai Ninh Hydropower project; (b) for PC3: (i) rehabilitation and
reinforcement of the distribution systems of the cities of Hue and Nhatrang; (ii) construction of the 220
kV Krongbuk-Nhatrang transmission line and 220 kV substations at Krongbuk and Nhatrang, and
expansion of the 110 kV substations at Nhatrang, Cau Do and Lien Tri; (iii) establishment of the
Central Region Load Dispatch Center; (iv) establishment of the Central Region Training Center; (v)
resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected by components b (i) and b (ii); and (vi) consulting
services for detailed engineering, procurement and construction supervision. The project also includes:
(a) for MOE: (i) expansion of the National Load Dispatch Center; (ii) procurement of equipment for the
National Training Center; and (iii) engineering studies for the Son La Hydropower project; and (b) for
the Power Sector: (i) technical assistance in strategic planning, MIS, human resource development,
financial management and materials managernent; and (ii) technical assistance in demand-side
management and electricity efficiency imnprovement.
4.3        The Power Sector Reform and Restructuring study by ESMAP (para. 4.18) would,
through seminars, workshops and study tours, focus attention of the Vietnamese on issues relevant to:
(a) improving the efficiency of technical and managerial operations; (b) commercialization and
corporatization leading to greater managerial and financial autonomy with accountability; (c) the legal
and regulatory framework for the sector; and (d) an industry structure that would facilitate private
financing of power development. The study's terms of reference are at Annex 8.



-29-
Description of The Project Components
Conversion of Open Cycle Combustion Turbines to Combined Cycle Operation at Ba Ria
4.4        The existing power station at Ba Ria in the south is provided with 5 Frame 6 combustion
turbines until recently burning diesel oil. Off-shore natural gas is expected to be available at Ba Ria in
mid-1995. While providing a more economical fuel source, natural gas opens up the possibility of
increasing generation at Ba Ria, without incremental fuel consumption, by converting the open cycle
turbines to combined cycle mode with the installation of the steam cycle equipment. To justify the
large per unit capital cost of US$1,300/kW of the steam cycle equipment, a detailed economic study,
considering power and energy balance in the southern grid, was conducted by consultants. This study
establishes the need for high plant factor thermal capacity addition in the southern grid and provides the
rationale for conversion to combined cycle operation at Ba Ria. A subsequent detailed technical
feasibility study by the same consultant establishes the technical parameters for the conversion of 3x37.5
MW combustion turbines to combined cycle operation by the installation of 3 heat recovery boilers and
a 57 MW steam turbine. The cooling source for the steam cycle is currently planned to be through the
creation of a pond in the nearby estuary. The economics of the alternative with land-based cooling
towers, which would eliminate the aquatic environmental impact, is under consideration by PC2. If the
cooling pond alternative is adopted, a part of a cooperative shrimp farm would need to be acquired and
suitable compensation paid (para. 4.29).
Rehabilitation/Reinforcement of the Distribution System of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC)
4.5        HCMC is the industrial, scientific, technical and international relations center of Viet
Nam. Its metropolis, with 12 districts and an area of 140 sq km has a population of 3.2 million
(population density: 23,000 persons/sq km), whereas its suburbs, with 6 districts and an area of 1,916
sq km have a population of 1.4 million (population density: 7 persons/sq Ian). The MV and LV power
distribution systems in HCMC are operated by the Power Supply Department, a subsidiary of PC2,
while PC2 itself operates the HV transmission system and the HV/MV source substations. The demand
for electricity in 1993 was 420 MW, 2,352 Gwh p. a., with losses amounting to about 19% of which
about 3% are estimated to be non-technical. A recent detailed evaluation of the HCMC distribution
system concludes that: (a) many of the substations are overloaded, almost all of their equipment is old,
undermaintained due to lack of spares and poses serious operational problems and safety hazards; (b)
the overhead MV network, though in a reasonable physical condition, has almost half its circuits
overloaded, whereas the underground MV cables are over 40 years old and prone to frequent faults;
and (c) the LV overhead network is in a very bad condition and is in urgent need of rehabilitation.
4.6        A master plan study for the rehabilitation and expansion of the HCMC distribution system
was carried out by consultants. The Base Case load forecast scenario developed by the consultants,
based on an update of MOE's recent forecasts, indicates the demand growing from 510 MW and 2,869
Gwh in 1994 to 1,237 MW and 7,286 Gwh in 2000, reflecting an average growth rate of about 16%.
The study presents the investments in the short and medium term to rehabilitate and reinforce the
network (including upgrading MV and LV voltages and reconductoring), which would reduce its losses
from the current level of about 19% to about 10% by 2005. If these investments are not made, the
losses would increase tremendously, and system reliability would seriously deteriorate. The planning
basis is considered to be reasonable and practicable. The proposed project covers rehabilitation and
expansion of the MV and LV lines and MV/LV substations over the 1995-1997 period (see Annex 9,



-30-
page 2 for details). Provision has been made for resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected
by this project component (para. 4.27).
Rehabilitation/Reinforcement of the Distribution System of Hue
4.7        Hue (population 375,000), the political capital of Viet Nam from 1802 to 1945, is the
cultural, religious and educational center of the country. Its ancient monuments have been classified by
UNESCO as part of the world heritage and the Government attaches great significance to developing
Hue as a tourist center. Apart from its touristic importance, Hue has a number of industries and has a
good potential for industrial growth. The demand for electricity in 1993 was 17.5 MW, 74 Gwh p. a.,
with losses amounting to about 20% of which about 6% are estimated to be non-technical. A recent
detailed evaluation of Hue distribution concludes that: (a) the networks and their equipment are very old
and in a state of disrepair due to lack of spares; (b) the networks are under-sized and over-extended,
incurring excessive losses and voltage drops; and (c) the circuits are cluttered and clearances are below
standard, posing safety hazards. The distribution system is hardly adequate to meet existing demands
and is totally incapable of meeting future demand.
4.8        A detailed feasibility study for the rehabilitation and expansion of the Hue distribution
system was carried out by PC3 and reviewed and updated by consultants. A load forecast considering
detailed sector-wise analysis of demand growth and the current restrictions on electricity usage,
indicates the demand growing from 17.5 MW and 74 Gwh in 1993 to 42.8 MW and 170 Gwh in 2000,
reflecting an average growth rate of about 13%. The study presents the investments in the short and
medium term to rehabilitate and reinforce the network (including upgrading MV and LV voltages and
reconductoring), which would reduce its total losses from the current level of about 20% to about 10%
by 2000. In the absence of these investments the losses would increase to over 35%, if indeed the
network could withstand the increased stresses. The planning basis is considered to be reasonable and
practicable. The proposed project covers rehabilitation and expansion of the MV and LV lines and
MV/LV substations over the 1995-1997 period (see Annex 9, page 6 for details). Provision has been
made for resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected by this project component (para. 4.27).
Rehabilitation/Reinforcement of the Distribution System of Nhatrang
4.9        Nhatrang (population 280,000), the capital of Khanh Hoa Province, is one of the most
important tourist resorts in Viet Nam. It is also a cultural, economic and scientific center, with a
substantial industrial base. The demand for electricity in 1993 was 18 MW, 84 Gwh p. a., with losses
amounting to about 15% of which about 3.5% are estimated to be non-technical. A recent detailed
evaluation of Nhatrang distribution concludes that: (a) the networks and their equipment are very old
and in a state of disrepair due to lack of spares; (b) the networks are under-sized and over-extended,
incurring excessive losses and voltage drops; and (c) the circuits are cluttered and clearances below
standard, posing safety hazards. The distribution system is hardly adequate to meet existing demands
and is totally incapable of meeting future demand.
4.10       A detailed feasibility study for the rehabilitation and expansion of the Nhatrang distribution
system was carried out by PC3 and reviewed and updated by consultants. A load forecast considering
detailed sector-wise analysis of demand growth and the current restrictions on electricity usage,
indicates the demand growing from 18 MW and 83.8 Gwh in 1993 to 51.7 MW and 213 Gwh in 2000,
reflecting an average growth rate of about 16%. The study presents the investments in the short and
medium term to rehabilitate and reinforce the network (including upgrading MV and LV voltages and



-31-
reconductoring), which would reduce its total losses from the current level of about 15% to about 7.5%
by 2000. In the absence of these investments the losses would increase to over 28%, if indeed the
network could withstand the increased stresses. The planning basis is considered to be reasonable and
practicable. The proposed project covers rehabilitation and expansion of the MV and LV lines and
MV/LV substations over the 1995-1997 period (see Annex 9, page 8 for details). Provision has been
made for resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected by this project component (para. 4.27).
New Southern and Central Region Load Dispatch Centers
Strengthening of The National Load Dispatch Center
4.11       The northern, southern and central 220kV power systems currently operated by PC1, PC2
and PC3, respectively, are interconnected by a 500 kV transmission system. A National Load Dispatch
Center (NLDC), has been installed in the Ministry of Energy's (MOE) Hanoi headquarters and is being
operated by MOE staff. PC1 operates an existing Regional Load Dispatch Center (RLDC) from its
headquarters in Hanoi. The center was built about 10 years ago with assistance from the former USSR,
and provides basic monitoring functions for the northern region network. PC2 currently coordinates
load dispatch from its operations headquarters using basic telephone facilities and has comnnissioned a
new distribution system control center for Ho Chi Minh City. The latter is provided with supervisory
control and data acquisition facilities under a Swedish aid project. PC3 has rudimnentary supervision
facilities with limited PLC and VHF communications. Existing regional load dispatch facilities are
inadequate and need to be upgraded for proper monitoring and control of the respective regional power
systems and to facilitate optimal dispatch of power between regions.
4.12       A Conceptual Master Plan for the design and operation of the entire load dispatch system
in Viet Namn has been prepared by consultants. This plan lays down the philosophy of hierarchical
control of the system. The master plan also specifies the basic requirements of the hardware and
software for the SCADA and Energy Management (EMS) systems and the communication network.
Funding of the RLDCs for South and Central Viet Nam and components for extension of the National
Load Dispatch Center would be covered under the proposed project (Annex 9, pages 4, 10 and 18).
The RLDC for North is proposed to be funded by SIDA of Sweden. A building for housing the
southem RLDC has already been constructed whereas a new building would be built for the central
RLDC.
Southem and Central Region Training Centers
Equipment for The National Training Center
4.13       The existing facilities in the south, center and the north of Viet Nam for training of
technicians and staff of the respective power companies are ill-equipped and outdated primarily due to
lack of funding. While the building for the new training center in Hanoi, which would function as the
National Training Center, has been constructed, it is void of equipment and facilities. Several studies
have been made in the past for upgrading each of the training centers; an overall study reviewing the
training needs of the entire power sector and specifying a staged development of the training centers and
proposals for training was made by consultants. The proposed project covers the first phase of
upgrading the training facilities for the power sector and includes: (a) extensions of the existing works
facilities, provision of urgently needed training equipment, and training of trainers for the South and
Center; and (b) provision of equipment for the National Training Center (Annex 9, pages 5, 11 and
19).



-32-
Kronabuk-Nhatran2 220 kV Line and 220 kV Substations at Krongbuk and Nhatrang
4.14       The construction of the 500 kV North-Center-South transmission line and the establishment
of a 500/220 kV substation at Pleicu (see Grid Map), opens the way for providing reliable power to
central Viet Nam. The plan for transmitting power from Pleicu to Nhatrang via Krongbuk has been
approved by the Prime Minister and PC3 is already executing the Pleicu-Krongbuk section. PC3's
feasibility study and basic design for the 220 kV system expansion in central Viet Nam was reviewed
for IDA by consultants and found to be acceptable. The proposed project provides for the construction
of: (a) a 147 km, 336 AAAC conductor, single circuit 220 kV Krongbuk-Nhatrang transmission line;
(b) Krongbuk substation with one 220/110/20 kV, 63 MVA transformer, 3x220 kV and 2xll 0 kV
switching bays and 5x20 kV feeder outlets; and (c) Nhatrang substation with one 220/110/20 kV, 125
MVA transformer, 2x220 kV and 2xl 10 kV switching bays and 6x20 kV feeder outlets. Land for the
substations and right of way for the transmission line have already been secured. Provision has been
made for resettlement and/or compensation of persons affected by this project component (para. 4.28).
Reinforcement of The 110 kV substations at Nhatrang. Cau Do and Lien Tri.
4.15       Based on detailed demand projections by PC3, reinforcement of 110 kV substations is
necessary to meet the demand growth in the areas of Nhatrang, Cau Do and Lientri in the north of
central Viet Nam (see Grid Map). The project provides for the installation of: (a) lx25 MVA, 110/20
kV transformer, 4xll O kV and 4x20 kV feeders at Nhatrang substation; (b) lx25 MVA, 110/35 kV
transformer, 2x110 kV and 6x35 kV feeders at Cao Do substation; and (d) lx25 MVA, 110/35 kV
transformer, 2x1 10 kV and 6x35 kV feeders at Lien Tri substation.
Consulting Studies for Proiect Mananement and Technical Assistance Engineering Studies for Future
Hydro Proiects
4.16       Based on a detailed evaluation of the needs of the various implementing agencies,
provision has been made in the project for adequate staff-months (SM) of expatriate consulting services
to assist in engineering, design, procurement and construction supervision for: (a) the Ba Ria combined
cycle conversion (100 SM); (b) HCMC distribution (60 SM); (c) Southern RLDC (60 SM); (d)
Southern Training Centre, including training (50 SM); (e) Hue/Nhatrang distribution (50 SM); (f)
Central RLDC (60 SM); (g) Central Training Center, including training (50 SM); (h) 220 kV line and
substations (30 SM); (i) National LDC (30 SM); and (j) engineering studies for Dai Ninh and Son La
Hydropower projects (60 SM each). The terms of reference for all the project related consulting
assistance have been agreed with the implementing agencies.
Technical Assistance for Demand Side Management.
4.17       While there is a growing awareness of the need for Demand Side Management (DSM) in
Government and utility circles, there has been very limited application of energy efficiency measures
and other DSM activities in Viet Nam. There is also very little energy end-use data available in the
country. Viet Nam needs to implement all available cost effective DSM measures to use electricity in
the most efficient manner, commensurate with the country's development. The main objectives of the
study (Terms of Reference are at Annex 10) are to: (a) identify a menu of DSM opportunities in the
industrial, commercial and residential sectors; (b) prioritize and evaluate these DSM sector alternatives,
based on their energy sector impact and cost effectiveness; (c) define an appropriate institutional and
regulatory framework for DSM program implementation; (d) introduce a resource planning approach



-33-
(e.g Integrated Resource Planning (IRP)) which would permit the cost-effective assessment of all
sU.   and demand energy resource options; and finally (e) identify DSM components that could be
coL   red for financing under an IDA Energy Sector Credit. Agreement was reached at negotiations
that wle Borrower would furnish to IDA for review and comments: (a) the findings of the study; and (b)
its proposals for the implementation of the study's recommendations, and thereafter implement the
proposals taking into consideration IDA's commnents.
Technical Assistance for Power Sector Reforrn & Institutional Strengthening.
4.18     To meet Government's overall objectives of reforming state enterprises and moving from
centrally planned to market-oriented mechanisms, two major technical assistance initiatives are planned.
The first, being conducted by the Banks ESMAP is focussed on an immediate need articulated by the
Government. This technical assistance is designed to assist the Government and EVN in making the
transition from the existing power sector structure to the new structure.  This effort is based on the
principles of: (a) improving the operational efficiency of the sector; (b) commercialization and
corporatization of the constituent operations to provide greater managerial and financial autonomy; (c)
developing an appropriate legal and regulatory framework that would allow for greater enterprise
autonomy and requisite government regulatory oversight; and (d) a financially viable and open sector
structure that allows for increased private involvement in financing sector expansion. (Terms of
Reference in Annex 8).
4.19     The second, technical assistance program under the proposed project, directed at much
needed institutional strengthening, is being financed by the Japanese Grant Facility. This technical
assistance would focus on the development of appropriate organizational structures, adoption of
commercial management practices, budget and control systems, reporting procedures and information
flows, under the reformed sector structure. (Terms of Reference in Annex 11). The study will
reconmmend: (a) appropriate levels of consolidation of accounting statements and balance sheets of the
subordinate entities under EVN; (b) organization of line and staff functions of the newly defined
entities; and (c) the operational, financial and MIS reporting requirements within the new entities.  A
complementary technical assistance program is being funded by ADB which focuses on the development
of cost and financial accounting systems (Terms of Reference in Annex 6). Close coordination of these
complementary technical assistance programs would be ensured from the outset. Agreement was
reached at negotiations that the Borrower would furnish to IDA for review and comments: (a) the
findings of the studies; and (b) its proposals for the implementation of the studies' recommendations,
and thereafter implement the proposals taking into account IDA's comments.
B. Implementation
4.20           PC2 and PC3 would be responsible for implementing the major portion of the project,
managing components falling within their jurisdiction in South and Central Viet Nam, respectively.
The technical experts of the MOE would be responsible for implementing the strengthening of the
National Load Dispatch Center, while PCI will assist MOE in implementing the component for
strengthening of the National Training Center in Hanoi. The Personnel Department of MOE will
manage the technical assistance studies relating to Power Sector Institutional Strengthening and Power
Sector Reform and Restructuring, while the Energy Institute will manage the technical assistance study



-34-
for Demand Side Management. Both PC2 and PC3 have substantial in-house expertise in engineering
and design; this would be reinforced through assistance from PIDC2 and PIDC1, respectively.
Adequate consulting assistance is being provided under the project (para. 4.16) to assist the
implementing agencies in developing designs and bid documents, evaluating bids and preparing
evaluation reports, project management including construction supervision and progress reporting.
Draft bidding documents following the Bank guidelines have already been prepared by consultants for
HCMC, Hue and Nhatrang distribution systems, the Southern and Central RLDCs and the 220 kV
system components. These will be refined and finalized with the assistance of the consultants employed
under the project.
4.21           Both PC2 and PC3 have prepared Project Implementation Plans following the Bank
guidelines; these indicate the organizational arrangements for project management and the
implementation bar charts.  Project Management Units (with a Project Manager and staff positions)
will be set up within PC2 and PC3 specifically for managing the IDA-assisted project components (see
Charts 4 and 5). Bidding Evaluation Commnittees (having representation from the MOE) will be set up
for PC2 and PC3 for approving bid documents and contract awards.
4.22           The Power Distribution Company in HCMC and the provincial distribution authorities
in Hue and Nhatrang will play a major role in managing the distribution projects and constructing the
networks. About 50% of installation work would be let out on contract to local firms through
competitive bidding and the rest done through forced account. Construction for the 220 kV lines and
the 220kV and 110 kV substations will be handled by PC3 in a similar manner. While PC2's load
dispatch department has adequate expertise in managing the RLDC project, PC3 will avail itself of
substantial assistance from PIDC1 and MOE. Both PC2 and PC3 have adequate experience in handling
the training center components, with necessary expatriate consultancy assistance. The Ba Ria combined
cycle component will be managed by PC2 with the assistance of PIDC2; its installation will be let out
on turnkey basis.
4.23           The bar charts for implementing the project components and the key project dates are
given in Annex 12. The major portion of the project implementation would be over the 1995-1997
period. The Vietnamese institutions are technically well experienced in implementing the project
components and with the expatriate consulting assistance provided under the project, no substantive
problems are foreseen in efficient and timely implementation of the project.  The implementing
arrangements are satisfactory to IDA.
Monitoring and Reporting
4.24           Satisfactory procedures for monitoring the progress of the project in terms of physical
execution and financial reports were agreed, at negotiations, with each implementing agency. It would
also be agreed that each agency will furnish quarterly progress reports. An Implementation Completion
Report (ICR) will be drafted by IDA not later than six months after completion of the Credit and
agreement was reached with MOE, PC2 and PC3 to assist in its preparation. The agencies will adopt
the plan for the operational phase of the project and together with IDA, define the performance
indicators to be used to monitor operations and development impact. The Agencies will also prepare
and make available to IDA their own evaluation reports, including summary reports which will be
attached unedited to the ICR. The evaluation would assess the project execution and initial operation,
its costs and benefits, IDA's performance, its own performance of the obligations under the Credit
Agreement, and the extent to which the purposes of the Credit were achieved.



-35-
Supervision Plan
4.25           Supervision of this project will extend over a period of five years, 1995-1999. The
key issues that would be focused upon are: (a) review of Viet Nam's power development plan in
keeping with changes in the economic scenario; (b) a continuing dialogue with the Government on
tariffs for the power sector; (c) monitoring of compliance with financial covenants to assure the
financial health of the PCs while undertaking large investment programs; (d) monitoring of the
implementation of the environmental impact mitigation measures for Ba Ria and rehabilitation plans for:
(i) the 220 kV transmission line and substations; and (ii) people likely to be displaced due to
construction of the distribution lines and substations; and (e) technical supervision of physical
implementation of the project components. The IDA missions would also assist the Government in
analyzing issues and options in power sector institutional strengthening and in formulating strategy and
concrete plans for DSM. Supervision of the project would require expertise in power engineering,
economics, financial analysis and rehabilitation. Three missions annually for a period of three years
(normally coinciding with preparatory missions for future IDA-assisted projects) are foreseen for
adequate supervision of this project. The total estimated staff inputs are: (a) power engineer, economist
and financial analyst -- 24 staff-weeks; and (b) rehabilitation specialist -- 9 staff-weeks. Key project
performance indicators that would be used for supervision are given in Annex 13. These performance
indicators cover: (a) the reduction of losses; (b) the reduction of accounts receivable; and (c) the timely
completion of Load Dispatch and Training Centers - all of which are linked to improving the efficiency
of the power sector operations, which is a primary objective of the project. Also, setting of target dates
for the completion of institutional studies would contribute towards timely sequencing of reforms in the
sector. Finally, monitoring of target completion dates for major components of the project would
strengthen project implementation discipline, while environmental and resettlement related monitoring
would ensure environmentally and socially acceptable development.
C. Environment and Resettlement
4.26           All load dispatch and training centers and the expansions of the 110 kV substations of
Nhatrang, Cau Do and Lien Tri are on existing land plots and in some cases in existing buildings and
do not pose any environmental issues. Rehabilitation of old, cluttered distribution networks in HCMC,
Hue and Nhatrang, predominantly using insulated conductors, largely running along existing corridors,
would contribute to greater safety and present better aesthetic appearance. No PCB is used in the
power transformers that would be replaced under the project. The routes of distribution lines and
locations of distribution substations may in exceptional cases involve displacement of some people. The
220 kV Krongbuk-Nhatrang transmission line route traversing through agricultural and tree-crop land,
does not encroach on ecologically sensitive areas. However, 80 houses would need to be relocated
along the line route. Although the line traverses through areas inhabited by ethnic people, care has
been taken in routing to ensure that no ethnic people are affected by the project. The 220 kV Krongbuk
and Nhatrang substations are located on grass land.
Distribution Systems for Ho Chi Minh City. Hue and Nhatran,
4.27           The detailed design of the MV and LV distribution systems for HCMC, Hue and
Nhatrang would be finalized later. A detailed Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for this component



-36-
cannot, therefore, be prepared at this stage. The RAP is being prepared in two phases: (a) RAP Phase-
1 (see Annex 14 for details), which has already been prepared, includes: (i) the resettlement principles;
(ii) institutional and legal framework including entitlement policies; (iii) implementation arrangements;
(iv) peoples' participation in implementation; (v) grievance redressal mechanisms; and (vi) provision for
internal and extemal monitoring; and (b) RAPs Phase-2, which will consist of: (i) results of the socio-
economic census and socio-economic survey of the project affected persons (PAPs) and properties to be
affected; (ii) detailed compensation and/or resettlement and rehabilitation entitlements of various
categories of PAPs; (iii) a timetable for implementation; (iv) institutional responsibilities for
implementation; (v) a detailed budget for funding the various compensation and rehabilitation measures;
and (vi) intemal and extemal monitoring arrangements. The census and socio-economic surveys under
the RAPs, Phase-2 will be completed as soon as possible but at least 6 months prior to the estimated
date for commencement of construction. It was agreed at negotiations that the RAPs, Phase-2 will be:
(a) furnished to IDA no later than 3 months prior to their implementation; (b) undertaken only after
approval by IDA and the Government; and (c) completed at least 1 month before the beginning of
construction work in any given area. The Phase-I RAP was agreed with the Govermnent prior to
negotiations. Approval of the Phase-2 RAPs by IDA and the Govermnent would be a condition for
credit disbursement against expenditures incurred against the distribution systems sub-components of the
project.
220 kV Kron2buk-Nhatran2 Line and Substations at Kron2buk and Nhatrang
4.28           For the 220 kV Krongbuk-Nhatrang line and terminal substations at Krongbuk and
Nhatrang, a RAP has been prepared for the 85 families that would be affected by the transmission line
(see Annex 14 for details). Only land directly under the transmission towers and the houses in the right
of way (ROW) will need to be acquired. Land, not directly under the towers, can continue to be used
for agricultural purposes with some restrictions on the height of trees. The PAPs will be relocated
close to their present location in order to ensure that their socio-economic lifestyles will not be affected.
The form of compensation for land will be "land for land". Compensation will be paid at replacement
cost for houses and structures and at market rates for trees and crops. The RAP will be implemented
by PC3 with the involvement of PAPs and the peoples' committees at the provincial, district and
commune levels. Adequate mechanisms have been provided for the redressal of grievances and for
external and internal supervision and monitoring. The RAP is in compliance with the Bank's
operational directives and is acceptable to IDA. The RAP was agreed with the Government prior to
negotiations. It was agreed at negotiations that PC3 would carry out the RAP as approved by IDA and
the Government.
Ba Ria Combined Cycle Conversion
4.29           A detailed environmental assessment (Annex 22, Ref 9a and 9b; Annex 15 - EA
Overview) has concluded that with proper design and mitigation measures, atmospheric impacts (NO,
and noise levels) and aquatic impacts (cooling water temperature, chlorine concentration and impact on
shrimp farming and mangroves) would be within acceptable limits. The EA has been approved by the
Government. An alternative cooling system using cooling towers is being studied. If this option is
decided upon, there would be no need for creating a cooling water lagoon in the river estuary and the



-37-
corresponding impact on the marine environment would disappear.- In the event a cooling water
lagoon is required, a part of a cooperative shrimp farm will need to be acquired. The farm has more
land than can effectively be utilized by the present number of members. Hence, acquisition of a part of
this shrimp farm will not adversely affect the livelihood of any of its members. Compensation rates
acceptable to the cooperative have been agreed upon between the farmers, the local district peoples'
committee and PC2. It was agreed during negotiations that PC2 would: (a) design the plant and follow
appropriate mitigation measures; (b) set up an environmental unit and an environmental coordinator as
part of the management structure of the power station, as outlined in the EA document; and (c)
compensate the shrimp farming community at rates that have been mutually agreed upon.
D. Cost Estimates
4.30            The total cost of the project (including capitalized interest during construction) is
estimated at US$247.9 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$165.9 million. Physical
contingencies are assumed at 10% of the base cost for all project components. Price contingencies are
estimated on the basis of escalation factors of 5% per annum for local cost components and 2.3% per
annum for foreign cost components, following the Bank's latest forecasts. Table 4.1 summarizes the
cost estimates for the project (details are at Annex 9).
E. Financing Plan
4.31            The financing plan for the project is shown in Table 4.2. The proposed IDA credit of
US$165 million equivalent would meet almost 100% of the foreign cost of the project and about 67% of
project financing requirements. The proposed IDA credit would be made to the Government at IDA's
standard rate for a 40 year terrn including 5 years of grace on repayment of principal. Of the total
Credit amount of US$165 million equivalent, US$117 million equivalent would be onlent to PC2 and
US$40 million equivalent to PC3. An amount of US$8 million would be used by the Government for
project components to be executed by the MOE. The credit would be on-lent to PC2 and PC3 in US
dollars at a fixed interest rate of 6.9% per annum, with repayment over 20 years, including a grace
period of 5 years, and foreign exchange risk being borne by PC2 and PC3. The finalization of
subsidiary loan agreements between the Government and PC2 and PC3, acceptable to IDA, would be a
condition of effectiveness of the IDA credit.
1/ The current proposal is to use cooling towers and an EIA for this alternative, which eliminates the aquatic impact, has also
been prepared.

F. Procurement
4.32            About 93%  (US$153.5 million equivalent) of the IDA credit would be used for
financing goods procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) using the Bank guidelines.
In the evaluation of bids obtained following ICB procedures, a margin of preference equal to 15 % of
the CIF bid price of imported goods or the actual customs duties and import taxes, whichever is less,
will be allowed for domestic manufactures. About 6% (US$10 million equivalent) of the credit amount
would be used for financing consulting services procured following the Bank procedures for the
employment of consultants. About 1% (US$1.6 million equivalent) of the credit would be used for
financing specialized equipment (including testing and measuring equipment) using the following
procedures complying with the Bank guidelines: (a) Limited International Bidding (LIB), aggregating
US$1.2 million equivalent; and (b) International Shopping (IS) aggregating US$0.4 million equivalent.
Contracts under these procedures would not exceed the equivalent of US$200,000 each for LIB and
US$50,000 each for IS.
4.33            The bid documents would follow the text of the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents.
All bid documents, contract award recommendations and contracts for goods and services would be
subject to prior review and approval by IDA. The total number of procurement packages is foreseen to
be: (a) ICB - 20 packages (Annex 16), 13 for PC3, 5 for PC2 and 2 for MOE; and (b) LIB and IS -
about 14 packages. A total of about 620 staff-months of consulting services will be engaged under 11
contracts (para 4.16).
4.34            Local contracts for installation would not be financed from the IDA credit. About
50% of installation work for distribution system rehabilitation and expansion, transmission line and
substations would be contracted to local firms through a competitive bidding process satisfactory to
IDA. The balance of such installation work would be undertaken on force-account basis using the PCs
own resources including those of their subsidiaries. These personnel have long experience in executing



-40-
installation work of this nature. Implementation of the Ba Ria combined cycle plant component would
be on turnkey basis.
4.35           Table 4.3 summarizes the procurement arrangements for the components expected to
be financed out of the proposed IDA credit.
G. Disbursements
4.36           The IDA credit would be disbursed against: (a) 100% of foreign expenditures, or
100% of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for goods procured through ICB; (b) 50% of local
expenditures for other items procured locally; (c) 100% of foreign expenditures for goods purchased
through LIB or IS; and (d) 100% of expenditures for consulting services, excluding taxes. As no
contract is expected to be less than about US$200,000 equivalent (except for a few contracts under IS
procedures), Statement of Expenditures (SOE) procedures would not be followed.  To facilitate
disbursements, three Special Accounts would be established in US currency for PC2, PC3 and MOE on
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA with deposits of US$4.0 million (PC2), US$1.5 million (PC3)
and US$0.6 million (MOE). Replenishment applications should be submitted monthly or when the
account is drawn by 30% of the authorized allocation, whichever occurs first. For withdrawal outside
of the Special Accounts (applications for direct payment or for issuance of Special Commitments) a
minimum application value of 20% of the authorized allocation of the Special Accounts would be
observed.
4.37           Retroactive financing would be permitted to the extent bf US$5.0 million equivalent
for payments made, prior to the date of the Credit Agreement but after August 23, 1994 (the appraisal
starting date), for contracting urgently required goods and consulting services. This is necessary to
meet the project implementation schedule.
4.38           Annex 17 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA credit and the
standard profile of disbursements for power projects in Asia. The credit is assumed to be disbursed
about three years faster than the profile, based on actual performance of the Vietnamese on other power
projects and the preparatory work already undertaken. The project is expected to be completed by June
30, 1998 and the closing date for the credit would be June 30, 1999.

Chapter V
Financial Aspects
A. Introduction
5.1        The accounting procedures of PC2 and PC3 comprise several features which make a
conventional financial analysis difficult (para. 3.18). Hence, the income statements and balance sheets
for FY92 and FY93 were modified to conform, to the extent possible, to the concept of accrued income
and expenses: (a) revenues from sales of power were recomputed to an accrual basis; (b) foreign
exchange equivalents were restated to those in effect at the end of the respective financial year; (c)
depreciation on fully depreciated assets was eliminated; and (d) receivables were corrected in line with
the revenue adjustment. In addition, modifications were made to the income statements, particularly in
regard to certain operational expense items (para. 3.18) which PC2 and PC3 used to simply capitalize
on the balance sheet. Furthermore, revenues of D 140 billion were added to the 1993 income statement
of PC2 to offset depreciation expenses disallowed by the Government.
5.2        Thus modified, the accounts of PC2 and PC3 serve as a reasonable basis for the financial
projections. Until such time that the studies (para. 3.19) are completed and accounts changed to
comply with international utility practices, the indices discussed in this chapter need to be viewed with
caution.
B. Past and Present Financial Performance
5.3        The Government's policy reforms in the power sector meant to give all PCs increased
autonomy in the operation and management of their assets. To this end, Decree No. 388 (Formation
and Dissolution of SOEs) was enacted in 1976. This allowed the PCs to engage in business activities
with a degree of independence which up to that time was not possible. However, defined corporate
objectives, mechanisms to foster managerial efficiency or financial discipline, and the institutional and
organizational systems and skills necessary to translate this increased autonomy into actual practice are
still not available. Thus, while sector reforms allowed the PCs to be responsible for their day-to-day
operations, matters relating to planning, budgeting, staffing, appointing of high level staff, contracting,
pricing, and financing of investments are still subject to Government approval, through the MOE.
While the resolution creating the PCs gives them the responsibility to manage and utilize their resources
"paying attention to high rates of return", and to continuously accumulate funds for the Govermnent and
themselves, there is no explicit financial mandate to ensure that the PCs' revenues be sufficient to meet
operating expenses, depreciation and interest charges.
5.4        A summary of the actual operating results of PC2 and PC3 for FY92 and FY93 is
presented in Table 5.1; the detailed statements are given in Annexes 18 and 19.

5.5          PC2's FY92-1993 financial results show that it was able to generate revenues sufficient to
cover all operating expenses (including depreciation), as well as interest expenses and income taxes.
Energy sales grew by 17%, from 3,118 Gwh in FY92 to 3,646 Gwh in FY93 and revenues from D
1,660 billion to D 2,106 billion, or 27%. Major portions of PC2's operating expenses were for fuel,
48%, and depreciation, 24% of revenues. Operating income in FY93 was 23% higher than in FY92,
as PC2 was able to hold down operating expenses to 90% of total revenues. Because of increasing
sales and improved operating ratio, PC2's net income almost doubled, from D 76 billion in FY92 to D
151 billion inFY93.
5.6         While PC2's financial performance is satisfactory, PC3's finances are a matter of serious
concern. PC3 sold 638 Gwh in FY93, 19% higher than in FY92 and its total revenues increased by
26%  from  D 243 bilY;on to D 306 billion.  However, PC3's revenues were not enough to offset
operating expenses incurred in either year, and the result was operating losses of D 139 billion in FY92
and D 194 billion in FY93. The difference in the operating performances of PC2 and PC3 is largely
due to their different markets. While PC2 sells to the more compact urban subscribers with a large
proportion of industrial consumers at higher tariff levels, PC3 sells predominantly in smaller towns and
rural areas, at lower tariff levels. Also, PC3 has a higher generation expense as it has a large number
of isolated diesel stati ,-. The Government is aware of PC3's unfavorable financial situation and has
taken actions to remedy it, including reducing the price PC3 has to pay for purchased power from PC1
and PC2 (from D 200/kWh to D 5/kWh), reducing the negotiated fuel/diesel price which PC3 pays, and
adjusting the amount of regular and major maintenance depreciation which PC3 may remit and keep,
respectively. While the greatly subsidized transfer price of power from PC1 and PC2 to PC3 has
alleviated PC3's financial situation somewhat, it has had a negative effect on the finances of PC1 and
PC2, representing about D 90 billion of lost revenues to PCI and PC2.

5.7        Table 5.2 demonstrates the serious weakness of PC2 and PC3's financial condition and the
anomalous situation of its capital structure. PC2's equity base in FY92 of D 4,809 billion, consisting
of Government capital of D 4,838 billion and accumulated losses of D 29 billion in FY92, increased to
D 6,011 billion in FY93 (D 5,889 billion of capital and D 122 billion of retained earnings). PC3's
FY92 equity amounted to D 1,169 billion of which D 1,330 billion was capital and D 161 billion was
accumulated losses. In FY93, PC3's equity increased to D 1,875 billion consisting of D 2,230 billion
of capital and D 355 billion of accumulated losses. Because the finances of both PCs were capitalized
solely from Government contributions, the PCs had no long term borrowing in FY92 and had only D
270 billion, in the case of PC2, in FY93. The ratio of debt to equity, the'refore, had been insignificant
in these years. However, the finances show that while both PCs benefit from 100% Government
funding, they have suffered from a lack of funds so that their ability to finance and plan for operating
and capital works, as well as to maintain properly their existing investments, has been severely
constrained. The main reason for this lies in the Government requirement that PCs remit their
depreciation charge. Up to the end of 1988, the PCs were required to remit 50% of their calculated
depreciation to the Government and retain the balance to fund capital works. In 1990, a change was
implemented allowing them to retain full depreciation, however, due to the Government's budgetary
constraints, this was not implemented and in 1992, the PCs were required to remit anywhere from 30-
100% of depreciation charge to the Govermnent. In FY93, PC2 incurred depreciation expenses of
about D 482 billion of which D 324 billion were remitted to the Government, while PC3 remitted its
entire D 132 billion. Furthermore, the Government also required the PCs to continue depreciating and
remitting fully depreciated assets. In effect, the Government has not provided the PCs with any
permanent cash equity, as whatever Government capital was provided was reimbursed each year
through these depreciation charges. Consequently, the PCs' financial performance and liquidity has
suffered with no ability to finance capital investments, sufficient retained earnings to finance future
expansion have not been accumulated, and financial resiliency to withstand unexpected business crises
has been eroded.
Fixed Assets Revaluation and Rate of Return
5.8        The PCs are required to pay to the Government an annual fixed amount, set by the
Ministry of Finance (MOF), for amortization of assets. Major portions of the fixed assets of PC2 and



-46-
PC3 were initially recorded at cost. With the introduction of a market-oriented economic system in
1989, the Government revalued all the operating assets of the PCs (para. 3.18). The fixed assets of all
PCs were restated based on the price index stipulated by the Government in January 1990 and January
1992. PC2's net revalued fixed assets for 1993 amounted to D 4,028 billion and were only slightly
increased from FY92 levels, despite the revaluation. PC3, had net revalued fixed assets in FY92 of D
672 billion, which dropped slightly in FY93 to D 630 billion. PC2 and PC3 recorded substantial
increase in their fixed assets under construction of about 83% and 55%, respectively, in FY93
reflecting their expansion activities. PC2 recorded a 5.4% rate of return on average net fixed assets in
operation in FY93, while PC3 had a negative return. However, due to the high rates of inflation
experienced in Viet Nam over the past four years, the varying methodologies used for revaluing fixed
assets, and distortions in the value of fixed assets, computations of annual rates of return, can be
misleading.
C. Financial Outlook
5.9        To address the vulnerable condition of the PCs and achieve financial recovery, a re-
capitalization of the PCs equity with the aim of rebuilding, fully funding, and strengthening the capital
base, and to focus on improving liquidity without charging distorted tariffs, is necessary. In order to
improve the PCs' financial performance, and help them self-finance a substantial portion of the
investment program, the PCs would need to retain depreciation expenses. In 1994, the Government has
decided to discontinue the requirement of remitting regular depreciation charges starting 1995. This
Government initiative, however, will not completely improve the PCs' capital structure unless infusion
of new Government equity is made.  The financial projections, therefore, assumes that future
investments will be financed through a combination of loans and fresh Government contributions.
Specific operating and financial covenants designed to directly support the objectives of financial
viability and mobilization of resources for development, are being sought under the proposed project.
The covenants provided in paras. 5.11-5.17 are designed to prevent further erosion of the capital base,
ensure that part of the profits would be available to meet future financing requirements, and safeguard
that internally generated funds will be available to meet operating and debt servicing requirements.
5.10       Projections of PC2's and PC3's financial performance for the period 1994-2000, together
with assumptions underlying these projections, are presented in Annexes 18 through 20. A summary of
the financial projections is presented in Table 5.3.
5.11       On the basis of load forecasts approved by the Government for planning the sector's
development, PC2's retail sales are expected to grow on average at 14% from 4,329 Gwh in FY94 to
9,030 Gwh in FY2000. Revenues from the sale of power are projected to increase from D 2,359
billion to D 9,761 billion for the same period. Fuel costs are estimated to increase by 10% in each of
the years: 1996, 1998 and 2000. The financial projections show that with reasonable tariff increases in
line with the Government's intent to raise the cost of electricity to an average of 7 USc/kWh by 1999,
PC2's performance is expected to remain satisfactory, with operating expenses remaining at about 70%
to 80% of operating revenues. The projections also indicate that during the period, PC2 might be able
to finance an average of about 35% of its future investment from internal sources. However, given
certain weaknesses in PC2's financial accounts and the sensitivity of the financial projections to the
Government's pricing of electricity tariffs and the timing of these increases, a lower self financing ratio



-47-
is covenanted. Agreement was reached at negotiations with the Borrower and PC2 that they would take
all actions, including but not limited to adjustment of tariffs, so that PC2 would generate funds from
internal sources equivalent to not less than 25% of the annual average of PC2's capital expenditures
incurred for that financial year, the previous financial year, and the next following financial year.

5.12        PC3's future finances are precarious and the situation is exacerbated by incorporating on
its books the capital and operating costs of the 700 MW Yali Hydropower project whose benefits would
begin to flow in the next century. For the purpose of this analysis, Yali has been removed from the
financial projections. In addition, the following assumptions are made: (a) the price at which PC3
purchases power from PCI and PC2 would remain at the current level of D 5/kWh; and (b) the
Government would: (i) waive payment of the tax on capital in 1995; (ii) levy tax on capital in
progressively increasing amounts during 1996-1998 to achieve zero net income; and (iii) levy the full
tax on capital and on income from  1999 onwards.  With the load forecasts approved by the
Government, PC3's retail sales are expected to increase from 742 Gwh in FY94 to 1,498 Gwh in
FY2000 or an average increase of about 13% p.a. Revenues from the sale of power are projected to
increase from D 352 billion to D 1,411 billion from FY94 to FY2000, while fuel costs are assumed to
increase by 10% in FY96, FY98 and FY2000. The projections show that in FY94 and FY95, revenues
per kWh of D 475 and D 539 will not be enough to offset operating costs per kWh of D 593 and D
579, respectively, due to increasing costs of operating and depreciating a rapidly expanding system and
will result in operating losses during the period. PC3 will experience net operating losses of about D
88 billion in FY94 and D 40 billion in FY95. However, as revenues per kWh are gradually increased
and as expenses per kWh are held to reasonable levels, PC3 will realize operating income from FY96
onwards.  To ensure that PC3 achieves viable operations, it was agreed at negotiations that the
Borrower and PC3 would take all necessary measures including but not limited to adjusting tariffs, so
as to enable PC3, from FY96 and thereafter, to realize operating revenues that would be sufficient to
cover all operating costs including depreciation. This would be on the basis of the aforementioned
assumptions regarding Yali, the cost of purchased power and the levy of tax on capital.

5.14       In the past, PC2 and PC3 have not borrowed long term funds since all funds have been
provided through the Government budget. The projections, however, assume that a bigger portion of
future investments will be financed through loans until a satisfactory capitalization of the power sector
is achieved. The assumptions on the future capital structure are: (a) in order to maintain a manageable
level of debt servicing, the existing Government capital will remain as equity and will not be
transformed into debt; (b) beginning 1994, new investments will be financed with one third new cash
Government contributions in the form of equity and two thirds debt.
5.15       Total investments including IDC of PC2 and PC3 for 1994-2000 are projected at D 32,121
billion (US$2.9 billion) and D 9,298 billion (US$845 million), respectively. PC2's investments are
expected to grow considerably at an average rate of about 36% during 1994-2000, while investments of
PC3 are projected to grow by 15% p.a. from FY94-97 and drop sharply by 53% thereafter. PC2 and
PC3 will secure long term financing, net of debt service, for about D 18,593 billion and D 4,678
billion, respectively, of projected 1994-2000 investments. These borrowings represent adequate capital
structures for PC2 and PC3 with long term debts not exceeding 46% and 37% of total capitalization,
respectively, for the projected period. While PC2 is expected to achieve a significant level of self
financing averaging about 35% throughout the projected period, PC3's net internal cash generation
would not be sufficient to cover investments, as its internal cash net of debt service would contribute
only about 7% on average to investments.
5.16       PC2's debt service coverage in the past has been adequate because borrowings have not
been a significant source of financing. The financial projections show that with the restructuring of
PC2's capital base and implementation of adequate tariffs, the debt service coverage would be between
2.8 times to 41.7 times during the projected period. With a view to maintaining debt service at
acceptable levels, agreement was reached at negotiations with the Borrower and PC2 that PC2 would
not incur additional debt unless a reasonable forecast shows that its estimated internally generated cash,
after expenditure for each year, during the term of the debt to be incurred shall be at least 1.5 times its
total estimated debt service requirements in such years, including the debt to be incurred.
5.17       The bulk of PC3's project construction will be carried out in FY94-97 and about 71% of
the capital investment will be made in these years. PC3 will have no further major capital expenditures
beyond 1997 and will not require any cash generation except for meeting debt service and working
capital requirements. PC3's long term loans would require debt service payments of D 995 billion over
the projected period. The financial projections show that PC3's internal cash generation (operating
profit less income tax plus depreciation), before debt service, would be about D 2,133 billion which
would enable PC3 to service its debt from its internal sources without recourse to additional borrowing.
PC3's debt service coverage is estimnated to be negative in PY94 but will increase to 10.2 times in
FY95 and gradually decline to a normal level as debt servicing to finance expenditures commences from
FY96. Agreement was reached at negotiations with the Borrower and PC3 that PC3 would in each year
beginning FY95, achieve a debt service coverage of not less than 1.3 times in respect of its operations.



CHAPTER VI
Project Justification
A. Economic Analysis
6.1        Development of the power sector is crucial for the economic upliftment of Viet Nam.
Implementation of the proposed project would help ensure the country's continued economic growth.
While providing the much needed capital for investment, the project would make a significant
contribution towards improving the efficiency of the power sector, in terms of reducing fuel costs,
reducing losses and improving system operation and control - all proven measures to achieve benefits at
the lowest cost. Other project benefits would be strengthening of the power sector institutions, preparing
them to handle efficiently the requirements of a rapidly growing system, and moving them towards
market-oriented approaches.
Conversion of Ba Ria Open Cycle Turbines to Combined Cycle Operation
6.2        Although the commissioning of the 500 kV North-South link has temporarily eased power
shortages in the South, the rapid demand growth is expected to put renewed pressure on generating
capacity within the next 2-3 years. An assessment of PC2's generation requirements by consultants
shows the need for addition of base load capacity in PC2's system by 1996-1997. Even with the
addition of 57 MW steam capacity at Ba Ria (proposed under the project), the system reserve would be
insufficient to back up the 500 kV link and load shedding can be expected at times when the link fails.
6.3        The availability of offshore gas at Ba Ria from mid 1995 at a price of about US$2.0 per
MMBTU (economic cost about US$1.3 per MMBTU) strengthens the justification for converting Ba Ria
to a base load station. An assessment of the annuitized costs of different options for capacity additions
(conversion of open cycle turbines to combined cycle operation, new open cycle capacity, new
combined cycle capacity - Annex 21) shows that the least-cost alternative is the conversion of three 37.5
MW turbines to combined cycle operation, by adding a 57 MW steam cycle.
6.4        The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is calculated for the least-cost option
assuming the plant running at an annual capacity factor of 68% for an economic life of 20 years. All
monetary costs and benefits are in 1994 prices. Because of the liberalized nature of foreign exchange in
Viet Nam, no adjustments are made for the shadow exchange rate. A conversion factor of 0.75 is
assumed for expenditure on labor to remove distortions of subsidies and taxes. The incremental sales
(after duly allowing for all losses) represent the benefits of the project; these are valued at tariffs
progressively reaching 7 USc/kWh by 1999 as proposed by the Government. The cost streams consist
of the capital expenditure (foreign - US$62.82 million; local - US$6.26 million) and the annual
operation and maintenance costs of US$1.73 million (2.5% of capital cost). As the steam turbine will
use waste heat, there is no incremental fuel cost. The EIRR is computed at 18.0% (details are at
Annex 21). A 10% increase in capital costs reduces the EIRR to 16.3%. If the tariff is maintained at
the present level of about 5 USc/kWh, the EIRR falls to 14.0%. Finally, a 12% reduction in output
(unlikely, given PC2's needs for energy and its ability to run the plant at the assumed capacity factor)
reduces the EIRR to 15.5%

6.5        The EIRR thus calculated understates the benefits to the economy, as consumer surplus
(benefit derived by consumers over and above the price for electricity) is not included. Inclusion of
consumer surplus would result in a higher EIRR, largely independent of the tariff; a lower tariff would
simply transfer the benefit from PC2 to the consumers.
Rehabilitation and Expansion of HCMC, Hue and Nhatrang Distribution Networks
6.6        The existing distribution networks in HCMC, Hue and Nhatrang are old, unreliable and
overloaded, and incur high losses (paras. 4.5, 4.7, 4.9). With the forecast rapid increase in demands,
the power companies would need to make large investments in rehabilitating the old network
components, in expanding the networks to new areas and in connecting new consumers. Part of the
reason that sales are expected to increase so rapidly is that there is substantial pent-up demand because
of shortages in generating capacity.  Detailed feasibility studies for upgrading these distribution
networks have been conducted by consultants. These studies consider: (a) the forecast demand growths;
(b) the investment requirements over the next several years for meeting the forecast demands while
upgrading the networks to acceptable levels of safety and reliability; and (c) estimates of progressive
reductions in losses and improvements in reliability (expressed in terms of unserved energy due to
outages). The following methodology is used for evaluating the EIRR for the distribution rehabilitation
and expansion projects.
6.7         The analysis assumes two scenarios: (a) "with project"; and (b) "without project". The
"with project" scenario is based on incurring the full investments (in the distribution systems and
upstream sub-transmission) for meeting the forecast demands and a progressive reduction in losses and
unserved energy. The "without project" scenario assumes that the system would be able to meet the
full forecast demand growth with zero investments but with progressive increase in losses and unserved
energy. The "without project" scenario makes the unrealistic (but overly conservative) assumption that
the existing system would be able to meet the demand growth. Incremental operation and maintenance
(O&M) costs are conservatively assumed to be the same for both the scenarios, although in the "without
project" scenario these would be much higher. The following are the main assumptions:
(a)   all costs are expressed in constant 1994 prices, making no adjustments for shadow
exchange rate and using a conversion factor of 0.75 for labor costs;
(b)  the capital investment is considered over the 1994-2000 time slice (part of which would be
funded by the proposed project);
(c)  the analysis is made over a project economic life of 25 years, with no increases in sales or
losses or improvements in reliability after 2000;
(d)  the average retail sales tariff is assumed to increase from the current level of about 5
USc/kWh to 7 USc/kWh in 1999 as proposed by the Government;
(e)  the LRMC of supply to the subtransmission level is assumed at 5 USc/kWh based on the
Bank's Energy Sector Investment and Policy Review (Report No. 10842-VN);
(f)   unserved energy is very conservatively evaluated at 10 times the tariff level;



-53-
(g)  the technical losses are valued at the LRMC of supply at the subtransmission level (non-
technical losses are not considered in the economic evaluation); and
(h)  the EIRR of the project is the discount rate at which the present value of the cost streams
of the "with project" and "without project" scenarios are equal.
6.8        The details of the economic analysis are presented in Annex 21. To test the robustness of
the EIRR for the base case, sensitivities are undertaken, relating to forecast demand growth, capital and
O&M costs and the valuation of unserved energy. The resulting EIRRs are tabulated below:
EIRR %
Case                                          HCMC        Hue        Nhatranz
Base                                          55.6%       20.3%      29.0%
Capital costs increased by 10%                51.8%       18.0%      26.0%
Demand reduced by 10%                         47.9%       16.1%      23.6%
Unserved energy valued at 5 times the tariff  51.3%       16.7%      23.7%
6.9         The results indicate robust EIRRs for all the distribution projects; the results for HCMC
being much higher than those for Hue and Nhatrang in view of the large power demand in this
metropolis. The EIRRs are likely to be underestimates because of the conservative assumptions made
about the unserved energy (both in terms of its magnitude and its evaluation) and other factors.
Load Dispatch Centers
6.10       This project component envisages the construction of Regional Load Dispatch centers for
PC1, PC2 and PC3, and strengthening of the National Load Dispatch Center. The investments are
vital; these centers will allow the introduction of SCADA and EMS systems to Viet Nam, and allow the
automation of system control and dispatch procedures that are currently performed manually. The
benefits are indeed large, but are difficult to quantify; an attempt is nevertheless made to evaluate an
order of magnitude of returns that could be expected out of the project. Since these centers will be
operated jointly to control an integrated system, it is appropriate to estimate the economic returns
jointly, rather than for each individual control center.
6.11       The benefits that can be expected to arise are: (a) improved system efficiency as a result of
better dispatch of generating plant; (b) reduction in fault clearance times on transmission lines and
consequent reduction in unserved energy due to transmission faults; (c) reduced staff numbers due to
automation of processes currently performed manually; and (d) improved quality of supply due to
reduction in the amount of uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems and voltage stabilizer equipment
purchased in the country by industry. The PCs will also be able to collect data on the operating
performance of their system far more efficiently than before, which will assist their short and long term
planning efforts; this benefit has not however been quantified. It should be noted that some of these



-54-
benefits (for example improved frequency control) will only be realized if there is disciplined grid
operation and a reasonable margin of capacity over demand.
6.12       The cost streams are the investmnent in the load dispatch centers and the annual O&M
costs, assumed at 2% of the investment. The benefits are calculated assuming: (a) an efficiency gain of
0.5% on energy generation; (b) a reduction of 20% in the volume of unserved energy due to
transmission line faults; and (c) a reduction in the purchase of UPS and voltage stabilizer equipment
equivalent to 0.1% of peak demand by the end of the project. The EIRR is estimated to be 27%;
details of the assumptions and computation are at Annex 21. Decreasing by half the benefits from a
reduction in unserved energy and in the purchase of UPS equipment produces an EIRR of 20.3%.
Energy efficiency savings alone produce an EIRR of 11.0%.
B. Risks
6.13       The project faces the following potential risks: First, delay in meeting the level of demand
growth to maintain the project's economic viability, due to delays in securing counterpart funds;
Second, delays in project implementation due to: (i) teething problems of working with international
financial institutions; and (ii) unfamiliarity with the Bank's procurement guidelines. The risk of demand
not materializing as forecast is low, as the project focuses on areas of high potential growth. The risk
of undue delays in project implementation has been minimized by extensive preparation work,
institutional strengthening measures and substantive consulting assistance in project detailed design and
construction supervision. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower would take
necessary steps to secure the funds needed for undertaking the project components.

The Power Companies No. 1 and No. 3 were established under similar decrees with the same contents.
PC3 was established on October 7, 1975 as a "connecting link" between PCI and PC2 and was taken
over from the French Company of SIPEA. PCl's original name was "Company of the North".
With Resolution No. 15-DL/TCCB3 of May 9, 1981 the power companies were named Power
Company No.1 (in the North), Power Company No.2 (in the South) and Power Company No.3 (in the
Center).
RESOLUTION No.388-HDBT
(Hanoi, the 20th of November 1991)
Under Resolution No. 388-HDBT - it is a "Temporary Resolution and the intention is, to pass a
regular law to this effect in the future - all State Enterprises, including those dealing with electric
power, had to apply for re-registration. The purpose of this procedure was to review the very large
number of State Enterprises, which had accumulated over the years, with a view to determining whether
they would be economically viable under the regime of an Open Market Policy. Following guidelines
were applied in determining viability:
1.   Companies had to be in a position to operate in the sector they had been operating before.
2.   Prospects had to be good for preserving and maintaining the capital entrusted to them by the
State.
3.   They had to be in a position to carry out the duties and responsibilities entrusted to them by the
State.
4.   Adequate staffing and a suitable organization had to be in place.
5.   The companies had to be in a position to preserve their assets and to satisfy their market.
In the case of the power companies, the Ministry of Energy (MOE) had to submit the application for re-
registration.
The process of re-registration was originally envisaged as follows:
1.   Enterprises with a considerable amount of assets)"
(a)   Review by the Chairman of the Planning Commission.
(b)   Decision by the Prime Minister.
I1 No definision was given on what constitutes a 'Considerable Amount of Assets".



-70-
Annex 4
Page 6 of 7
2.   "Smaller" amount of assets
(a) For centrally-owned companies the Chairman of the Planning Commission was to decide
on re-registration of State Enterprises.
(b)   For provincially-owned companies the Minister of Economics was to decide on re-
registration of State Enterprises.
After approval of the re-registration, a company had to register with the Government ("economic
authority") within 60 days. After this registration the State Enterprise acquired its status of a new
juridical entity. Within 7 days after registration the "economic authority" had to send the necessary
papers to the tax authorities, to the Ministry of Finance and to the Ministry of Statistics.
Within 30 days of registration the State Enterprise had to announce in the official gazette - on five
consecutive days - the particulars of its juridical person, such as name, headquarters, name of bank
connection and account number, date of start of operations, sector of operations, etc.
Subsequently,
RESOLUTION No.393/CT
(Hanoi, the 25th of November 1991)
was published and stipulated the following:
All State Enterprises, for which it has been decided that they be abolished, must discontinue operation
during the first quarter of 1992. Those which remain under new registry must be re-established by the
end of the second quarter 1992. By January 31, 1992 all State Enterprises had to report their intention
to re-register. They have to carry a new seal.
RESOLUTION No. 156/HDBT
ADDENDUM TO RESOLUTION No. 388-HDBT
(Hanoi, the 7th of May 1992)
In modification of Resolution No. 388, it was decreed that, before reviewing a State Enterprise, a
SELECTION COMMITTEE has to be established. Unlike in the basic resolution where the Prime
Minister decides about a State Company's re-registration after recommendation by the Chairman of the
State Planning Commission, the Prime Minister decides, in the case of a comnpany with sizeable amount
of assets, on the recommendation of the Selection Committee (the Committee consists of the State
Planning Conunission and members of the Ministry concerned). In the case of smaller enterprises with



-71-
Annex 4
Page 7 of 7
CENTRAL ownership, a similar selection committee reviews, the Prime Minister decides and
concerned Minister signs the establishment paper. In the case of smaller enterprises with REGIONAL
ownership, the Minister of Economics and Technology reviews and decides. The Chairman of the City
Council signs the establishment paper.
RESOLUTION No. 147-TTG of April 7, 1993 re-established Power Company No. 2 with a Capital of
Dong 3,831,204,000,000.
RESOLUTION No. 148-TTG of April 7, 1993 re-established Power Company No. 3 with a Capital of
Dong 707,607,000,000.
The production and consumption of electricity in the country is regulated with the following directive:
DIRECTIVE No. 80-HDBT
ON SUPPLY AND USE OF POWER
(Hanoi, the 18th of July 1983)
I.    GENERAL
HI.   Conditions of Supply and Use of Power
A.   Regulation
B.   Basic technical conditions, such as cosphi, capacity factor, etc.
C.   Meter reading
D.   Invoicing and Control
m.  Area of Control of Power Facilities. The relevant paragraphs cover the subject of electric power
from generation to consumption.
IV.  Responsibilities and Limitations of Supply. Basically, the power companies are required to offer
safe, uninterrupted supply. In case of major maintenance requirements, customers must be
notified 10 days in advance. In case of emergency, PCs have access to any premise at anytime.
By breach of a supply contract, a monetary compensation of five times the electricity not
provided is foreseen; the same applies to damages caused by voltage surges. Force majeure is,
of course, excluded.
V.   Responsibilities of Users. Resale of electricity is basically not allowed. Repair of power facilities
is exclusively the responsibility of the power companies. Theft of electricity is a criminal
offense.

Power Company No. 2 and No. 3
Billing and Collection System
A. Background
1.           Power Company no. 2 (PC2) and Power Company no. 3 (PC3) have 19 and 11 power
service subsidiaries, respectively, located in different provinces. Depending on its physical size, each
province also has a number of collection branches. PC2 services approximately 700,000 customers out
of a total population of about 28 million in an area covering 22% of the country. PC3 services 158,270
customers out of total population of approximately 11 million in an area covering 33 % of the country.
B. Metering
2.           PC2 and PC3 meter reading procedures are similar. Meter readers, who report to the
head of the power service subsidiary, play an important role in the process of recording the usage of
power. All new meter readers go through a short training course. They need to be meticulous and
must possess legible handwriting.
3.           A meter reader has the following records:
(a)    Meter Card: this card, which is replaced every 4 years in the case of PC2, is attached
to the meter;
(b)    Consunmtion Report: this report, furnished by the computer centers of PC2 and PC3,
provides customer information such as the name and address, type of business, previous
consumption, current consumption, etc. At each power service subsidiary, the report is
assigned to the meter reader on a daily basis at the start of a working day and in
accordance with a schedule of meter reading. The meter reader visits the customers
following the order of information provided on the report. At the end of the day, the
meter reader reports back to the supervisor and submits the following: (i) consumption
report; (ii) letters of grievances from customers; (iii) report on addresses which could
not be found; and (iv) report on notices left at the places of absent customers.
4.           Meter reading is done once every month, usually on the same day of the month. In
addition, the meter reader is responsible for: (a) comparing the current consumption of power against
the previous period; (b) reporting defective meters; and (c) reporting theft of power.
5.           In urban areas, meter readers read an average of 70 meters each day. At the end of the
day, they bring back the consumption reports to the power service subsidiary to have the data entered
by the staff of the computer center. In rural areas, they read about 30 meters each day and bring back
the consumption reports every five or six days to the power service subsidiary.

C. Billing
Power Company No. 2
6.              The billing system  of PC2, which is computerized  includes: (a) computation of
consumption of electricity; and (b) invoices produced in the month following the consumption period.
7.              The Data Processing Center, located in Ho Chi Minh City, is responsible for this
process which is generated using a Bull mainframe with an older IBM mainframe as a back-up. The 19
power service subsidiaries submit the following information to the Data Processing Center: (a)
consumption diskettes: (data from the consumption reports are entered and stored on diskettes by the
computer staff at the power service subsidiaries); (b) notices on new customers; (c) notices on
customers who have terminated their contracts with PC2; and (d) notices of changes such as customers'
names, new meters.
8.              The power service subsidiaries reviews the data carefully before submitting them to the
Data Processing Center which then coordinates with the Commerce Department who verifies the data
before processing them. Information is submitted in accordance with a pre-arranged schedule between
the Data Processing Center and the power service subsidiaries. For the Ho Chi Minh City power
service subsidiary, the Data Processing Center follows a 24-day cycle of producing invoices for
residential customers and an 8 day-cycle for non-residential customers.
9.              The PC2 invoice has three detachable parts. A sample is illustrated below:

Power Company No. 3
11.             The computer center of each power service subsidiary is responsible for the computation
of consumption of electricity and the issuance of invoices. Invoices are produced in the month
following the consumption period. The computer center of each power service subsidiary is linked
through a dedicated line to the computer center of the head office located in Danang. This allows the
Finance Department at the head office to follow the billing system in the provinces. The PC3 invoice

D. Collection
Power Company No. 2
12.             The collection system includes the following:
(a)     A  Mobile Collection Unit which is comprised of supervisors and mobile collectors.
Every morning, before going on their route, the mobile collectors are assigned a
number of invoices together with a list of customers. At the end of the day, they report
back to the supervisor the following: (i) the arnount collected from customers or the
bank receipts in the case where the mobile collectors deposit directly their collections
into PC2's account at the bank; (ii) the stubs of invoices (third detachable portion)
already paid by customers; and (iii) the invoices for customers who are absent.



-75-
Annex 5
Page 4 of 5
(b)    A Branch Collection Unit comprised of supervisors, bill controllers, and branch
collectors. If customers are absent, the mobile collectors leave a notice (first detachable
portion) to the customers to pay at the nearest branch. At the end of the day, the
branch collectors remit the collections to the supervisor or deposit them directly into
PC2's bank account. The bill controllers keep track of the list of customers whose
power service may be discontinued due to overdue payments.
(c)    A Bank Collection Unit responsible for collections done through auto-payments,
payment authorizations, and checks.
(d)    A Bill-Cancellation and Follow-Up Unit which follows up on the payment and non-
payment of each invoice and cancels the paid invoices from its books. It coordinates
with the bill controllers and the bill collectors in cases of extended overdue payments.
(e)    A Receivables Unit responsible for controlling the receipts and expenses. It reports the
movements of entries to and from PC2's bank account.
13.           On average, it takes one week between the time the meter reader visits the customer and
the time the mobile collector delivers the electricity bill to the customer. The customer has to pay the
bill within eight days. If the bill is not paid within eight days, the mobile collector leaves another
notice at the customer's place, giving the customer a grace period of one t6 three days to pay his bill
before the service is discontinued. The mobile collector returns for a third time to the customer's place
to collect the bill within that time limit. If he is unsuccessful, the bill controllers will issue an order to
the customers' service to disconnect the service within 24 hours for residential customers and within
three days for non-residential customers.

14.           Mobile collectors deliver the electricity bills to the customers following a routing
schedule. If the customers are not present, the collectors leave behind a notice (first detachable portion
of the bill). The customers have to pay the bills within five days. If the bills are not paid within that
time limit, the collectors deliver a second notice indicating that the power service will be disconnected
if the bills are not paid within three days. The mobile collectors return to collect from the customers a
third time within that time limit. If the collection is unsuccessful, power service will be disconnected
within 24 hours for residential customers and within three to five days for non-residential customers.
15.           At the end of every day, the collections from the power service subsidiaries and from
the collection branches are deposited into the bank accounts of PC3 in the provinces. Deposits from
main collection branches are transferred from bank branches to PC3's main bank account in Da Nang
each day. Deposits from smaller collection branches are transferred only every three days. Unpaid
invoices are usually from state enterprises which have been dissolved and especially from agricultural
provinces experiencing bad harvest. Under these special circumstances, PC3 may continue to provide
power and request the State to recognize the bad debt. For example in February 1994, the State wrote-
off a bad debt amounting to D 300 million carried by PC3 for the agricultural province of Quang Binh.

E. Methods of payment
16.          The methods of payment to PC2 and PC3 are as follows:
(a)    Cash collected from the customers either at their residences or at the collection
branches. This method is the most popular among residential customers.
(b)    Auto-Payment which is initiated by the customer's bank for the benefit of PC2 and PC3
usually on the same date of the month and upon receipt of the electricity bill. This
method of payment is specified in the contract between the customers and the power
companies. This method is exclusively for corporate customers who have stable
earnings.
(c)    Pavment Authorization where the customer issues a payment authorization to PC2 and
PC3 to collect at the customer's bank. This method is used by most of the companies.
(d)    Checks

power sector and consumers' ability and willingness to pay;
(iii)  review the adequacy or otherwise of the existing tariff both in terms of level and structure
based on the tariff policy developed in (ii) above and by drawing on, where appropriate,
experience with tariff levels and structure of other power utilities of the region;
(iv)  review the desirability and practicability of having a uniform tariff throughout the country
and the need and justification for special adjustments to cater for the needs of each region;
(v)  review the billing and collection capabilities of the power companies and determine the
extent to which these capabilities may affect the implementation of a revised tariff
structure; and recommend suitable improvements;
(vi)  review the desirability of introducing an automatic fuel adjustment clause in the tariff
structure;
(vii)  formulate and recormmend an appropriate tariff structure which is consistent with the tariff
policy in (ii) above, the billing and collection capabilities of the power conlpanies, and

Power Sector Rehabilitation and Expansion Project
Power Sector Reform and Restructuring
Terms of Reference for ESMAP Technical Assistance
A. Background & Project Objectives
1.         The Government of Vietnam is currently developing proposals for a major structural
change in the power sector. On January 1, 1995, the govermnent created The General Company of
Electricity of Vietnam, by decree number 562/Ttg, dated October 10, 1995. The General Company is
an independent juridical entity with the legal name of Electricity of Vietnam (EVN). The legal charter
of EVN laying out the exact scope of its responsibilities and the organizational boundaries under it, is
yet to be defined. Tentative proposals envisage the creation of multiple independent accounting and
legal entities in the core operational areas of generation, transmission and distribution. The Ministry of
Energy has developed a draft charter that is under review and discussion by the Government of
Vietnam.
2.         The objective of this technical assistance activity are to assist the Government in the
following tasks:
(a)   Defining the structural and implementation details for the sector transformation under
EVN. This will involve the clarification of the applicable principles and organizational
options for sector reform and modernization to achieve the Government's objective of
moving the administration of the power sector from central planning mechanism to those
that are more market oriented.
(b)   Preparation of a draft grid code that would allow for the integrated and reliable operation
of the transmission system, and also facilitate increased operational efficiency.
(c)   Define the requirements for the legal and regulatory framework based on the proposed
sector structure that are necessary to separate the distinct roles of asset ownership,
enterprise management and sector regulation. The government currently performs all
three functions without the necessary arms-length separation. While the government
would continue to perform a large part of these functions in the medium-term, the need
for a credible regulatory framework has been recognized. This legal and regulatory
framework would also assist in the paving the ways for future private sector involvement
in the sector.
3.         The technical assistance would be conducted in a participatory, interactive environment by
means of Action Planning Sessions/Workshops under the guidance of a Steering Committee and the
participation of a Working Group of commnitted working-level Vietnamese counterparts from the various
Government Ministries, the State Planning Committee, the Institute of Energy and the three existing
power companies.



-82-
Annex 8
Page 2 of 3
B. Scope of Work
4.         This technical assistance will be provided in an interactive environment that is responsive
to the priority needs of the Vietnamese Government, at a time when major reforms are under
consideration and implementation. A Vietnamese Working Group comprised of about 15 experts from
the different entities in the power sector will be established to work with the ESMAP team on a day-to-
day basis. A series of presentations, discussion and action planning workshops will be used to facilitate
this interaction. A Steering Committee comprised of members from key government ministries an
agencies will oversee the technical assistance.
5.         A study tour to UK, France, Malaysia and China will be organized to allow members of
the Working Group and other Vietnamese officials to evaluate first-hand the institutional structures in
place in these countries, as well as to hold discussions with officials in these countries to gain an
appreciation for the implementation challenges.
6.         In May 1995, a Workshop will be held in Vietnam, where the Working Groups will
present their recommendations to high-level policy makers from the Vietnamese Government. The
Workshop will include international experts who will provide their views on the recommendations made
by the Working Group.
7.         During the interactive sessions with the Working Group the ESMAP team will be prepared
to discuss and provide advice in the following topics:
(a)   objective of reform;
(b)   overview of power sector reform: reasons for reform, reform as a process;
(c)   framework for understanding power sector reform: modes of ownership and control,
vertical integration of activities, competition and monopoly, industry concentration,
international experience;
(d)   structural options for power sector organization: key issues concerning structural reform,
general principles concerning structural reform;
(e)  the process of enterprise reform: commercialization and corporatization of the power
entities, sequencing and transitional arrangements;
(f)   key issues in gauging financial performance of the sector.  Options for diversifying
financing for power sector development;
(g)   key issues in legal and regulatory reform. Relationship of regulatory reform to structural
reform; and
(h)   reforms to facilitate private sector participation in the sector.

C. Organization of Work & Outputs
8.         This activity will be supervised and coordinated by a "Steering Committee" of high-level
Vietnamese officials from all agencies involved in the power sector reform process, including but not
limited to the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Finance, the Institute of Energy (MOE), the State
Planning Committee including representation from the Department of Enterprise Reform, the State
Committee on Pricing, and from the Reform Committee under the Government's Office. The Steering
Committee will oversee this technical assistance activity.
9.         A Working Group of about 15 Vietnamese experts will be formed by the Steering
Committee. The Working Group will be responsible for the daily interaction with the ESMAP team.
The Chairman of the Working Group will be responsible to the Steering Committee and keep them
abreast of the progress of work.  For the Working Group, it would be appropriate to have
representation from the three power Companies: PCI, PC2 and PC3; from the Power Investigation and
Design Company No. 1 (PIDCI); the Institute of Energy and from the MOE.
10.        To prepare for the discussions with the ESMAP team the Working Group will collect
material relevant to the reform effort in the power sector and prepare a Background Paper. The
Background Paper will also articulate the Government's reform objectives, and clarify the current
institutional and policy directions. During the extended first interactive session with the Working
Group (3-weeks in February 1995), the ESMAP team will prepare presentations and written material in
topics/areas as required by the Working Group and the ESMAP Task Manager.
1.         The Government will be responsible for the selection of participants to the Study Tour. In
this regard, it is important to select the appropriate participants so that upon return they would be
empowered to act on the experiences and the lessons learned during the Study Tour, The ESMAP team
will assist in making arrangements if deemed necessary for the study tour which best provided for the
substantive needs and interests of the Vietnamese experts.
12.        The Working Group with the assistance of the ESMAP team, will prepare a draft report to
be presented at the final Workshop in May 1995. This interim report will reflect their findings of the
study tour, in addition to the results of discussions with the ESMAP team. After the final Workshop,
the Working Group with the assistance of the ESMAP team will prepare a Final Report that will be
presented to the Steering Committee for further action.
13.        In particular reference to the final Workshop, it is understood that Vietnamese counterparts
are responsible for the coordination of activities in Viet Nam including inter alia venue, organization,
translation, logistics, etc. It is also understood that a strong commitment is required from the Steering
Committee and particularly by the Working Group for an extensive effort throughout this ESMAP
activity and beyond so that the recommendations as embodied in the Final Report can be put into
practice.

Demand Side Management
Terms of Reference for Consulting Study
Background
The Energy/Electricity Sector
1.         Growth in electricity demand has been over 9% p.a. for the last 12 years and this rate is
expected to be sustained over the next decade. This growth has been greatest in the residential sector in
urban areas though it has been high in all sectors. Continued rapid growth is expected as a result of:
(a) rapid industrial growth, particularly in the south; and (b) growth in urban residential and
commercial demand, particularly in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
2.         Much of industry in Viet Nam does not utilize modem energy use technology and there
are great opportunities for savings through improving energy efficiency. However, the opportunities
for simple retrofitting may be limited in some heavy industry by the needs for major investments in new
production facilities to become internationally competitive. The capital base of Viet Nam industry is
expected to more than double in the next decade so attention is needed to ensure that Viet Nam does not
install technology which has lowest capital cost and unnecessarily high ongoing energy/electricity
demands. Attention is also required to address the rapidly increasing use of electricity in the residential
and commercial sectors. While electricity in the residential sector is largely used for lighting and
cooking, increased use of appliances can be expected with increasing living standards particularly in Ho
Chi Minh City and Hanoi.
3.         There has been very limited application of energy efficiency measures and other demand
side management activities to date, although there is a growing awareness of the need for Demand Side
Management (DSM) in government and utility circles. If the demand for electricity is not controlled,
the requirement for additional investments in the power sector will put an unbearable debt burden on the
Viet Namn economy.
Study Objectives
4.         The main objective of this study is to identify DSM components that could be considered
for financing under an IDA energy sector credit. To this end, and, with particular emphasis on the
south of the country where there are current shortfalls in supply capacity, the immediate objectives
would be to (i) identify a menu of DSM opportunities in the industrial, commercial and residential
sectors; (ii) prioritize and evaluate these DSM sector alternatives, based on their energy sector impact
and cost effectiveness; (iii) define an appropriate institutional and regulatory framework for DSM
program implementation and (iv) introduce a resource planning approach (e.g. IRP) which would permit
the cost-effective assessment of all supply and demand energy resource options.



-104-
Annex 10
Page 2 of 4
Study Scope
Phase I: Identify DSM Opportunities
5.         Data Collection Phase I would begin with a determination of the quality of the existing
data on electricity consumption and electric appliance/equipment ownership patterns and trends by
region (e.g. north and south) in the industrial, residential and commercial sectors. Where the existing
data is inadequate, data collection and analysis surveys/audits would be designed and implemented.
6.         Institutional Capabilitv  An assessment will be carried out of major public and private
sector institutions and supporting entities in the electricity sector that would have a role in implementing
DSM/Energy Conservation Programs. This assessment would include, but not be limited to an analysis
of the organization, staffing and training requirements of the principal concerned entities to design,
implement, monitor and evaluate DSM programs; assessment of educational and technical institutes (if
available) that train architects, engineers, economists, market researchers and the potential to
introduce/strengthen energy conservation/efficiency topics in their curricula; the capability of the local
architectural and engineering community to incorporate energy efficient practices and equipment; a
determination of the local capacity to manufacture components and/or assemble energy efficient
equipment as well as manufacture complete units; the extent of tariffs, duties, import restrictions on
energy development; and the availability of equipment testing facilities in Viet Nam to assist in the
development of equipment standards and building codes.
7.         Technical Potential Assessment  Based on an analysis of the data collected, DSM
opportunities would be identified and assessed according to their technical feasibility. This menu of
DSM options must include all sectors of the economy (with particular emphasis on the industrial sector,
including processes and motors) and will examine actions that will improve the structure and efficiency
of both existing and future loads (e.g. new industrial and commercial development; new appliance
ownership in the residential and small-scale commercial sectors), and load management options that
would alleviate the need for mandatory load curtailment. Based upon generally available energy
efficient equipment and practices that are compatible with the operating characteristics of the Viet Nam
grid, an estimate will be made of the arnount of energy savings (both in terms of GWh and MW) that
could be achieved, under the assumption that there are no constraints on customer acceptance and
program imnplementation.
8.         Identification of Cost-Effective DSM Measures An estimate will be made of that portion
of the DSM technical potential identified in para. 13 above that could be achieved cost effectively. This
analysis will also take into account the existing political and cultural structures as well as regional
differences (north and south). While appropriate tests for measuring the cost-effectiveness of various
DSM measures have not yet been introduced in Viet Nam, it can be assumed that tests such as the Total
Resource Cost Test (TRC), the Utility Test and Customer Test would be used to evaluate cost
effectiveness from a variety of perspectives. This would provide the Govermunent with information to
begin to formulate feasible DSM programs and implementation arrangements.



-105-
Annex 10
Page 3 of 4
Phase Il: Development of DSM Programs
9.         Based on the results of Phase 1, a set of possible DSM programs, consisting of one or
more cost-effective DSM measures, will be identified. Each program will then be evaluated to
determine its cost-effectiveness relative to the avoided long run marginal costs of new supply
investments. Programs will be ranked according to their relative cost-effectiveness and impact on
system demand. The next step will be to select DSM programs and determine the specific issues
involved in successful implementation of these programs in Viet Nam and how these should be
addressed to ensure the programs deliver the expected benefits and then to identify a Preliminary
Implementation Plan which will determine a broad potential timetable and plan for implementation of
the program.
Determine Institutional Needs
10.        Review the institution structures and supports required for the ongoing review and
implementation of DSM. This would include definition of a framework to best: set policies and
coordinate the program at government level; manage and implement the program; support the program
on an ongoing basis; and involve private sector in DSM activities. This component would include
coverage of: organizational structure; staffing levels and qualifications; stiff functions, qualifications
and training needs;  foreign and local technical assistance and training inputs; requirements for
implementing a methodology within the utilities for evaluation of DSM opportunities and integrated
resource planning for generation, transmission and distribution investments; and the requirements for a
review of demand forecasting approaches.
Determine Needs for Regulation
I1.        Evaluate the application of regulations for minimum efficiency codes and standards and
labelling energy intensive packaged residential, commercial and industrial equipment. Determine the
impact that this would have on local manufacture of this equipment and support that could be provided
for local firms to meet these standards. Also examine the needs for electricity tariff modifications to
ensure that economical DSM can be taken up more effectively.
Examine Financial Mechanisms for DSM
12.        Analyze funding mechanisms most suitable for Viet Nam and recommend appropriate
mechanisms for financing the program elements. Recommend allocation of funds to various program
components (such as program design; implementation hardware and operational costs, training, database
development and program evaluation etc)
Establish Monitoring, Evaluation and Database Structure
13.        Determine the most appropriate way for the establishment of an energy use database to
overcome the existing shortage of data. Recommend mechanisms for the monitoring of program
performance for each of the major DSM programs recommended.



-106-
Annex 10
Page 4 of 4
Evaluate Teclmology Transfer and Training Needs
14.        Determine the requirements for training and technology transfer in energy efficient
technologies in Viet Nam for both industry and commerce as well as for potential services providers.
Review the best way that these services can be provided and sustained. Address the application of
information and education programs and the best way of implementing them in Viet Nam.
15.        Determine the impact of technology intervention program on imports, the viability of local
manufacturing and potential for local technology development and manufacture, and assess the benefits
of demonstration projects.
16.        This study should provide a high level of expertise transfer of skills in DSM  policy
development and DSM program design (identification/evaluationlimplementation/monitoring).
DSM Components for IDA Financing
17.        Development of discrete components for financing under the IDA credit.

Power Sector Rehabilitation and Expansion Project
Power Sector: Institutional Strengthening
Terms of Reference for Consulting Study
A. Background
1.         The Vietnamese power sector is currently  undergoing  a significant structural
transformation. This structural change would involve the creation of an umbrella power enterprise (i.e.
Electricity of Vietnam, EVN) that would supervise the operations of subordinate entities engaged in the
core activities of generation, transmission and distribution.
2.         This technical assistance (TA) project has been designed to assist the restructured entities
in meeting the operational and management challenges of this complex structural change.  The
realization of efficiency gains at the enterprise level is a key objective of the exercise. The consulting
services to be financed under this technical assistance component would develop a masterplan for
implementing internal changes in organization, and the corresponding accounting, budgeting, and
financial management systems, within the restructured power system in Viet Nnam. These changes will
reflect the principles of increasing management autonomy and accountability, and improving the flow of
cost and financial information to assist management in its operational and financial decisions.
3.         Two complementary initiatives are planned to assist the Ministry of Energy (MOE) in
restructuring the power sector, and improving the accounting systems and practices of the constituent
power entities. The first, which is currently underway, is the Power Sector Reform and Restructuring
Study. This effort is intended to assist MOE/EVN in developing a framework and sequence for
reforming the power sector. The second program of technical assistance, under ADB funding, is
intended to improve the financial and accounting systems in the power sector. To achieve the full
benefits of organizational reform and improved financial reporting and monitoring systems, it is crucial
that this technical assistance component be closely integrated with the above activities from the outset.
B. Scope of Work
4.         The overall scope of work is to develop practical and clearly defined recommendations for
organizational reforms, and the introduction of modem financial management practices and systems in
the subordinate power entities under EVN. In addressing this issue, the underlying principle is to
improve the operational efficiency and financial viability of the various business units and entities
related to EVN.
5.         In view of the need to develop a coherent approach to the intended organizational reform
and introduction of new financial and accounting management systems, the work is divided into two
phases:



-108-
Annex II
Page 2 of 4
Phase 1:
6.         Development of workplan to meet the objective of Phase 2 (below) based on the outputs of
the May 1995 sector restructuring workshop, and more importantly on the final approval of the draft
charter for EVN by the Government of Viet Nam which will lay out the boundaries of the different
operational entities under EVN. This workplan will:
(a)   establish the key client working groups who will work closely with the consultants on a
day-to-day basis. The designated Vietnamese staff will be identified by the relevant
institutions and will work with the Consultant for the duration of the technical assistance
component.
(b)   outline the information requirements, and program of field visits.
(c)   develop in consultation with the ADB-funded consultant team a viable program  for
collaboration to avoid any unnecessary overlap and repetition of tasks.
Phase 2:
7.         Preparation of a Masterplan recommending appropriate organizational and management
structures of the subordinate entities under EVN. The main focus of this Masterplan would be to
recommend: (a) appropriate levels and procedures for consolidating accounting statements and balance
sheets of the subordinate power entities under EVN; (b) the organization of line and staff functions of
the newly defined entities; and (c) the operational, financial and MIS reporting requirements within and
between the new entities.
8.         As the ADB-funded technical assistance will be closely related to this phase of work, close
collaboration will be maintained at all times with the ADB funded consultant team.
The detailed scope of this masterplan is as follows:
(a)  redefinition of the functional boundaries of the different departments, work units and
subsidiaries within each independent and dependent accounting entity under EVN. This
could include the merging, separation or elimination of certain functions.
Correspondingly, this could involve the strengthening or expansion of certain functions,
e.g. financial operations at the level of EVN and the main generation and transmission
companies.
(b)   redefinition of job functions/descriptions as appropriate to fit the recommended
reorganization. The conunuication and reporting channels should also be defined.
Close working group sessions with managers and staff will be required to make sure that
the developments are totally in conformity with their needs.
(c)   redefinition of accounting units and activities, reporting requirements, formats for
information flow and frequency of such information exchange. This task will develop a
basic design for the new financial and accounting information system. It is of crucial



-109-
Annex 11
Page 3 of 4
importance that this basic design of the financial and accounting management information
system be totally consistent with the proposed reorganization of business processes and
procedures.
(d)   development of a financial planning system, including the introduction of operational
objectives and planned allocation of resources in the form of operating expense budgets
and capital expenditure budgets, and the frequency of issuance.
(e)  redefinition of the process of setting performance targets, and the systems for controlling
and monitoring them in practice. This would include policies and procedures, related
analytical techniques, and mechanical tools to ensure project planning, formulation,
justification, management and control of budgets, including analysis of budget variances.
It is once again of crucial importance that this be completely integrated with the
management/financial information system that is to developed.
(f)  improving the planning and control of operational support functions or central service
functions, such as, maintenance and work planning/preparation, materials management,
procurement, quality control, transportation, personnel management, etc.
(g)   preparation of a detailed scope of tasks and a clearly defined implementation strategy for
the adoption of the above recommendations. The implementation strategy will be divided
into monitorable actions and targets with a timetable. Identification and definition of
training needs and specific programs for imparting this training to the staff and
management of the different power sector entities.
9.         The TA's scope would cover the following main heads:  (a) Strategic Planning and
Organizational Structure; (b) Management Information and Budgeting Systems (MIS); Computerizing
and Data Processing; (c) Cost and Financial Accounting Systems (this aspect is being covered by an
ADB funded study and only coordination is required under this TA); (d) Human Resource
Development; (e) Materials Management; (f) Financial Management; and (g) Customer Relations.
Plan of Work
10.        Execution of the TA will be based on collaboration and consultation between the
Consultant(s) and designated staff of the power companies and MOE concerned with organizational and
management matters. To this end, the bulk of the institutional strengthening tasks should be carried out
in Viet Nam. The designated Vietnamese staff will be identified by the relevant institutions prior to the
start-up of this component and will work with the Consultant(s) for the duration of the component.
11.        The Consultant(s) will prepare two Reports: a preliminary report of their findings and
recommendations which would be discussed with the Vietnamese authorities and IDA. A draft Final
Report would be submitted, taking into account the outputs of the complimentary TAs and would be
finalized, taking into account the views of the Vietnamese authorities and IDA.

Tasks
12.        The following main tasks are visualized: (a) review  the existing organization and
mianagement structures of the power companies, including the structure of all major functional units,
taking into account their tasks and inter-organizational relationships; (b) identify weaknesses, if any, in
the existing organizational structure and recommend changes keeping in mind the: (i) purposes and
objectives of the organization; (ii) functional areas to be covered; (iii) specialization and division of
work; (iv) line and staff functions and (v) the need to formalize reporting relationships and lines of
authority; (c) assess the staffing pattern and recruitment needs to determine and classify the various
positions required and prepare a staffing proposal based on the recommnended organizational structures
and interrelationships; (d) prepare job specifications and job manuals setting out suitable qualifications
and experience for various categories of employees; (e) review and analyze technical practices and
operating procedures and recommend systems aimed at making those technical practices more uniform;
(f) review and analyze current financial management practices, recommend changes as required and
identify training needs to upgrade existing skills; and (g) analyze the information system in place and
recommend adjustments thereto, or alternatively introduce a management information system
appropriate to the power company's size and stage of development which will include inter-alia: (i)
information to be collected, where when and by whom; (ii) design of various reporting fornats for
different functional departments including construction, generation, transmission distribution,
commercial, personnel, statistical and administrative; (iii) flow of reports; (iv) procedures for synthesis
and analysis of reports; (v) procedures for follow-up action and; (vi) comprehensive review of the
organization, practices and procedures used by the power company's commercial and administrative
departments; (h) review and recommend improvements to the power companies' (i) administrative
procedures; and (ii) internal control systems, rules and regulations to cover establishment of procedures,
adequacy and direction of communication flow and gaps therein, inter-department relationships and
duplication of actions; and (i) maintain at all times a liaison with the ADB-funded study on cost and
financial accounting systems.
13.        The Government would provide accommodation and office facilities to expatriate advisors,
interpretation/translation services and local travel.

Section 1
Introduction
A. The Project
1.         The Power Sector Rehabilitation and Expansion Project (the Project) includes inter-alia
rehabilitation and expansion of medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) electricity distribution
networks, comprising construction of MV and LV lines (overhead and underground) and MV/LV
substations in Ho Chi Minh City (Part A. 1 of the Project) and in Hue and Nhatrang (Part B. 1 of the
Project) to be undertaken by the PC2 and PC3, respectively. A separate Resettlement Action Plan for
the 220kv Krongbuk-Nhatrang power transmission line and 220kv terminal substations at Krongbuck
and Nhatrang (Part B. 1 of the Project) has been prepared by PC3 and approved by the Government of
the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, dated March 27, 1995.
B. Distribution System Resettlement Action Plan Phase 1 (RAP-1)
2.         Every effort will be made to expand the distribution network under Parts A. 1 and B. 1 of
the Project by utilizing the land already available with PC2 and PC3 (along existing routes). In
exceptional circumstances acquisition of additional land and/or houses and the resettlement of people
losing the totality of their land and/or houses or a significant part thereof would be unavoidable.
However, the final routing of lines and location of new substations, which may require acquisition of
land and/or houses would be finalized during the detailed design stage under Project implementation.
To adequately address compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation of the people to be affected by
these Parts of the Project (PAPs), the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been divided into Phase 1
RAP (RAP-1) and Phase 2 RAP (RAP-2). This is the Phase-i RAP.
3.         The principle objective of the RAP is to ensure that all PAPs will be compensated and
rehabilitated to assist them to improve, or at least maintain, their living conditions and income earning
capacity at the pre-Project levels.
4.         This RAP-I has been prepared by the PC2 and PC3 and approved by the Government of
the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on March 27, 1995. It lays down the principles and objectives,
legal and institutional framework, modes of compensation and rehabilitation, peoples participation
features and grievances procedures that will guide the resettlement and rehabilitation of the (PAPs).
Each of PC2 and PC3 will prepare a RAP-2 for Parts A. 1 and B. 1 of the Project, respectively. Each
RAP-2 will include: (a) results of the census and socio-economic survey of the PAPs and properties to
be affected; (b) detailed compensation and/or resettlement and rehabilitation entitlements of various
categories of PAPs; (c) a timetable for implementation of the RAP-2; (d) allocation of the institutional
responsibilities for implementation; (e) a detailed budget for funding the various compensation and
rehabilitation measures; and (f) internal and external monitoring arrangements.
5.         The census and socio-economic surveys under each of the RAP-2 would be completed as
soon as possible but no later than six months prior to the estimated date for commencement of the
works under the respective Part of the Project. Each of the RAP-2 will be furnished to the International



-127-
Annex 14
Page 4 of 22
Development Association (IDA) for consideration as soon as possible but no later than three months
prior to the actual initiation of the works under the respective Part of the Project. Compensation and
resettlement and rehabilitation activities under Parts A. 1 and B. I of the Project will only commence
after IDA has found acceptable the respective RAP-2 and the Government of the Socialist Republic of
Viet Nam has approved it. These activities will be completed at least one month before the beginning
of works in each site under said Parts of the Project.
C. Project Affected People (PAPS)
6.         The PAPs include the following persons to be identified in the census and socio-economic
surveys under each of the RAP-2:
(a)   persons whose houses are in part or in toto affected by the Project;
(b)   persons whose premise and/or agricultural land is in part or in toto affected (permanently
or temporarily) by the Project; and
(c)   persons whose businesses are affected in part or in toto (temporarily or permanently) by
the Project.
D. Resetthment Principles and Objectives
7.         The principles outlined in the World Bank's Operational Directives 4.30 have been
adopted in preparing the RAP. In this regard the following principles and objectives would be applied:
(a)   Resettlement will be minimized as much as possible.
(b)   All PAPs residing or cultivating land in the Project area as of the date of the socio-
economic survey are entitled to compensation for their losses and/or income rehabilitation.
Lack of land use right certificate will not bar the PAP from compensation and/or income
restoration.
(c)   PAPs will be compensated, resettled and rehabilitated so as to improve their standard of
living or at least maintain their current standards at pre-Project level after resettlement.
(d)   The means of resettlement and rehabilitation are: compensation at replacement cost for
houses and other structures, agricultural land for land of equal productive capacity
acceptable to the PAP, replacement of premise land at least of equal size acceptable to the
PAP, and transfer allowances.
(e)   Replacement premise and agricultural land will be as close as possible to the land that was
lost, acceptable to the PAP.
(f)   The resettlement transition period will be minimized and land for land and/or cash
compensation should be provided to the PAPs no later than one month prior to the
expected start-up date of works in the respective Project site.



-128-
Annex 14
Page 5 of 22
(g)  Resettlement and land acquisition plans will be carried out following consultation with the
PAPs.
(h)  The previous level of community services and resources will be maintained or improved
after resettlement.
(i)   Financial and physical resources for resettlement and rehabilitation will be made available
as and when required.
(j)  Institutional arrangements will ensure effective and timely design, planning and
implementation of the RAP.
(k) Internal and external effective and timely monitoring will be provided on the
implementation of the RAP.
Section 2
Institutional and Legal Framework
A. Institutional Framework
8.         The responsibility for implementing the RAP are as follows:
(a)   The respective Power Company (PC) has overall responsibility for planning and
implementing the RAP within its jurisdiction. For this purpose, the respective PC, will
coordinate with the respective District Peoples' Committees (DPCs).  The peoples
committees at the commune level will discuss the various aspects of the RAP with the
PAPs.
(b)   Funds for the resettlement program will be provided by PC2/PC3 based on decisions,
reached through negotiations between local governments (district and commune peoples
committees) and the PAPs.
(c)   Provincial, District, and Commune People's Committees will organize and carry out the
RAP within the areas of their responsibility under the supervision of the respective PC.
B. Legal Framework
9.         The overall objective of the RAP is guided by Article 27 of the Land Law of 1993 (as
amplified by Government decree No 90-CP of 17th August 1994) enacted by the National Assembly of
the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on July 1993.  Article 27 provides that: 'In case of utmost
necessity, when the State recovers land being used by a land user, for national defense, security,
national benefit, or public benefit purposes, the land user shall be given compensation for the
damages".



-129-
Annex 14
Page 6 of 22
10.        Compensation for land and fixed assets (e.g. houses) is defined by the Government Decree
No. 87-CP of the 17th of August 1994, which provides for land for land compensation and cash for
land, when land is not available, at rates established by Government. These rates have been established
for purposes of leasing government land, acquisition of land by government for national purposes, and
for tax value for issuing land use rights certificates.
Section 3
Entitlement Policy
11.        PAP will be entitled to the following types of compensation as they apply to individual
situations according to the eligibility and entitlement categories defined above.
12.        PAPs losing agricultural land will be compensated as follows:
(a)  the general mechanism for compensation of lost agricultural land will be through "land for
land" arrangements of equal productive capacity, satisfactory to the PAP. However, if
such land is not available in the vicinity, compensation in cash; at full replacement cost,
can be provided as mutually agreed between the PAP and the relevant peoples' committee.
If the portion of the land to be lost represents 20% or less of the total area of the land,
cash compensation, at full replacement cost, will be provided to the PAP; and
(b)   PAPs who are forced to relocate or lose agricultural land shall be compensated with the
market price for the loss of standing crops. In case of loss of fruit or industrial trees,
these will be compensated at market price.
13.        PAPs whose houses will be affected by the Project will be provided with:
(a)   replacement residential (premises) land of equivalent size; and (ii) cash compensation,
reflecting full replacement cost of the structure without depreciation.
(b)  if the premise land and/or structure is only partially being affected by the Project and the
remaining part of the structure is habitable, either the entire premise land and structure
would be acquired from the PAP and compensation paid as under sub-paragraph (a), or
alternatively, compensation in cash reflecting full replacement cost of the portion of the
premise land and/or structure affected will be provided as mutually agreed between the
PAP and the relevant peoples' committee; and
(c)  tenants, who have leased a house for residential purposes will be provided with a cash
grant of six months rental fee, and will be assisted in identifying alternative
accommodation.
14.        PAPs will also be provided compensation at full replacement cost for any other fixed
assets affected in part or in toto by the Project.

15.       In cases where communuity infrastructure such as schools, factories, water sources, roads,
sewage systems or electrical supply is lost, this will be replaced at no cost to the community.
Section 4
People's Participation in the Project
16.        The PAPs will participate throughout the various stages of the resettlement activities.
They will be consulted by the competent authorities and will be invited to participate in public meetings
held by the respective PC and/or by the local peoples' committees.
17.        The PAPs will be adequately informed by the relevant local peoples' committees of the
details of the RAP.
Section 5
Baseline Information
A. Census and Inventory of Project Affected People
18.        Each RAP-2 will provide a census of families and persons affected by construction works
which will include an inventory of all losses incurred by each PAP.
19.        This information will include: (a) number, type, and area of the houses lost; (b) number,
quantity and area of all the residential plots lost; (c) number, category, type, and area of agricultural
land lost; and (d) quantity, category, and dimension of all other fixed assets affected by the Project.
B. Identification of Replacement Land and Cash Compensation
20.        Each RAP-2 will include information on the location, area, type, and category of the
replacement land available for residential and/or agricultural purposes and of the amount of cash
compensation to be provided, if that be the case.
C. The Socio-Economic Survey
21.        In addition to the PAPs census and inventory of affected properties, RAP-2 will also
include a socio-economic survey of the affected population, describing occupation and level of income
of the PAPs.

negotiations aimed at achieving consensus.
25.        Settlement between the PAP and local government will be first attempted at the level of
the Commune. If this first conciliation attempt fails, the case will be discussed a second time at the
District level. If at the District level the case is not resolved, an ad-hoc committee established by the
Provincial Peoples' Committee will decide the matter.
26.        In cases where, despite the above efforts, no agreement is reached between the parties, the
case will be submitted to the District court.
27.        PAPs who present their cases to the Commune, District and Provincial authorities, will be
exempted from any legal fees. PAPs, who bring their case to the District Court, will have to follow the
prevailing laws.
C. Supervision and Monitoring
28.        Implementation of RAP-2 will be regularly supervised and monitored by the respective PC
in coordination with the respective local peoples' committees. An agency nominated by each PC will

Introduction
A. The Project
32.        The Power Sector Rehabilitation and Expansion Project (the Project) includes inter-alia
construction of 147 Iam, 220kv Krongbuk-Nhatrang power transmission line and 220kv terminal
substations at Krongbuk and Nhatrang (Part B.1 of the Project). This is the RAP for this project
component. The project also includes the rehabilitation and expansion of medium voltage (MV) and
low voltage (LV) electricity distribution networks, comprising construction of MV and LV lines
(overhead and underground) and MV/LV substations in Ho Chi Minh City (Part A. 1 of the Project) and
in Hue and Nhatrang (Part B. I of the Project) to be undertaken by the PC2 and PC3, respectively.
Regarding the latter, a separate Resettlement Action Plan has been prepared by PC3 and approved by
the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, dated March 27, 1995.
B.   Transnission Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
Introduction
1.         Under Part B.2 of the Project, Power Company 3 (PC3) will be constructing the 220kV,
147 klm, Krongbuk-Nhatrang transmission line (T/L) and the 220 kV terminal substations at Krongbuk
and Nhatrang. The width of the transmission Line Right of Way (ROW) is 22 meters.
Project Impact Area
2.         The project area is in west-central Viet Nam, in the central uplands where many ethnic
mninority groups reside. The line passes through sparsely populated areas of Dac Lac and Khanh Hoa
provinces, running south-east from Krongbuk substation through the gently sloping terrain around the
borders of Dac Lac and Khong Hoa provinces and traverses parts of the coastal plains near Nhatrang.
Protect Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impact
3.         Lands, houses, crops and other properties will be affected in the 22 meters ROW of the
transmission line. Out of the total T/L ROW area of 325 hectares only 3.56 hectares are actually
required for siting of the T/L towers. Waste land without any cultivation or houses on it will be
acquired for the Krongbuk and Nhatrang substations. The area affected by the Project includes 85
houses. About 51 % of ROW area is waste land under state control. About 157 hectares or 49 % of the
total land is cultivated. The major crops/trees in the T/L ROW are coffee, eucalyptus, rice, mango,
jackfruit, pineapple and vegetables. Of the 80 houses in the ROW, 66 houses are of good quality and
14 houses are made of thatched and other light materials. Table 1 summarizes the houses, crops, trees
and other properties affected by the project. Land which is not directly required for siting of the T/L
towers can be used for cultivation even after construction, however, trees above 4 meters in height will
not be allowed in the ROW.

4.         This RAP has been prepared by the Power Company No. 3 (PC3) and approved by the
Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam on March 27, 1995. It lays down the principles and
objectives, legal and institutional framework, modes of compensation and rehabilitation, peoples's
participation features and grievances procedures that will guide the resettlement and rehabilitation of the
project affected persons(PAPs). The RAP also includes results of the census and socio-economic survey
of the PAPs and properties to be affected, compensation and/or resettlement and rehabilitation
entitlements of various categories of PAPs; a timetable for implementation of the RAP; allocation of
the institutional responsibilities for implementation; a budget for funding the various compensation and
rehabilitation measures; and internal and external monitoring arrangements.
5.         The principle objective of this RAP is to ensure that all project affected persons (PAPs)
will be compensated and rehabilitated to assist them to improve, or at least maintain, their living
conditions and income earning capacity at the pre-Project levels. The RAP also aims to ensure that
communities are not broken up as a result of resettlement and that the PAPs are resettled in the vicinity
of their original residential areas. The project has been designed taking into consideration the need to
minimize resettlement. The route of the T/L has been chosen to ensure that it passes over minimum
number of houses and cultivated areas. No ethnic minority groups will be affected by the Project. Also
the lands chosen for substations is not under any productive use and does not have any built up
structures on it.
C. Project Affected People (PAPS)
6.          The PAPs include the following persons:
(a)   persons whose houses are in part or in toto affected by construction of the power
transmission line;
(b)   persons whose premise and/or agricultural land is in part or in toto affected (permanently
or temporarily) due to the construction of the power transmission line;
(c)   persons whose agricultural land is in the ROW of the power transmission line; and
(d)   persons whose businesses are affected in part or in toto (temporarily or permanently) due
the construction of the power transmission line.
D. Resettlement Principles and Objectives
7.         The principles outlined in the World Bank's Operational Directives 4.30 have been
adopted in preparing the RAP. In this regard the following principles and objectives have been applied:
(a)   Resettlement will be minimized as much as possible.
(b)   All PAPs residing or cultivating land in the Project area as of the date of the socio-
economic survey are entitled to compensation and/or resettlement.



-137-
Annex 14
Page 14 of 22
(c)   PAPs will be compensated, resettled and rehabilitated so as to improve their standard of
living or at least maintain their current standards at pre-Project level after resettlement;
(d)  The means of resettlement and rehabilitation are: compensation at replacement cost for
houses and other structures, agricultural land for land of equal productive capacity
acceptable to the PAP, replacement of premise land at least of equal size acceptable to the
PAP, transfer allowances, and compensation for trees and crops at market value.
(e)   Replacement premise and agricultural land will be as close as possible to the land that was
lost, acceptable to the PAP.
(f)   The resettlement transition period will be minimized and land for land and/or cash
compensation will be provided to the PAPs no later than one month prior to the scheduled
start-up date of construction at a given site.
(g)   Resettlement plans will be carried out following consultation with the PAPs.
(h)   The previous level of community services and resources will be maintained or improved
after resettlement.
(i)   Financial and physical resources for resettlement and rehabilitation will be made available
as and when required.
Institutional arrangements will ensure effective and timely design, planning and
implementation of the RAP.
(k)  Internal and external effective and timely monitoring will be provided on the
implementation of the RAP.
Section 2
Institutional and Legal Framework
A. Institutional Framework
8.         The responsibilities for implementing the RAP are as follows:
(a)   PC3 has overall responsibility for planning and implementing the RAP. For this purpose,
the PC2 will coordinate with the respective District Peoples Committees (DPCs). The
peoples committees at the commune level will discuss the various aspects of the RAP with
the PAPs.



-138-
Annex 14
Page 15 of 22
(b)   Funds for the resettlement program will be provided by PC3 based on decisions reached
through negotiations between local governments (district and conmmune peoples
committees) and the PAPs.
c)   PC3 will implement the RAP in coordination with the Provincial, District, and Commune
People's Committees.
B. Legal Framework
9.         The overall objective of the RAP is guided by Article 27 of the Land Law of 1993 (as
further amplified by Government Decree No 90-CP of 17th August 1994) enacted by the National
Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Viet Namn on July 1993. Article 27 provides that: "In case of
utmost necessity, when the State recovers land being used by a land user, for national defense, security,
national benefit, or public benefit purposes, the land user shall be given compensation for the
damages ".
10.        Compensation for land and fixed assets (e.g. houses) is defined by the Government Decree
No. 87-CP of the 17th of August 1994, which provides for land for land compensation and cash for
land, when land is not available, at rates established by Government. These rates have been established
for purposes of leasing government land, acquisition of land by government for national purposes, and
for tax value for issuing land use rights certificates.
Section 3
Entitlement Policy
11.        PAP will be entitled to the following types of compensation as they apply to individual
situations according to the eligibility and entitlement categories defined above.
PAPs losing agricultural land will be compensated as follows:
(a)  the general mechanism for compensation of lost agriculutural land will be through "land
for land" arrangements of equal productive capacity, satisfactory to the PAP. However, if
such land is not available in the vicinity, compensation in cash, at full replacement cost,
can be provided, as mutually agreed between the PAP and the relevant peoples'
committee. If the portion of the land to be lost represents 20% or less of the total area of
the land, cash compensation, at full replacement cost, will be provided to the PAP; and
(b)   PAPs who are forced to relocate or lose agricultural land shall be compensated with the
market price for the loss of standing crops. In case of loss of fruit or industrial trees,
these will be compensated at market price.
PAPs whose houses will be affected by the Project will be provided with:



-139-
Annex 14
Page 16 of 22
(c)  replacement residential (premises) land of equivalent size; and (ii) cash compensation,
reflecting full replacement cost of the structure without depreciation.
(d)  if the premise land and/or structure is only partially being affected by the Project and the
remaining part of the structure is habitable, either the entire premise land and structure
would be acquired from the PAP and compensation paid as under sub-paragraph (a), or
alternatively, compensation in cash reflecting full replacement cost of the portion of the
premise land and/or structure affected will be provided, as mutually agreed between the
PAP and the relevant peoples' committee; and
(e)   Transfer of Houses to New Sites: The PAP will be paid an allowance for transfer of
houses from their existing locations to the resettlement sites. The amount of assistance
will be 1 million VN Dong (about US $ 100), and may be increased for specific cases.
(f)   Land in T/L ROW: Land not directly acquired for construction but in the T/L ROW can
be used by the current users for cultivation, grazing and other activities, and will not be
compensated. However, a height restriction of 4 meters will be observed by the current
users for all future development. Hence, trees of commercial value with height more than
4 meters would be removed and fully compensated. Trees of non-commercial value
would be trimmed, and maintenance cost would be paid to the-owner, if he/she undertakes
this work.
(g)   Waste Land of LPCs: Arrangements for the use of waste lands belonging to the local
peoples' committees (LPCs) would be mutually agreed between the Government and the
concerned LPC.
(h)   Damage During Construction: Compensation would be paid for damage caused to crops
and trees during T/L construction at market rates.
Section 4
People's Participation in the Project
12.        The PAPs will participate throughout the various stages of the resettlement activities.
They will be consulted by the competent authorities and will be invited to participate in public meetings
held by the PC3 and/or by the local peoples' committees.
13.        The PAPs will be adequately informed by the relevant local peoples' committees of the
details of the RAP.
14.        All activities relating to fixing and payment of compensation and the resettlement program
will be carried out with the participation of the affected people and their representatives. The affected
communes and villages were informed about the project as soon as the proposal to implement the
project was finalized. The first activity to be carried out for implementation of the RAP, i.e.



-140-
Annex 14
Page 17 of 22
conducting surveys of the affected properties was carried out with the complete participation of the
affected person and peoples representatives. The survey record, prepared by district surveyors, was
finalized in the presence of the affected person, village head or his representative, commune
representative and a representative of PC3. The affected person signs the survey record if he is
satisfied with the details of his property recorded on the survey form. Fixation of compensation will be
similarly agreed to by the affected person. Land and property can only be acquired if the affected
person signs the compensation form. Land for resettlement will be approved by the commune before it
is selected for resettlement. Before finalization, various proposed sites will be shown to the affected
people and they select the location depending on their preference. In Vietnam there is time respected
tradition of consultations with and participation of the people in all matters which affect them. Most of
the activities mentioned in the RAP were and will be carried out with the involvement of the
conmnunes, which are truly representative of the peoples interests.
Section 5
Baseline Information
A. Cesus and Inventory of Project Affected People
15.        The physical survey of the selected route of the transmission line was carried out by the
Power Investigation and Design Company No. 2 (PIDC2), based at Nhatrang. The survey of affected
families and properties was done along with the detailed physical survey of the T/L route. The number
of houses and other properties affected, and the area under various agricultural, fruit and tree crops was
determined and plotted on the map providing the detailed physical description of the T/L route. The
precise location of each house and various cropped areas is given in this map. A list showing: (a) the
location of the affected houses and their position in the T/L ROW; (b) the type of materials used in
house construction; (c) the name of the owner and the exact number of affected persons in each house;
and (d) the income level of each household is given in Annex 1. In each of the affected houses resides
only one family; therefore, the total number of affected families is 80 (386 people). Agriculture, along
with raising of some animals, is the main occupation of the project affected persons (PAPs) .
16.        The lands proposed for construction of the Krongbuk and Nhatrang substations belong to
the local peoples' committees (LPCs). These are waste lands without any cultivation or houses or any
other economic activities being carried out on them.

Section 6
Implementation Arrangements
A. Resettlement and Construction Schedule
17.          The PAP  will be informed by project authorities and/or LPCs about the detailed
description of project impacts and the properties to be acquired at least 6 months before the start of
construction on the respective lands. Payment of compensation for crops, trees and other properties,
allotment of land for construction of relocated houses, and replacement land of equal productive
capacity, will be completed at least 1 month before construction starts on the affected area.
B. Implementation Arrangements
18.          Implementation of the R/C program  will be a joint effort of PC3, its subsidiary, Power
Transmission Utility (PTU) No. 2, the Provincial Peoples Committees (PPC), District Peoples'
Committees (DPC) and the commune authorities. The overall responsibility for implementing the RAP
will be that of PC3. PC3 will exercise its functions through two of its subsidiary agencies; namely the
PTU No. 2 based at Nhatrang and the Power Project Management Group based at Danang. Though
most of the activities will be carried out in close coordination with the Peoples' Committees at various
levels, the officials of PC3 and its two subsidiaries will ensure that implementation complies with the
RAP. PC3 will be responsible for coordinating the disbursement of funds. The funds would be
disbursed to the people directly by PTU No. 2, with the LPC acting as a witness.



-142-
Annex 14
Page 19 of 22
19.          The PPCs of the respective provinces will inform  the concerned districts about the
resettlement program and direct them to take the steps necessary for compensation and resettlement of
the PAP within their jurisdiction. The DPCs will inform the PAP and the respective communes about
the project and the RIC program and coordinate its activities. The DPCs will be responsible for fixing
compensation levels for various types of affected properties in accordance with the principles of this
RAP (see legal framework) and supervise the detailed surveys of these properties. Payment of
compensation will be supervised by PC3 and its agencies and allotment of alternative lands will be the
responsibility of the DPCs. The commnune authorities will be in charge of informing the PAPs about
the project impact and implementation schedule, to redress their grievances and to act as a
communication link between the PAPs and the DPCs, PPCs, PTU No. 2 and PC3. Most routine
activities will be coordinated directly by the conmmune and district authorities. PC3 will finance the
total cost of the RAP and ensure the timely availability of funds. Table 2 shows the activities which
need to be carried out as a part of the R/C program and the organization(s) responsible for it.
C. Implementation Schedule

Summary of Mitigation Measures S-
2.            In order to reduce environmental impacts from  the proposed development, mitigation
measures, summarized below, have already been put in hand in relation to (a) altering the location for
the cooling water discharge point and (b) agreeing adequate compensation for the acquisition of land
from a local shrimp farm cooperative. As described below, mitigation measures are also planned to
reduce the impacts of noise and waste water streams. Apart from these, and taking into account the
relatively minor residual impacts of the proposed development no further mitigation measures are
considered necessary.
3.            The initially selected cooling water discharge point, which was beside the power station,
has been relocated to a more suitable site because of the danger of unacceptably high temperature rises
in the receiving waters. This will require the construction of a 3 km long pipe route to the new
discharge point which is located by a large body of water where the discharge of the cooling water will
have no significant impact. While the laying of this pipeline will itself cause some loss of mangrove
trees, the route will be chosen to minimize this impact and, as the pipe is buried underground, any
disturbed area will after a few years return to its original state. Planting of any disturbed areas will
reduce the time for regrowth.
1/ Paras. 2, 3 and 4 are not relevant to cooling tower alternative.

Annex 15

4.         For the development of the proposed cooling water intake lagoon. PC2 will need to
acquire 40 hectares of land currently used for shrimp and rice farming. Adequate compensation terms
have been agreed which will allow the owners to move their activities to areas not currently utilized and
avoid socio-economic impacts as well as any indirect environmental effects.
5.         Available data on existing noise at the site are limited, but indicate that there may be a
danger of breaching guideline levels at nearby residences. A survey to be carried out will give a much
better picture of the present situation. If this survey shows that guidelines are being breached then it
may be necessary to specify the level of acoustic cladding and other silencing equipment for the new
development such that it will have no significant additional noise at the site perimeter. Given that the
waste heat boilers and steam turbines will be enclosed, the cost of the additional acoustic insulation
would be very small compared with the overall project cost.
6.         Depending on the outcome of the survey findings two alternative noise mitigation measures
may be more economic. These are (a) the erection at the site perimeter of a berm (earth mound) with
planted trees and shrubs to insulate noise emissions and (b) the acoustic insulation of residences where
indoor noise is high. The costs associated with both these mitigation measures are minor.
7.         Waste water streams from the proposed development includifig (a) water plant treatment
waste, (b) sewage, (c) surface drains, (d) boiler blowdown, (e) boiler acid cleaning effluent will all be
reated, as required, so that the effluent discharged satisfies Vietnamese waste water effluent regulations
and will cause no significant impact.

Assumptions in the Financial Statements
Inflation
1.         Viet Nam's inflation rate over the past years has been volatile as the country was
undergoing its adjustment process toward a market-oriented economy. The inflation rate was 68% in
1990 and 1991 declining to 18% in 1992 and 8% in 1993. The Government is keen on maintaining a
single-digit inflation rate. The Bank expects the rate of inflation to drop further and, on average, to
stabilize around 5-6% per annum during the projected period 1994-2000. Unless otherwise stated, a
5% inflation rate has been built into the financial projections.
Tariffs
2.         The financial projections assume that tariffs would be progressively raised to an average
level of US cents 7/kWh by 1999 as proposed by the Government. Assuming a 5 % annual depreciation
of the Dong vis-a-vis the dollar, this tariff in 1999 would be about US cents 974/kWh for PC2 and US
cents 848/kWh for PC3.
Losses
3.         Technical and non-technical losses currently at 20% and 3% for PC2 and 18% and 7% for
PC3, respectively, are: (a) projected to be maintained at 19% and 3% for PC2; and (b) projected to be
reduced to 17% and 6% in 1998 and to drop further to 17% and 5% in 2000 for PC3, in line with
Govermnent's proposals.
Purchase of Power
4.         The projected price of purchased power for PC2 of about D 290 per kWh sold is based on
the estimated cost of a medium-sized hydroelectric station. Currently, PCI and PC2 sell power to PC3
at D 5/kWh. This negligible tariff was set by the Government to improve PC3's financial results
without adversely affecting the finances of PC1 and PC2. As PC3's financial condition continues to
remain unsatisfactory till around 1998, the projections assume that the purchase price would continue to
remain at D 5/kWh.
Cost of Fuel
5.         Fuel includes the cost of oil, gas and diesel consumed by PC2 and PC3 in their thermal
generating facilities. All fuel costs have been assumed at their present prices until 1995 when prices are
projected to increase by 10% each in 1996, 1998 and 2000. These expenses are based on fuel prices
used in the calculation of the present tariff structure as follows:



-159-
Annex 20
Page 2 of 3
Power Company No. 2
Oil. The price of heavy oil including average transportation cost to site is at present D
1,324,250/MT. This price is about equal to US$18 - US$19 per barrel. PC2 is permitted to
negotiate the price with the oil companies. On average, the steam stations of PC2 use 0.25 kg of
oil/kWh. The fuel cost per kWh produced is D 331.
Gas. It is assumed that starting 1996 natural gas will be available for power generation although
the price has not yet been decided. It is expected that the price will be between US$ 2.00 (D
21,800) and US$ 2.50 (D 27,250)/MMBTU (252,000 kcal). The financial projections assume a
price of US$ 2.00 per 252,000 kcal.
Diesel. The price of diesel is at present D 2,635,250/MT (US$ 241.77fMT or about D 2,725
per liter). Diesel stations use on average 0.2 kg/kWh produced.
Power Companv No. 3
Apart from a few micro hydro stations, PC3 operates only diesel stations at the following cost on
average: D 2,800/kg plus 0.5% for losses during transport and D 145/kg for transport. Diesel
stations use on average 0.272 kg/kWh produced. The price is negotiable and was decreased by
D 30 from the above price in July 1, 1994.
Salaijes, Wages and Benefits
6.         PC2 and PC3 record only base salaries and wages in their income staternents; staff,
however, also draws bonuses and benefits which are not recorded in the costs of the income statement.
The projections include bonuses and benefits in the income statements.
Operation, Maintenance and Administration
7.         PC2 and PC3 are required to eliminate the cost component "Facility Maintenance" from
their income statements; these expenses have been included in the projections.
Taxes
8.         Taxes are based on current levels as follows: (a) Tax on Revenues at 8% of revenues and
4% of other revenues; (b) Charge on Natural Resources at 2% of that part of revenues from sales of
power which corresponds to the percentage of hydro generation versus total generation; (c) Tax on
Capital at 2.4% of net plant in service; and (d) Income Tax at 25%.
Depreciation
9.         Depreciation rates for PC2 and PC3 are prescribed by the Government and calculated on
the following basis: turbines (8%), rockfill dams (2%), concrete dams (3%), distribution systems
(8.5%). The financial projections include depreciation, on average at the rate of 5.4% for PC2 and
5.0% for PC3.

Capital Structure
10.        The following capital structure is assumed: (a) existing Government capital remains as
equity and is not transformed into debt; (b) starting FY94 new investments are assumed to be financed
at one third Government contributions and two thirds debt; (c) long term debts have been assumed at an
annual interest rate of 7.5% with repayment terms of up to 15 years including two years of grace; (d)
no dividend payments on equity have been assumed; and (e) PC2 and PC3 will capitalize interest during
construction.
Investments
11.        Projected capital expenditures are those estimnated to provide the additonal plant and
equipment required to meet the demand forecast, escalated at the rate of expected inflation of 6% p.a.
Fixed Assets
12.        Due to doubtful past valuation procedures, fixed assets as recorded by PC2 and PC3 may
not represent their real value. Consequently, the financial projections are based on fixed assets as
available at the end of FY93.
Current Assets and Liabilities
13.        Accounts receivable are projected to be approximately two months and four months of
revenues for PC2 and PC3, respectively. Current payables are projected at the equivalent of one week
of fuel expenses and 20% of annual capital expenditures.

Economnic Justification of the Project
1.         This Annex presents the assumptions and working details for the economic justification of
the project components.
Basis for Costs and Monetary Benefits
2.          All costs and monetary benefits are converted to 1994 prices. It is common practice to
apply a shadow exchange rate multiplier and a conversion factor for expenditure on local labor. The
former is used to correct for distortions in the exchange rate; because of the liberalized nature of the
market for foreign exchange in Viet Nam, it is estimated that the exchange rate does not suffer from
distortions, and no adjustments are made. For the latter, designed to remove distortions of subsidies
and taxes from this component, a conversion factor of 0.75 is assumed.
Conversion of Ba Ria Open Cyde Turbines to Combined Cycle Operation
3.         The power balance for PC2's system is shown in Table 3.1 indicating the need for
additional capacity by 1996-97. Given the shape of PC2's daily load curve, and the energy inflows to,
storage capacity and power capability of the hydro stations in PC2's service area, the requirement is for
base load rather than peaking capacity.
4.          With the availability of offshore natural gas at about US$ 2.0 per MMBTU (economic cost
about US$1.3/MMBTU) by mnid 1995, Ba Ria becomes the least cost proposition for base load thermal
capacity addition in PC2's system by 1996-97. There are three basic natural gas-fired options for the
expansion of Ba Ria's generating capacity. These options and the levelised costs for each are shown in
Table A21.1 below. The least-cost solution is that proposed for the project: the conversion of three gas
turbines to a combined cycle block. The conversion of existing turbines to combined cycle operation
does not require additional fuel; however, the construction of new plant will require this fuel.

Estimation of the EIRR of The Project
5.          Assumptions regarding the project are:
(a)   the capital costs are US$62.82 million in foreign costs and US$6.26 million in local costs;
this represents the base costs plus a 10% allowance for physical contingencies; price
contingencies are excluded; this also excludes duties and taxes; 26% of the local costs
represent expenditure on labor;
(b)   capital expenditure is phased 40% in 1995, 40%in 1996 and 20% in 1997;
(c)   O&M  costs are assumed to be US$1.73 million per year of operation, in real terms
(approximately 2.5% of capital expenditure);
(d)   no fuel costs are attributed to the project; the addition of the steam unit increases output
simply by recycling the exhaust gases from turbine operation;
(e)  the unit operates at a 50% plant load factor in 1997, followed by a 68% plant load factor
thereafter; the unit has a 20 year life, and ceases operation in 2016;
(f)  the output from the unit is decreased by the level of losses forec:ast for the system in each
year of operation; this represents the incremental sales from the project;
(g)   the tariff is assumed to increase progressively to 7 USc/kWh by 1999, in nominal terms;
based on Governments proposals.
6.          Table A21.6 presents the computation of incremental benefits and costs attributed to the
project, while Table A21.2. presents the results of the computation for the Base Case and various
sensitivity cases.

7.          Tables A21.3, A21.4 and A21.5 present: (a) capital expenditures on the distribution and
upstream sub-transmission systems; (b) technical losses; (c) electricity sales; (d) energy required by the
system; and (e) unserved energy, for the "with project" and "without project" cases, for HCMC, Hue
and Nhatrang. The capital costs include a 10% allowance for physical contingency; price contingencies

are excluded as also are duties and taxes. Of the local expenditure, 26% is in the form of labor
services. No incremental O&M costs were included for either case; O&M costs would be even higher
for the "without project" case.
8.         The EIRRs are calculated on the stream of costs and benefits over a project economic life
of 25 years. The losses (technical only) are valued at the LRMC figure of 5 USc/kWh at the
subtransmission level and the reduction in unsupplied energy is conservatively valued at 10 times the
tariff. The details of the cost and benefit streams are presented in Tables A21.7 - A21.9. EIRRs
calculated for the base and several sensitivity cases are tabulated below. The sensitivities undertaken
are designed to examine the impact of: (i) increasing capital costs; (ii) lower demand; and (iii) a 50%
reduction in the valuation of unserved energy.

Load Dispatch Centers
9.           The project benefits are quantified over the period to 2012, providing a 15 year period for
benefits following commissioning. It is assumed that the control centers would allow a 0.5 % saving in
energy efficiency; given the energy constrained nature of the system in the medium term, this is
considered analogous to an increase in sales and is therefore valued using the prevailing tariff rate,
adjusted for losses. The value of unserved energy used is assumed conservatively at ten times the tariff
level; the quantity of unserved energy due to transmission faults is estimated to be half the total
unserved energy forecast. It is assumed that the control centers could provide a 20% reduction in the
unserved energy (declining from 1.7% in 1994 to 0.5% by 2001) due to transmission faults. It is also
assumed that by 2012, the improved frequency control would have lead to a reduction in UPS
equipment in the country equivalent to 0.1 % of forecast peak demand. This equipment costs in the
region of US$2,000 per kW. Finally, it is assumed that automation would save about 35 staff valued at
US$5,000 per staff-year.
10.          The investment in the load dispatch centers totals US$38.75 million; annual O&M  costs
equal to 2% of this expenditure are assumed. The investment is estimated to be phased 20%, 40%,
40% over the years 1995-1997.
11.          The EIRR (see Table A21. 10 for details), including all benefits, is 27.0%. Decreasing by
50% the benefits from a reduction in unserved energy and in the purchase of UPS equipment gives an
EIRR of 20.3%, and assuming that efficiency savings are equal to 0.25% of generation reduces the
EIRR to 23.3%. Taking the improvement in efficiency alone, the EIRR is 11 %.
