INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE MALAGASY REPUBLIC
FOR THE M)RONDAVA IRRIGATION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Malagasy Republic for the equivalent of $15.3 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance an irrigation and rural development
project. Approximately $6.6 million of the proceeds of the credit would
be relent to the Societe pour le D6veloppement Economique de la R6gion
de Morondava (SODEMO), for 40 years, including 10 years of grace, with
interest at 3.5 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report, entitled "Recent Economic Position and
Prospects of the MIalagasy Republic" (Report No. AE-1la) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on January 27, 1971. An economic mission is
scheduled to visit-Madagascar in the fall. Annex II shows basic country
data.
3.        With a land area of 590,000 km2, and a population of 6.9 million,
Madagascar is sparsely populated. The population is unevenly distributed;
some areas, particularly in the center of the island, are heavily populated
and there are already signs of overcrowding.
4.        MAdagascar's GDP in 1970 was estimated at $890 million and the
per capita income was less than $130. The economy is basically agricultural.
Over 80% of the population is rural, and agriculture accounts for 70% of
commodity production. More than half of this production is, however, for
subsistence; monetary income from agricultural pursuits is around 20% of
total monetized income. The main products for local consumption are rice,
manioc, and meat. The main export products are coffee (accounting for
nearly one third of export earnings), cloves, vanilla, and animal products.
In 1968, agricultural products as a whole accounted for 85% of exports.
In 1971, agricultural products still represented 70% of exports, despite
the increase in exports of minerals (mostly chromite).
5.        The Malagasy economy remains heavily dependent on France, both
for foreign aid and technical assistance. There are some 34,000 Frenchmen
living on the island, playing a significant role in the economy, in civil
administration as well as in industry, agriculture, and trade.  Most of
the expatriates are in Tananarive. The country has a large university
(3,900 student) which relies heavily on French financial and technical
support. Madagascar is also a member of the Franc Zone, thereby benefiting
from free convertibility of its intra-zone export earnings and from over-
draft facilities with the French Treasury. In general, however, Madagascar's
trade with countries outside the Franc Zone has been in balance, primarily
because of coffee and vanilla exports to the US.



6.        In the 1960s real GDP grew at about 4.7% per year, representing
an annual increase in per capita MDP of slightly over 2%, a year. Average
per capita aDP thus rose from $100 in 1960 to about $120 in 1969. In
1970, however, aDP grew by about 6%, owing to the conjunction of good crops
and above-average export prices, mainly for coffee. The production of
rice rose from 1.5 to 1.7 million tons and the output of coffee, vanilla,
cloves and cotton increased considerably. This, combined with full pro-
duction of the new chromite mine in Andriamena, increased the country's
export proceeds by nearly 40% in one year. Consequently, foreign reserves
nearly doubled from $25.0 million in December 1969 to $49.7 million in
December 1970, representing 3.5 month** imports. In 1970, real per
capita GDP is estimated to have increased by 4%, twice as much as the
average in the preceding five-year period. In 1971, however, while exports
increased by another 1.5%, there was a 25% increase in imports. In parti-
cular, imports of foodstuffs rose by 53% (or 14% of total imports), reflecting
principally the trebling of rice imports necessitated by the lower domestic
production caused by cyclones. As a result, foreign reserves, expressed in
Halagasy Francs, declined by 6%. By December 1971, foreign reserves re-
presented only about 3 months' imports.
7.       In recent years, the Government has made a strong effort to
increase public sector investment and to create conditions for the expansion
of private investment. Gross fixed capital formation rose from FMGI 22 billion
in 1966 to 35 billion in 1970. While detailed information for 1971 is not
yet available, and is particularly scarce respecting private investment,
there are indications that there has been a continued increase in investmenit.
The proportion of GDP devoted to investment increased from 12% in 1966 to
over 14% in 1970.
8.        In line with its objective to increase investment, the Government
has taken appropriate steps in its budget. Until 1967, surpluses on the
recurrent budget were rising and financed an increasing share of the growing
capital expenditure. In view of the substantial increase in capital ex-
penditure which occurred during 1967-69, the budget deficit increased. In
1970, therefore, the Governmnt introduced some selective austerity measures
aimed at curtailing current expenditures, and also reduced capital appro-
priations to the level of available resources. During the past few years,
about one half of the public sector investment has been financed by re-
current budget surpluses and the rest by foreign aid. The European De-
velopment Fund (FED) has been the principal source of external capital aid
(about one half of the total) while others, principally France and the Bank
Group have provided the rest.
9.        Madagascarts first five-year plan ended in 1968. It was followed
by an interim plan 1969-70 and by the preparation of a new plan, the official
adoption of which has, however, been delayed, though its main outlines have
been foUowed. The development strategy since the end of the last plan aims
at (i) self-sufficiency in rice; (ii) diversification of exports through
stimulation of new exports (livestock, cotton, forest products) and the
expansion of mining; and (iii) improvement in transport, particularly roads
and ports. There has been some progress with regard to each of these ob-
jectives.



-3-
10.       At the end of 1970, Madagascar's external public debt, including
undisbursed amounts, amounted to $137.7 million equivalent. France is the
major creditor, accounting for 44 percent of the total, while Bank Group
lending accounted for 21.1 percent. Debt service payments in 1970 amounted
to $7.0 million or 4.3 percent of the estimated foreign exchange earnings.
Although debt service is relatively low, it is desirable, in view of the
country's poverty and the still limited prospects for its exports, that the
major proportion of external aid continue to be provided on concessional
terms.
PART II - BENK aROUP OPERATIONS
11.       Since the newly independent Malagasy Republic became a member
of the Bank and IDA in September 1963, Madagascar has received four IDA
credits totalling $29,100,000 and three Bank loans totalling $11 ,100,000.
Of these amounts, two thirds have been lent for projects in transport,
while two projects, representing somewhat less than 20% of total lending,
were in agriculture. The balance is accounted for by a loan for education.
Annex I contains a sumuary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of
April 30, 1972. Project execution is generally satisfactory. Adminis-
trative delays in the preparation of withdrawal applications, which did
occur in earlier projects, have been largely overcome.
12.       The priority which the Bank Group in its lending is giving to
the improvement of transport conforms to Madagascarts development ob-
jectives. The Tamatave port project, currently in execution, will soon
provide a reliable outlet for exports. Bank Group financed road construc-
tion in the central and northern regions has increased all-weather land
connections within the island and will continue to do so in the north and
in part of the western regions. I expect to be able to submit to you
early in the next fiscal year, a third highway project and, later in the
year, a proposal for a railway loan.
13.       Madagascar's agriculture is of equally high priority, both in
the GovernmenV'a development strategy and in the Bank Group's program.
There are projects for general agricultural development, forestry, live-
stock and rice at various stages of preparation which I hope will result
in Bank Group operations over the next two fiscal years. Projects are
also under preparation for technical education and a development finance
company.
PART III - AGRICULTURE
14.       While over 80% of the Malagasy population is rural, less than
5% of the total area of Madagascar is cultivated. The population is
concentrated in certain parts of the island, in particular in the high



-4 -
central plateau and east coast areas. Migration toward these areas
of high population density, especially from the more arid southern
and southeastern regions of Madagascar, has continued for some time
and if unchecked, would threaten these areas with excessive pressure
on land.
15.       Although the high central plateau and east coast areas
account for most of the irrigated rice grown in Madagascar and for
much of coffee and banana, further agricultural development of these
areas is not of high priority because of their relatively limited
potential. Other areas of Madagascar suitable for agriculture are
the northern tropical region, which produces sugar cane, cocoa and
spices, the middle west and the west coast, which is livestock
country, and the alluvial flood plains of the west coast with a
high potential for the cultivation of cotton, tobacco, and high-
quality rice.
16.       In order to check population pressure in the high plateau
and east coast areas, and to spur the development of the highly
productive middle west and west coast regions, the Government is
encouraging migration to the less densely populated and potentially
more productive areas. Insufficient experience with the organization
of settlements, the lack of extension services, transport and other
general infrastructure are constraints which the Government will have
to overcome during the next years.
17.       Agriculture, which provides livelihood to more than four
fifths of the population, accounts for less than one third of GDP.
In 1969, annual per capita income in the rural areas was about $80.
Nore than 80% of export earnings during the late 1960's were from
agricultural products, mainly coffee, vanilla, high-quality rice
and sugar. On the other hand, Madagascar, over the same period,
imported low-quality rice, wheat flour and dairy products, amounting
to about 23% of the value of agricultural exports.
18.       The Bank Group has financed two projects in agriculture.
The first was a $2.8 million livestock development loan-in 1969,
and the second, a $5.0 million credit for an irrigation project
in the Lake Alaotra area. Experience gained during the progress of
the Lake Alaotra project has influenced the design of the present-
ly proposed project which, however, adds the new dimensions of
rural settlement and health.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
19.       A report, entitled "Appraisal of the Mbrondava Irrigation
and Rural Development Project - Malagasy Republic" (No. PA-128a),
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A Credit



and Project Swumary is provided at Annex III.
20.       The project, based on feasibility studies financed by the
UNDP, was appraised in October-November 1971. Negotiations for the
proposed IDA credit were held in Washington in May 1972. The Mala-
gasy delegation was led by Mr. Raymond Rabeharisoa, Secretary
General of the Ministry of Agriculture, and included Messrs. Jean
Rabeson and Pierre Raharison, respectively Director of the Service
Central de Mise en Valeur and of the Service du Genie Rural of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Messrs. Gaston Ralison and Ramamonjisoa of
the IfLnistry of Finance and Messrs. Henri Rasolondraibe and Charles
Randrianasolo of the Malagasy Bnbassy in Washington.
21.       The project,. to be carried out over a period of six and
one half years, would be the first phase of the Government development
plan for the Morondava region. It provides for irrigation and
associated services in three new agricultural areas, and the settle-
ment of about 2,100 families to participate in the cultivation of
these areas.
22.       The project area of about 10,000-hectares, located between
the Morondava and Andranomena Rivers, in the central part of Mada-
gascar's west coast, would be divided into three units. The first,
of about 4,700 hectares, would be devoted to irrigated rice cultiva-
tion by some 2,300 small farmers to be settled there. The second;
of about 2,700 hectares, would be developed as a state farm special-
izing in tobacco and peanut production, with burley tobacco grown
in rotation with peanuts and a forage crop. The third, of about
1,900 hectares, would be developed as a state farm for cotton
production, with medium staple cotton grown in rotation with a forage
crop.
23.       The specific project works would include:  (a) construction
of a diversion dam at Dabara on the Norondava River; (b) rehabilita-
tion of about 64 kmi of main canals; (c) a gravity irrigation and
drainage system on 6,600 hectares for cotton and rice cultivation;
(d) a sprinkler irrigation system on 2,700 hectares for tobacco and
peanut cultivation; (e) on-farm development, including tertiary and
quaternary canals and drains; (f) improvement and construction of
about 90 km of roads in the project area; (g) construction of project
buildings; and (h) construction of ten new villages and expansion
of ten existing ones.
24.       In addition to these works, the project would include the
selection of about 2,100 new families and their settlement in the
project area, the purchase of farm machinery and equipment for the
operation and maintenance of irrigation works, the establishment
of a new research station, the implementation of a health program



- 6 -
designed to combat endemic diseases and control schistosomiasis,
and a feasibility study for a second phase irrigation project in
the Morondava region. Consultants would be engaged to assist
in the design and supervision of project construction works, the
establishment and agricultural development of the three, project
units, the settlement of farmers, the training of project personnel
and the preparation of the feasibility study for the second phase
irrigation project.
25.       The settlement and health control aspects of the project
are somewhat of an innovation in Madagascar. While the Government
has embarked upon a settlement policy which would relieve the
pressure on densely populated areas in the high plateaus and on
the east coast, there has been little experience to date with
Government,.launched settlements.  The principles SODEMD will follow
in the selection of settler families will be that farm.families al-
ready in the Morondava region would have priority in the allocation
of land for irrigated rice cultivation; second, that farm families
would be given priority over single agricultural workers;.third,
that, to the extent possible, settlers would be chosen from among
ethnic groups already represented in the area. The settlers chosen
would all receive.a plot of land at least sufficient to satisfy the
subsistence needs of their family,  whether they are laborers on one
of the state farms, or full time rice farmers. The latter category
of settlers would receive two hectares for irrigated rice cultiva-
tion.
26.       Schistosomiasis of the urinary type (bilharzia) is endemic
in the region. At present, it affects about 20% of the-inhabitants.
Although the projected improvements to the irrigation and drainage
systens should slow the spread of the disease, the large increase
in the area's population which the settlement scheme would bring
about, would increase the chances of infection, and hence..the incidence
of this debilitating disease to 40 to 50% of the inhabitants by 1980,
unless measures are taken to combat it. The project therefore includes
a health program expected to cost about $1.0 million equivalent,
consisting of the construction of a clinic and three new dispensaries,
the expansion of an existing hospital so as to double its capacity to
about 50 beds, and the carrying out of an epidemiological study intended
to control schistosomiasis in the project area.
27.       The main irrigation and road works would be carried out by
contractors under the direction of the Ministry of Agriculture's bervice
du Genie Rural (GR), an agency responsible for civil works related to
agriculture. The feasibility studies for further development in the Mo-
rondava region would be carried out by consultants under the direction
of the Service Central de Mise en Valeur of the Ministry of Agriculture
(SCMV) which is responsible for formulating agricultural development



schemes. All other parts of the projoct would be implemented under
the direction of the Socift6 pour le DSveloppement Economique de la
R6gion de Morondava (SODEHO), a new regional development institution
being established by the Government along the lines of the institution
implementing the Lake Alaotra project.
28.       In order to expedite the preparation of final designs,
consultants are to be employed by GR and by SODEKO and may be
selected before signature of the proposed credit agreement. Ex-
penditures for the services of such consultants incurred after
May 1, 1972, and up to $200,000 equivalent, would be financed
retroactively under the proposed credit.
29.       SODEKO would be a joint stock company with a share capital
of FMG300 million which would be held by the Government (56*), para-
statal agencies (17O), local entities (21%), and private firms (6%).
SODEMO would be headed by a Malagasy general manager. However, due
to the lack of sufficient qualified Malagasy nationals to fill other
executive positions in SODEMO, except for that of a deputy manager
for settlement and social affairs, expatriates would be recruited
for the three other positions of deputy general manager within
SODEMO. In addition, four expatriates would be hired to serve as
directors in charge, respectively, of the rice farming unit, the
two state farms, and of SODEKO's operation and maintenance unit.
These seven experts are to be provided by consultants to be en-
gaged by SODE4O. Each expert would be provided a Malagasy counter-
part for in-service training. Financing for the foreign exchange
cost of experts services is included in the proposed credit.
30.       The fulfillment of all formal steps required to complete
SODEMO's establishment, including the adoption of statutes defining
its management and financial structure, would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed credit.
31.       The total cost of the project net of taxes is estimated
at $27.0 million equivalent. The foreign exchange component,
estimated at $15.3 million (57%), would be financed by IDA. The
local cost component would be financed as follows: the Malagasy
National Development Bank (BNM) is expected to provide loans to
SODEMO totalling $3.3 million equivalent; private participations
in SODEMO's equity will provide $0.4 million equivalent; and the
balance of $8.0 million will be provided by the Government directly
in the form of an equity contribution of 200 million Malagasy
Francs ($0.8 million equivalent) to SODEKO, and by grants or loans.
Commitment of the proposed financing by the agencies concerned,
and the approvals or corporate action necessary for the commitment
of funds as required for project implementation, would be a con-
dition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.



- 8 -
32.       About $6.7 million equivalent of credit proceeds would be
utilized directly by Government agencies - GR and SCKV - for major
civil works and for consultants services. The balance would be
channeled to SCDE40 as follows: the amounts necessary to carry out
the settlement, health and research aspecto of the project-would be
passed on by Government in the form of a grant, estimated at $2.0
million equivalent; the remainder of credit proceeds would be onlent
to SCDEKO for 40 years, including ton years of grace, at a rate of
interest of 3.5% per annum, which is the rate at which Government
lends to its agencies for agricultural projects. The signature and
effectiveness of a subsidiary loan agreement along theae lines would
be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
33.       The cotton (1,600 t/a), peanuts (3,400 t/a) and tobacco
(1,350 t/a) to be produced under the project would be exported
primarily to EEC countries. The quantities involved are negligible
in terms of quantities traded on the world market and Madagascar
should find a ready market at competitive prices particularly in
Europe where demand for these produsts is growing. The low-quality
rice to be produced under the project would all be consumed locally,
reducing, but not eliminating, the projected annual deficits in this
product and the resulting import requiremnts.
34.       The charges to be paid by rice farmers (see below) and
the revenues of the state farms are such that SODEH0 s full annual
operation and maintenance oosts and its administrative Costs for
operating the settlement scheme will be covered. Moreover, except
for the Cost of the agricultural research and the studies, the full
amount of capital investment will be recovered over a 40-year period
the estimated life of the project - including a 5% return. The low
financial return stems from the low monetary income of small farmers
in the rice scheme who could not support higher charges and is not
likely to lead to any distortion in the use of resources.
35.       The small rice farmer would pay to SODEM0 for 40 years the
equivalent of 600 kg of paddy per cropped hectare for each harvest.
This compares with expected yields of four tons per cropped hectare
at full development. In addition, the cash surpluses of the two
state farms would accrue to SODEKO. SODEKO would also collect an
annual irrigation and drainage charge from an existing citrus state
farm which will benefit from improved water aupply and health conditions
brought about by the project.
36.       SODI40 will turn over to the Government its net cash surplus
after meeting its operating oosts, debt service, replacement of
equipment, dividend payments to its shareholders, and after establishing
a working capital fund equivalent to $1.0 million. The Eurplus is
expected to grow to about $1.0 million equivalent each year starting
in 1988.



-9-
37.       Contracts for civil works and equipment will be awarded after
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank/IDA Guidelines
except (i) for contracts for construction of settlement and health control
facilities and other small works expected to cost less than $100,000 each
and not more than $1.0 million in the aggregate, and (ii) for contracts for
miscellaneous equipment expected to cost less than $10,000 each and not more
than $400,000 in the aggregate. These contracts would be tendered locally in
accordance with existing Government procedures, which ensure adequate local,
competition. A margin of preference equivalent to 15% of the c.i.f. price of
imported goods or import taxes payable by non-exempt importers, whichever is
less, would be accorded to the local manufacturers of equipment. Madagascar
grants import duty preferences to EBC countries but GR and SODEMO are tax
exempt or entitled to tax reimbursement, and comparison of bids among foreign
suppliers or contractors would be made on the basis of a bid price net of
taxes and duties.
38.       At full agricultural development, the value of incremental produc-
tion due to the project is estimated at $3.0 million equivalent per annum, and
the value of incremental foreign exchange earnings due to the project is
estimated at about $2.0 million equivalent.. Discounting costs and benefits
over the 40-year life of the project, the economic rate of return would be
about 16%.
39.       At full development, the annual per capita income of the small rice
farmer, after payment of the project charges, is expected to range from
$100 to $140. This compares with a present annual per capita income of $45
for farmers already in the project area. The settlers would also benefit
from improved educational, housing and medical services to be provided as a
consequence of the project.
PART V - LEaAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Malagasy Republic
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section I(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolu-
tion approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
41.       The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms to the nonmal
pattern in credits for agricultural projects, including adequate provisions
concerning the matters discussed in the preceding paragraphs 35, 36, and 37.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECa(MENDATION
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
