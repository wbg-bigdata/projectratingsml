                                           I.Introduction

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an Additional
Finance in the amount of US$25 million to Socialist Republic of Vietnam for the Mekong
Transport and FloodProtectionProject (Cr. 3448-VN).

2.      Summary. The additional financing would enable the project to: (i)meet the original
project objectives by completing the remaining 58 km of road rehabilitation works under the
Mekong Delta Network Improvement (MDNI) sub-component; and (ii)finance expanded
activities to enhance the project's development impact by constructing the Ganh Hao I1(GH2)
Bridge located in Ca-Mau city, which connects road sections of the on-going IDA-financed
investmentsonNational Highway 1(NH1) under the existing project.

3.      Major Changes Being Proposed. The proposed Additional Finance would cover a
financing gap in the current project and permit scaled-up activities in support of the major
highway investments. Having nearly completed the major highway rehabilitation activities, the
Borrower's request seeks additional financing for: (i)the completion of the MDNI
subcomponent in order to meet the original project targets of 128 km of rehabilitation works on
provincial level network; and (ii) construction of the GH2 Bridge, a 600 meter long, 12meter
                                   the
wide bridge that is located on the project road NHl in Ca-Mau city, as well as the supervision
services for its construction.     These activities are consistent with the project development
objectives, though the GH2 Bridge is additional to the scope of works inthe original project.

4.      Expected Outcomes. The additional financing will enable the project to achieve the
originally envisaged outputs of the MDNI sub-component, thus improving the access and
connectivity of rural villages to the major highway infrastructure.      Furthermore, while the
highway improvements financed under the Credit (Cr. 3448-VN) widened the highway to 24
meters on both sides of the existing Ganh Hao River Bridge, the current bridge's 12 meter width
i s creating a critical capacity constraint in Ca Mau city. The new GH2 Bridge would provide a
second, parallel structure to alleviate this bottleneck and would represent the last crucial bridge
works requiredfor upgrading the entire highway sectionto Class IV standard.


   11.BackgroundandRationalefor AdditionalFinancingin the Amount ofUS25 Million

5.      An IDA Credit of SDR86.2 million (US$l 10 million equivalent as of the date of Credit
signing) for the Mekong Transport FloodProtection Project (MTFP) was approved by the World
Bank Board of Executive Directors on December 20, 2000, and became effective on October 3,
2001, The objectives o f the Project are to assist the Borrower to: (i)complete the rehabilitation
of NH1, including increased protection for certain flood-prone segments; and (ii)     improve the
efficiency of the regional transport network in the Mekong Delta.         The original project's
development objective i s to stimulate the commercial use of an improved transportation network,
improve access to rural areas by connecting them to the main trade and movement corridors, and
ensure permanent access to regular flood-prone areas.

6.      Current Credit Status. Over the most recent 12 months, the ISR ratings, including
those for implementation progress (IP) and development objectives (DOs), have been
consistently rated satisfactory. Implementation has beenrated moderately satisfactory, due to the
slow pace of implementation, which has now improved. Disbursements as o f March 30, 2007
amount to approximately US$77.51 million, equivalent to 60 percent o f the Credit in 85 percent
(5 years 5 months) o f the revised project implementation period. The original closing date o f
June 2006 has been extended (once) for 18 months. The Credit's current revised closing date i s
December 31,2007.

7.      The achievements to date highlight that the project's impacts are consistent with the
output and outcome indicators detailed inits design. The project has overcome a nearly two-year
delay at the outset resulting from extensive dialogue between IDA and the Government o f
Vietnam (GOV) on the status o f State-Owned Enterprise eligibility in the project's bidding
processes. The outcome of these discussions was that IDA provided a one time wavier for
participationo f MoT's State Owned Enterprises inthe biddingprocesses financed by the project.
A second implementation hurdle, the inability o f two primary contractors to fully mobilize the
capital requirements at the project sites, i s inprocess o f being resolved. Otherwise, the project
has no major implementation, fiduciary, environmental, social or other safeguard issues. The
project i s incompliance with Credit covenants.

8.      The Borrower and the Implementing Agency remain committed to successfully
completing the project. It i s anticipated that, if the Additional Financing i s approved, a three
year extension to December 31,2010 o f the closing date o fthe Credit would be granted.

9.      Previous Project Performance.            In June 2003, implementation progress was
downgraded to unsatisfactory status (and remained as such for nearly two years) after it became
apparent that counterpart funding to complete resettlement activities was insufficient.       This
resulted in serious delays in the handover o f the rights-of-way, preventing contractor
mobilization on three o f the major civil works sites. Project supervision also revealed that the
environmental unit o f PMU1, organized in April o f 2002, had been demobilized, with
environmental staff being reassigned without notice to IDA. P M U l was to immediately appoint
at least two environmental/engineering staff for appropriate environmental training, or recruit
two new environmental/engineering specialists to work permanently on road construction
environmental management specifically for this project.

10.     During subsequent missions, IDA was still unable to upgrade the project given: (a) slow
progress on the civil works program for NH1; (b) overall lack o f good administration and
management related to quality control and compliance with the safeguard requirements; (c)
procurement delays inthe regional transport network and institutional strengthening components;
and (d) limited progress in monitoring and evaluation reporting. At the Mid-Term Review
(MTR) inJuly 2004, a revisedset of actionable targets against which project progress was to be
measured were agreed upon. These included: (i)100 percent completion o f site hand-over; (ii)
establishment o f average monthly progress rates for five ICB contracts; (iii) disbursement
                                                                              Credit
rate and counterpart funding milestones; (iv) Project Management Unit 1 (PMU1)'s framework
for management strengthening; (v) quality assurancepractices inplace; (v) contractor and P M U l
compliance with the Environmental Management Plan; (vii) submission o f a report on base line


                                                  2

data for results monitoring; and (viii) the timely submission of quarterly reports. Based on the
substantial achievement by Ministry of Transport (MoT)/PMUl towards the progress of
measured results and identifiedtargets established during the MTR, project status was upgraded
to moderately satisfactory inMarch2005.

11.     FundingIssues DuringImplementation. The MTFP project was appraisedin 1998 and
the project cost was establishedbased on 1998 market price. Over the period of nine (9) years,
the implementationofthe project has facedmajor financial issues as describedbelow.

    (a) Limited funding for the replacementof six bridges of 1ST capacity inthe project's Dam
        Cung -Nam Can road section ofNH1;
    (b) Large Variation Orders oftwo major ICB contracts; and
    (c) Cost overruns for the Provincial feeder roads inthe Mekong Delta Network Improvement
        (MDNI)sub-component.

12.     Limited Funding for the Replacement of Six Bridges of 1.5T Capacity in the
Project's Dam Cung-Nam Can Road Section of NH1. The original project design included
the replacement or rehabilitation of bridges with a span of less than 25 meters to increasetheir
capacity to accommodate vehicle gross weights of 30-tonnes. Bilateral support from the Japan
Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) was envisaged to finance the construction and
rehabilitation of bridges on NH1 of varying lengths (38 to 56 meters), which were to be
implemented in coordination with the MTFP highway improvements.                   In 2003, it was
determinedthat the JBIC funding for 15 newly built bridges along the Can Tho - Ca Mau road
section of NH1, would not be sufficient to cover the replacement of six bridges in the project's
DamCung-NamCan road section. To ensure the sustainability of IDA'Sexisting investments
along NH1, IDA has agreedinprincipleto finance the additional six bridges.

13.     Large Variation Orders of Two Major ICB Contracts. In October 2005 the
implementing agency and supervision engineer proposed variation orders (VOs), with an
aggregate value of approximately US$24 million, for two of the five major ICB contracts being
implemented under the project. The VOs were needed to upgrade the road standards to the
actual conditions of traffic and road safety and to ensure the sustainability of the investments. A
technical audit conductedinApril 2006 validated the necessity of the VOs and provided IDA the
basis for its no-objection dated December 2006. The major contributing factors for these
additional works are:

    (a) Increases in selected materials due to unanticipated amounts of soft soil along two of the
        civil works contract sites;
    (b) The need to strengthenpavement structure along these same sections to accommodate
        significantly increased traffic volumes. Traffic surveys conducted by the Engineer in
        2003, when compared to the traffic at project preparation in 1999, indicated substantial
        increasesinprojected traffic volume on the roads (approximately 15% per year);
    (c) Widening of NHl passingthrough urbantown areas incombination with other means of
        traffic managementfor the urbansections ofNH1for road safety provisions;
    (d) Reinforcement of pavement (asphalt overlay) on the highway sections of Can Tho and
        Bac Lieu cities; and

     (e) Limited unit price increases related to the additional costs incurred by the contractors in
         line with the terms o f the contract.

14.      Cost Overruns for the ProvincialFeeder Roads in the MDNI Sub-component. The
original project design and Development Credit Agreement (DCA) allocated US$8.75 million
(total cost US$9.76 million) to rehabilitate 128 km o f provincial feeder roads inthe MDNIsub-
component. To date, nine contracts covering approximately 71 km o f the region's provincial
level network are under implementation.                These contracts, let through National Competitive
Bidding (NCB)          procedures, constitute an aggregate value o f VND 140,227,169,635
(approximately US$8.88 million). Initial delays in procurement and implementation o f these
civil works resulted in significant price escalations (caused by an abnormal increase in material
prices inVietnam, specifically fuel and petroleum-based commodities that reflected international
price movements), which produced a financing gap in available funding for completion o f the
envisaged MDNItarget.

15.      Reallocation of Credit Proceeds. To accommodate the six bridges and improved
standards, the Borrower decided to pursue a reallocation of the Credit categories to finance the
current commitments related to the major highway investments. The State Bank o f Vietnam
recently requested and IDA i s processing, a reallocation o f the Credit proceeds which would be
borne through both the Credit's Unallocated Category and savings incurred as a result of
favorable exchange rate fluctuations between US$ and SDR. This will enable the Credit to
finance the six bridges and variation orders under the current project. The PDO will not change
as a result o f the reallocation o f the Credit categories. Table 1 below provides the current,
reallocated and additional credit financing per expenditure category. Table 2 provides a summary
o f the project costs for the original design, reallocation and Additional Finance by component.

16.       Government Request for Additional Financing. Having thus nearly completed the
major highway rehabilitation activities, the Borrower seeks additional financing to: (i)             complete
the remaining 58 km of road rehabilitation, which would allow the project to meet the original
target of 128 km of rehabilitation works in the region's road network (estimated to cost
US$14.90 million; US$13.49 million of IDA funds); and (ii)                 expansion of the original project
physical targets' for the construction of the Ganh Hao I1(GH2) Bridge, a 600 meter long bridge
that is located on the project's section of NH1 in Ca-Mau city, (estimated to cost US$14.81
million, US$10.67 million of IDA funds) and the supervision services for its construction (cost
about US$0.84 million).

17.       Rationale. The Additional Financing will enable the project to achieve the target output
of 128 km of provincial level feeder roads and to add a major bridge to complete the NH1
rehabilitation, as follows:

          (a) The remaining 58 km of the MDNI sub-component would improve the access and
               connectivity of rural villages with the major highway infrastructure. Completion of
               these roads would contribute to achieving one of the main project development
               objectives -- improving the accessibility and connectivity of rural areas to the main
               trade and movement corridors; and

          (b) The GH2 Bridge would support the completion of all related major bridgeworks on
               NH1,thereby increasing the efficiency of the primary highway investment supported
               by the present IDA Credit. The road investments already implemented under the
               existing project have widened the highway section in Ca Mau City on both sides of
               the bridge, leaving the only major bottleneck at the current bridge. This has createda
               critical capacity constraint in Ca Mau city, with subsequent road safety issues. The
               construction of anewbridge would provide a second, parallel structure to the existing
               bridge and would represent one o f the last crucial bridge works required for
               upgrading the highway sectionto Class IV standard.

18.      Project Design: Completion of the MDNI Sub-component. Preparation of the
remaining road sections of the MDNI component is underway; MOT has thus far selected and
approved a list of road sections from which the 58 km will be selected for IDA financing. The
selection of the proposed road segments follows the screening criteria established inthe original

project design, mainly traffic volume, pavement conditions, function in their immediate and
overall road network hierarchies, and bridge and ferry load capacities. Candidate roads are
evaluated by six (weighted) criteria:      connectivity, economic benefits, infrastructure costs,
minimal adverse social and environmental impact, spatial distribution, and support to planned
development projects.

19.    Relevant feasibility studies, detailed design, safeguard documents andN C B procurement
documents have been finalized. The first phase comprising 21 km (road sections TV PR911,and
BD PR742), have been selected in consultation with the provincial DOTS.Appraisal of these
roads was conducted and completed. The identification o f approximately 37 km (or more if cost
savings allow) will be carried out as a 2ndphase within the agreed selection criteria framework.

20.    ProjectDesign: Constructionof the GanhHao 2 Bridgein Ca Maucity. The original
project has now completed NHl rehabilitation through Ca Mau city to 24 meter width. With its
current width o f 12 meters the existing Ganh Hao River Bridge i s creating severe traffic
congestion at both approaches and major road safety hazardous location for the mixture o f two
wheel, car and truck traffic. To overcome this constraint, the Borrower has requested IDA
financing for a new 12 meter wide bridge, to complement the associated highway upgrade.

21.    The GH2 Bridge Feasibility Study incorporates the navigational needs o f the river and
the appropriate bridge standards, and indicates that the new parallel structure would have similar
features, clearance and size as the existing one; such that it would not obstruct the planned
service o f the water way. A continuous beam box cross section design i s proposed, which
presents the advantage o f a smoother ride and requires less maintenance than the actual beam
box structure o f the existing bridge. A road safety audit by an independent consultant will be
conducted for the final design o f the bridge, with the recommendations to be incorporated by the
design consultant. Financing of the safety requirement modifications is to be an element in the
constructioncontract.

22.    Proposed Changes to Project'sDOs, Design,and/or Scope. The additional Credit will
support the: (i)completion o f the remaining 58 km o f the Mekong Delta Network Improvement
(MDNI)component inorder to meet the original project target of 128 kmofrehabilitation work,
and (ii)construction of the a 600 meter long bridge (Ganh Hao I1Bridge) located on the project
road, National Highway 1 (NHl), inCa Mau City.

23.    The main physical project outputs will be adjusted to reflect the additional works on the
GH2 Bridge and the revised timetable for completion o f the MDNI-subcomponent (see
paragraph 17). The project performance indicators have also been amended and are described in
Section VI. The baseline data for the specified indicators will be collected during the final
engineering design o f the GH2 Bridge and will be providedby the end o f September 2007.

26.        Institutional and Implementation Arrangements. The institutional arrangement for
project implementation will remain unchanged. PMU1 under MOT will be the implementing
agency. It will directly administer contracts for the on-going project and the activities funded
under the Additional Finance. PMU1 will oversee procurement and administer contracts
procured under both national competitive bidding (NCB) and international competitive bidding
(ICB). The provincial transport authorities, on behalf of their Provincial Peoples Committees,
will be responsible for resettlement activities and will be responsible for compensation
payments.

27.       ConstructionSupervision. International consultantswill conduct the supervision of the
civil works. The provincial roads and the GH2 Bridge are to be covered by two different
supervision consulting services. Consulting services for the MDNI subcomponent are already in

                                                                          7

place for the ongoing program. The construction supervision consultant for the GH2 Bridge will
be procured separately. For both contracts, the supervision will consist of: (a) materials testing,
verification o f construction quantities, schedules, and general adherence to the contract clauses,
construction standards and approved final designs; (b) assistance to the P M U1with management
o f the construction contracts, coordination and reporting; (c) assistancewith the coordination and
reporting o f progress, schedules, target indicators, and with general project monitoring including
environmental monitoring; and (d) technological and knowledge transfer to relevant staff in
construction management, and monitoring and use o f internationally accepted procedures and
standards for quality, management and reporting.

28.      In relation to the overall moderately satisfactory project ratings for implementation,
improvement inthe near future i s planned as follows: the implementing agency will improve its
monitoring and management o f the project, as M O T has confirmed that it will issue instructions
to the contractors improve the implementation progress. An updated action planwill be required
from the contractors, which will be monitored every 10 days by P M U l and penalties and other
remedial measures will be applied. In addition, the PMU1 has updated the target indicators for
improvedmonitoring and evaluation and reporting.

29.      Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements. The MTFP project has
been regularly supervised. The Financial Management (FM) arrangements have been assessed
as Moderately Satisfactory. The following provides details o f financial management assessment.

30.     Budgeting. Improvement o f budget management i s noted where budget i s updated more
frequently. A tool for budget management i s being built as a part o f the new reporting system
which i s under development by a consulting firm.

31.     Accounting System The policies and procedures applied for MTFP are the procedures
applied for the government funded projects or the projects funded by other donors. The current
software has been used for accounting for the MTFP and other projects managed by PMU1.

32.     Internal Controls.      The draft o f financial management manual developed by the
consultant for PMU1 was provided which is comprehensive and covers in details the procedures
of financial management which will be applied for all projects managed by PMU1.

33.     Financial Reporting.      The past rating of "Moderately Satisfactory" for Financial
Management o f MTFP was the result o f the non-submission o f quarterly Project Monitoring
Reports (PMR). This has been improved in the first quarter o f 2007. The PMR for the first
quarter of 2007 was sent to the Bank in April 2007 and PMUl committed to send the next
quarterly PMR within 45 days o f the quarter end as set in the Credit Agreement.          Financial
management staff from the Bank will continue to provide support and coaching to improve the
quality o fPMRsprepared by the PMU1.

34.     External Audit. The audit report for MTFP was submitted on time and the audit opinion
is unqualified and the management letter revealed no matter o f accountability. The annual
financial statements o f Additional Financing will be audited by an independent auditor
acceptable to the Bank under Terms o f Reference acceptable to the Bank.

35.     The allocation ofthe Additional Finance proceeds i s shown inTable 5.

37.    Procurement. Procurementunder the proposedAdditionalFinancewill be carriedout in
accordancewith the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurementunder IBRDLoans andIDCredits'
published by the Bank in May 2004, revised on October 1, 2006", and "Guidelines: Selection
andEmploymentof Consultantsby WorldBank" publishedby the Bank inMay2004, revisedon
October 1, 2006 and the provisions stipulated in the FinancingAgreement. The processing of
procurement under the on-going operation has encountered delays, primarily in the preparation
of biddingdocuments and evaluation of bids. While PMU1 is familiar with Bank procurement
and consultants' selection guidelines, reconcilingdifferencesbetweenthe Bank's Guidelines and
the Government's procurement rules when there is a conflict betweenthe provisions in the two
documents has slowedthe process. The delays inbidevaluationhave ledto severalrequests for
the extensionofbidvalidityperiod.


                                                   9

38.     The procurement risk rating for the project remains as Average and the prior review
thresholds and the procurement method thresholds under the on-going project will be
maintained; however, the aggregate thresholds for all non-ICB procurement will be deleted,
given that the procurement plan for uncommitted funds under the on going operation and the
plan for the additional financing has been agreed with the Borrower. All o f the contracts under
the additional financing will be subject to IDA prior review.

39.     Procurement activities will continue to be carried out by PMU1.              While recent
supervision missions have indicated that adequate counterpart and PMU1 staff inputs have been
available on the original project, extra staff would be put in place to handle the additional
activities and to improve contract management and supervision and cost control. The Draft
Procurement Plan for uncommitted funds under the ongoing project together with the additional
financing is attached as Annex 1.         It was agreed that the same consultants who were
competitively selected under the on-going project will carry out the additional services for
preparation o f the detailed designs, and preparation of bidding documents. The consultant for
construction supervision for the works to be financed under the Additional Finance will be
competitively selected by QCBS method. The procurement plan will be updated by the Project
Team and agreed on by IDA annually, or as required, to reflect the actual project implementation
needs. Service Standards for processing procurement have been agreed with PMU1 and MOT.
Each quarter, the PMUl will submit to IDA procurement monitoring reports and contract
expenditure and progress reports as part o fthe project's Interim Financial Reports (IFR).

40.     Safeguards. The Project Office has developed an Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA) and a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the GH2 Bridge in line with relevant
Government and World Bank safeguard policies (no ethnic minority issues were identified).
These documents have been reviewed and cleared, as they comply with relevant Bank policies.
The EIA and RAP have also beendisclosed both inthe country and at the World Bank Infoshop.
As specified under the original Credit, PMU1 i s responsible for the Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) implementation, including monitoring and reporting to the DONRE, and mitigating
any unforeseen impacts during construction.       PMUl will ensure that the actions required to
mitigate impacts during construction are included in the contract documents and will supervise
compliance with the assistance o f the supervising engineers. PMUl will also hire qualified
consultants to undertake the environmental monitoring program and will assign one full-time
staffto coordinate and supervise the implementation o f the EMP.

41,     Social Safeguards. P M U l will coordinate with the provincial and district resettlement
committees established by the peoples' committees in Ca Mau province for implementing the
resettlement action plan. The land acquisition impacts occurring on the road approach on both
sides o f the bridge result in a total of 87 project affected households (PAHs), including 423
project affected persons (PAPs).      There are no PAPs from an ethnic minority group, and
therefore the indigenous peoples policy i s not triggered. The total residential land area acquired
for widening o f the road approaches i s 4159 m2,mainly for the households living along the sides
o f the road approaches who are relying on small shop services. A majority o f the PAHs will
reorganize their houses, while 39 PAHs will be relocated as they preferred to receive cash
compensation to buy new residential land themselves. In line with Bank requirement on social
safeguards, the RAP has been developed in full consultation with the local peoples. The cost



                                                 10

estimate of the RAP is about VND 40 billion (US$2.5 million equivalent) and will come from
the counterpart find, including the cost for independentmonitoring of RAP implementation.

42.     Environmental Safeguards.       The proposed Additional Financing will not raise the
environmental safeguards category, nor will it trigger new safeguards policies. The works
proposedto be financed involve restoration of existing road alignments and for the GH2 Bridge a
parallel structure to the existing bridge will be built so that four lanes of traffic can be
accommodated. Therefore, the potential for negative environmental impact of the project is
expected to be minimal and limited to the effects of air emissions, noise, erosion and
sedimentation, impacts on aquatic and vegetation habitat, and effects on public heath, all of
which are localized and of short term, are manageable with proven road maintenance mitigation
techniques. The Category B rating is consistentwith OP4.01.

43.     The project will implement an Environmental Action Plan (EAP). PMUl will assign
within the PMUl an environmental specialist to follow and monitor the implementation of the
EAP.     This specialist should be trained to guide the contractor in the preparation and
implementation of the EAP.       The recommendations to minimize and mitigate the adverse
impacts will be incorporated in the detailed design of the civil works.          In addition, the
independentteam of consultants selected to carry out the environmental monitoring of the civil
works under the original Credit will be also monitoring the works underthe additional financing.

44.     The project team includes an environmental specialist who reviews the environmental
aspects during supervision missions, and when needed makes recommendations to rectify
deficiencies noted. The environmental specialist also reviews the monitoring reports and follows
up with the consultants and the PMU1 for implementation of the recommendations. The
Engineer's monthly reports also provide feedback on compliance with environmental plans.

45.     Closing Date and Implementation Schedule. According to the current estimate, the
additional-finance works can be completed by June 30, 2010 and the new closing date would be
December31,2010. The proposedimplementation schedule is indicated inAnnex 2.


                               IV. Consistency with CAS or CPS

46.     The additional financing conforms to the first pillar of the Country Partnership Strategy,
`Improving the Business Environment,' by supporting on-going investments in the expansion
and level of service for the nation's primary highway corridor, NHl, thus improving transport
efficiency and reliability and reducing transport costs. The second pillar, `Strengthening Social
Inclusion,' is supported through the provision of provincial level feeder roads under the MDNI
sub-component. By facilitating the access and connectivity of rural communities with the major

   V. EconomicAnalysis of FinancingGap andAppraisal of Scaledup ProjectActivities

47.     EconomicAnalysis of Financing Gap. The selection o f both the on-going road works
and proposed road segments is based on initial screening criteria established in the project
design, mainly an assessment o f traffic volume, pavement conditions, functions in their
immediate and overall road network hierarchies, and bridge load capacities. Candidate roads
were then evaluated by six (weighted) criteria: connectivity, economic benefits, infrastructure
costs, minimal adverse social and environmental impact, spatial distribution, and support to
planneddevelopment projects. Beneficial effects earned highscores, with the highestweight (60
percent) assigned to economic benefits. The weighted scores were aggregated, totaled for each
site, and rankedfrom highest to lowest, with the selected road segments taking into consideration
their rank, the established budget constraint, and network effects. Because the subcomponent i s
based on a multi criteria evaluation, o f which the quantified benefits form only one element, a
sensitivityanalysis was not performed.

48.     By applying the above mentioned methodology, 21 km o f provincial roads that were
screened under the original project has been selected for improvement under the additional
financing. The remaining 37 km will be further screened and selected during implementation
phase o f the additional credit to fulfill the targeted 128 km of provincial road network to be
improved. Ifthere i s cost savings, more road segments will be selected for improvement based
on the stated methodology.

49.     Appraisal of Restructured or Scaled-Up Project Activities. The improvement to the
GanhHao Bridge will alleviate an existing constraint inthe network where a four lane highway
has to narrow to two lanes at the site o f the existing GH2 Bridge. The proposed improvement
will build a parallel structure to the existing bridge so that four lanes of traffic can be
accommodated.      Appraisal o f the additional financing for the Project was conducted and
completed consistent with the conclusions and guidance provided during the virtual review
meeting that concluded on April 25,2007.

50.     The benefits from the investment will include reduced vehicle operating costs from time
savings associated with reduced congestion and lower accident rates. These benefits have been
calculated using the Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4).

51.     Traffic counts at the bridge show relatively high traffic levels and particularly high
motorcycle numbers. Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) i s 63,598 o f which 1,860 i s four
wheel vehicles and 61,738 are motorcycles. Given the economic development in the area and
the infrastructure improvements to the rest o f the network it i s considered that traffic growth
rates will be high. Growth forecasts range from 8 percent inthe period from 2008 to 2017 and 6
percent from 2017 onwards.

52.     A numbero falternatives were considered for the designofthe new bridge as described in
the technical section. The financial costs presented in Table 7 were reduced by 12.5 percent to
obtain economic costs for the purposes o f the economic analysis.

53.     Maintenance costs were included in the analysis based on unit rates for defined
maintenance activities such as sealing, patching, overlays and maintenance to the structure o f the
bridge.

54.     The cost benefit analysis was conducted using HDM-4. A discount rate o f 12 percent
was applied and the evaluation period was 20 years. The Economic Internal Rate of Return
(EIRR) was 14.3 percent with a Net Present Value (NPV) o f US$2.35 million. A sensitivity
analysis was also conducted using scenarios where construction costs went up by 20 percent, that
traffic growth rates were reduced to 6 percent and 4 percent compared to 8 percent and 6 percent,
and where construction costs were increased by 10 percent and traffic growth reduced to 7
percent and 5 percent, respectively. Although the EIRR's reduced in each o f these scenarios,
they were all over 12 percent. It can therefore be concluded that this investment i s economically
viable even given lower than expected benefits andhigher than expected costs.


                                      VI. ExpectedOutcomes

55.     The additional financing will enable the project to achieve the envisaged outputs o f the
MDNI sub-component, thus improving the access and connectivity of rural villages with the
major highway infrastructure.         Project performance/output indicators on MDNI project
component will remain unchanged.

56.     The highway improvements financed under the Credit (Cr. 3448-VN) widened the
highway to 24 meters on both sides o f the existing Ganh Hao River Bridge (currently 12 meter
width), creating a critical capacity constraint inCa Mau city. The GH2 Bridge would provide a
second, parallel structure to alleviate this bottleneck and would represent the last crucial bridge
works required for upgrading the entire highway section to Class IV standards. At the end o f the
project period, the expected outcomes, in addition to those generated under the original Credit,
are: (a) congestion alleviation along the corridor o f the GH2 Bridge section, and (b) reduction in
accidents and fatalities along inthe bridge section.

57.      The original project outputhmpact indicators are revised to incorporate the additional
indicators, as specified in Annex 3. The Baseline data will be collected during the Bridge final
design stage.


                                           VII.   BenefitsandRisks

58.      The overall risk for the ongoing operation was rated "Modest." The additional financing
i s also considered to be of Modest risk, the risks and the proposedmeasuresto reduce them are
as follows:

            (a) Slow project implementation. The institutional arrangement for project
                implementation will remain unchanged, with PMUl as the executing agency of
                behalf of MOT. PMUl due diligence has improved with the recent appointment
                of a new Deputy Director who has broad experience managing contracts and the
                PMU1's affairs. While contractor mobilization of financial resources hindered
                implementation of the larger ICB packages during the original project, with the
                prime contractor relying on SOE sub-contractors for liquidity, MOT and IDA
                analysis of the contractors' eligibility and fiduciary capacity to undertake the
                bridgeworks is expected to mitigate this risk. With the exception of the GH2
                bridge and possibly two MDNI contracts, most of the bidding packages are
                planned as NCB. During implementation of the MTFP, the local contractors
                engaged by NCB processes have performed satisfactorily and no major
                implementation issues have affected the construction works.

            (b) Time-consuming Governmental Internal Decision Process. The relatively
                advancedpreparation of design and procurement planning for the limitednumber
                of packages proposed should facilitate implementation.          Furthermore, major
                delays in internal approvals appear unlikely given that the Prime Minister has
                granted delegation to MOT for the approval of the feasibility study, safeguard
                reports, and the additional financing to facilitate timely implementation.


            VIII. FinancialTerms and Conditionsfor the AdditionalFinancing

59.      The additional financing will be inthe form of an IDA Credit, and as the ongoing project
i s financed by a Credit, the financing terms and conditions will remain the same.
