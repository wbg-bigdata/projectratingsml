DEFINITION OF TERMS
Cut-off-date       The date of starting of inventory of losses during preparation of the
                   RAP. The cut-off-date of the Project shall be 15 June 2004. Displaced
                   Persons and local communities will be informed of the cut-off date for
                   the Project, and that anyone moving into the Project Area after that
                   date will not be entitled to compensation and assistance under the
                   Project.

Eligibility        Any person who at the cut-off-date was located within the area
                   affected by the project, its sub-components, or other subproject parts
                   thereof, and would: (i) have formal legal rights to land (including
                   customary and traditional rights recognized under the laws of the
                   country); or (ii) not have formal legal rights to land at the time the
                   census begins but have a claim to such land or assets ­ provided that
                   such claims are recognized under the laws of the country or become
                   recognized through process identified in the resettlement plan; (iii) not
                   have legal nor recognizable by laws rights to the land they are
                   occupying, they live or/and have properties/assets within the project
                   areas before the cut-off date. Persons covered under (i) and (ii) are
                   provided compensation for the land they lose and other assistance at
                   full replacement cost. Persons covered under (iii) are provided
                   resettlement assistance in lieu of compensation for the land they
                   occupy, and other assistance, as necessary, to achieve the objectives
                   set in this PF, if they occupy the project area prior to a cut-off date.
                   Persons who encroach on the area after the cut-off date are not
                   entitled to compensation or any other form of resettlement assistance.

Replacement cost   Is the term used to determine the amount sufficient to replace lost
                   assets and cover transaction costs. For loses that cannot easily be
                   valued or compensated for in monetary terms (e.g. access to public
                   services, customers, and supplies; or to fishing, grazing, or forest
                   areas), attempts are made to establish access to equivalent and
                   culturally acceptable resources and earning opportunities. When
                   domestic laws do not meet the standard of compensation at full
                   replacement cost, compensation under domestic law is supplemented
                   by additional measures necessary to meet the replacement cost
                   standards.

Resettlement       Is the general term related to land acquisition and compensation for
                   loss of asset whether it involves actual relocation, loss of land, shelter,
                   assets or other means of livelihood.

                                                                    Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)



                  Summary of Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
            For the 06 Bridges between Dam Cung and Nam Can


The Highway No.1 Project Management Unit (PMU1) has been established for Project
preparation and implementation for this project and other similar Projects for the
improvement of National Highway No.1 (NH-1) and Mekong Transport Network financed by
multilateral and bilateral agencies.

The feasibility study for this Project has been carried out in 2004 by the consultants ­
APECO, who also conducted the detailed design of the roads of the Improvement of the
Mekong Transport Network in November 2004.

At present, National Highway No.1 Rehabilitation Project - Phase 3 is being carried out and it
is estimated to complete at the end of 2007. National Highway No1, Dam Cung ­ Nam Can
section is approximately 12 km ( from Km 2290+000 to Km2301+680) and it is the end
section of National Highway No1 of which road components are under construction in
National Highway No1 Rehabilitaion Project, section Can Tho-Nam Can (WB3 project). On
the alignment, there are 06 temporary weak bridges which do not meet technical standards
of class IV highway of Ca Mau ­ Nam Can section in the future. The World Bank (WB)
accepted additional funds for construction of these 06 bridges. The PMU1 is Employer, and
the Apeco consultants carry out Feasibility Study for 06 bridges using counterpart fund.

Thus, the rehabilitation of NH1, Ca Mau ­ Nam Can section and construction of 06 bridges
on the section will improve the transport in the area.

Therefore, The Ministry of Transport (MoT) of the Government of Viet Nam proposed to
apply additional financial assistance in the form of a Supplemental Credit from the IDA i.e.
under the Improvement of the Mekong Transport Network component for the construction of
06 bridges on Dam Cung-Nam Can section (Km2290+000 to Km2301+680) on National
Highway No1.
Construction of 06 Bridges and Bridge Approaches anticipates a land acquisition and
resettlement impacts for:

     ·  Construction of 06 bridges of 9 meters wide located approx. 15m from the existing
        bridges in horizontal direction.
     ·  Other temporary land acquisition during civil works
     ·  Establishment of roads' Right of Way (ROW) safety areas, distances on each side of
        roads shall be 3m.

Therefore, this Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared based on the results of:
(i) Inventory of losses caused by the project, conducted by Resettlement Specialists of the
Asia Pacific Engineering Consultants (APECO) in cooperation with the PMU1's staffs as well
as relevant local authorities in the period of June 2004 to July 2004; (ii) Field observation of
the project' physical works that anticipate land acquisition and resettlement impacts; (iii)
Stakeholders consultations, including consultation with local authorities at different levels
(provincial/city's, district's and wards); (iv) Interviews with displaced and non-displaced
people; and (v) Group discussion and consultation with DPs in the project areas. During the

                                                                      Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)


project preparation, extensive consultations with local authorities were held by the consultant
to discuss alternative options to minimize land acquisition and resettlement impacts.



.According to the results of the Inventory, the project will:

    ·   Permanently acquire about 29,409 m2 of agricultural land
    ·   Permanently acquire about 1460 m2 of residential land in which there constructed
        815 m2 of class IV houses
    ·   Temporarily acquire about 39,046 m2 of agricultural land during construction
    ·   Affect 21 households (HHs): 13 partial losses, and 8 total losses that will have to
        relocate. That represent about five percent of the total area of the affected agricultural
        units.

This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) aims to guide implementation of project compensation
activities and provision of rehabilitation assistance measures to DPs impacted by the projects
components. Policies for compensation, relocation, and rehabilitation have been established
based on these surveys, applying Vietnam's existing laws and regulations and the World
Bank Operational Directives/Policies. A full and accurate scale of land acquisition and
resettlement impacts of the project will be identified through an updated detailed
measurement survey (DMS) during the implementation stage, when the detailed engineering
design are completed, providing required technical information, and land marks, clearly
indicating the project area, are staked on the ground. Results of the DMS will serve are the
basis for updating this resettlement plan and will be the final legal basis for compensation,
resettlement and construction of the 06 Bridges.

The main objectives of the RAP are to ensure that all DPs caused by the 06 Bridges between
Dam Cung and Nam Can             will be compensated or assisted in accordance with current
resettlement policies.

The total resettlement plan implementation cost           for the Project is estimated approx.
3,321,551,000 VND.

1 Introduction

Ca Mau is the southernmost province of the 64 provinces in Vietnam. Ca Mau province has
the natural area of 5,208.8 square kilometers equivalent to 13.1% of total area of the Mekong
Delta region of Vietnam or 1.57% the country area. It has a population of 1,119 thousands (in
2000). The province adjoins Kien Giang and Bac Lieu provinces on the North, the East Sea
on the South and the Gulf of Thailand on the West.

Ca Mau province is administratively divided into 8 districts and Ca Mau city which is 350 km
far from Ho Chi Minh City and 180 km from Can Tho city to the south. From Ca Mau city the
NH1 continues its course to Nam Can district where Nam Can sea port is being constructed
at the end of NH1.

Ca Mau is relatively thinly populated. In 2002, the population of the province was 1123.3
thousand. Urban population was 246.2 thousand and rural population was 877.1 thousand.
Population of labor ages is 500 thousand accounting for 44.6% of total population. In
general, a majority of labor force is unskilled with only 5.8% of the labor force have been
trained. The climate in Ca Mau is tropical monsoon and affected by the equator climate.
Therefore, the average temperature for the year is high and stable at 26.5oC. There are two
seasons in Ca Mau: the rainy season (June to November) and the dry season (from
December to May).

The terrain is flat and low approximately 0.5m to 0.7m above sea level Southernmost Ca
Mau province with its seafood, large crude oil reserves and mangrove and cajuput forests
has the potential to attract domestic and foreign investment. With a coastline of 254 km and
almost 250,000 ha of water surface for shrimp farming, Ca Mau is one of four key fishing
grounds in Viet Nam.

The province has injected money into developing the seafood processing industry along with
zoning off material areas in order to fully tap its potential.

Aside from developing services and infrastructure for fishing and crude oil exploitation, Ca
Mau has developed fleets of deep-sea fishing vessels, gradually replacing coastal fishing
ships. The province has also built advanced seafood processing factories to diversify
products for export suitable to market demands.

Annual seafood output increased 10.85 percent in 2002 helped by a rise in the output of
shrimps to 75,000 tones and the output of processed seafood to 55,000 tones, meeting
international standards and entering into foreign markets. Ca Mau registered export
turnovers of $252 million USD in 2001, $304 million USD in 2002 and $350 million USD in
2003 of which processed seafood will contribute $341 million USD.

The sea-born economy has contributed to the province's socio-economic development, with
gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates of 10.8 percent in 2001 and 11.3 percent in
2002.

The province also has a large oil and gas reserve, attracting long-term investment. In 2002,
construction of the Ca Mau gas-electricity-fertilizer industrial zone started with an investment
capital of $1.7 billion USD.

In the last 7 years, in pursuant to the approval master plan, the Local authorities cooperated
with their related agencies in establishing the detailed plan of 26 projects, with total area of
1,319.71 ha, including: Industrial zone ­ Industrial Center, Trade Center, residential quarters,

paddy has amounted to 390.262 tons, output of shrimp has amounted to 13.480 tons,
increasing 49.58% on annual average.

The Government of Viet Nam applied for additional financing from the International
Development Association (IDA) towards the cost of the Mekong Transport and Flood
Protection Project (MTFPP) and which included the components for the National Highway
No.1 Rehabilitation Project - Phase 3 and Improvement of the Mekong Transport Network
(IMTN).

The Highway No.1 Project Management Unit (PMU1) has been established for Project
preparation and implementation for this project and other similar Projects for the
improvement of National Highway No.1 (NH-1) and Mekong Transport Network financed by
multilateral and bilateral agencies.

The feasibility study for this Project has been carried out in 1998 under the Third Highway
Rehabilitation Project (HRP2) by the consultants ­ APECO, who also conducted the detailed
design of the roads of the Improvement of the Mekong Transport Network in November
2003.

At present, National Highway No.1 Rehabilitation Project - Phase 3 is being carried out and it
is estimated to complete at the end of 2007. National Highway No1, Dam Cung ­ Nam Can
section is approximately 12 km ( from Km 2290+000 to Km2301+680) and it is the end
section of National Highway No1 of which road components are under construction in
National Highway No1 Rehabilitaion Project, section Can Tho-Nam Can (WB3 project). On
the alignment, there are 06 temporary weak bridges, which do not meet technical standards
of class IV highway of Ca Mau ­ Nam Can section in the future. The World Bank (WB)
accepted additional funds for construction of these 06 bridges. The PMU1 is Employer, and
the Apeco consultants carry out Feasibility Study for 06 bridges using counterpart fund.

Thus, the rehabilitation of NH1, Ca Mau ­ Nam Can section and construction of 06 bridges
on the section will improve the transport in the area.

Therefore, The Ministry of Transport (MoT) of the Government of Viet Nam proposed to
apply additional financial assistance in the form of a Supplemental Credit from the IDA i.e.
under the Improvement of the Mekong Transport Network component for the construction of
06 bridges on Dam Cung-Nam Can section (Km2290+000 to Km2301+680) on National
Highway No1

2 Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement

2.1 General Description
The roadway transport network in Ca Mau province is 2.177 km total length, with the average
formation of 4m; including 100 Km of macadam penetration road and 291km asphalt road.
The National Highway No.1 along Ca Mau province is most important highway, with the
length of approx. 70 km from the East Gateway of Ca Mau City to Nam Can district, from
here there are a lot of inter-district road and connection road to districts, communes, towns in
province. The National Highway No.63 from Ca Mau to Kien Giang is being improved and is
an important road in the North of Ca Mau province

The ratio of road length to area is 0.04km/km2 which are the lowest in Vietnam. While the
national highways are being rehabilitated and paved, most of local road is unpaved and
impassable in the rainy season.

The principal mode of transport in Ca Mau is via waterways. The inland waterways including
canals and rivers that are used for transport are 540 km in length. The waterways carry
69.8% of goods and 50% of passengers. The waterway is a cheap mode of transport but
despite its advantage in general goods transport, its disadvantages in transport of passenger
and some special commodities are apparent as the boats carrying such loads are normally
very speedy and thus very dangerous. The waves generated from such speed boats cause
serious erosion to river banks and once an accident occurs, there will be a big loss of people
and much damage to the environment from its oil spills.

It can be expected that when the rehabilitation of the NH1 from Can Tho to Nam Can is
completed, the transport road networks of the region will be enormously improved especially
to the poor Nam Can, Ngoc Hien, Tran Van Thoi, Dam Doi and Cai Nuoc district

2.3    Land Acquisition Impacts

1.        Construction of 06 Bridges and Bridge Approaches anticipates a land acquisition
and resettlement impacts for:

    ·  Construction of 06 bridges of 9 and 12 meter wide located approx. 15m from the
       existing bridges in horizontal direction.
    ·  Other temporary land acquisition during civil works
    ·  Establishment of roads' Right of Way (ROW) safety areas, distances on each side of
       roads shall be 3m.

2.        During the project preparation, in close cooperation with respective PDOT,
extensive consultations with local authorities were held by the consultant to discuss
alternative options to minimize land acquisition and resettlement impacts.

3.         Regardless of the mentioned measures, it is anticipated that the 6 bridge project will
involve certain resettlement impacts. Based on the FS technical design, a Census and
Inventory of Losses (IOL) for the 06 Bridges was conducted by the Asia Pacific Engineering
Consultants (APECO) during the period of June 2004 to July 2004. According to the results
of the Inventory, the project will:

    ·    Permanently acquire about 29,409 m2 of agricultural land
    ·    Permanently acquire about 1460 m2 of residential land in which there constructed
         815 m2 of class IV houses
    ·    Temporarily acquire about 39,046 m2 of agricultural land during construction
    ·    Affect 21 households (HHs)

         8 houses are shown above are loss of over than 73% of residential land and remain
less than 40m2, so that they have to relocated out of their land. There is no plan for
resettlement sites due to almost affected people living in sub-urban zone. These households
will receive the compensation and/or relocate by themselves. Besides, the commune agents
will provide new lands within the residential quarter for the households whose land is
acquired totally or not enough to reorganize the structures on the same site

5.         This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared to guide implementation of
project compensation activities and provision of rehabilitation assistance measures to DPs
impacted by the projects components. Policies for compensation, relocation, and
rehabilitation have been established based on these surveys, applying Vietnam's existing

laws and regulations and the World Bank Operational Directives/Policies (as relevant):
Operational Policy (OP) 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement, Operational Directive (OD) 4.20
on Indigenous People and OP4.11 on Cultural Property. A full and accurate scale of land
acquisition and resettlement impacts of the project will be identified through an updated
detailed measurement survey (DMS) during the implementation stage, when the detailed
engineering design are completed, providing required technical information, and land marks,
clearly indicating the project area, are staked on the ground. Results of the DMS will serve
are the basis for updating this resettlement plan and will be the final legal basis for
compensation, resettlement and construction of the 06 Bridges.

6.         Following approval by WB and the Government, the updated RAP will be
implemented by local resettlement committees (RCs) under the guidance of the provincial
people's committee (PPC) and PMU1 of the MOT. Careful coordination between all the
agencies and departments will be necessary to successfully complete the different
resettlement activities. The provisions and policies of this RAP will form the legal basis for
the implementation of resettlement activities for the 06 Bridges.

3.1 Sources of Information

7.          Socioeconomic information of this RAP has been taken from several sources: (i)
results of IOL for 100% of affected households of the 06 Bridges; (ii) results of socio-economic
household survey of the DPs; (iii) results of formal and informal meetings and group discussions
with local authorities and social groups in project impacted areas. The consultation activities
were held by the Consultant's Resettlement Specialist in cooperation with the PMU1 and local
authorities. All of these activities were carried out in the period of June ­ July 2004.

3.2 Demographic Features of DPs

8.          Other demographic features of the DPs, including ethnicity, age composition of the
affected HHs and characteristics of their HHHs, including education and occupation of DPs'

3.3 Education

9.        Vietnam is recognized as one of the most successful among the developing countries
in term of its achievements in compulsory education in the context of its low per capita income
status. The Government has made great efforts to provide education for all. During the
economic "renovation" period, the access to education throughout the country, including in the
Mekong Delta, has been radically improved. The primary compulsory education has been
achieved throughout the country, and today the basic secondary education has also become
compulsory in most of the provinces of Vietnam. In this context, the Mekong Delta is not an
exception, where nowadays, the illiteracy is mainly found among the aged population.
Regardless of the great progress, the Mekong Delta still remains to be the region, whose overall
education level is among the lowest compared to the other regions of the country.

10.       The average schooling of the DPs' HHHs is 6.1 years, and it is 6.7 years among the
HHs' surveyed population, with a slight variation between the affected communes and districts.
There is a certain relationship between education level and the average age, and location of the
affected population: the younger the DPs are and/or the closer to urban centers/urbanized
areas or to main road arteries the DPs are located, the higher their education levels are.

11.       The education of the surveyed population confirms the fact about the improved
education status among the younger generation.

   3.4 Land Tenure

   12.         The Ca Mau is one of the provinces with the average highest agricultural holding
   (about 0.65 ha/HH) in the country. Meanwhile, it is also a region where landlessness of the
   farmers is most serious. In the Delta, farmers without recognized rights to the land they cultivate
   are hardly found. It means that all the affected DPs have legal or legalizable right to their
   affected land.. The 6 bridges generally poses a linear impacts on land with an exception for the
   case where the bypass or new road section are anticipated. That is why it can hardly cause
   severe impacts on the local farmers.

   The widespread combination between residential land and garden land and/or the custom of
   building house on agricultural land are also the factors that could reduce the possible risks of
   displacing people to a new site by the project. The results of socioeconomic survey and public
   consultations with affected people and other stakeholder groups confirm these conclusions.

   3.5 Income Sources and Incomes

   13.         The commercial service value has amounted to 4.748 billions dong for last 7 years,
   increasing 17.53% on annual average. Compared with the year 1998, now there are 7.150
   establishments, increasing 2.875 establishments, the annual average growth speed is 7.62%.
   The kinds of transport, financial, bank, postal services... are expanded, with the attendance of
   the economic components to sever better the production requirements and life of the people.

  14.        The structure of income sources of the DPs' HHHs as well as of the sample surveyed
  population of the 06 Bridges Project reflect the general regional employment picture with
  services production being predominant over all the other economic activities: on average, more
  than 49.5 % of the total affected HHHs and 38.5% of the surveyed HHs' labors are engaged in
  service sector. Commercial activities are the second main sources of income of the affected
  population, involving 20.5% of the DPs' HHHs and 16.5% of the HHs' active laborers surveyed.
  The state employment is the third important source of income, where 17.5% of the HHHs and
  15.0% of the HHs' surveyed population are engaged in. The figures in the Tables 10 and 11
  below provide the data on occupation structure of the affected population.

3.6 Living Conditions and Possessions of Assets

16.       100% of the affected HHs surveyed has access to electricity city. All of them used safe
water from local water factory (See Table 13, and see Annex B for further details). All affected
wards have basic social infrastructure, including primary school, post office and health care
centers. They also have their own market.

17.       The majority of the affected population has access to common telecommunication
systems, 100% of the HHs possessing TV, while the telephone ownership rate is equal to 15
phones per 100 persons. Table 14 provides the data on household assets for the surveyed
HHs. It again indicates fair living standards among the affected population in general. (See
Annex B for more details.)

4.2 World Bank Policies

21.       The World Bank experience indicates that involuntary resettlement under development
projects, if un-mitigated, often gives rise to severe economic, social, and environmental risks.
Thus the World Bank policy regulated by OP 4.12 includes safeguards to address and mitigate
these impoverishment risks.

22.       The basic guiding principle of the World Bank resettlement policy is that:

    ·  Involuntary resettlement should be avoided, where feasible, or minimized, exploring all
       viable alternatives in project design;
    ·  Where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be conceived
       and executed as sustainable development programs, providing sufficient investment
       resources to enable the person displaced by the project to share benefit. Displaced
       persons should be meaningfully consulted and participate in planning and implementing
       resettlement programs.
    ·  Displaced persons should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and
       standards of living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels or
       to levels prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is higher.

23.       The OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples, requiring all projects that are affecting indigenous
peoples to engage these people in a process of free, prior, and informed consultation; and to
prepare an Ethnic Minority Development Plan (EMDP) that will ensure these people to receive
social and economic benefits that are culturally appropriate and gender- and "inter-
generationally" inclusive.

24.       The OP 4.11 on Cultural Property, ensuring preservation and seeking to avoid the
elimination, of sites having archaeological, paleontological, historical, religious and unique
natural values. The Bank declines to assist those projects that will bring damage to cultural
property.

4.3 Government, World Bank, and MTFPP


25.       In general, the Land Law 2003, Decree 197/CP and amended Decree 17/2006/CP
satisfy the most principles and objectives of the World Bank's Policy on Involuntary
Resettlement. However, according to experiences from previous projects, it indicated that more
consideration should be paid to all of the project affected households, particularly for the poor
households, and social policy's households.

26.       To ensure faire compensations, and rehabilitation of the DPs caused by land
acquisition and loss of house land/assets due to the project development, the Government of
Vietnam will approve or assign the Ministry of Transport to approve the Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) of the 06 Bridges.

5 Compensation Policy

5.1 Objectives of Resettlement

27.       The objectives of the Vietnamese legislation governing resettlement and rehabilitation
of displaced persons (DPs) and those of the World Bank concerning involuntary resettlement
have been adapted for the preparation of this Resettlement Plan (RP) for the 06 Bridges. The
objectives are set out below. An entitlement matrix is shown in Annex A. The policies and

                                                     THE 06 BRIDGES BETWEEN DAM CUNG AND NAM CAN

                                                                           Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)

principles adopted for the Project supersede the provisions of relevant decrees currently in force
in Vietnam wherever a gap exists between the World Bank policy (OP 4.12) and Vietnamese
law.

28.       The main objective of the RAP is to ensure that all DPs caused by the 06 Bridges will be
compensated or assisted for their losses and will be provided with rehabilitation measures to
improve, or at least to maintain, their pre-project living standards and income earning capacity.

5.2 Displaced People (DP)

29.       Displaced People (DP) are those who, at the subprojects' Cut-off Date, are affected by:

        (i) the involuntary taking of land resulting in:
        a)       relocation or loss of shelter;
        b)       lost of assets or access to assets;
        c)       loss of income sources or means of livelihood, whether or not the affected
                 persons must move to another location; or


5.3 Principles of Resettlement

30.       The principle for resettlement policy in the project will be as follows:

      a)       Acquisition of land and other assets, and resettlement of people will be minimized
               as much as possible.
      b)       All DPs residing, working, doing business or cultivating land within the recovered
               area under the Project as of the cut-off-date are entitled to be provided with
               rehabilitation measures sufficient to assist them to improve or at least maintain
               their pre-Project living standards, income earning capacity and production levels.
               Lack of legal rights to the assets lost will not bar the DPs from entitlement to such
               rehabilitation measures.
      c)       The rehabilitation measures to be provided are: (i) compensation at replacement
               cost without deduction for depreciation or salvage materials for houses and other
               structures;    (ii)  transportation    and     subsistence    allowances;     and      (iii)
               business/income rehabilitation allowances.
      d)       The resettlement transition period will be minimized and the rehabilitation means will
               be provided to the DPs no later than one month prior to the expected start-up date
               of works in the respective Project site.
      e)       Plans for acquisition of land and other assets and provision of rehabilitation
               measures will be carried out in consultation with the DPs to ensure minimal
               disturbance. Entitlements will be provided to DPs no later than one month prior to
               expected start-up of works at the respective project site.

7 Public Participation, Consultation, and Grievance Mechanisms

7.1 Objectives of Public Information and Consultation

57.       Information dissemination to Project DPs and involved agencies is an important part of
the Project preparation and implementation. Consultation with DPs and ensuring their active
participation will reduce the potential for conflicts and will minimize the risk of project delays.
This will also enable the Project to design the resettlement and rehabilitation program as a
comprehensive development program to suit the needs and priorities of the displaced persons,
and thereby maximizing the economic and social benefits of investments. The objectives of the
public information and consultation program are as follows:

(a)    To ensure that local authorities, as well as representatives of DPs, will be included in the
       planning and decision-making processes. The PMU1 will work closely with the
       Provincial/City's People's Committee and the District's People's Committee and related
       line departments and agencies during project implementation. DPs' involvement in
       implementation will be continued thereafter by requesting each district to invite DPs'
       representatives to be members of the DRC and take part in the resettlement activities
       (property evaluation, compensation, resettlement, and monitoring).
(b)    To fully share information about the proposed project components and activities with the
       DPs.
(c)    To obtain information about the needs and priorities of the DPs, as well as receiving
       information about their reactions to proposed policies and activities.
(d)    To ensure that DPs are able to make fully informed decisions that will directly affect their
       incomes and living standards, and that they will have the opportunity to participate in
       activities and decision-making about issues that will directly affect them.
(e)    To obtain the cooperation and participation of the DPs and communities in activities
       necessary for resettlement planning and implementation.
(f)    To ensure transparency in all activities related to land acquisition, resettlement, and
       rehabilitation.

7.2 Consultation During Projects' preparation

58.       During the project preparatory phase, public information and consultations were held,
aiming to gather information for assessing project resettlement impacts and to clarify
recommendations on possible alternative technical options to reduce and/or mitigate potential
negative resettlement impacts on local population and to proactively address issues or
problems that may emerge during implementation.

59.       The methods of project information and public consultation included participatory rapid
appraisals and stakeholder's consultation ones, using techniques of site and household visits,
public meetings, group and focus group discussions and the household socio-economic survey.

60.       The local authorities, leaders of different administrative levels and local DPs were
informed about the proposed project, its objectives and proposed activities. Consultation and
discussions were held with the district and PDOT. They and DPs were also informed about the
WB's and the project's proposed resettlement policy. The DPs were extensively consulted and
actively participated in discussions on their development needs and priorities, about their
perception toward project objectives. DPs were consulted on project's potential impacts and

                                                                         Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)

possible measures to reduce potential negative impacts, and improve benefits for them and
their communities. The public meetings and consultation were widely organized in all the
affected wards of the projects. All the DPs consulted are supportive of the project's investment,
expecting that it will improve conditions for trading and socio-economic development in their
communities and for communications and improving public awareness in their daily life. Their
main concern is that the compensation should be fair and transparent. Focus group discussions
were organized with severely affected DPs, including relocated and/or severely affected
persons, to consult on their preference on relocation options and rehabilitation measures. All
potentially relocated DPs expressed their willingness to receive compensations in cash and to
arrange resettlement by themselves. The same severely affected farmers opted for the
rehabilitation option of receiving compensations in cash at rate reflecting market prices.

61.       The local authorities are consulted on their agreement and commitments to follow the
project resettlement policy described in the RAP, reflecting both the Government and WB
resettlement objectives and principles.

7.3 Consultation Proposed During Implementation

A.      Information Dissemination and Consultation

62.       In the stage of the projects' implementation, the following information dissemination
and consultation activities wil be implemented:

        (i)     The PMU1 will provide project's information to resettlement committees at all
                levels through training workshops. Detailed information on project resettlement
                policies and implementation procedures will be provided.
        (ii)    The PMU1 wil conduct information dissemination to, and consultations with, DPs
                throughout the life of the project.
        (iii)   The DRC will then apply prices, calculate compensation entitlements, and
                complete the Compensation options for each affected household. Information on
                entitlements will then be presented on an individual basis to DPs by the DPC in
                the DMS follow-up community consultations/meetings.
        (iv)    The Compensation options, showing the household's affected assets and
                compensation entitlements, will then need to be signed by the DPs to indicate
                their agreement with the assessment. Any complaints the DPs have about the
                contents of the form will be recorded and will be solved at this time.
        (v)     A letter/questionnaire about resettlement options will be given to all DPs entitled
                to relocation to: (a) inform them of resettlement options (a clear explanation of
                the consequences of choosing each option will be given); (b) request that DPs
                confirm their choice of resettlement option and their preliminary confirmation of
                resettlement site location; and (c) identify the DPs' relocation needs and
                assistances measures.
        (vi)    Consultation regarding DPs preferred option for rehabilitation assistance. This
                applies to severely affected and vulnerable DPs. The resettlement committee will
                inform DPs of options and entitlement to rehabilitation assistance before asking
                them to indicate preferences for such rehabilitation assistance.

B.      Public Meetings

63.       Prior to the beginning of the detailed design, a public meeting will be held in each ward
to provide DPs with additional information and an opportunity for open discussions about
resettlement policies and procedures. A letter of invitation will be sent to all DPs at least one
week before the meeting in their area. This meeting is intended to clarify information that has

been given to date and to provide DPs with the opportunity to discuss issues of concern and
obtain clarification. In addition to a letter informing the DP, other means will be used to inform
DPs and the general public, such as posters in prominent locations in the communes and
districts where DPs currently reside, radio, newspaper and public poster announcements. The
letter and notices will advise the time and location of the meeting, and who can attend. Both
men and women from affected households, as well as other interested community members,
will be encouraged to attend. The meeting will explain the Project, and households' rights and
entitlements, and there will be opportunities to ask questions. Such meetings will be conducted
periodically during the life of the Project.

64.       Relevant information will be given to the DPs at the meetings (verbally, graphically,
and/or on printed information sheets). Extra copies of the printed information sheets will be
available at district offices throughout the project area. The meetings are proposed to have the
following format:

(i)     Explanations given verbally and in visual format, including written information and
        drawings of the proposed design for the Project.
(ii)    Adequate opportunities will be provided for DPs to respond with questions and
        comments. DPs will be encouraged to contribute their ideas for DPs' rehabilitation
        options.
(iii)   DRC will establish a complete list of all DPs who are present at the meetings.
(iv)    DRC will make a complete record of all questions, comments, opinions and decisions
        that arise during the information/consultation meetings and present a report of all the
        meetings to the PMU1.


C.      Compensation and Rehabilitation

65.       A letter of notification will be sent to each DP with the time, location, and procedure for
receiving compensation payment. Severely affected and vulnerable DPs will be personally
contacted to confirm their preferences for rehabilitation assistance.

D.      Public Information Booklet (PIB)

66.       To ensure that DPs, their representatives, and local governments in the affected areas
fully understand the details of the resettlement program, and are also informed about the
compensation and rehabilitation packages applicable to the Project, a Public Information
Booklet (PIB) will be prepared by the PMU1 in consultation with the World Bank. This booklet
will be distributed to all DPs in the project area. General contents of the PIB will include the
following:

                Brief Description of the Project, Implementation Schedule, Project Impacts,
                Entitlements and Rights of DP, Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policies for All
                Types of Impacts, Institutions Responsible for Resettlement, Information
                Dissemination to and Consultations with Project Displaced Persons, What To Do
                if DPs have a Question or a Problem, Grievance Procedure, and Independent
                Monitoring.

E.      Disclosure

67.       In addition to disclosure to displaced persons and communities, this RAP will be
available at the PMU1, Provincial Information Centers, and Project District, as well as in Info
shop in Washington DC and in the Vietnam Development Information Center (VDIC) in Hanoi.

7.4 Grievance Redress Procedure

68.       DPs can lodge their complaints regarding any aspect of compensation policy, rates, land
acquisition, resettlement and entitlements relating to rehabilitation assistance programs.
Complaints by DPs can be lodged verbally or in written form, and where they are lodged
verbally, the committee to which it is lodged will write it down during the first meeting with the
DP. DPs will be exempt from administrative and legal fees.

69.       Local mass organizations, such as National Front, Association of Farmers, and
Women's Union, will be mobilized to actively participate in process of solving of DP's emerged
complaints/grievances

70.       To facilitate process of resolving complaints and grievances of DPs, a four-stage
procedure for redressing grievances is proposed as follows:

       Stage 1- Complaints from DPs on any aspect of the resettlement program, or losses not
       previously addressed shall first be lodged verbally or in written form to the people's
       committee at commune level. The complaints can be discussed in an informal meeting
       with the plaintiff and the chairman of the people's committee at commune level. The
       people's committee at commune level will be responsible for resolving the issue within
       15 days from the day it is lodged.

       Stage 2 - If no understanding or amicable solution can be reached, or if no response
       from the people's committee at the commune level is received by the DP within 15 days
       from registering the complaint, he/she can appeal to the District's Resettlement
       Committee. The DRC will provide a decision within 1 month from the registering of the
       appeal.

       Stage 3 - If the DP is not satisfied with the decision of the DRC or its representative, or in
       the absence of any response by the DRC, the DPs can appeal to the Provincial/City's
       People's Committee. The City's/Provincial People's Committees together with the
       representative of the Provincial/City's RC will provide a decision on the appeal within 30
       days from the day it is lodged with the PPC

       Stage 4 - If the DP is still not satisfied with the decision of the PPCs/City's PC or
       PRCs/City's RC on appeal, or in absence of any response from the PPCs/City's PC within
       the stipulated time, the DP, as the last resort, may submit his/her case to the district court.

8 Implementation Schedule

71.       The implementation schedule is as follows:

1.     Information Dissemination Prior to Detailed Design. Prior to the commencement of
detailed design, PMU1 will provide information about the Project throughout the project area.
Information meetings will be held in all potentially affected wards to inform the communities
about (i) the project scope; (ii) impacts; (iii) entitlements for all categories of loss; (iv) schedule
of activities beginning with the detailed measurement survey; (v) institutional responsibilities;
and (vi) the grievance mechanism. The PIB will be prepared and distributed to all affected
communities during the meetings.

These surveys will serve as a basis for compensation and updating the RPs. Data will be
computerized by PMU1 and others.

5.       Updating Compensation Rates. During the preliminary detailed design process, the
PPC/City'sPC will update unit rates at replacement cost for all categories of loss and adjust
allowances to account for inflation in accordance with provision of Decree 197/2004/CP.

6.       Pricing Application and Compensation to DPs. District's Resettlement committe will
be responsible for pricing application and preparing compensation charts for each affected

                PPC on land prices in Ca Mau province.

76.       In stage of resettlement implementation, the compensation rates will be updated by the
PPC to reflect current market prices of land in accordance with provision of the Land Law and
the Decree 197/2004/CP.

77.       The Cost for the RAP consists of:

       i)    Preparation work :
                 All work at the office such as design study, preparation of survey form.
                 Survey work: census and inventory, socio-economic survey.
       Survey work is carried out in two stages: Preliminary stage (for RAP preparation) and
       Detailed Measurement Survey (at the early time of project and RAP implementation)

       ii) Compensation and rehabilitation cost, includes
                Compensation for permanent land acquisition
                Compensation for houses and other/secondary structures attached to the

78.       The PMU1 also is responsible for contracting with some external organization/s,
specialized on social sciences to carry out the independent monitoring of the projects'
resettlement implementation. Because cost of monitoring work has not yet been detailed by the
Government, it is estimated that att about 1.8% of the total cost of compensation and RAP
preparation. The interested independent monitoring institutions will prepare the technical and
financial proposals for bidding, and the actual cost will be determined through procurement for
independent monitoring.

       v) Contingency cost

79.       Based on the past project experience and to be conservative, the contingency is
estimated to be about 10% of the total cost of compensation and RAP preparation.

10 Monitoring and Evaluation

10.1 Monitoring

81.       Monitoring is the continuous process of assessing project implementation, in relation to
agreed schedules, the use of inputs, infrastructure and services by the Project. Monitoring
provides all stakeholders with continuous feedback on implementation. It identifies actual or
potential successes and problems as early as possible to facilitate timely correction during
project operation.

82.       Monitoring has two purposes:
                  To verify that project activities have been effectively completed including
                  quantity, quality, and timeliness; and
                  To assess whether and how well these activities are achieving the stated goal
                  and purpose of the Project.

10.2 Internal Monitoring

83.       The Project Management Unit 1 (PMU1) is responsible for internal monitoring of the
RAP's implementation for the 06 Bridges. The agencies will oversee the progress in
resettlement preparation and implementation through regular progress reports.

84.       The main indicators that will be monitored regularly are:

       (i)      payment of compensation to DPs in various categories, according to the
                compensation policy described in the RAP;
       (ii)     delivery of technical assistance, relocation, payment of subsistence, and moving
                allowances;

       (vii)    coordination and completion of resettlement activities and award of civil works
                contract.

85.       The PMU1 will collect information every month from the District compensation
committee. A database of resettlement monitoring information regarding the Project will be
maintained and updated every month.

86.       The PMU1 will submit a monitoring report on the progress on implementation of the
RAP to the PPCs/City'sPC and the Bank as part of their regular quarterly report to Bank. The
internal monitoring reports shall include the following topics:
       (i)      The number of DPs by category of impact per component, and the status of
                compensation payment and relocation and income restoration for each category.
       (ii)     The amount of funds allocated for operations or for compensation and the
                amount of funds disbursed for each.
       (iii)    The eventual outcome of complaints and grievances and any outstanding issues
                requiring action by management.
       (iv)     Implementation problems.
       (v)      Revised actual resettlement implementation schedule.

10.3 External Monitoring

87.       Objectives.    The general objective of the external monitoring is to provide an
independent periodic review and assessment of achievement of resettlement objectives, the
changes in living standards and livelihoods, restoration of the economic and social base of the
displaced persons people, the organizational effectiveness, impact and sustainability of
entitlements, the need for further mitigation measures if any, and to learn strategic lessons for
future policy formulation and planning.

88.       Agency Responsible. In accordance with the World Bank requirements for consultant
procurement, the PMU1 will hire one or more organizations for the independent monitoring and
evaluation of RAP's implementation for the project. This organization, to be called the
Monitoring Organization (MO), should be specialized in the Social Sciences and experienced in
resettlement monitoring. The MO/s should start their work as soon as the updated RAP have
been approved.

89.       Monitoring and Evaluation Indicators. The following indicators will be monitored and
evaluated by the MO:

        (i)     Conduct a       replacement cost      survey of    affected land and         attached
                properties/assets to assess level of adequacy of the compensation prices issued
                by the PPCs/City'sPC, comparing with their replacement costs. In case, if there
                exists a considerable gap, the MO will submit recommendations to the PMU1 so
                that they will act for necessary adjustments, ensuring the project's resettlement
                principles are met.
        (ii)    Payment of compensation will be as follows: (a) full payment to be made to all
                affected persons sufficiently before land acquisition; (b) adequacy of payment to
                replace affected assets.
        (iii)   Provision of technical assistance for house construction to DPs who are
                rebuilding their structures on their remaining land, or building their own structures
                in new places.
        (iv)    Provision of income restoration assistance.
        (v)     Public consultation and awareness of compensation policy: (a) DPs should be fully
                informed and consulted about land acquisition, leasing and relocation activities;
                (b) the monitoring team should attend at least one public consultation meeting to
                monitor public consultation procedures, problems and issues that arise during the
                meetings, and solutions that are proposed; (c) public awareness of the
                compensation policy and entitlements will be assessed among the DPs; and (d)
                assessment of awareness of various options available to DPs as provided for in
                the RAP.
        (vi)    Affected persons should be monitored regarding restoration of productive
                activities.
        (vii)   The level of satisfaction of DPs with various aspects of the RAP will be monitored
                and recorded. The operation of the mechanisms for grievance redress, and the
                speed of grievance redress will be monitored.
        (viii)  Throughout the implementation process, the trends of living standards will be
                observed and surveyed. Any potential problems in the restoration of living standards
                will be reported.

10.4 Methodology for Independent Monitoring

A.      Sample Survey

90.       A socioeconomic survey will be required before, during and after the resettlement
implementation to provide a clear comparison of success/failure of the resettlement plan.

91.       Monitoring on a sample basis will be carried out, following the TOR for independent
monitoring, approved by the MOT and WB, and in accordance with the project's implementation
progress.

92.       A Post-Resettlement Evaluation will be carried out 6 to 12 months after completion of
all resettlement activities.

B.      Database Storage

93.       The MO will maintain a database of resettlement monitoring information. It will contain
files on results of independent monitoring, DPs surveyed and will be updated based on
information collected in successive rounds of data collection. All databases compiled will be fully
accessible by the PMU1 and the Bank.

94.       The Independent monitoring activities will be carried out in accordance with the
project's implementation progress, and the monitoring reports will be sent to the PMU1 and no
later than 2 weeks after field independent monitoring activities is completed. The MO is required
to submit the findings of the periodical monitoring. These monitoring reports shall be submitted
to the World Bank as an annex of its progress report.

95.       The report should contain: (i) a report on the progress of RAP implementation; (ii)
deviations, if any, from the provisions and principles of the RAP; (ii) identification of problem
issues and recommended solutions so that implementing agencies are informed about the
ongoing situation and can resolve problems in a timely manner; and (iv) a report on progress of
the follow-up of problems and issues identified in the previous report.

D.      Monitoring Report Follow-Up

96.       The monitoring reports will be discussed in a meeting between the MO and PMU1
immediately after submission of the report. Necessary follow-up actions will be taken based on
the problems and issues identified in the reports and follow-up discussions.

10.5 Evaluation

97.       Evaluation is an assessment at a given point of time of the impact of resettlement and
whether stated objectives have been achieved. The external monitoring will conduct an
evaluation of the resettlement process and impact 6 to 12 months after completion of all
resettlement activities using the same survey questionnaire and sample as used during the
monitoring activities.
