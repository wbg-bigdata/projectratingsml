APPRAISAL OF A FOURTH EDUCATION PROJECT
I. DEVELOPMENT AND MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS
Geographic and Socio Economic Situation
2
1.01      Kenya, with 582,600 km , about the same size as France, lies
astride the equator and is divided into two halves longitudinally by the
Rift Valley. Rising from the coast line along the Indian Ocean, Kenya has
a range of uplands crossing two-thirds of the country from west to east.
The climate varies with altitude, which ranges from sea level to over 5,000
meters. Three broad rainfall zones can be distinguished: the first zone
with a dry, hot climate, lies north of the equator, with a rainfall of less
than 500 mm per annum; the second, a medium rainfall zone in the coastal
region, has a hot, damp climate and rainfall of from 1,250 to 1,500 mm per
annum; and the third is a high rainfall area with a cool climate and an
annual rainfall of up to 1,900 mm. Agriculture is largely concentrated in
the high-potential areas in the Western region, along the coast and around
Mount Kenya.
1.02      The population of Kenya in mid-1976 was estimated to be 13.8
million, growing at a rate of about 3.5% p.a. About 87% of the population
live in rural areas and are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood.
The population is unevenly distributed, since prime farm land is found in
only a few small areas. In 1976, the most densely settled provinces were
Nyanza, Western, and Central; these areas had only 6% of the country's land
area but contained 47% of the total population   The population density
in these provinces averaged 187 persons per km . At the other extreme,
North-Eastern Province, which includes 22% of the country's land area,2had
only 2% of the population, giving a density of only two persons per km
The average annual per capita income in 1976 of those living in rural
areas is estimated at K.Sh. 580 (US$70 equivalent), whereas the country-
wide average was estimated at K.Sh. 2,000 (US$240 equivalent).
Recent Economic Development
1.03      Between 1973 and 1976, the Kenyan economy experienced a sharp
reduction in the rate of economic growth, declining employment, high infla-
tion and growing pressure on the Government's recurrent and development
budgets. The breakdown of the East African Community further affected the
economy adversely. The Government responded to this situation with a com-
prehensive restructuring program designed to curb inflation, utilize domes-
tic resources more efficiently, reduce the balance of payments gap, and return
the economy to a higher rate of growth. In 1976, the economic picture became
somewhat brighter, and GDP reached a 5% growth rate as compared with only
about 1% in 1975; still lower, however, than the target growth rate of 7.4%



-2-
set in the Third Development Plan (1974-1978). Performance of the major
sectors of the economy in 1976 was generally better than in 1974-75. Manufac-
turing and mining made a particularly strong comeback. Despite inadequate
rains during 1976, coffee production registered a substantial increase in
volume in addition to a price increase of nearly 200%. Nevertheless, growth
in agriculture, both in the monetary and non-monetary segments, remained below
the average annual rate over the period 1964-73.
Manpower Requirements
1.04      One of the main objectives of the Third Development Plan, (1974-
1978), is to provide employment for Kenya's labor force. Total employment
growth was only 3% ifor the period 1972-1976. In 1976 paid employment in the
private sector increased by 5.1% and in the public sector by 4.1% as shown in
the foLlowing table:

of Finance and Planning.
For those who had employment in 1976, average earnings in both the public and
private sectors increased faster between June 1975 and June 1976 than the
rise in the cost of living for the first time in four years.
1.05      One of the major issues facing Kenya is the general problem of lack
of productive employment and in particular the rising unemployment of school
leavers. Out of a total working age population (15-59), estimated at 6.6
million in 1976, only 14% or 914,700 were engaged in the modern sector of the
economy. A further 290,000 were receiving secondary or higher education and
the remainder were either in urban areas seeking employment, working in the
rural areas on small agricultural holdings or engaged in informal sector
activities. The exact number of unemployed and underemployed workers is not
known. A Labor Force Survey by the Government is underway to obtain a better
picture of the situation.



1.06      During the next ten years, it is expected that more than half of
the increase in the labor force will have to seek employment in agr culture-
largely on small holdings. Of the total land surface of 582,600 km , only
about 18% has high or mediumr agricultuzal potential under the present tech-
nology. Increasing agricultural production will depend not only on using the
limited possibilities to bring idle land under cultivation, but in particular
on increasing productivity per acre of currently utilized land. In order
to increase output on this limited agricultural area, it will be necessary
to promote production on the relatively small farms, including feedcropping
and dairying. To achieve this, a considerably upgraded extension service is
necessary and should include an increased number of bachelor degree holders
and certificate level personnel.
1.07      The Ministry of Agriculture has shortages of agriculturalists
at all levels and this is a serious constraint to the Ministry's objective
of promoting agricultural productivity. Furthermore, the inadequate supply
of trained agriculturalists also constrains the operations of other Ministries
(Settlement and Cooperative Development), the Agricultural Statutory Boards,
commercial farms, and farming service companies.
1.08      In order to develop quantitative estimates of the need for trained
agricultural manpower, a survey, financed by the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) was undertaken. The survey was comprehen-
sive and included the use of a questionnaire followed up by interviews with
staff at: (i) Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) headquarters; (ii) thirty six
MOA district offices; (iii) seven MOA provincial headquarters; and (iv) other
government agencies, such as the Ministries of Education, Water, and Tourism,
and parastatals utilizing agriculturally-trained personnel. In addition,
establishments in the private sector, e.g., commercial farms, sugar factories,
which employ at least 100 persons were included; the sample covered about 90%
of this subsector in terms of the total number of establishments.
1.09      The initial findings of the study indicate that by 1990 the stock
of high- and mid-level agricultural manpower should consist of some 3,000
personnel with bachelor's or master's degrees and about 13,500 certificate
holders. The survey results used several different rates for retirement
and wastage since they vary significantly by specialty and by educational
level. Retirement rates in the survey were calculated on the average ser-
vice time of a person in a job during a specific period; wastage rates were
calculated on the basis of interviews and questionnaires. In the survey,
wasitage from the public sector was treated as a transfer into the private
sectlor; thus, totals are not additive. The survey calculated that the total
number of individuals in the private sector equals the wastage from the pub-
lic sector, plus direct hires from the university and other educational in-
stiltutions, minus a negligible number of individuals who return to government
service. The current practice on the part of the private sector is to hire
agricultural personnel from the Ministry of Agriculture and related govern-
ment offices after the candidates have spent at least two years in post.
The effective demand for trained manpower in the private sector is currently
high, but it is expected that within three to four years, it will fall, thus,
requirements for the private sector are not expected to be significant.

1.10      The survety calculated that at the present time, there are about
1,000 holders of bachelor's and master's degrees employed in the Ministry of
Agriculture, other Ministries, the parastatals and the private sector. Of
this number, 4% are expatriates. Professional agriculturalists are trained at
the University's FaLculty of Agriculture where the present physical facilities
are inadequate to train a sufficient number of people to meet the estimated
requirements in 19S90, as shown in the following table:

1990             230             70             2,328
These figures indicate that the output of agricultural university graduates
need to be increased to about 230 p.a. by 1985 from about 90 in the late
1970 's.
1.11      Training of agricultural technicians takes place in two-year courses
at the agricultural institutes at Embu and Bukura and the Kabete Animal Health
and Industry Training Institute (AHITI). These three institutes have insuffi-
cient capacity to train the numbers required by 1990. Required annual outputs
are shown in the following table:

2/   Total of columns 1, 2, 3 and 4 (rounded) provides for training of about

These figures indicate that the output of agricultural technicians should be
increased from about 300 in the mid-70s to about 700 p.a. in the late 1980s.
1.12      The estimates for trained manpower requirement at the certificate
level carried out by Bank staff are about 2,500 less than those developed by
the recent USAID agricultural manpower survey. The Bank staff estimates take
into account that in certain jobs a lower number of people than that currently
employed will be needed since worker productivity will gradually be improved.
Furthermore, projections of government recurrent finances indicate that the
Government is unlikely to be able to employ such a large number of agricul-
tural certificate holders as suggested by the manpower survey. To keep the
total recurrent wage costs within acceptable limits, present plans should
provide for the training of about 7,000 agricultural assistants by 1990.
1.13      A recent study undertaken by the Ministry of Finance indicated that
improved management and budgeting techniques are a prerequisite to carry out
effective government project preparation and implementation   in the field of
agriculture as well as in other development activities. The training of middle-
and upper-level administration and managerial personnel is an area which needs



-6-
urgent attention. Many of the expatriates provided under technical assistance
arrangements still serve in advisory or even executive positions in both the
government and parastatal corporations.  Steps are therefore being taken to
chart an action program for appropriate development and training courses
related to public administration and day-to-day techniques of detailed project
work.
II. THE EDUCATION SECTOR AND MAJOR ISSUES IN EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT
Background
2.01      Western education in the form of mission schools was introduced
to Kenya by the midd,le of last century, but traditional education had long
played a vital role in the daily life of the individual. In 1911, the
colonial administration set up a Department of Education and instituted a
segregated public school system which existed until Independence. For African
students, emphasis was placed on literacy, numeracy and a certain amount of
vocational training. In the 1920s an independent school movement, organized
and financed by villagers, gained momentum and developed into a self-help
system (harambee), still active today.
2.02      Since Independence, education has figured prominently in all of the
development plans of Kenya. The First National Development Plan (1966-1970)
supported the expansion of education at all levels and advocated that second-
ary and tertiary education be related to manpower needs. The Second National
Development Plan (1970-1974) restated that universal primary education (Stan-
dards 1-7) should receive priority and emphasized the need to bring the con-
tent of education into line with the socio-economic needs and environment
of the nation. The Third National Development Plan (1974-1978) focuses on
the abolition of tuition fees for the lower primary standards (1-4) 1/, the
reorganization of the teacher-training system, the consolidation of secondary
schools, the expansion of education support services, and a gradual restruc-
turing of administrative services.
2.03      At present, the Ministry of Education is responsible for most educa-
tional activities in the country, administering 87% of total public recurrent
expenditures on education. It oversees directly about 8,900 primary schools
which are staffed by some 89,000 teachers, 1,250 aided and unaided secondary
schools with more than 11,000 teachers, and a wide range of specialized
educational institutions at all levels. Other Ministries and agencies with
educational activities include the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Hlousing
and Social Services, the Ministry of Health and the Office of the President.
The Ministry of Labor supervises the National Industrial Training Centers and
the National Youth Service, and the Ministry of Housing and Social Services
is responsible for the Craft Training Centers (CTC's) (formerly Village
Polytechnics). An autonomous Board of Adult Education oversees and organizes
most nonformal education activities for the out-of-school population. All
1/   However, other users charges (e.g., equipment levy, uniform fee in
certain schools, textbook fee) have been maintained.



-7-
other Ministries sustain in-service training and occasional "crash courses"
for the training of specialists as the need arises.
2.04      The structure of education, the education pyramid, comparative
education indicators and primary enrollment statistics are included in
Annex I-Cl and C2, and T1-T3, respectively. The primary course consists
of seven years (Standards 1-7) followed by a secondary course of six years
divided into four-year lower cycle (Forms I-IV) and a two-year upper cycle
(Forms V and VI). At the end of primary Standard 7, all pupils sit for the
Certificate of Primary Education (CPE). About 13% of primary school-leavers
transfer to Government secondary schools and another 18% to harambee or
private secondary schools which now account for more than 50% of all secondary
enrollments. Students of harambee secondary schools sit after two years for
the Kenya Junior Secondary Examination (K.J.S.E.), while students of govern-
ment and many private schools take the East African Certificate of Education
(E.A.C.E.) examination after four years, permitting access to intermediate
technical and teacher education. For university entrance, the full secondary
course of six years and the East African Advanced Certificate of Education
(E.A.A.C.E.) is required. Specialized post-secondary education is of a dura-
tion of two to four years (agriculture, veterinary medicine) and higher educa-
tion:, varying according to specialization, lasts from three to five years.

The National Committee on Education Objectives and Policies
2.05      In December 1975, the Government of Kenya established the National
Committee on Educational Objectives and Policies (NCEOP) with the mandate to
prepare a report which would have "far-reaching effects on the objectives,
structure and content of the education system," including qualitative improve-
ment while at the same time providing a framework for introducing and implement-
ing recommended changes. In financial terms, the Committee was instructed to
hold educational recurrent expenditure to about its present share of total
government recurrent expenditure level (1975-76 = 28%) and to an annual growth
of no more than 7% in real terms. The main reason for establishing the NCEOP
was the concern over the increasing portion of government recurrent expenditure
allocated to education. If the trend of the late 1960s and 1970s had continued
unchecked, by 1990 Kenya would have spent well over 50% of its annual recur-
rent budget on education. The work of the NCEOP was assisted under the Third
Education Project (Bank Loan 1184-KE), and its final report was issued in
January 1977. The Ministries most interested in the report--Education, and
Finance and Planning--have summarized the main findings and recommendations
in a Sessional Paper on Education, a draft of which has been reviewed by the
Association staff. The Sessional Paper has been received and commented upon
by the Cabinet and is expected to be tabled before Parliament in the near
future. Satisfactory progress is being made in this respect.
2.06      In the report, the Committee tried to be as  "comprehensive as
possible" but gave priority to an analysis of the formal education system
viewed by the public "as the best access route to advancement of the indivi-
dual." The main emphasis of the report is on primary education and its
related problems, since this level is felt to be most in need of change and
improvement. On the basis of its findings, the NCEOP recommended the following
education strategy policies for the next decade:
(a)  Primary Education, as first priority, should be made universal
and ultimately compulsory for all. Improvement of the
quality and relevance of primary education and a fundamental
revision of the present primary teacher training program are
of second and third priority; beginning in the early 1980s,
as the availability of funds permits, there are plans to
introduce a new nine-year basic education course. In order
to increase equity, the program of building boarding primary
schools in remote areas (para. 3.08) will also be intensified.
(lb) Secondary Education. The Government is concerned about the
rising rates of unemployment among secondary school leavers.
According to projections done by the Ministry of Labor, during
the next decade, only one out of ten secondary school leavers
will obtain a modern sector job. The intake to secondary edu-
cation therefore will be controlled to meet projected manpower
needs and courses will be made increasingly scientific, pre-
vocationa:L and craft-oriented. In the long run as the nine-year
basic cycLe develops, the secondary course will be reduced from
six to four years. The "harambee schools" (para. 2.04) will be
gradually integrated into the Government system.



- 9 -
(c) Teacher Training, Education Materials and Equipment. In order
to improve the quality of instruction, specific programs will
be implemented to increase the output of teacher training
institutions at both the primary and the secondary levels.
At the same time, the provision of teaching materials and
equipment will be expanded but cost-recovery measures will be
introduced as outlined in para 2.07 below. Over the years, the
Science Equipment Production Unit (SEPU), now serving only the
secondary level, will be enlarged in order to produce materials
for the primary level as well.
(d) Technical Education and Training will be strengthened and made
more relevant to labor market needs with stronger participation
of private industry and National Industrial Training Scheme in
the planning and financing of such training.
(e)  Higher Education.  The present capacity of the University of
Nairobi may be doubled, provided manpower requirements call
for it. In the meantime, there are proposals for a substantial
expansion of the Faculty of Agriculture (para. 3.02) in line
with the demand for professional agriculturalists. Kenyatta
University College will develop into a full university ulti-
mately enrolling 5,000 students, and thereafter a third uni-
versity institution may be established.
(f) Adult Education. There are plans for the attainment of universal
literacy in the forthcoming decade. Since adult education is the
concern of many Ministries, the Board of Adult Education would be
restructured and given the authority to coordinate all efforts
in this subsector.
Education Finance
2.07      The financial implications of the NCEOP recommendations (para.
2.05) have been studied in detail. In order to increase educational reve-
nues, reduce costs, and execute the long-term program of educational change,
a number of fiscal and financial measures are proposed in the Sessional
Paper. As a first step, the Government is planning to restructure the
schedule of nontuition fees, levies and users charges so that it will be
uniform at all educational institutions. All primary pupils will be charged
K.Sh. 40 p.a. 1/, junior secondary students K.Sh. 1,400 p.a. and senior
secondary students K.Sh. 1,600 p.a. The new system will bring in additional
revenues and reduce inequitable practices of fee collection. Since "non-
discretionary" expenditures (mainly teachers' salaries) constitute 75% of
educational recurrent expenditures, the Government is aware that the control
of the growth of educational expenditure had to be linked to long-term
1/   This fee would consolidate the users' charges and levies indicated
in para. 2.02.



- 1o -
teacher-salary policies. For this purpose, as part of the program on which
is based the third education project assisted by the Bank Group, a quota
system for the recruitment of student teachers was adopted, automatic salary
increzsc.s upon passing academic examinations were abolished, and only 1% of
the teachers are being promoted each year. In addition, the primary-school
staffing formula WELS changed, and head teachers now are expected to do a
substantial amount of teaching in addition to their administrative duties.
2.08      According to the NCEOP, using a 3.5% p.a. growth of primary enroll-
ments, educational expenditures on primary education would grow at 7% p.a. and
total educational etxpenditure would remain at about 28% of the total recurrent
budget. The rate of growth of government recurrent expenditures is assumed at
7.5% p.a. in real terms for 1975/76 - 1985/86 and is based on a rate of growth
of real GDP of 7% p.a. for the same period. In view of the actual performance
of the economy in 1974-1976, the Government prepared alternative projections
based on annual growth rates of GDP and total government expenditures of
less than 7% but maintaining all the other assumptions about teacher salaries,
primary enrollments and the costs of secondary and higher education. The
results of these projections show that education's share of the total govern-
ment recurrent budget in 1985/86 would reach 29.5% if government revenues and
expenditure were to grow at 7%, 33% if they were to grow at 6% p.a. and 35%
if they were to grow at 5% p.a. However, in all the projections, primary
enrollment is assumed to grow at 3.5% per annum and to reach 4.1 million in
1985/86. This figure includes a substantial adjustment for alleged under-
counting in the 1969 census and reflects the assumption that after the 1974
population explosion, primary enrollments would continue to increase steadily.
In the meantime, enrollment data for the period 1975-77 showing a stagnation
and indeed even a slight decline in primary education enrollments (Annex I-T2)
have become available; revised enrollment projections prepared by the Asso-
ciation and Unesco staff indicate that by 1986 a primary school population
of 3.5 million (Annex I-T3) is more probable than the 4.1 million calculated
by the NCEOP. In this case, and if the assumptions about teacher salaries,
quality improvement and secondary-and university-level costs prove correct,
the Government would have a safety margin for the implementation of its
proposals and by the mid-1980s the share of education as a percentage of the
recurrent budget would be about 26%.
2.09      These conclusions are also supported by an encouraging improvement
in the situation of the Ministry of Education's recurrent expenditures, which
in real terms have responded to the control measures (para. 2.07) taken by the
Government in 1975 and 1976 as the following table indicates:

School Leavers and Unemployment
2.10      The problem of lack of productive employment, in general, and the
unemployment of school leavers, in particular, has been one of the major
issues facing Kenya in recent years. Both the Sessional Paper on Employment
of May 1973 and the NCEOP report contain recommendations on how to approach
the problem of the increasing unemployment of school leavers. Out of the
total population of economically active persons estimated at 6.6 million in
1976, only 14% or 914,700 were engaged in the modern sector of the economy.
A further 290,000 were receiving secondary and higher education and the
remainder, i.e., over 80% of the total, were engaged in rural areas, mainly
in smallholding agriculture, or in urban and rural areas in informal occupa-
tions. In the last four years, employment has increased at about 3%, showing
faster growth in the public than in the private sector. Meanwhile, the output
of students from secondary education has grown at over 12% p.a. A comparison
of projected job seekers at different educational levels with employment
opportunities in the modern sector from 1974 to 1985 shows the magnitude of
the problem. In every year of the projection period, there will be, on the
average, an increase of about 200,000 young people who cannot be absorbed by
the modern sector of the labor market.
2.11      With an estimated output of about 91,000 primary school leavers and
50,000 secondary school graduates in 1976, already a sizeable employment gap
will exist. Since employers are steadily increasing their educational re-
cruitment requirements, more openings will be taken by secondary school leavers
even in the "informal sector," consisting of small scale farming, repair work,
petty trading, services and minor manufacturing. The Third Development Plan
(1974-78) estimates that 130,000 jobs (120,000 in rural areas and 10,000 in
urban areas) p.a. will be generated in this segment of the labor market.



- 12 -
2.12       Expansion of the education system (except for teacher employment)
normally has no major job creating effect.  The major effect is to prepare
school leavers better for their subsequent roles in the labor market. Con-
sequently, the Project would support the Government's efforts to improve the
quality of primary education and to increase its relevance to adult needs
(para. 3.15). A particular feature, on a pilot basis, is the assistance to
the Craft Training Center movement which prepares primary school leavers for
self--employment in rural areas (para. 3.12).
Organization and Management
2.13       The administration and management of the education system has
become a major problem. The Ministry of Education is responsible for the
supervision of al]L primary and secondary schools, a variety of intermediate
institutions, two polytechnics, 17 primary teacher training colleges, a
science teacher college and two university institutions. Secondary schools
and teacher trainiing colleges are run by independent Board of Governors,
and the University of Nairobi, the Higher Education Loans Board and the
Teachers Service Commission (TSC) have their own separate statutes. The
Ministry, for example, cannot discipline a teacher since the teacher is
employed by the T'iC, whereas the TSC can assign but not supervise a teacher.
2.14      Administratively, the Ministry acts through eight Provincial Edu-
cation Officers (PEOs), who deal mainly with secondary education and teacher
colleges, and 39 District Education Officers (DEOs), who supervise primary
schools. The immetdiate administrative responsibility for schools lies with
Municipal Councils and, in rural areas, with District Education Boards (DEBs).
These authorities, however, have no control over the staffing of schools, the
discipline of teachers, or the supply of school equipment. The DEBs, in par-
ticular, have no responsibility for school buildings, provision of land, or
financial control. The Ministry's influence and responsibility ends after
a grant is given to an institution. Consequently, it cannot always ensure
that funds are properly spent. Quality control is also inadequate. The in-
spectorate has grown substantially over the last few years but still lacks
the legal power to enforce minimum requirements in facilities and in the
pedagogical performance of teachers.
2.15      The Government has responded to the problem by introducing a system
of modern management in the Ministry of Education. Each level of education
is considered a program, with the Inspectorate, Examinations Section, Curri-
culum Development Unit and the administrative departments as supporting ser-
vices. A Planning Unit deals with major issues such as the preparation of
the education chapter of the Development Plan. Also, the NCEOP has devoted
attention to the improvement of education administration and management and
suggested a review of the Education Act and the statutes of autonomous bodies
like the TSC and the University of Nairobi, in order to find new ways of
coordinating these institutions. A proposal for the reorganization of the
Ministry of Education would strengthen the inspectorate by establishing sub-
jects inspectors' posts under a system which would allow direct action of a
central inspectorate in matters of teacher discipline and quality improvement
of education. This proposal is embodied in the Sessional Paper on Education



- 13 -
referred to at para. 2.05. Since the Ministry of Education needs some years
to t:est the new management system and the new organization structure, the
Project includes assistance only to the Planning Unit (para. 3.17).
Further assistance for the improvement of organization and management could
eventually be included in a possible Fifth Education Project.
Equ itY
2.16      In spite of the expansion of primary education over the last few
years, there are still imbalances in educational opportunities as among pro-
vinces and districts, urban and rural areas as well as sexes. The apparent
enrollment ratio of 109% is misleading as a measure of equity and as an
indication of the universalization of primary education, since 74% of all
primary pupils in 1975 were not attending their age-related standard. In
remote areas, particularly the nomadic districts bordering Somalia, Ethiopia,
the Sudan, and Uganda, only a small fraction of the school age population is
found at school and in the proper standard. Remote areas also have low
pyramid ratios and very few girls progress into the higher primary standards.
The Representation Indices depict low educational provision for the districts
of Turkana, Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, Samburu, Marsabit and Narok, all located
in the dry semi-desert land, where population densities are low and the social
and economic value of schooling is yet to be fully recognized by the inhabit-
ants. In fact, many rural schools in remote areas have uneconomically low
day-school enrollments and only boarding schools or schools in small urban
settlements catering for the children of traders, civil servants and other
set:tled people are properly utilized.
2.17      At present, about 200 special primary schools in remote areas, many
built by church groups and later taken over by the Government, cater to the
nomiadic and semi-nomadic school age population. Many of these schools have
boarding facilities which were provided in the period 1970-1974 by the Govern-
menit through its "Remote Areas Programme". The Government considered using
mobile teaching units but found them too difficult to operate and ineffective.
2.18      Since 1968, the participation of girls in primary education has
grown faster (270%) than that of boys (215%) but boys still outnumber girls
at a ratio of 54:46. Consequently, the female illiteracy rate is higher
throughout the country except in the educationally well provided Central
and Western provinces. The Government is aware of these disparities and is
actively trying to increase educational provision for girls in remote areas
by expanding the boarding primary school system and reserving for girls 45%
of the new places (para 3.08).
2.19      Opportunities for CPE holders to find a secondary school place
vary widely throughout the country. While 13% of all CPE school candidates
(1975/76) found a place in Form I of aided schools, regional indices show
that opportunities are best for CPE candidates of the Northeastern province
(41%) and are worst for those of the Nyanza province (19.5%). This picture
changes, however, if opportunity is measured in terms of the number of Form I
places available as a percentage of the estimated population aged 13 in each
province: from the Northeastern province, then, only 3% of the relevant age



- 14 -
group progress to the secondary level, compared to 22.5% in Nairobi. While
some of the data concerning unaided schools is unreliable, the Ministry of
Education estimates that nationwide, another 18% of the CPE candidates pro-
gress  ~, Form I of unaided schools.  This would give a comlined total cf abcut
31% of the CPE candidates who find a place in Form I of an aided or an unaided
secon:dary school. In view of these high rates, the NCEOP has recommended a
controlled expansion of secondary education during the forthcoming decade
(para. 2.06).
2.20      The Project would actively support Government efforts to increase
equity on a country wide basis. The 13 new boarding primary schools intended
to support the "Remote Areas Programme" (para. 3.08) represent a major step
forward in educational provision for the very remote and inaccessible areas.
The supply of storage facilities for educational materials (para. 3.11) will
favor rural area schools which are less well equipped than urban schools and
the support which would be provided to the Craft Training Center (para. 3.12)
will also benefit youth with the least chance of obtaining remunerative
employment.
Efficiency of the E.ducational System
2.21      An analysis of the 1968-1975 cohort by the Ministry of Education
indicates that for Kenya as a whole, 516 out of 1,000 pupils who enter
Standard 1, reach Sitandard 7. Retention was lowest in the Northeastern
province, where only 342 out of 1,000 reached Standard 7. On the average,
it took 9.8 pupil-years to produce a Standard 7 school-leaver. However,
projections done by the Association staff indicate that because of various
measures being taken by the Government to improve quality and relevance in
the future, only 8.6 pupil-years may be needed to produce a primary school
leaver. Within this context, a child who entered in Standard 1 in 1974 will,
on the average, remain another 4.3 standards in school, and once Standard 4
is reached, the expectancy is for an additional 3.4 standards.  This means,
that if a child reaches Standard 4, the probability of completing the full
primary course is relatively high. There are differences among provinces,
but the pattern is similar throughout the country.
2.22      The pupil:teacher ratio in aided primary education is about 32:1.
It appears to have decreased slightly since 1970, which suggests that in
anticipation of a continued enrollment expansion, more teachers than needed
were aLppointed. The lowest ratio (22:1) is in the Northeastern province
which supports the observation that some remote area day schools are not
fully utilized (para. 2.16). In many areas, facility constraints do not
allow a higher attendance per class. Average class sizes are on the order
of 40 students, but in the more densely populated areas, there are class
sizes of 50-65 students. The average size of aided secondary schools (about
260 students) in 1975 was almost double that of unaided schools (about 150
students); student:teacher ratios were lower in aided than in unaided schools.
In aided schools average class size was 24, in unaided schools 31. Consolida-
tion into larger units, both at Forms I-IV and at Forms V-VI, has been
recommended by the NCEOP.



- 15 -
2.23      Another major distinction between the two types of secondary schools
is teacher quality. In 1976, of the 5,085 teachers in aided schools, 92% were
qualified, whereas of the 6,353 teachers in unaided schools only 29% were
qualified. Also, aided schools have more and better qualified teachers
in critical areas such as science and applied subjects (agriculture, indus-
trial training, domestic science, business education). The lack of qualified
teachers, together with the preference of most students for a subject com-
bination which limits science and mathematics to the minimum, contribute to
continuation of the weakness in the teaching of science and mathematics at all
levels of the education system. The First and the Second Education projects
assisted by the Bank Group were addressed to these issues and to those de-
picted in para 2.22. It is expected that further Bank Group assistance to
these areas will be provided after the NCEOP recommendations are fully pro-
grammed (para 2.31).
CurriLcula and Examinations
2.24      In spite of a decade of efforts to localize the curricula at both
the primary and the secondary levels and to make them more relevant to the
needs of school leavers, considerable curriculum development work is yet to
be done. At the primary level, much thought and work is being devoted to
designing a course that can make the Standard 7 leaver relate better to his/
her predominantly rural environment. It is not envisaged that the primary
course be made prevocational, but rather that it provide the foundation which
would make the young school leaver better trainable in crafts and trades.
Changes in the content of education are also needed at the secondary level
where syllabi derived and copied from institutions abroad have been modi-
fied to suit national needs but are being introduced into the system at a
slow rate. More difficult is the situation in industrial, agricultural and
business education. Industrial education was introduced with Swedish assis-
tance and is aimed at imparting simple skills. However, less than 50 schools
offer courses in such subjects and only a few have qualified teachers of an
acceptable standard. Agriculture was introduced in 1960 in a pilot program
sponsored by USAID. At present about 90 of the 1,250 secondary schools of
Kenya have programs in agriculture and the syllabus was prepared by the
East African Examinations Council in 1969. However, it is geared to large
mechanized farming and requires too sophisticated equipment. Business educa-
tion is taught more as a practical component of general education than as
a prevocational course.
2.25      Examinations at both the primary and the secondary levels require
revision. The Certificate of Primary Education (CPE) is mainly an academic
examination which distinctly favors candidates from urban areas who have been
more intensely exposed to the English language. An evaluation of the 1974
and 1975 English examination results revealed low marks throughout the country
except in high-cost, mainly urban schools. In mathematics, CPE candidates
showed difficulties with the most simple concepts of quantity and the under-
standing of three-dimensional objects. In science, only 41% of the students
knew very basic facts about maize, the most common crop in Kenya. Finally, no
exarminations have yet been offered in vernacular languages, the most important
medium of communication in the family life of most school leavers.



- 16 -
2.26      Three examinations can be taken at the secondary level.  The Kenya
Junior Secondary Examination (K.J.S.E.) is intended to be an examination for
harambee junior-secondary schools, but many unqualified primary teacher can-
didates also take it. The examination was not popular until recently since
it offered few possibilities for further education. The East African Certifi-
cate of Education (E.A.C.E.) is taken at the end of Form IV and is terminal
for most candidates. Examination performance varies markedly according to
the status of schools. Students from government schools do better than those
from harambee and private schools in all subjects. In languages, the failure
rate in Swahili is higher than in English. The failure rate in mathematics
is high in all schools. In science, students from aided schools do better
than those from unaided schools, but overall, general science results are
poor. Failure is high in technical subjects. Only a few "academic" second-
ary schools have arrangements for technical/practical subjects. Startling
in this context is that failure rates in technical subjects in secondary
technical schools are very high. In 1975, 77% of the candidates in metal-
working, 55% in technical drawing, 46% in geometric and mechanical drawing
and 44% in engineering workshop practice failed. Similarly, results in busi-
ness education were poor. In 1975, no harambee school accepted candidates for
a single technical subject, this is not surprising because facilities for
teaching technical subjects require considerable capital outlay. The East
African Advanced Certificate of Education (E.A.A.C.E.) is taken at the end of
Form VI. In 1975, 4,190 candidates sat for the examination and the pass rate
was about 60%. Successful candidates normally proceed to higher education.
2.27      Work for the primary level has been stagnating since 1967 when a
new syllabus for science and general subjects was introduced. The Government
sustains a vast program of curriculum development for the secondary level.
Classroom experience and reactions of employers, however, have shown that more
fundamental changes are needed particularly with respect to practical subjects
and preparation for rural life. The Project therefore includes incremental
operational funds for a first phase (4 years) of an eight-year program of
primary curriculum and educational materials development (paras 3.15-3.16).
Regarding the localization of examinations, the Sessional Paper on Education
(para. 2.05) contains a series of proposals for changes to be implemented by
1985. The curriculum development program (paras 3.15-3.16) included in the
Project is designed to assist the implementation of these proposals.
Role of the Bank Group in Kenyan Education Development
2.28      The Bank Group has provided three credits/loans to assist educa-
tional development in Kenya. In 1966, Credit 93-KE of US$7.0 million equiv-
alent helped to finance a major expansion program involving the construction
and equipping of 42 general secondary schools, 9 technical schools, and 18
primary teacher training colleges, including boarding facilities and staff
housing. During implementation, at the request of the Government, the number
of teacher training colleges benefiting from the project was reduced to 11.
The project was completed within the original Closing Date at a cost of about
8% above the appraisal estimate. The Operations Evaluation Department of
the Bank reviewed the project during 1974. Their report indicated some



- 17 -
short-comings in the attainment of the qualitative objectives and in the use of
the equipment and facilities provided; however,the overall project objectives
were met.
2.29      A second Credit, 185-KE, of US$6.1 million equivalent, was approved
in 1970. It was designed to assist in the financing of a program involving
the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Nairobi, three Agricultural
Inst:Ltutes, five Farmer Training Centers, six secondary schools, a Secondary
Teacher Training College and a Technical Institute. The project also strength-
ened the planning capacity of the Ministry of Education through the creation
of a Planning Unit, which recently proved its worth and efficiency in the
preparation and background work of the NCEOP. At the request of the Govern-
ment, the construction of a new secondary technical school was added to the
project in lieu of expanding an existing school; this modification caused
delays, making it necessary to extend the Closing Date by almost two years.
The Credit is now fully disbursed, and a completion report was issued in early
1978. The findings of the completion mission, which was carried out by UNESCO
at tlhe end of 1977, are particularly relevant to the agricultural education
component included in the proposed project. Among other things, the UNESCO
study indicated that the Faculty of Agriculture and the three agricultural
institutes had been under-designed in light of actual manpower requirements
and that these facilities are more utilized than anticipated at appraisal.
It also revealed, however, that the average teacher ratio to students in the
agricultural institutes (about 1:11) was excessive.
2.30      At the end of 1975, a Third Education Project (Loan 1184-KE of
US$10.0 million equivalent), was approved. The project aims at: (i) further
improvement of 17 teacher-training colleges; (ii) the strengthening of the
Kenya School Equipment Scheme through the provision of transport and the
establishment of a country-wide network of school equipment storage facili-
ties; (iii) the expansion of the curriculum development capacity of the Kenya
Institute of Education; and (iv) the improvement of educational media services
through the establishment of a multi-media center which will unite, under one
roof, all educational broadcasting services, as well as the development and
testing of new audio-visual teaching and learning aids. The programs of the
new multi-media center will also support adult education and rural education
efforts. An already completed element of the Project is the assistance to
the NCEOP, which issued its report in January 1977. After initial difficul-
ties, the project is now progressing satisfactorily and disbursements are
nearing appraisal estimates.
2.31      Looking at the future, it appears that the Bank should give priority
to t:he support of primary education in Kenya, particularly those programs
which will increase the practical and rural orientation of the primary course.
This strategy coincides with the Bank's emphasis on primary education which
recognizes that learning achievements in secondary and subsequent levels can
only be fully successful if primary education has been of adequate quality.
Assiisting the primary level also appears to be effective in helping achieve
social equity.  Increased internal efficiency of the education system also
deserves attention. At the same time, the Bank should continue to support
specialized education to meet clearly identified manpower needs in the
directly productive fields of agriculture and industry.

i. c_m..ldt ions
2.32      Universal primary education up to Standard 7 appears to be an
educational and social necessity for Kenya. The policies envisaged b- the
Goveriament (para 2.06) are realistic and compatible with its determination
to control recurrentt education expenditures within acceptable limits. The
emphasis on improving the content of education by enriching the curriculum
of primary and secondary education with practical subjects is correct. The
efforts to increase the quantity and quality of education materials will
provide additional support in this direction. School-building programs in
remote areas are necessary and help increase educational equity. The pro-
posed changes in the examination system at both the primary and the secondary
levels should help to make the entire system more efficient. Efforts to
rationalize education programs for the out-of-school population particularly
in the rural areas (e.g., Farmers Training Centers, Craft Training Centers),
are a step toward slowing the migration of unemployed youth to the urban
areas. Finally, proposals to upgrade the administration and management of
the Ministry of Education and to improve the coordination among Ministries,
and the autonomous bodies like the TSC and Higher Education Board can only
lead to overall improvement of the system. Forthcoming Bank Group projects
should support efforts in these areas as a high priority. The proposed
nine-year basic education course, still a long way off, does not appear to
be of high financial priority.
2.33      Of a lower priority is the consolidation of harambee junior sec-
ondary schools. The Government's effort to limit the growth of schools of
inadequate standards should be supported. This strategy coincides with
Government plans to control carefully the expansion at the secondary and
higher education levels. Major investments at these levels may not be re-
quired during the forthcoming three to five year period.
2.34      As Kenya has started a major agricultural development program with
the assistance of various agencies including the Bank, investment in educa-
tion and training should be geared to support this program by providing the
trained local manpower required to carry it out (paras. 1.10-1.13).
III. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives and Strategy
3.01      In terms of enrollment increases, the expansion of Kenya's educa-
tional system has been very rapid. Now, the task is to consolidate the growth
of the sector with improvements in the quality of education and the strength-
ening of educational support services.  The administration of education and
the control of recurrent educational expenditures require particular atten-
tion. Following the NCEOP report, the Government has developed a strategy to
limit f'uture resource allocations to education in line with future increases
in GDP and tax revenue. Regarding the content of education, the emphasis on



- 19 -
rural development will be reflected in curriculum development and examination
requirements. Consequently, the Project is supporting the Government's
strategy (para. 2.06), by according priority to:
(a) Specialized Education. Development of formal agr4-ultural
education to meet estimated manpower requirements by expanding
the University's Faculty of Agriculture and the two agricul-
tural institutes at Embu and Bukura and by construction of a
new Animal Health and Industry Training Institute at Ndomba.
(b) Providing for the training of Kenyans in various aspects of
project development and management through formal courses at
the Kenya Institute of Administration.
(c) Improvement in Equity at Primary and Post-Primary Level.
Promoting progress towards universal primary education
by providing for 13 new Nomadic Primary Schools to be
sited where opportunities for basic education are sig-
nificantly below the national average. Storage facilities
for textbooks and educational materials at about 5,000
rural primary schools would also be included.
(d) Supporting rural training for youths, particularly unem-
ployed primary school leavers by providing a pilot program
in support of the Craft Training Center scheme.
(e) Supporting Educational Services. Assisting qualitative
improvements in education through the Kenya Institute of
Education by providing technical assistance and operational
costs for curriculum development, particularly for basic
education.
(f) Enabling educational planning to be executed with increased
efficiency by providing technical assistance for the Planning
Unit of the Ministry of Education, a computer terminal at the
Ministry of Education and support for the Educational Facilities
Unit.
Project Items
Specialized Education
3.02      The Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Nairobi was founded
at Kabete and temporarily at Chiroma, two suburbs of Nairobi, in 1967 follow-
ing the recommendations of the Weir Agricultural Education Commission. The
Commission report projected public sector requirements for agricultural gra-
duates at 50 p.a. during the period 1970-1980 and, on this basis, the Faculty
was designed for an intake of 40 students and a total capacity of 120 for the
three-year program. When the Commission report was published, there were
already indications that the effective demand for agricultural graduates had
been seriously underestimated; therefore, the second IDA education credit of



- 20 -
1970 assisted in expanding the Faculty to a capacity of 300, which is being
increased to 385 with bilateral assistance. Enrollments have developed as
new capacity was made available and in 1977 there were 310 students. However,
due to the increasing demand for graduate agricultural manpower, the present
enrollment and capacity of the Faculty are not able to produce the number of
specialists needed by the Ministry of Agriculture, parastatals and the private
sector (paras 1.10 and 2.29). Consequently, the Government has requested the
inclusion in the Project of an expansion of the Faculty of Agriculture by
another 305 student places, leading to a total new capacity of 690 students
with an annual output of 200 undergraduates and about 30 graduates after
project completion.
3.03      This project item is fully justified on manpower grounds and because
of the priority attributed to the agricultural sector in Kenya's development
plans. The project includes the financing of teaching and boarding facilities
as well as some transport facilities and technical assistance for the Faculty.
In spite of growing Kenyanization of teaching positions, over 50% of the
Faculty's senior staff remain expatriates, many of whom are provided under
bilateral technical assistance arrangements or exchange agreements with
British, Dutch, German, Swiss, and American universities. In order to main-
tain the steady inflow of highly specialized teaching staff, the project would
include technical assistance of a total of 26 man-years for specialists. Most
of these specialists will be needed for the development of the Faculty's re-
search capacity and for the establishment of new programs at the post-graduate
level and assist in a staff development program which will offer opportunities
to young Kenyan agricultural graduates (M.Sc. and Ph.D. holders) to acquire
advanced specialized knowledge and teaching experience so that after training
they could assume staff positions at the Faculty. About 24 man-years of
fellowships have been included for such training. A satisfactory staff
development plan for the Faculty of Agriculture has been reviewed by the
Association. Agreement was reached with the Government that the University
will submit to the Association an annual progress report on staff development
at the F'aculty of Agriculture. This report would be submitted within six
months of the end of each academic year up to and including the academic year
of 1980 and would include details on the utilization of the technical assist-
ance provided under the Project.
3.04      There is also an increased demand for certificate level agricul-
turalists who are trained at the two Agricultural Institutes at Bukura and
Embu and at the Animal Health and Industry Training Institute (AHITI) at
Kabete. Bukura and Embu offer two-year certificate courses in agriculture
with a special home economics option for women. AHITI offers two-year cer-
tificate courses in animal health, range management and one-year courses
in leather technology, in addition to a number of courses in artificial in-
semination each lasting about four weeks. Bukura and Embu have been assisted
under the Second Education Project of 1970 and at present have a capacity
of 250 students each. AHITI has also a capacity of 250 students. Certificate
holders are mainly employed by the Ministry of Agriculture (for example in the
extension service) and their shortage is critically felt in the implementation
of agricultural development schemes and in the staffing of most agricultural/
veterinary services (para. 1.11).



- 21 -
3.05      To meet the requirements for certificate holders, an expansion of
the two agricultural institutes at Bukura and Embu and a new AHITI at Ndomba
have been included in the project in order to allow a total enrollment of
400 in each agricultural institute and 360 in the new AHITI. At all three
locations, because of their remote situations, full student boarding and a
minimum of staff housing (Bukura 18, Embu 10, Ndomba 40) is included to cater
to the housing needs of new teaching staff. To facilitate access of staff and
teachers to the Institutes and for field work for all three institutions, a
limited amount of transport is provided. All three Institutes plan to offer
new opportunities for women through the provision of new boarding facilities
and special courses in home economics for which equipment would be provided
under the project. An adequate supply of Kenyan teaching staff is available
and can be trained at diploma level at the Egerton Agricultural College. In
order to redress the situation described in para. 2.29, agreement was reached
with the Government that by the 1981 academic year, the average student:teacher
ratio in the Agricultural Institutes will reach at least 15:1.
3.06      The present AHITI built in Kabete to accommodate 250 students cannot
be further expanded to produce more Animal Health and Range Assistants as
planned by the Government because it has already been absorbed within the
urban area of Nairobi. For the new AHITI a location has been chosen (Ndomba,
60 km north of Nairobi) which combines ideal conditions for field training
(300 ha of farm land) and extension to the surrounding subsistence farmers.
The new AHITI would use a revised curriculum and offer more opportunities for
in-service training of animal health and range assistants. The Government
plans to increase the enrollment of women in all programs offered. Changes in
the agricultural education and training capacity resulting from the Project
are summarized in the following table:

*    Includes day students.
3.07      The Government wishes to improve development project work throughout
the country by improving the knowledge and experience of a wide cross-section
of middle- and upper-level civil servants and through establishment of a
series of Project Development and Management Courses at the Kenya Institute
of Administration (KIA). The KIA operates under the Directorate of Personnel
of the Office of the President and over the past 8 years has gained wide expe-
rience with a pilot program in project development which with IDA assistance
is proposed to become fully institutionalized. The development of a detailed
program of training and including an associated staff development plan is



- 22 -
essential to the success of this component and tor Phase I, up to 1.5 man-years
of sp-ecialists services have been included for the development of a course plan
and staff developm[ent. Phase II includes up to about 20 man-years of special-
ists services to carry out the program, 6 man years of fellowship training for
local staff and incremental operation costs for guest lecturers, preparation
of teaching aids and field trips. Disbursement against Phase II would be
contingent upon receipt by the Association by not later than June 30, 1979 of
a satisfactory course plan and staff development plan financed under Phase I.
Improvement in Equity at the Primary and Post-Primary Levels
3.08      The Project includes 13 Nomadic Primary Schools which would be sited
in areas identified as those where children have much less opportunity than
elsehwere in the country to attend school; hence, implementation of the
Government policy of basic education for all (para. 2.06 (a) inevitably means
Government investment in boarding primary schools for these children. In this
regard in 1970 the Government, launched its "Remote Areas Programme" (para.
2.16). Boarding primary schools have been fully accepted by parents and
schools with boarding facilities generally are showing a better retention in
upper standards 1/. Particularly, the retention of girls is higher in board-
ing schools than in day schools. Several alternatives have been investigated
resulting in the selection of this type of schools as being the most efficient
method to reach the educational objectives. At least 45% of the boarding
capacity at each of the 13 schools will be reserved for girls.
3.09      This component would favor the remote northern districts of Mandera,
Wajir and Turkana with enrollment ratios of under 15%; the districts of Samburu
and Marsabit with enrollments of less than 25%; and seven other remote dis-
tricts where under 55% of the primary school age population is enrolled. The
13 schools are part of a long-term program of 35 new boarding institutions
which the Government proposed to build for a school-age population of about
40,000-50,000 children in remote areas. Simultaneously with the introduction
of boarding primary schools, the Government will extend its network of day
schools wherever possible and offer other educational services (such as radio
broadcasts) to the remote area population. The 13 schools would have a total
of 4,550 student places with 73% boarding; each school would have eight
teachers and staff houses. Austere building standards would be applied with
local materials used wherever possible. The improvement in educational pro-
vision for remote areas through the Project is shown in the following table
(related to the 1977 situation):
1/   The Bank Group is assisting boarding primary schools in other countries,
e.g., the Fourth Education in Malaysia (Loan 1329-MAY) and the Second
Education Project in Somalia (Credit 511-SO).

3.10      The curriculum for remote area schools is the same as for other pri-
mary schools all over the country, and teacher supply is guaranteed by the
Government through the TSC. Experience has shown that remote area schools
attract the same proportion of qualified teachers as other schools, provided
staff houses are made available.
3.11      To assist in extending the useful life of textbooks and other
educational materials, particularly in schools built with self-help methods
in rural areas, the Project would include simple storage facilities (shelves,
cabinets) for about 5,000 of the country's rural primary schools. The storage
buildings are to be constructed by the local communities. Distribution would
be arranged through the Kenya School Equipment Scheme together with other
materials provided by the Ministry of Education.
3.12      Substantial progress has been made in the development of Craft
Training Centers: since the initial conception in 1966, the movement has
grown so that in 1976 there were 160 registered CTCs with more than 12,000
trainees and 720 instructors. But, even with this progress, there remains a
problem of some magnitude: primary school leavers, by 1980, will number about
420,000 p.a., and almost all of them will aspire to seek jobs in the modern
sector. Yet, since such jobs will increase at far too slow a rate to absorb
al:L the school leavers, it is apparent that the development of rural areas and
of appropriate training for youth is urgent.
3.13      A report by an international study team sponsored by NORAD indicated
that the Centers play a useful role in training primary school leavers for
rural employment. The report's principal findings are that the quality and
effectiveness of the individual Center depend primarily on two factors: (a)
their proximity to growth areas; and (b) the availability of equipment and
tools. On a pilot basis and in preparation of possible future major programs
in support of the scheme, the Project would provide equipment to about 30



- 24 -
Centers and expand the Karen Centre for Research and Training. The 30 Centers
will be selected as a control group to fully assess the impact of improved
equipping on the effectiveness of training. Such assessment will be carried
out by the Karen Centre which is adequately staffed and organized for this
purpose. The Government confirmed that by December 31, 1978 the 30 Craft
Training Centers to receive the equipment will be selected and a program for
monitoring and evaluation presented to the Association for comments.
3.14      The Karen Centre has the objective to identify local work opportuni-
ties and offers to a limited number of trainees financial loans to support
their initial phases of employment (or self-employment). Visits by the
Centre's staff to trainees during their initial stages of employment are made
regularly and have been found of considerable value in giving practical
assistance and advice as well as providing a valuable feedback of information
to the Centre. Other objectives are the development of work programs for the
CTC's instructors, the investigation of experimental work programs and train-
ing and counseling of technical staff. The Centre is well staffed and receives
support from several voluntary agencies and international religious organiza-
tions. Coordination of the Centre's activities is undertaken in cooperation
with the Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Education, Cooperatives, and
Commerce and Industry. The Centre's physical facilities, however, are of poor
standards. Expansion of these facilities would be included in the Project, as
would vehicles for roving in-service training teams who regularly visit Craft
Training Centers all over the country to offer assistance and advice and who
would carry out the monitoring and evaluation referred to in para. 3.13 and
for transportation of educational materials.
Supporting Educational Services
3.15      The Kenya Institute of Education (KIE) has a key role to play
in assisting in the implementation of major recommendations of the NCEOP by
restructuring the curricula for primary and secondary schools so that the
new courses would prepare students, especially primary school leavers, to
participate more fully in the economic, social, and political life of the
nation. Initially, priority will be given to primary school curriculum
development, including identifying equipment needs for practical work (in
cooperation with the Science Equipment Production Unit (SEPU)), production
of prototypes for testing and evaluating in schools. The Institute woulcl
also organize and operate courses on the new curricula for teacher trainers
at primary and secondary teacher training colleges and at their headquarters
in Nairobi.
3.16      To help the Institute meet the above responsibilities the Project
would provide for six man-months of technical assistance and for equipment and
lncremental operational cost for the first phase of curriculum development and
testing as well as courses for teacher trainers. The program would be imple-
tnented by qualified local experts in the area of education. Since most ex-
perts are engaged in other activities, their services would be made available
through a rotating panel system incorporating both subjects and course panels.
This system would utilize the approximately 1,300 national and expatriate
educators with experience in curriculum matters residing in Kenya without



- 25 -
creating new posts. For this reason, the Project includes the incremental
operational costs of this one-time exercise. The development of teaching and
learning aids will be undertaken by SEPU. Special arrangements were made to
support its design and prototype development capacity with four man-years of
technical assistance under the Third Education Project.
3.17      An efficient Planning Unit in the Ministry of Education is essen-
tial for future educational developments in Kenya. The Planning Unit will have
the major task of systematically planning for the implementation of the NCEOP
recommendations. This work will be superimposed upon the Unit's already heavy
day-to-day operations.  The Planning Unit received technical assistance under
the Second Education Project, and the contracts of the educational planner and
educational economist are terminating. New appointments to these posts are
necessary.  Provision for 2-1/2 and 2 man-years respectively, would be in-
cluded in the Project in this respect. Also included, so as to provide
essential short-term support in specialized areas of planning, are funds for
specialist services to enable appropriate local consultants to be hired for
varying short periods.
3.18      The Educational Facilities Unit of the Ministry of Education has an
important role to play in support of the Planning Unit and of the Educational
Project Implementation Section of the Ministry of Works. The Facilities Unit
is charged with keeping an inventory of school buildings including site plans,
advising on maintenance and development problems, control of minor works and
improvements, and preparing site plans and architectural briefs for develop-
ment programs. Research programs are also carried out to establish space
norms for standard educational facilities, equipment requirements, furniture
designs, and to investigate the possibility of reducing the unit cost of
standard buildings by the use of local building materials and simpler con-
struction techniques. To render the Facilities Unit effective in this work,
seven man-years of technical assistance would be included in the Project to
enable an architect and two building supervisors to be appointed for two years
each and a school furniture designer for one year; they would be supported by
a financial allocation for office equipment and vehicles for survey purposes.
A general educator financed by a bilateral agency would also assist in this
wcrk.
3.19      To support the Planning Unit of the Ministry of Education, there
is a need to create and maintain computer records and data processing of the
examinations. The lack of statistical records on teachers also should be
rectified with computerized records. Data processing, in view of the large
and increasing volume of work, is also necessary to facilitate the analysis
of examination results, to carry out a thorough analysis of multiple choice
examination papers, to analyze examination performance statistics, and to
examine reasons for marked differences in performance among districts and
schools.
3.20      A technical analysis of alternative arrangements for data processing
has led to the inclusion in the Project of the installation of a computer
terminal at the Ministry of Education, linked through appropriate multiple
lines to the existing computer center at the Ministry of Finance where there



- 26 -
is a computer equipped with all necessary peripherals. The terminal would be
provided with about 20K bytes of local central memory permitting the indepen-
dent execution of a range of small jobs without involving the central computing
facility; the terminal would also be provided with a line printer, a disk
unit, a card reader and a document reader. Also included are four man-years
of technical assistance for a system analyst and a programmer and provision
for about two years of incremental operational cost.
3.21      Agreement was reached with the Government that all technical assis-
tant specialists and fellowships financed under the Project would be employed
with qualification and experience, and upon terms and conditions, satisfactory
to the Association.
3.22      The Government also confirmed that it will carry out a Completion
and Evaluation Study of the Project and submit a report to the Association for
review within three months after the Closing Date of the Credit. The terms of
reference of this study would be mutually agreed upon by the Government and
the Bank Group.

4.02       Construction, furniture and equipment cost estimates have been
provided by the Government and reviewed by Association staff on the basis of
recent competitive bidding in the Third Education Project (Loan 1184-KE) and
in ccnsultation wi'th architects and quantity surveyors of the Ministries of
Education and Works and the staff of the Faculty of Agriculture. Base unit
ccnist:ruction costs per square meter vary from US$140 for Nomadic Primary
Schools and US$250 for the new agricultural institutes. These unit costs
compared favorably with similar institutions financed in other Bank Group
education projects. For nonformal basic education facilities and for post
secondary agricultural institutions, the mid-1977 median value was US$117 and
US$256 per square meter. The average gross area for staff houses is about 65
square meters. The proposed schedules of accommodations are functional, and
areas per student place are realistic.  Technical assistance specialists have
been costed at US$55,000 per man-year and fellowships at US$8,000 per man-year.
Furniture and equipment would be kept to a minimum and of a type pertinent to
the basic needs of the Project to reach the educational objectives. Estimated
costs have allowed for maximum use of local materials and simplified building
technology particularly for the Nomadic Primary Schools for which standard
designs would be dLeveloped. Academic and communal facilities represent about
38% of the civil works costs; boarding, 38% and staff housing, 24%. No self-
help construction scheme is envisaged for the Nomadic Primary Schools because
of insufficient population in the proposed areas.
4.03       Custom Duties and Taxes.  Items directly imported for educational
facilities are exempt from import duties and taxes. The Project has been
costed net of import duties and taxes on those items but the total cost
includes taxes and duties estimated at about US$1.0 million equivalent
representing taxes on locally procured construction materials and equipment
imported directly by contractors or vendors and for services.
4.04       Contingency Allowances.  Physical contingencies add 10% to the cost
of civil works and professional services and 5% to equipment, furniture, tech-
nical assistance, project administration and incremental operational cost,
which together represent 8% of base line cost. Estimated price increases
are based upon thet following annual rates for which price escalation has been
calculated from thie base cost date (March 1978) in accordance with the imple-
mentation schedule shown in Annex I-C3.

Pricet increases for civil works have been comparatively high due to high
inflation between 1973 and 1976 (para. 1.03) and also in 1976-1977, prices
in construction sector rose about 1.5% per month, mainly because of wage
increases, only a gradual deceleration of this trend is expected.

4.05      The Foreign Exchange Component has been calculated as follows:  (i)
civil works and furniture, 30%; (ii) equipment and vehicles, 90%; (iii) pro-
fessional services, 60%; (iv) technical assistance, 80%; and (v) project
administration and incremental operation cost, 20%. The foreign exchange
component estimated at US$15.0 million equivalent represents 50% of total
project cost excluding duties and taxes.
Financial Plan
4.06      The total Project cost of US$31.0 million equivalent would be
financed with an IDA credit of US$23.0 million representing 77% of project
cost excluding duties and taxes. The Credit would cover the foreign exchange
component and 53% of local currency cost excluding duties and taxes and the
Government would provide US$8.0 million equivalent, as follows:

4.07      The recurrent expenditures generated by the Project would be about
K. Shs. 17.0 million which represents less than 1% of the estimated recurrent
expenditure on education in 1981/82.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
Implementation
5.01      The Project would be implemented in about 4-1/4 years after Credit
effectiveness (Annex I-C3) including six months for completion of payments and
withdrawals from the Credit proceeds.



- 30 -
5.02      Administration.  The Project Unit in the Ministry of Education which
implemented satisf'actorily the first and second Bank Group-financed education
projects and is imiplementing the third project would be responsible for the
fourth project; thLe Unit would work in close collaboration with the Ministry
of Works which has prime responsibility for construction of civil works
in Kenya and which would also maintain its staff assigned to assist in the
implementation of the previous education projects. The Project UInit would be
strengthened by the appointment of one of the key staff as assistant project
director and the arddition of an accountant.  The Project Unit's architect is
provided by DANIDA until February 1980 and his extension to June 30, 1982 is
financed under the Third Education Project-. Finance for six man-months of
technical dssistance to support an extension of his contract to December 31,
1982 is included in the Project.  Agreement was reached with the Government
that the staff for the Project Unit and the Ministry of Works (MOW) would be
maintained throughout the period of project implementation.
5.03      Professional Services (Architectural/Engineering).  For the design,
preparation of construction documents and supervision of construction, consul-
tants would be selected and appointed on terms and conditions mutually agree-
able to the Borrower akd the Association.  Due to the specialized nature of
the Faculty of Agriculture, consultants would be utilized.  ShouLd the MOW
have the capacity to undertake some of the design other than the Faculty of
Agriculture, such work will be-at no cost to the Project.
5.04       Standardized designs already developed for the first, second and
third Bank Group-f'inanced education projects would be used to the extent
practicable for the Project. Satisfactory sites are available for all project
institutions.
Procurement
5.05       Contracts for civil works, furniture, equipment and vehicles would
be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement except as follows: (i) civil works
contracts costing less than US$300,000 equivalent each (estimated at US$3.0
million); (ii) furniture and equipment contracts costing less than US$50,000
equivalent each (estimated at US$0.2 million); and (iii) transportation serv-
ices (estimated at: US$0.3 million). Contracts for items i-iii would be award-
ed on1 the basis ofr competitive bidding, advertised locally and in accordance
with local procedures satisfactory to the Association. It is anticipated
that contracts for the Nomadic Primary Schools would be awarded to Kenyan
contractors already established in rural districts.  Nearly 350 rural con-
tractors are receiving technical assistance from the National Construction
Corporation, a seTmi-Government organization financed by the Government and
NORAD).
5.06       Sketch designs, draft tender documents and master lists of construc-
tion materials, furniture, equipment and vehicles (including proposed group-
ing) would be reviewed by the Association. Items would be grouped to the
extent practicable to permit bulk procurement. Review of tender evaluation
docurnents by the Association prior to award would not be required for civil
works contracts less than US$500,000 equivalent and contracts for equipment,
furniture and construction materials, less than US$50,000 equivalent. Domestic



- 31 -
manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a preference of 15%
or the existing rate of import duties, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f.
price of competing foreign suppliers. Qualified domestic civil works con-
tractors would be allowed a preferential margin of 7.5% over bid prices of
competing foreign contractors.
Disbursement
5.07      Disbursement (Annex I-T6) would be on the basis of:
(a) 60% of total expenditures for civil works.
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported furniture,
equipment, and vehicles; 100% of ex-factory cost when
manufactured locally or 70% of local expenditures when
procured locally;
(c) 70% of local expenditures for local transportation of
furniture and equipment; and for incremental operational
costs of project administration; and
(d) 100% of foreign expenditures or 70% of local expenditures,
for technical assistance, and professional services.
Disbursements against (a), (b) and (d) would be fully documented. Disburse-
ment for (c), estimated at US$1.2 million equivalent, would be against a
certificate of expenditure, the documentation for which, would not be sub-
mitted for review, but retained by the Borrower and available for inspection
by the Association during the course of a project supervision mission. Annual
auditing of expenditures concerning disbursements under this procedure would
be carried out by Government auditors acceptable to the Association.  The
Project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1982 with a proposed Closing
Date of December 31, 1982.
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
6.01      The Project would provide financial and technical assistance to
carry out major recommendations of the National Committee on Educational
Objectives and Policies (NCEOP). Specifically, the Project would support
strategic items in specialized education, basic and post primary, education,
and supportive educational services. All items included would be of crucial
importance to implement the NCEOP strategy in assisting the country in attain-
ing its development objectives by generating important benefits with respect
tco development of trained manpower, equity in basic education, and improvement
of educational quality throughout Kenya.
6.02      Manpower Development.  The proposed increase in the supply of
trained agricultural manpower at both graduate and certificate level would
assist the Government in carrying out its rural development policy, provide
vital reinforcements for the understaffed extension service, and contribute



- 32 -
t~ ou.alitative improvement by replacing many under-qualified extension workers
wiCh well-trained technicians.  The courses to be carried out at the KIA would
improve Kenya's capability in project planning and implementation by upgrading
abotut 2,300 middle- and upper-level civil servants concerned with development
activities.
6.03      Equity in Educational Opportunity.  A step towards equity in educa-
tLonal opportunity would be realized through the provision of 4,550 student
places, sited in areas where enrollments for basic education are the lowest in
the country. Opportunities for women would be increased by reserving 45% of
the total boarding places specifically for female enrollment. The inclusion
of assistance to Craft Training Centers and the Karen Centre for research and
training would not only support rural development but also improve the condi-
tion of unemployed rural young people and would represent the Government's
main thrust in training young people for identified rural job opportunities.
6.04      Educational Quality.  Qualitative improvements will be realized
through assistance to the Planning Unit at the MOE together with other edu-
cational facilities units. This assistance would provide for educational
planning on a national scale in accordance with the NCEOP recommendations
and Government policies.
6.05      Risks.  The principal risk relates to the Ministry of Education's
recurrent expenditures which should be controlled and monitored in order
that their increase remains broadly in step with growth of the Government's
recurrent budget. Teachers' salaries are the principal cause of high recur-
rent costs and while some progress has been made to contain salary increases,
the Government has to contend with a powerful and well organized Kenya
National Union of Teachers (KNUT) whose prime concern is to ensure the
improvement of teachers' compensation. Future reasonable cooperation between
Government and the Union will be a major factor affecting educational devel-
opment (paras. 2.08-2.09).
6.06      In spite of the risk, the Project represents a major step forward
in the consolidation of 15 years of educational development and will form the
basis for qualitative improvements envisaged by the NCEOP. The determination
of both the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance and Planning to
keep recurrent education expenditure under control is not in doubt and Kenya
has a well established project implementation capacity. Therefore, the
proposed project is expected to achieve its targets.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      Agreement was reached with the Government on the folowing principal
poilnts:
(a)  the staffing of the Faculty of Agriculture and the Agricultural
Institutes (paras. 3.03 and 3.05);



- 33 -
(b)  employment of technical assistance specialists, fellowships
and monitoring and evaluation with special reference to the
Craft Training Centers (paras. 3.13, 3.21 and 3.22); and
(c)  the project implementation staff would be maintained throughout
the period of project implementation (para. 5.02).
7.02      Disbursements for the Project Development and Management Courses
(Phase II) at the KIA would be contingent upon receipt by the Association,
by not later than June 30, 1979, of a satisfactory course plan and associated
staff development plan (financed under Phase I) (para 3.07).
7.03      The Project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of
US$23.0 million.
