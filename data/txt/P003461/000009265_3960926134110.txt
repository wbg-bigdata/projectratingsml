subborrowers. ABC would bear the exchange risk on
foreign exchange used for staff training program.
Project Objectives
and description:     The main objectives of the proposed project would be to
(a) stimulate growth and diversification of agriculture
by expanding availability of medium-and long-term credit,
and (b) increase ABC'8 operational efficiency through
institutional development. ABC would use project funds
to provide subloans to households, cooperatives,
collective enterprises, state-owned enterprises and
state-collective partnerships for investments in tree
crops, livestock, aquaculture, and agro-processing. ABC
lending would be in six of China's poorer provinces:
Guizhou, Sichuan and Yunnan in the southwest and Anhui,
Henan and Hubei in north central region.  The project's
technical assistance for institutional development would
be used to strengthen ABC's in-house staff training
capability and to conduct studies of ABC and RCC
operations. The project would also include a pilot
program to introduce rural credit cooperatives (RCCs) to
longer term lending. The focus of the institutional
development program is to assist in Government's effort
to reshape ABC's role consister with the ongoing reform
of the financial system. At full development, the value

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A THIRD RURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the People's Republic of China to help finance a Third Rural Credit
Project. The Credit of SDR 123.8 million (US$170 million equivalent) would be
on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity.
2.        Background.  The proposed project would expand the availability of
institutional credit in six of China's poorer provinces as a means to
stimulate growth and diversification of agriculture. The six provinces
include Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan in the southwest and Anhui, Hubei and
Henan in the north central region. Project funds would be channeled through
the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) in the form of medium and long-term loans
to households and enterprises for the development of tree crops, livestock,
aquaculture and agro-processing. The project would also provide technical
assistance for ABC's institutional development to increase its operational
efficiency.
3.        Agriculture in China, including crops, livestock, forestry, and
fisheries, provides sustenance to over one billion people, is the source of
income fot some 190 million farm households, and accounts for about 35% of the
country's GDP. Major reforms in farm policies since 1979, especially the
shift from communal to household-managed farming, increases in farm prices,
and enlarging the role of the market, have helped stimulate and diversify
agricultural production.  During 1980-85, Chini's agricultural production
increased dramatically, by about 10% p.a. in comparison with the average of 3%
p.a. over the past two decades.
4.        The Government's main objectives in the agricultural sector continue
to be to: (i) increase and diversify agricultural production to meet the
requirements created by the expanding population; (ii) accommodate a continued
shift in consumption patterns in response to increasing per capita incomes;
and (iii) raise employment opportunities and incomes in rural areas. Given
the shortage of arable land (0.1 ha per capita), the GCvernment's emphasis is
on increasing the productivity of existing cropped areas, developing
efficiently the remaining unutilized land, and promoting the growth of rural
agro-processing and support services to achieve the above objectives.
5.        The Bank Group's strategy for lending in China's agricultural sector
has been to support the Government objecti-es outlined above (para. 4).
Lending to date has included 14 operations involving a total assistance of
about $1 billion for land development; support services including agricultural
training, research, credit and seed production; development of specialized
product subsectors including rubber, forestry and fisheries; and area
development projects combining crop and livestock production, agro-processing
and support services. Implementation of these projects is generally on
schedule. Future Bank-Group lending would continue to support projects in
large and diverse subsectors, e.g., water resources development, livestock,
agro-processing, and rural credit which supports a broad range of activities.



6.        The Bank Group involvement in the project would also assist in the
Government's reform efforts in the financial sector, an area in which the Bank
Group and Government recently reviewed the evolving processes of mobilization,
intermediation, allocation of j7vestment resources, and the interrelationships
of the various policy reforms._ Future reform measures in the sector would
focus on the development of financial institutions which would be increasingly
responsible for mobilization of financial savings and channeling of those
savings to efficient investments. To achieve this latter objective, the
financial institutions are expected to become more autonomous and responsible
for their own profits and losses. The proposed project would contribute to
the ongoing process of reshaping the role of the rural banking system in line
with the changing financial sector environment.
7.        ABC and its affiliated rural credit cooperatives (RCCs) are the main
institutional sources of credit for the rural sector. Loans to date have been
mainly short-term, for working capital purposes. Generally, ABC provides
loans to Supply and Marketing Cooperatives (SMCs), county and township
enterprises and specialized households. RCCs lend to village enterprises and
individual farmers. Both ABC and RCCs are now attempting to respond to the
increasing demand for credit, especially longer term investment funds, brought
about by the shift from communal to household-managed farming (para. 3).
Recent changes in the Government approach to enterprise financing have also
increased the demand for longer term loans from ABC and RCCs. To ensure
efficiency in resource allocation and cost recovery, an important element of
the ongoing referms, the Government now requires that capital investments by
enterprises should be increasingly financed by loans rather than by fiscal
grants as in the pi-t. ABC and RZCs are in the process of taking on this
additional function of development banking. To become effective in this new
role, they will need to increase resources and expand the range of services,
including provision of medium-and longer term credit, and upgrade staff
skills, particularly in techniques of investment analysis. ABC's longer term
lending and institutional development are being supported by the ongoing IDA-
financed Rural Credit I and II Projects (Cr. 1462 and 1642-CHA) which are
being implemented satisfactorily. The two Rural Credit Projects are also
beginning to make a favorable impact on improving savings mobilization at the
branches involved in project implementation because of increase in farmer
incomes and farmers' improved access to banking services offered by ABC.
8.        Project Objectives and Description.  The main objectives of the
project would be (a) to stimulate growth and diversification of agriculture by
expanding the availability of medium- and long- term credit, and (b) to
increase ABC's operational efficiency through institutional development. The
project would supplement ABC's resources for longer term loans to households,
cooperatives, collective enterprises, state-owned enterprises, and state-
collective partnerships for investments in tree crops, livestock, aquaculture,
and agroprocessing. The project's technical assistance would be used for
strengthening ABC's in-house training capability, and to conduct systems
improvement studies of ABC and RCC operations. The project would also include
a pilot program to introduce selected RCCs to longer term lending.

9.        Credit Component.   With the assistance from the provincial
goveri,ments  technical bureaus, ABC has developed an indicative investment
program for the project (1988-92) in tree crops, livestock, aquaculture, and
agro-processing in line with government strategies in agriculture (para. 4).
The project would focus on making use of underutilized land, generally in
remote areas, for tree crop development and pastures. Tree crops would
chiefly include plantingfreplanting of rubber and rehabilitation of tea in
Yunnan, planting of sumac trees for gallnut production in Guizhou, and orchard
development for a variety of fruits in Sichuan, Anhui and Henan. Tea rehabil-
itation would be financed on the ground that the project areas, located in
poorer areas of Yunnan, have very limited alternatives to tea growing. As
most tea producers are small scale, relatively low income farmers, the
proposed development is critical as a poverty alleviation measure. In
addition, tea as a perennial crop would provide better protection against soil
ereaLon which is a serious problem in the project area. Much of the
incremental black tea production (20,000 tons) is likely to be consumed
domestically and only marginal amounts would enter the export market with
little long-term impact on world tea prices.
10.       Livestock investments would focus on increasing the efficiency of
pig production in Sichuan, Hubei, and Henan; pasture development for sheep
raising for wool in Guizhou and cattle production in Guizhou and Henan; and
goat production in Henan. The project would support construction of fish
ponds mainly in Henan, Sichuan and Guizhou. The project-financed investment
program would support establishment of storage and processing facilities for a
wide range of products including fruits, oilseeds, rubber, tea, animal and
fish feed, meat and other animal products, and fish and other aquatic
products. The focus would be on using modern technology appropriate for
producing quality output consistent with market requirements and on ensuring
efficient use of by-products and protection of the environment.
11.       ABC would use about $8 million equivalent of project funds to
implement the RCC pilot program in Henan, Hubei, Anhui and Sichuan. The main
focus of this program would be to establish a model for longer term lending by
RCCs, in response to the growing demand for such resources from households and
enterprises (para. 7). The main elements of the pilot program would be
training of RCC staff in project appraisal and introducing a refinancing
mechanism between ABC and RCCs.
12.       Technical Assistance Component.  The project would support ABC's
institutional development mainly by implementing a staff training program and
providing consultancy services for ABC's in-house studies in support of its
systems reform activities. The staff training program would help ABC to
upgrade the faculty and facilities at ABC's three national-level Senior Staff
Colleges which in turn would train the teachers of lower level schools and
management personnel in key subjects including project appraisal, market
analysis, township and village enterprise management, modern banking practices
and teaching techniques. Several new courses would be introduced and existing
courses upgraded at the three colleges and staff training schools. Through
improved instruction, ABC's provincial and lower level staff training schools
would turn out better trained managerial and operational staff, thus helping
to improve the range and quality of ABC services, and contributing to more
efficient internal management including lending decisions.



-4-
13.       The project-assisted studies would focus on the following topirs:
ABC's loan approval policies and procedures, (including resources for longer
term lending), subloan collect.on and write-offs, transac-ion costs of ABC
lending, enterprise financing, increased deposit mobilization and
institutional development of RCCs. In the past, banks in China opere'.ed
essentially as fiscal agents facilitating and supervising the implementation
of resource allocation decisions by the Government. In their new role, the
banks would be responsible for mobilization of resources and aliocating those
resources to activities which promise highest economic returns. The focus of
the proposed studies would be to assist ABC in its ongoing systems reform
effort to be able to fulfill this function effectively (para. 6).
14.       Rationale for IDA supeort.  The proposed project would continue and
expand Bank Group support to ABC for modernization and diversification of
agricultural production and processing for increasing rural productivity,
employment and incomes (paras. 4 and 5). IDA funds would augment ABC
capability to extend longer term loans, the demand for which is growing in the
course of the recent economic reforms. Project support to ABC's institutional
development would assist the Government in reshaping ABC's role conpistent
with the current financial sector reform in which the Bank Group is actively
collaborating with Chinese authorities (paras. 6 and 7).
15.       Agreed Actions.  Compared with IDA-assisted Rural Credit I ind II
projects, the proposed project would be a much larger operation in terms of
geographical coverage, size of the lending program, and the number of
activities to be financed. The project's technical assistance component would
also be much broader in scope than in earlier IDA-assisted operations, aimed
at upgrading ABC's staff training institutions at both the central and local
levels. To ensure effective implementation of the project, the Government and
ABC have agreed to the following: (i) the Government would ensure that ABC
receives at least a 2% spread (or such higher spread as may be agreed between
the Government and IDA), between the cost to ABC of project funds (IDA funds
and ABC's counterpart contributions) and the project's onlending rates to
subborrowers; (ii) ABC's lending rates would be reviewed with IDA from time to
time in light of ABC's cost of funds and profitability and taking into account
inflation and other interest rates in the economy, in order to ensure that the
interest rates to be paid by final beneficiaries are positive in real terms.
The first such review would be completed by December 1988; (iii) the
Government would maintain Project Management Committees and ABC would maintain
Project Offices for the six provinces during project implementation; (iv) the
Government and ABC would implement the tea rehabilitation program in
accordance with technical guidelines agreed to with IDA and complete the
proposed reviews of gallnut and pasture development and sheep breeding
programs in Guizhou by the end of 1989; (v) ABC would implement the RCC pilot
program and review its implementation during 1989; (vi) ABC would appoint
additional staff in the Head Office for project implementation; (vii) ABC
would obtain the prior approval of IDA for subloans in excess of US$3 million;
and (viii) ABC and Government would ensure that subproject activities would
conform to appropriate guidelines on environmental control issued by the
provinces and acceptable to IDA. The prior approval of IDA (item vii above)
is intended to assist ABC to ensure that subloans which are large and/or
involve new technology are properly appraised. Such subloans would account
for about 15% of the project funds. In addition, subloans for $1 million and



above, involving about 30% of the project funds, would be reviewed by ABC Head
Office and reported to IDA for monitoring purposes. This would provide
adequate supervision by ABC and IDA over the project lending.
16.       Benefits and Justification.  At full development, the value of
annual incremental output from project investments would be about $245 million
per annim. The project would increase the production of higher value foods
which are in short supply and for which demand is growing rapidly. The
project would benefit directly some 150,000 families through increased
production and incomes. The annual demand for labor would increase by about
92 million work days, equivalent to 326,C00 full-time jobs, thereby absorbing
part of the surplus rural labor force.  ABC would benefit from institutional
strengthenirg through improvements in the efficiency of its overall operations
including lending decisions. The financial rates of returrn (FRR) of the
project components based on typical subprojects would range from 17% to 22%.
Their economic rates of return would vary frrm 15% to 39%. For the project as
a whole, the FRR and ERR are estimated at 20% and 24% .espectively.
17.       Risks.  No hajor risks are anticipated.  The financial and economic
analysis of typical investments indicates that the project could sustain
significant increases in costs and reductions in revenues and still provide
satisfactory rates of return. Institutional risks associated with channeling
of longer term investment funds would be addressed through staff training and
upgrading ABC's and participating RCCs' procedures for portfolio management.
Only those RCCs which comply with minimum financial standards would parti-
cipate in the project. Government's agreement that ABC and RCCs would receive
a spread of not less than 2% p.a. (currently at about 2.5% p.a.) on project
lending, would ensure that their transaction costs Pre fully covered.
Adequacy of the interest spread to ABC and RCCs would be reviewed by the
Covernment, ABC and IDA as necessary. All major subloans would be backed by
local government guarantees to ensure technical support to project investments
and assistance to ABC and RCCs in subloan collection. ABC's operations have
been consistently in profit. Its financial condition and liquidity are
monitored by the Ministry of Finance and the People's Bank of China.
18.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that t'ie p:aposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

Procurement and Disbursements
A. Procurement
1.        General.  Procurement arrangements have been evolved in line with
the Bank Group guidelines for Credit Projects (Table below),
2.        Machinery and Equipment.  Procurement of machinery and equipment,
spread over six provinces and carried out over five years, would be too
dispersed and small-scale to be suitable for International Competitive Bidding
(ICB). Vehicles and smaller scale machinery and equipment for on-farm devel-
opment, farm support and agro-processing facilities, and staff training would
be procured from local machinery companies and suppliers and the increasing
number of representatives of toreign suppliers in China, by prudent shopping
procedures acceptable to IDA. To facilitate technology transfer, machinery
and equipment fe- larger investments would be procured in accordance with
prudent shopping and limited international bidding (LIB) procedures acceptable
to IDA, as follows:
(a) Contracts for purchase of machinery and equipment items or groups of
items aggregating up to US$100,000 would be awarded on the basis of
comparison of price quotations from at least three qualified
suppliers;
(b) Contracts for purchase of investment items with costs exceeding
US$100,000 would be awarded through LIB procedures in accordance
with procedures set out in the "Guidelines for Procurement under
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits". This would be done on the basis of
evaluation and comparison of bids from at least four qualified
suppliers, from at least three different countries. Individual
contracts in ti.is category are not likely to exceed US$4 million;
and
(ci  Award of contracts exceeding US$500,000 would require prior review
by IDA.
3.        Civil Works.  Civil works and agricultural inputs would be procured
under local procedures acceptable to IDA. Civil works invo:ving LCB contracts
are expected to amount to US$50 million equivalent. Most contracts would be
small and scattered over a wide area and would not be of interest to foreign
bidders.
4.        Consultants.  Consultants would be selected in accordance with the
Bank Group's guidelines and on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
About 900 staff-days of internationally recruited consultants and 500 staff-
