1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country background: A nation of approximately 50 million people (second largest among the Former
Soviet Republics), Ukraine established its independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
This began a period of transition to a market economy in which Ukraine was stricken with an eight year
recession. Ukraine was initially viewed as a country with favorable economic conditions in comparison
to the other regions of the Former Soviet Union (FSU). However, the country experienced a deep
economic slowdown. During the recession from 1991 to 1999, Ukraine lost 60 percent of its GDP and
suffered five-digit inflation rates while 1/3 of the population plunged into poverty. In mid-1990s, the new
President embarked on an ambitious reform program and the Ukrainian economy began to stabilize.
However, although initial results were encouraging, the Government began to display lacking
commitment to the reform agenda, coupled with growing paralysis in decision-making and increasing
capture of the state by vested interests. These negative tendencies were noted in the April 1999 Bank
Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report and the Bank operations in Ukraine were sharply curtailed
at that time. However, with the November 1999 elections of President Kuchma and the appointment of a
progressive Prime Minister, Victor Yushchenko, there appeared a chance for Ukraine to recoup the
opportunity losses made over the previous decade. GDP began a positive trend in 2000 with 5.9% GDP
growth; this continued over the 2000-2002 period, with 9.8% growth in 2001 and 4.8% in 2002. Poverty
also declined very gradually from 29.4% in 1999 to 25.6% in 2002.

Sector background: The transition period with its political and socio-economic dislocations, a major
contraction of the economy in 1990s, led to shrinking budgetary resources, with deleterious effects on the
health status of the population. A contributing factor was also the overall deterioration in the provision of
health care services as a result of decreasing budgets while Ukraine attempted to maintain its inefficient
hospital-based Soviet healthcare system. As a result, from 1985 to 1999, life expectancy at birth
contracted from 70 to 67 years, particularly for males (from 66 to 62 years). This was full 10 years lower
than the EU-15 average for 1999 (77.2 years). Indeed, starting in 1991, Ukraine entered a demographic
crisis due to its high death rates and low birth rates. By 2000, the birth rate was 7.7 births/1,000
population while the death rate was 15.5 deaths/1,000 population. This was the lowest point in Ukraine's
natural rate of growth since 1990, including the present. While non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such
as circulatory diseases, cancers, respiratory and digestive diseases, as well as accidents, injuries and
poisonings represented most of the disease burden in Ukraine, communicable diseases--which were
decreasing in the late 1980s--re-emerged in the early/mid-1990s, including tuberculosis (TB), sexually
transmitted illnesses (STIs), and a new disease of HIV/AIDS. This trend was consistent with the
experience of other FSU countries, particularly Russia, which like Ukraine faced a rapid explosion of TB
and HIV/AIDS.

Tuberculosis: The overall coordination and administration for TB control was the responsibility of the
Ministry of Health Department of Socially Dangerous Diseases, with the implementation of TB control
programs resting at oblast and rayon administrations. The formulation of technical policies and guidelines
was provided by the Research Institute for Pulmonology and Phthisiology (TB Institute) under the
Academy of Medical Sciences. By 1999, TB treatment services were provided at 165 specialized TB
dispensaries and 98 TB sanatoria as well as in some large hospitals. The State Department of Prisons had
its own 10 TB hospitals with 13,200 beds as well as isolation wards in medical units attached to many
prison facilities. Based on this set-up, Ukraine had successfully controlled TB and other infectious
diseases although the system was inefficient with heavy reliance on expensive diagnostic techniques,
including active-case finding of TB in adult population aged 15 years and older by mass radiography

                                                     1
(fluoragraphy  x-ray), as well as on long hospitalizations of patients of one year or more. This system
proved difficult to maintain during the transition period with declining health budgets. TB facilities, and
especially laboratory services, had obsolete equipment, lacked resources and operated with scant
provision of necessary supplies and reagents. Moreover, there was no internal or external system for
quality control. As a result, the quality of diagnosis was poor, leading to high-levels of over-diagnosis of
TB (only 35 percent of all tested patients turned out to have bacteriologically proven pulmonary TB).
Also, drug supplies during the transition period were inadequate with periods where no drugs were
available at all and patients were asked to buy their own medicines. Lastly, treatment guidelines were
often not followed and treatment regimens differed from patient to patient (as a result of fluctuations in
the availability of drugs) and were also changed during the process for the same patients. Additionally,
because TB services were centralized at rayon and oblast dispensaries, access to care was reduced,
particularly during the transition period, with late presentation of patients with advanced disease. This
also led to high treatment default rates. In sum, this non-standardized, irregular and inadequate treatment
resulted in what the WHO Review of TB in Ukraine (December 1999) called "an epidemic of emergency
proportions."

Indeed, given these systemic weaknesses and increased poverty rates (closely associated with TB growth)
during the transition period, the epidemiological situation of TB was dramatically worse by 2000. The TB
case notification rate (new cases reported) more than doubled from 31.9/100,000 (1990) to 66.9/100,000
(2000). TB mortality rates almost tripled from 8.1/100,000 (1990) to 22.2/100,000 (2000). During the
same period, new TB cases in the EU countries dropped from 21.3/100,000 in 1990 to 19.6/100,000 in
2000. Irregular drug supply and lack of direct observation of treatment led to massive drug resistance,
with half of all patients found resistant to at least one drug and multi-resistance (resistance to isoniazid
and rifampicin) present in 10-15% of new cases. Roughly 30 percent of all TB patients in Ukraine were in
the prison system and in the pre-detention centers (SIZOs) in over-crowded conditions, with malnutrition,
poor diagnosis and lack of drugs. At the start of project preparation in 1999, TB prevalence in the prison
system was at very high levels (7%), with 14,000 TB patients of the roughly 200,000 prisoners in
Ukraine, whereas it was at 1.7% only 5 years earlier. In comparison, TB prevalence in the regular
population was twenty times lower, at 226.8/100,000, although this figure was also high.

The TB situation was worsened by the growing epidemic of HIV/AIDS. Thirty percent of adults
diagnosed with AIDS and 50 percent of those who died of AIDS had TB. Indeed, HIV infection was a
major factor which contributed to the development of active TB particularly among the latent AIDS
patients.

HIV/AIDS: The first HIV/AIDS case was diagnosed in 1987, but by end 2001, there were 43,600 HIV
cases officially registered, with 2,907 adults and children diagnosed with AIDS and 1,474 persons who
died of AIDS. The most dramatic increase in new HIV cases occurred in 1995 when the total number of
registered cases increased to 1,490 from 31 in 1994 after which it began to increase rapidly with 5,400
new cases reported in 1996 and 8,913 new cases reported in 1997. The same trend was seen in the prison
system and by 1999 a total of 4,300 HIV-infected prisoners registered. While the total officially registered
cases in the general and prison population were roughly 35,000 by 1999, the UNAIDS estimate (end-
1999) claimed that 240,000 people were HIV positive which made Ukraine the worst HIV affected
country in the Europe and Central Asia Region, almost twice as high as Russia with 130,000 estimated
cases.

The most affected regions in Ukraine were those in the South-Eastern regions (Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk,
Odessa, Nikolaev and the Crimea Republic.) These regions were also those with the highest estimated
number of intravenous drug users (IDUs) in Ukraine. In fact, the HIV epidemic was primarily
concentrated among IDUs after 1995. According to Government statistics, the estimated proportion of
HIV infections caused by IDUs was 83.6% in 1997 and decreased to 56.5% in 2001 and to 48.1% by

                                                     2
2003 of total infections while the percentage of heterosexually transmitted infections grew from 11.3%
(1997) to 26.9% (2001). This trend was consistent with the growing rate of sexually transmitted
infections (STIs). The possibility of acquiring HIV as well as infecting a sexual partner was 5-10 higher
for those suffering from an STI. The incidence of syphilis had increased from 10/100,000 in 1990 to
118/100,000 by 1995 and by 2000, 45,245 Ukranians were registered as having contracted syphilis for the
first time. Also, from 1998 to 2000, the rate of increase of HIV among persons with STIs increased by
35% which indicated an increased role played by heterosexual channel in HIV transmission. This was
also evidenced by an increase in women's share among the overall number of recorded HIV positive
cases, from 27% (1997) to 37% (2000). The percentage of mother-to-child transmission infections also
grew from 2.2% (1997) to 13.1% (2001). It must be noted that in 1998, Ukraine amended its 1991 Law
On AIDS Control and Social Protection by abolishing mandatory HIV testing for IDUs, commercial sex
workers (CSWs) and other special groups, which may explain the significant decrease in the overall
amount of testing of IDUs starting in 1998 and the overall decrease in the number of HIV cases among
IDUs, as shown in Figure 1 below.

             Figure 1: Number of HIV Infections in Ukraine by modes of transmission




                   HIV/AIDS Surveillance in Ukraine (1987-2000): National AIDS Center.

As of January 2001, the Ministry of Health data reflected that 75,489 persons were drug users (although
the real figure was likely several times higher) while the estimated percentage of IDUs was roughly 80%
of that figure. The HIV prevalence among IDUs varied greatly by region (18%-64%), as evidenced by
the results of the 2000 sentinel survey among IDUs in 6 major cities in Ukraine. Prevalence among
commercial sex workers (CSWs) was estimated to range from 2.5% to 10% (1998 and 1999 sentinel
surveys) with 13% among CSWs offering services along the highways in Ukraine, thus providing a
"bridge" of HIV transmission into the general population. The age distribution of the HIV/AID epidemic
was 18% in the 0-14 age group, 18% in 15-24 age group and 62% in the 25-29 age group. According to
the 1997 sociological survey of the youth in Ukraine, roughly 10% of young age 15-28 had 3 to 5 partners
in the previous year of whom 3% (age group 21-24) had over 10 partners. The National survey in 1999
showed that 43% of young people had sex with more than one partner (2-5 partners) and that those with
multiple partners during the previous 3 months faced the greatest risk of HIV infection. Compounding
these risky behaviors was the low awareness and understanding of how HIV was transmitted. In 2004,
the results of a behavioral survey showed that only 14% of young people correctly identified the methods
of preventing HIV/AIDS transmission. This figure was 21% for IDUs, 23% for military personnel, and
39% for prisoners. In sum, Ukraine was a fertile ground for a rapid spread of HIV.

Government Response: Against the background presented above, the TB control was clearly not
effective, and the threat of a generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic in Ukraine appeared imminent by
1999/2000 when the Government of Ukraine began to work with the World Bank on the preparation of
the TB and HIV/AIDS Control Project.

                                                   3
With respect to TB, in May 2000, a Presidential Decree was issued "On Urgent Measures for TB Control"
and US$5 million was allocated for centralized procurement of TB drugs. Also a draft of the National TB
Program was under preparation and the then Minister of Health (1999-2000) was proposing to introduce
the WHO recommended Directly Observed Treatment, Short-Course (DOTS) as a proven cost-effective
strategy being used in more than 110 countries in the world at that time. The five elements of the strategy
were the need to (i) ensure political commitment to strengthen TB control; (ii) introduce lower cost and
more efficient approaches to TB diagnosis, with the sputum smear microscopy used as the primary
diagnostic tool, supplemented by chest x-ray if necessary; (iii) introduce directly observed treatment; (iv)
introduce centralized procurement of anti-TB drugs; and (v) introduce standardized case definitions and
indicators. Indeed, by early 2000, there was commitment at the highest levels of Government to DOTS,
including from Parliament, MOH and the SDP as well as other Ministries. The Department of Socially
Dangerous Diseases was established in the MOH in 1999 in order to strengthen the response to TB as
well as to HIV/AIDS. Despite this broad interest and commitment, there remained considerable
resistance to DOTS from the TB Institute and from medical practitioners in Ukraine as well as other
vested interest groups. Also, the new MOH minister in mid-2000 was resistant to DOTS. In the end, the
Government adopted a National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) for 2002-2005 which did not use or refer to
DOTS and it was sufficiently clear that the full DOTS strategy was not entirely accepted. Indeed, as the
Project Appraisal Document for the Bank-financed project pointed out, DOTS was perceived as a strategy
for low-income countries and this alienated some important stakeholders. Nonetheless, the Government's
2002-2005 strategy was named the National TB Strategy Adapted to World Standard and it did
incorporate some DOTS principles. For example, in line with the new strategy, regular drug supply was
re-introduced and financed under the 2002-2005 program with increased emphasis on direct observation
of drug intake. Also, the MOH issued an Order on February 6, 2002 to develop TB bacteriological
diagnostic capacity and to increase focus on case detection through sputum microscopy. Unfortunately,
no budget was provided for this task.

Government response to the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1991 with Ukraine adopting a Law on
AIDS Control and Social Protection (subsequently amended in 1998). In 1992, the National AIDS Center
was established on the basis of the Institute of Epidemiology and the first program on HIV/AIDS in
Ukraine, 1992-1994, was adopted. As the epidemic progressed, two additional programs were supported
by Government, 1995-1997 Program and 1999-2000 AIDS and Drug Use Program for Ukraine which
defined prevention measures, implementation tools and responsible institutions. Also, in August 1999,
the National Coordination Council for AIDS was formed under the leadership of the Vice-Prime Minister
including representatives of all major relevant ministries to carry out strategic planning with support from
UNAIDS and other donor agencies. Finally, by early 2001, Ukraine was implementing its fourth
National HIV/AIDS Program on Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV, 2001-2003. In
2003, Ukraine submitted to UNAIDS its first report for the monitoring of progress against the Declaration
of Commitment adopted at the 2001 UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV and AIDS
(UNGASS). These were important steps taken but the overall response as well as budgetary allocations
were still limited. In fact, the first four HIV/AIDS Programs were severely underfunded which meant that
no serious efforts could be taken at the local level to stem the tide of the epidemic.

Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement: In 1999, the Bank began the
process of close collaboration with the Government of Ukraine on the preparation of the TB and
HIV/AIDS Control Project to be financed by a Bank loan of US$60 million. The Bank was well-placed
to support this operation given its extensive involvement world-wide in HIV/AIDS issues and given the
urgent needs in Ukraine in this area. The project was an integral part of the FY2001-2003 Country
Assistance Strategy for Ukraine focused on a broad-based poverty reduction strategy with an emphasis on
helping civil society to increase its voice for better government and social service provision in globally
sensitive areas.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The PDO was to reduce tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality through an effective
National Strategy for TB Adapted to World Standard, and an HIV/AIDS Program largely focused on
prevention of transmission of the disease among high-risk groups.

An extensive list of indicators was included in Annex 1 of the PAD. The indicators were divided between
those measuring success of interventions among the general population and in the prison setting. There
were 7 outcome indicators for TB and 4 outcome indicators for HIV/AIDS, as well as 17 output indicators
for TB and 17 HIV/AIDS indicators although in many cases they were duplicative. These indicators
focused on changes in prevalence, incidence, mortality, success and coverage of prevention and treatment
programs, behavior changes, as well as on institutional development and response capacity to the
epidemic. It should be noted that the PAD text (page 2) had an entirely different set of HIV/AIDS
outcome indicators than those in Annex 1 of the PAD. Also, importantly, the Supplemental Letter No. 2
to the Loan Agreement, dated April 15, 2003, which lists the officially agreed Monitoring and Evaluation
Indicators, did not include any outcome indicators for the project. Only an extensive list of output
indicators was attached (copy from the PAD Annex 1). No reason could be found by the ICR author for
this important omission.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

The PDO was not revised. However, in February 2006, during the Mid-term Review of the project,
additional indicators were added while other indicators were reworded and some others deleted entirely in
order to better and more appropriately capture critical data on HIV and TB. Regretfully, the M&E for the
project was persistently one of the weakest areas and no complete set of indicators was ever produced
with updated information. Therefore, the ICR team collected extensive data on baselines, targets and
actual achievements, working with Government counterparts as well as with international agencies.
Special thanks must be extended to WHO, MOH, the National AIDS Center and the TB Institute for their
valuable clarifications regarding TB and HIV/AIDS indicators. The ICR team also compiled additional
indicators to contribute to a more complete picture of the epidemics and what the project contributed.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries:

Project beneficiaries were to include: (a) high-risk groups who would benefit from targeted interventions
under the project. These groups include commercial sex workers (CSW) and their clients, men who have
sex with men (MSM); (b) persons living with HIV/AIDS who would benefit from better access to
treatment, care and support interventions under the project; and (c) the entire population in Ukraine who
would benefit from interventions aimed at the general community from reduced HIV transmission from
the high-risk groups. In addition, all stakeholders of the TB system, TB patients as well as the entire
Ukranian population were to benefit from the project as a result of planned improvements in diagnostics,
treatment and monitoring of TB.

1.5 Original Components

The project had three components, totaling an estimated US$77 million, of which the Bank was to finance
US$60 million and the Government was to contribute US$17 million, as follows:

Component 1: Control of Tuberculosis  MOH (total estimated cost US$28.7 million). This
component was to assist the MOH control the expanding epidemics of TB and MDR TB and upgrade the
country's capabilities in these areas. It was to provide the MOH with the means to implement its National

                                                   5
TB Strategy Adapted to World Standard and to strengthen the government's capacity both at the central
level (MOH, Institute of Phthisiology and Pulmonology, and the National Reference Laboratory) and in
the country's 27 regions. This component included 5 sub-components, as follows:

    (i) Training and Education (US2.6 million). This sub-component was to be implemented by the
          Institute of Phthisiology and Pulmonology in Kiev, supported by 12 regional centers. Activities
          would include the training of TB specialists, laboratory technicians, GPs, epidemiologists,
          statisticians and nurses in the detection and treatment of TB as well as in the proper monitoring
          and supervision of treatment and outcomes. It was to finance training of trainers, vehicles,
          computer and office equipment, materials, per diem and travel expenses.
    (ii) Diagnosis (US$11.5 million). This sub-component was to finance the development of technical
          guidelines, the purchase of vehicles, computer, office and laboratory equipment, including
          microscopes and supplies to undertake smear microscopy, and equipment for culture investigation
          at the regional levels. National Reference Laboratory was to be strengthened to implement
          laboratory quality control and investigations, including culture and drug susceptibility tests.
    (iii) Treatment (US$10.2 million). This sub-component was to be finance first-line drugs for TB.
          Financing was to be done mostly by Government with US$7.6 million; however, US$2.6 was
          included for Bank financing of drugs in case of additional need.
    (iv) Public Awareness Campaign (US$1.1 million). This sub-component was to finance mass
          media public awareness campaigns and training and educational materials to raise awareness of
          TB in the general population.
    (v) Monitoring and Evaluation (US$3.2 million). This sub-component was to finance monitoring
          of compliance with treatment protocols as well as baseline studies, collection and analysis of data
          to monitor key project indicators. Financing for project management was included as well.

Component 2: AIDS Control  MOH (total estimated cost US$32.2 million). This component was to
support the following three objectives of the Ukraine's Program of HIV/AIDS Prevention adopted on July
11, 2000: (i) to stabilize the epidemiological situation in the country; (ii) to reduce risky behavior among
young people; and (iii) to reduce the social tension in the society and negative consequences of the
epidemic. The highest priority and financing of this component was to be directed towards targeted
interventions to prevent the further transmission of HIV. This component included four sub-components
as follows:

    (i) HIV Prevention (US$22.9 million). This sub-component was to finance harm reduction
          programs among IDUs, CSWs, and MSM including training, advocacy, education materials, peer
          education programs, vehicles, syringes, condoms and supplies, and dissemination of protocols on
          HIV prevention. The sub-component was to also finance test kits and equipment to improve
          blood safety and the preparation and distribution of guidelines on the rational use of blood. A
          public awareness campaign was also included to increase information of the general population
          about HIV prevention, encourage the use of protective measures, and reduce stigma.
    (ii) Treatment activities (US$3.8 million). This sub-component was to support the development of
          treatment protocols, prevention of MTCT, drugs and supplies for the treatment of opportunistic
          infections, training of staff on psycho-social care and support of PLWHA, and laboratory
          equipment.
    (iii) Care and Support for PLWHA (US$2.3 million). This sub-component would increase access
          to services to improve the quality of life of PLWHA. This would be accomplished through the
          training of psychologists, social workers, welfare workers and GPs, the review and revision of
          curricula for physicians, nurses and other health workers, the establishment of self-help group of
          PLWHA and their families, the piloting of non-hospital-based care alternatives, the printing of
          training and education materials.


                                                     6
    (iv) Strengthening national capacity (US$3.2 million). This sub-component was to help the
         National and Regional AIDS Centers to carry out their mandates: (a) to help integrate HIV/AIDS,
         narcology and STI services with the primary health care system through the training of GPs and
         nurses, the provision of vehicles, medical and office equipment; (b) to establish mechanisms to
         enhance cooperation between government entities and NGOs in the delivery of harm reduction
         services; and (c) to evaluate best practices of pilot programs for possible replication.

Component 3: Prisons Department (total estimated cost US$12.7 million). This component included
the financing for TB and HIV/AIDS control activities in the prison system.

    (i) TB sub-component (US$9.2 million)  This sub-component was to improve the organization,
         diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of TB through the provision of training of physicians and
         other health workers, the upgrading of laboratory equipment, training and educational materials,
         computer and office equipment and monitoring of treatment results. Treatment protocols would
         adhere to WHO DOTS Plus strategy used when there are significant levels of MDR TB. This sub-
         component was to finance 1st and 2nd line drugs for TB with financing of US$3.2 million by SDP;
         however, US$3 million was included for Bank financing of drugs in case of additional need.
    (ii) AIDS sub-component (US$3.5 million)  This sub-component was to improve HIV prevention
         among prison inmates by (a) expanding current prevention programs, including the financing of
         information, education and communication materials, condoms and bleach disinfectants
         (representing the majority of financing under this sub-component), laboratory equipment and
         supplies; (b) preventing mother-to-child transmission; and (c) financing treatment of children
         under three years to born to mothers in the prison setting.

The project was also to finance project staff at the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in the areas of
procurement, disbursement, financial management, monitoring and evaluation, audit services as well as
technical specialists. The costs for these activities were subsumed under the two MOH components.

1.6 Revised Components

The project was never formally revised or restructured in terms of component scope or activities. The
original goals and intended investments remained highly relevant throughout implementation.
Unfortunately, because of the major implementation challenges faced by the project (discussed in detail
below), few of the originally intended activities were implemented. The project was unsatisfactory for
almost 4.5 years of its 5.5 year implementation period, with US$16.65 million of the original US$60
million formally cancelled during the last year of implementation. During the project period, many
changes were continuously made in the approach to implementation in the hope of improving the final
outcome. Project implementation and procurement plans were entirely revised on numerous occasions (a
lengthy process in itself). The revisions were mostly related to re-packaging of contracts, and later, to the
inclusion of UN agencies as procurement agents for various project activities.

In terms of project activities and their costs, the original estimates and Loan Agreement allocations turned
out to be dramatically different in the end. Sixty-five percent of the remaining loan amount (US$43.5
million-after partial cancelation) was spent during the last two project years on procurements through
UNICEF (US$26.5 million) for drugs for opportunistic infections for HIV/AIDS patients, supplies, test
kits, and reagents, and through UNFPA (US$1.7 million) for condoms, syringes, disinfectants and
information materials. While the original project included these items, the estimated amounts allocated to
them were dramatically different. For example, the original estimate for drugs for opportunistic
infections was initially only US$2 million while US$24 million were spent at the end. In this particular
case, agreement was made to finance the entire two years-worth of drugs required by MOH which were
not included in the MOH budget for 2008 and 2009. This decision was agreed on with Government in

                                                     7
2007 as a way to utilize loan funds in a more expeditious way and to provide assistance in these critical
areas. Unfortunately, some of the most important activities under the project were not carried out at all,
i.e. the information campaigns on TB and HIV/AIDS (only pilots were carried out), and the critical
prevention activities which were to be targeted on high-risk groups through regional AIDS Centers and
NGOs. Likewise, none of the treatment and care activities were carried out at all. Also, regrettably, the
TB laboratory equipment procurement was never completed as planned, with only a fraction provided
under the project, mostly for 1st level TB laboratories. Activities financed under the Prisons Component
were roughly 50% implemented as compared to the original plan (mostly for TB activities); which is
better than was the case with MOH implemented components but still insufficient in terms of achieving
agreed objectives. In sum, while components were not revised in their essence, the relative allocations for
completed activities were dramatically different from the original. See Annex 2 for a complete listing of
activities financed under the project.

1.7 Other significant changes

Shortly after the project's approval on December 19, 2002, the funding environment for HIV/AIDS and
TB prevention and treatment significantly changed. From January-March 2003, The Global Fund to
Fight HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria (GF) signed agreements with the recipients of Round 1 grant for
HIV/AIDS totaling US$99.12 million for a period of 5 years. The three Principal Recipients (PRs) were
the Ministry of Health (responsible for roughly 70% of the grant with the goal to implement treatment,
care and support of HIV/AIDS patients), the UNDP (in charge of 10% of the grant focused on targeted
prevention programs), and a Government fund  The Ukranian Fund to Fight HIV Infection and AIDS
(responsible for 20% of the grant focused on information/education campaigns [IEC] for the general
population). Unfortunately, in January 2004, the GF suspended this grant with all three PRs due to
significant concerns about slow implementation and ineffective management of the program. The GF
noted that an appropriate level of governance could not occur if the original implementation structure was
maintained. Therefore, in March 2004, the GF entered into a new agreement with the International
HIV/AIDS Alliance (Alliance) under which the Alliance agreed to provide stewardship and management
services for activities under the three suspended grant programs. The new agreement had four
components, (i) treatment, care and support (57%), (ii) targeted prevention (15%), (iii) IEC (12%), and
(iv) surveillance and evaluation (3%). The remaining 11% were earmarked for the PR unit to manage the
grant execution. The approval of the GF grant was a major contribution to the national AIDS response in
Ukraine, and together with the Government efforts and the Bank-financed project and a number of other
donor-supported projects, this was to ensure a comprehensive response.

As a result of the infusion of the GF grant for treatment, a decision was made in early 2004 that the Bank-
financed project would not provide anti-retrovirals (ARVs) for MTCT, as previously planned, in order to
avoid duplication with the GF. Another inadvertent change was made with respect to the HIV/AIDS
prevention programs planned under the project. The original plan was for the project's HIV/AIDS
component to mainly finance prevention programs targeted on high-risk groups. Indeed, the design of the
GF Round 1 grant proposal assumed that the Bank-financed project would finance these programs while
the GF grant would cover the provision of treatment, among other activities. Unfortunately, these
preventions programs were never initiated under the Bank-financed project, and after 2006, they were
never actively pursued again. Due to this failure, the GF realigned its first grant with increased focus on
prevention to the extent possible. In addition, the GF approved a second HIV/AIDS grant under Round 6
in August 2007 for Phase 1 totaling US$29.65 million until July 2009, which was to cover 22% of the
country's prevention needs and 22% of its treatment, care and support needs. The grant was implemented
through two PRs, the Alliance and the All-Ukranian Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS
(Network) and more than 150 national, regional and local NGOs served as sub-recipients under the grant.
In was suggested by some Government officials that the MOH may not have focused on the prevention
measures within the Bank-financed project because the GF was providing these programs for free. Also,

                                                    8
the GF set-up was based on well-funded and functioning mechanisms outside the Government structure
which the Bank-financed project could not replicate.

Other changes to the project during implementation included the following Amendments and Closing
Date extensions:
   1. Amendment dated November 7, 2005 reallocated funds across different disbursement categories
        in Schedule 1 of the LA and changed several provisions in Schedule 4 regarding procurement
        processes, resulting in more flexible procurement methods, ensuring consistency with new Bank
        guidelines from May 2004, allowing UN agencies to act as procurement agents, allowing NGOs
        to be contracted as service providers, and allowing SDP to use its own procurement system for
        contacts under US$300,000 each. This amendment allowed for a number of large contracts to be
        signed (i) with UNPFA for the provision of harm reduction services, condoms, syringes and
        needles and monitoring services; and (ii) with UNICEF for the provision of drugs for
        opportunistic infections, test kits, reagents and supplies. This was also critical for SDP to
        disassociate itself from the PIU in MOH in terms of procurement procedures which were
        continuously delayed. At the same time, a separate Special Account was also provided to SDP so
        that SDP could manage their share of the loan independently from the MOH PIU.
   2. 1st Closing Date extension. In June 2007, an extension of the loan Closing Date from June 30,
        2007 to December 30, 2008 was approved by the Bank in order to complete the implementation
        of signed contracts with UN agencies and to provide an opportunity to the Government to use
        remaining loan funds for budget support outcome-based financing as an alternative to the
        transaction-based implementation which was not working effectively.
   3. Amendment dated May 20, 2008 canceled US$12.5 million from the Loan and reallocated funds
        between expenditure categories. It was agreed with Government that these funds could not be
        used by December 30, 2008 (revised Closing Date) and that the cancellation would save Ukraine
        from paying unnecessary commitment fees on the undisbursed loan funds.
   4. 2nd Closing Date extension was granted to provide additional 4 months, from December 30, 2008
        to April 30, 2009, to support the finalization of delivery against three contracts with UNICEF for
        the provision of drugs for opportunistic infections, supplies, test kits and reagents. The extension
        was accompanied by a second partial cancellation of the remaining loan funds (US$4.15 million)
        which would not be utilized by the revised Closing Date. Prior to December 2008, the MOH and
        SDP teams tried their best to finalize some additional contracts to be implemented prior to
        December 30, 2008. However, despite valiant efforts, their attempt failed due to time pressures
        and inability of contractors to deliver goods and services by December 31, 2008. A reallocation
        of funds among loan expenditure categories was also made to reflect the above changes.
   5. 3rd extension of the Closing Date was provided, from April 30, 2009 to June 30, 2009 to allow for
        additional time to complete the delivery against the UNICEF contracts to the delays on the Bank
        side in processing payments to UNICEF.
   6. 4th and final extension of the Closing Date was provided retroactively, on August 3, 2009 until
        September 30, 2009, after the project officially closed on June 30, 2009, because some drugs
        were not delivered and some reagents provided by UNICEF turned out to be non-compliant with
        contract provisions and had to be returned and new reagents re-supplied.

    Lastly, it is critical to note the three important changes made as a result of the Suspension of
    Disbursements under the Loan between April 10, 2006 until November 22, 2006 due to non-
    compliance by Government with the Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement (commitment to project
    objectives) and Section 6.02(c) of the General Conditions (dated May 30, 1995). Three issues which
    required Government action by April 10, 2006 were not met by Government by that date. These were
    outlined in the March 6, 2006 letter from the Bank Country Director: (i) endorsement by Government
    of the National TB Control training modules prior to the commencement of training (the actual

                                                     9
   suspension letter, dated April 10, 2006 referred to this issue differently as "Adoption of the new
   National TB Control Strategy"); (ii) acceptance on using UN agencies for several agreed assignments
   in order to accelerate implementation; and (iii) a plan to ensure integration of the PIU into the MOH
   structure and the creation of a "sector" in the MOH solely responsible for the management of the
   project. These conditions were finally met in November 2006, all of which were issues under
   prolonged and arduous discussions for many years prior.

       (i)     The acceptance of the new TB Program in line with international best practice, and
               endorsed by WHO, was a crucial transition away from the traditional Soviet approach to
               TB diagnosis, treatment and monitoring. Unfortunately, this change required the
               suspension of the project to happen and took more than 6 years in reviews and
               discussions which began in 1999 and lasted on and off until 2006. As mentioned earlier,
               when the Bank approved the project, the understanding by the Bank was that the national
               TB Program was generally in line with international standards and that the Government
               was moving in the direction of DOTS albeit not explicitly. It was only in mid-2005 when
               the Bank reviewed the draft TB reporting and recording forms, training modules and the
               draft TB concept note (by WHO TB specialist), it became clear that the existing TB
               approaches proposed by the TB Institute for financing under the loan were not compliant
               with international standards and needed to be revised.
       (ii)    The agreement to use UN agencies allowed for several contracts with UN agencies to be
               signed (although to the exclusion of an important contract for laboratory equipment by
               IAPSO, and for the information campaign for which a contract with UNICEF took a year
               to agree on and which was eventually not done because there was no time left until the
               final closing date of the project).
       (iii)   The integration of the PIU into the MOH structure which essentially meant the creation
               of the "sector" in MOH responsible for project implementation was actually previously a
               Board presentation condition of the project. This condition was never officially met in
               2002 prior to the Board date, and remained a sore point and weakness in project
               management arrangements on the MOH side about which the MOH was continuously
               reminded of in Bank mission Aide-memoires and letters. Unfortunately, by the time this
               "sector" was formed into the work of the Ministry, the impact on the implementation of
               the project was minimal because only a short time remained in the project. However, this
               change was an important recognition of the need to have dedicated staff in the MOH
               responsible for HIV/AIDS international project. This decision also coincided with the
               decision to create in 2007 a larger unit in the MOH (HIV/AIDS Council with 23 staff
               positions) which is slowly expanding its role and responsibilities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Complex/long project preparation: This project was prepared over a 3 year period under the
leadership of Vice Prime Minister M. Zhulynsky, the Ministers of Health R. Bogatyreva and V.
Moskalenko and the Head of the State Prisons Department, V. Liovochkin, as well as with support from
three Bank task team leaders and other Bank staff as well as multiple consultants. The first
identification mission took place in September 1999 and the project was finally presented to the Board
on December 19, 2002.

The preparation of the project was financed by a PHRD grant of US$416,915 signed on October 31, 2000
which took 2.5 years to disburse US$294,502 (most of which was disbursed in the last 8 months). The
PHRD grant was extended twice. It financed the set-up of the Project Preparation Unit (PPU) in the

                                                  10
MOH, the initial work of several PPU staff and consultants in preparing and costing various parts of the
project, seminars on TB and HIV/AIDS strategies, assessments of TB and HIV/AIDS control needs and
revision of national TB and HIV/AIDS programs, a social assessment to develop a monitoring/evaluation
program of prevention activities, an economic and financial analysis, detailed implementation
arrangements and responsibilities at the local levels, and the preparation of the necessary project
documents such as the Project Operational Manual, which was a condition of Loan Effectiveness. The
PHRD grant was instrumental in providing the necessary funding for project preparation although its
implementation was heavily delayed and highlighted weaknesses in the ability of MOH to manage
international projects as well as the slew of bureaucratic hurdles that plague each investment operation.1
Several letters from Bank management were sent to the Vice-Prime Minister complaining about the slow
progress against agreed actions and the weak capacity of staff.

The long preparation period was also mainly due to the fact it took time to arrive at a consensus on the
project design. A number of changes to the initial design were continually proposed, including in
substance but also in implementation arrangements. Most notably, at least 3 sets of changes were made in
the TB component alone. At first, in 1999, the project design envisioned supporting the introduction of
the WHO endorsed DOTS strategy, with full agreement by the MOH Minister. However, when the new
Minister was appointed in early 2000, DOTS was declared ineffective and not appropriate for Ukraine
and the Minister (with backing from the Head of the TB Institute) refused to support the TB component
based on the DOTS principle. The Bank even considered whether to drop the TB component entirely or
only to support TB in the Prisons Department which supported DOTS. Open opposition to DOTS from
the MOH and the TB Institute continued, and in mid 2001, the Bank decided to "scale down" the previous
design of the component and support "less controversial activities." The idea became to use the results of
TB pilots in Kiev and Donetsk, financed by USAID and the EC, and build capacity and consensus around
DOTS slowly while supporting full introduction of DOTS in the prison system. In the end, the Bank
agreed to support the National TB Strategy Adapted to World Standard (2002-2005 TB Strategy) which
the Government claimed was in line with the DOTS principle. Likewise, as time went on, the HIV/AIDS
component kept growing; the treatment sub-component, opportunistic infection drugs, blood safety
activities, and equipment for AIDS centers were included, and the National and Regional AIDS Centers
were to manage prevention programs, previously expected to be contracted out directly to NGOs through
an overseeing committee. This last agreement took roughly 2 years to finalize.

Project design: The overall objectives of the project were broad but consistent with the sector issues
identified, i.e. the need to urgently address the growing epidemics of TB and HIV/AIDS in Ukraine.
However, it must be noted that the PDOs of reducing morbidity and mortality were likely unrealistic for
the project time-frame given that changes in these indicators take a long time to materialize and because
the project was not meant to finance a significant amount of treatment which could impact TB and AIDS
mortality in a substantial way. In fact, these objectives were more reflective of the entire national and
international efforts, not just of the project, although at the time of project preparation, the main financier
of ARVs for AIDS patients in Ukraine (Global Fund) was not yet operational. In terms of design, the
PAD presented an all-encompassing approach to expand the TB and HIV/AIDS response by Government.
This was clearly a high priority, timely and an ambitious undertaking to address this critical area. While
the design was technically sound and based on global knowledge and know-how, it was a highly complex
and challenging operation, particularly for a first project in the health sector in Ukraine, with counterparts
who had limited/ no previous operational experience in Bank-financed projects.
Importantly, the design of the TB component was contentious and underwent several changes, as
described above. Moreover, as it became evident during implementation, the final design of the

  The length of preparation of investment operations in the period of 1999-2006 in Ukraine was on average 28 months as
compared with 15-16 months for Bank-wide and ECA region. (IEG Ukraine Country Assistance Evaluation, Sept. 2007).


                                                         11
component was actually not entirely resolved at preparation despite statements in the PAD to the contrary.
While the TB component was described in the PAD as supporting elements critical for the WHO
recommended DOTS approach (case detection through sputum microscopy and administration of
treatment regimens under direct observation -two key elements of DOTS), in reality, the National TB
Strategy in Ukraine included only some elements of DOTS but retained all the traditional elements of TB
control firmly in place for decades, as supported by the TB Institute, i.e. the Soviet-based model of TB
diagnosis and treatment, heavily reliant on x-ray diagnosis and long hospitalizations. The Government
agreed that it would consider the introduction of DOTS on the basis of the future results of project-
financed pilots. This was unfortunate because results of the Donetsk TB pilot implemented by WHO in
2001-2002 were already available at the time of preparation. In fact, the reluctance to move in the
direction of DOTS by the TB authorities in Ukraine remained much the same during both the preparation
and most of the project implementation period.

In terms of the HIV/AIDS component, a major part of the costs were prevention programs which were to
be contracted out to NGOs by the National AIDS Center and the Regional AIDS Centers. However,
while the PAD describes the general set-up and arrangements as to how this would work, there did not
seem to be real commitment by Government to use NGOs. Nor was any agreement to use NGOs
recorded in the project legal documents. Importantly, as it became evident later on, practical contractual
arrangements (service contracts with NGOs) were not worked out either. Therefore, this crucial
component was left to be sorted out during implementation and unfortunately none of the prevention
programs ever materialized precisely because no clear legally binding arrangement was agreed upon.

Lessons taken into account: Prior to the preparation of this project, there was an earlier attempt to
prepare a health project. The failure of that attempt highlighted the importance of early engagement of
relevant Government agencies in the preparation process (rather than the Bank driven approach) and for
continued consensus building and monitoring of political support during preparation and implementation.
At the preparation stage of this project, overall Government acceptance of the need to combat the growing
threat of TB and HIV/AIDS was apparent. The Minister of Health was broadly supportive and Working
Groups were formed to provide inputs to project design, together with the PIU, in order to improve
project ownership and participation. However, it is not clear whether broad multi-sectoral consensus and
ownership was indeed present at all Government levels to these issues, including the commitment to
reduce stigma and associated discrimination so prevalent in Ukraine. Indeed, the need to set up and
maintain a multi-sectoral comprehensive response is one of the central lessons of successful HIV/AIDS
projects. It does not appear from project documents that this lesson was taken on board as there is no
mention of other Government agencies aside from the two main agencies (MOH and SDP).

Other lessons from world-wide experience were incorporated into project design, including the need to
focus on prevention, particularly in high-risk groups, the need to have effective training of health workers,
the need to include care and support measures for PLWHA, the critical importance of monitoring and
evaluation, public awareness campaigns, the need to have effective surveillance systems to ensure
treatment compliance outside the prison system once the TB-infected inmate is released. However, in
order to implement these activities, one needed strong capacity, a legal base which allows for the
implementation of these measures, dedicated increased resources, and practical implementation
arrangements to really expand prevention measures, diagnosis and treatment. These central lessons from
the implementation of TB and HIV/AIDS projects across the world were not discussed explicitly in
project documents and no funds were provided under the project to improve project implementation
capacity at the local government levels where most of the day-to-day implementation was to take place.
Instead, it was assumed that this capacity was either available or would somehow emerge during
implementation, and that detailed implementation arrangements would be established.

A critical lesson which was included in the project was the need for the MOH and the SDP to establish
separate "sectors" of full-time staff who would be responsible for the overall coordination of the project.
Unfortunately, while this was a project Board presentation condition, it was not met prior to the
distribution of the project Board package on November 22, 2002. On November 15, 2002, the Bank team
received a letter from the Ministry of Health indicating that the establishment of the "sector" would be
raised at a Government Committee on Social, Scientific and Technical Humanitarian Development on
November 18, 2002. The MOH promised to establish the sector by December 18, 2002, 1 day prior to the
Board date. Unfortunately, the sector was never established and the Board approved the project without
this condition having been met. A separate letter was sent by the SDP saying that the "sector" would be
established by December 18, 2002 and it was although not prior to the Board distribution date.

Lastly, while the comparative effectiveness of NGOs in providing prevention programs for high-risk
groups was recognized in the PAD as an important lesson, in practical terms there appears to have been
no concrete mechanisms developed, as mentioned above, and little recognition of how challenging such
arrangements would be (this was not identified as a risk in the PAD- see section below). In fact, the
Project Operations Manual from 2002 does not have any description of how the contracting of NGOs by
the AIDS Centers was to work. This proved to be another stumbling block during the project and none of
the planned prevention measures were ever implemented. Clearly, specific arrangements for NGO
involvement should have been agreed on a priori during project preparation.

In sum, a number of critical lessons were recognized and some were included in project design but needed
strong and dedicated full-time capacity, resources and concrete implementation arrangements to work.

Risks identification and mitigation measures: This was conceived as a high risk/high potential reward
operation. The PAD identified a number of risks, with an overall High-Risk rating. Two of these risks
(lack of intersectoral cooperation and inadequate institutional capacity to implement a large complex
program) turned out to be major problems during the project while the proposed mitigating measures,
outlined in the PAD, were never put in place, as discussed below in Section 2. On the other hand, two
major challenges which had a significant impact on the slow speed of implementation, namely the change
of top leadership in the project and the highly bureaucratic environment, were not identified at all as risks
in the PAD, despite the fact that the Ukraine's political instability and entrenched bureaucratic processes
were already a well-known reality during project preparation. Lastly, the potentially challenging
implementation (use of NGOs) of arguably the most important component of the project, i.e. HIV
prevention measures for high-risk groups, was not identified as a risk at all. Overall, the assessment of
the risks by the preparation team seems to have missed several key areas which later plagued the project
throughout its implementation.

Project readiness for implementation: While overall implementation arrangements, as described in the
PAD, were logical and sensible on paper, and it seemed at the time that the project could start
implementation relatively quickly, these arrangements depended on (i) a quick project start (instead,
effectiveness took 12 months); (ii) the commitment by several Ministries to act jointly in supervising the
project as part of the proposed Supervisory Council (which was never organized in the end); (iii) the will
of individual new Ministers to support the proposed implementation arrangements (which did not
happen); and (iv) on the continuation of work by those trained specialists who prepared the project and
who were committed to its implementation (this did not materialize). Instead, as it turned out, a year
lapsed between the end of preparation and the start of implementation, and an entirely new PIU team
(whose members had no related training to implement Bank-financed projects) was selected by a new
Minister with no prior knowledge about the project.

In May 2003, the Project Quality Entry Assessment (QEA) was carried out by the Bank Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) and rated the project Quality-at-Entry as Satisfactory (overall rating of 2 out of

                                                     13
6). The QAG panel recognized the long effort made to prepare the project and many of the challenges
described above. The panel specifically noted that there were no details in project documents on the
critically important capacity building components of the project and that no resources were earmarked to
improve implementation capacity of local staff. The review concluded that the success of the operation
would depend on continued Government ownership, particularly of the TB component, and that this
operation should be considered as a first step in a longer-term reform dialogue. The same conclusion was
made by the Quality Enhancement Review (QER) panel in January 2002 although this review appears to
have been harsher in its overall assessment. The review found the PAD to be "light" on description of
implementation arrangements and that details on the "plumbing" of the project were missing. The panel
was concerned about the lack of an overall health strategy in Ukraine, no description of the overall
healthcare system in the PAD with a context for how this operation was going to be implemented, and
concluded that implementation risks were very high because of limited agreement on DOTS, generally
weak commitment to harm reduction, and little apparent interest by the Client to borrow for "soft"
components such as consultant services.

Overall Quality at Entry: Based on the issues presented above, this ICR rates the overall project quality
and readiness at entry as Unsatisfactory because although the project design was highly relevant and
critical to the needs of Ukraine, it was complex and few detailed implementation arrangements/provisions
were made for the difficulties of working in a highly bureaucratic government setting in Ukraine, with a
weak MOH department (clearly not ready to take on this complex undertaking) in a first-time
implementing agency. Given that this was the first Bank-financed health project in Ukraine, with no
previous implementation knowledge and background, the team should have made the necessary
assessments and adjustments in implementation arrangements to take these challenges into consideration.
Also, agreement on fundamental aspects of project implementation, i.e. basic approach to TB and how to
reach most vulnerable groups through prevention measures by AIDS centers working with NGOs, was
not entirely certain, contrary to project documents. Lastly, the PAD provided relatively scarce and not
sufficiently detailed information on project components and specific activities; the cost tables in the PAD
did not give adequate information on the types of activities to be provided under the general headings,
such as "laboratory equipment". Unfortunately, the ICR author could not find detailed final cost tables in
project files, and therefore, had to reconstruct these from previous tables and later procurement plans.

2.2 Implementation

This project was a problem project for 4.5 years before it closed. Most of the originally envisaged
activities were not carried out. The actual activities/achievements by the two implementing agencies are
presented in Annex 2 and also discussed in Section 3 below. There are numerous reasons for why the
project was not implemented as designed. They include both project-specific factors and those which
affect the Ukraine portfolio as a whole.

Country-wide factors: This project must be viewed within the context of the Bank's Ukraine portfolio of
investment projects which is considered to be one of the most-problematic performing portfolios among
those supported by the Bank. Generally, half or more of all investment projects in Ukraine have been
consistently problematic, and at the end of Bank Fiscal Year 2009, 7 out of 13 were problem projects. In
mid 2006, when this project was suspended, several other projects were also suspended and two were
cancelled. The Ukraine Country Assistance Evaluation by the Bank's Independent Evaluation Group
(IEG) for the period of 1999-2006 found that Ukraine's investment projects ranked lowest in the ECA
region in terms of satisfactory outcomes and was 10% lower than the Bank average. Also, the rating for
institutional development impact was among the lowest in the Bank, 22% lower than the Bank average.
Likewise, disbursement ratios for Ukraine reached only 30% of the Bank average which is the lowest
ratio for all of IBRD countries. A variety of factors have contributed to these outcomes, including:


                                                    14
            1. Considerable political instability in the country with very frequent Government leadership
               changes (including the Orange Revolution).
            2. Burdensome Government bureaucratic structures and requirements.
            3. Project-by-project ratification by Parliament leading to major effectiveness delays.
            4. Weak governance structures with corruption index at 134 on the scale of 1 to 180 (2008 CPI
               Transparency International).
            5. Generally weak coordination among Government departments/agencies, particularly important in
               multi-sectoral projects.

        Political instability (including the 2004 "Orange Revolution") was likely one of the most important
        factors that led to the failure of this project, with seven Prime Ministers since the project was prepared:

        As a result of these top level changes, there were equally frequent changes at the ministry level. The
        following table 2 presents a clear picture of the operating environment for any implementing team.

As Table 2 demonstrates, the preparation and implementation teams (PIU) worked under seven Ministers
of Health and eleven Deputy Ministers of Health directly responsible for project oversight. One PIU
director described these changes as extremely disruptive to the project because every time a new Minister
or a Deputy Minister arrived, the essence and the design of the project was put into question and
explanations needed to be provided for why this project is necessary, etc. In some cases, the PIU was
asked to include new activities which were never agreed on or to proceed with methods and procedures
which were not agreed on with the Bank. For example, one Minister did not see any use in supporting
any prevention activities at all. This varied commitment to the project by the main implementing agency
made implementation almost impossible for the PIU.

Project-specific factors: In addition to the country-wide issues which affected this project, there were
other constraints, as follows:

1. Varied ownership and commitment to the project by various Government administrations;
2. Lack of a clear mandate, capacity and budget in MOH and SDP to implement grass-roots HIV
    prevention activities (not clear devolution of responsibility to NGOs who are better suited to carry out
    such activities);
3. Lack of overall coordination/leadership. A Supervisory Council which was to provide leadership
    and oversee project implementation never became functional. The National Coordination Council for
    the Prevention of TB and on HIV/AIDS was established in 2005 but that body was not terribly
    effective at providing overall coordination and generally met to discuss issues when new funding
    sources became available. In other words, this body did not create an enabling environment for the
    implementation of this project nor of the overall Government program. This was also the finding of
    the most recent UNAIDS sponsored Comprehensive External Evaluation report.
4. Large number of vested interests in the country who perceived the project to be a threat to the
    established system (pharmaceutical manufacturers, hospital administrators, doctors, government
    officials and main health institutions);
5. Generally dysfunctional implementation arrangements where the PIU could not work effectively
    with the Ministry staff because they had no official mandate and had no clear support for their work;
    also, there was no "sector" in the MOH and no real integration of the project into the main work of
    the Ministry. These arrangements were also dysfunctional from an organization point of view. The
    original idea was that this Department for Dangerous Diseases in the MOH would be strengthened
    under the project and would work closely and jointly with the PIU on the implementation of the
    project. But, early on in 2004, a decision was made that the Deputy Minister responsible for project
    oversight would not be the same Deputy Minister in charge of that Department. In essence, this
    created a parallel and ineffective implementation structure.
6. Weak capacity of implementing agencies with little understanding of external donor financing
    arrangements/requirements;
7. Dysfunctional procurement management (discussed at length below in Section 2.4);
8. Weak overall donor coordination and lack of a multi-sectoral approach by the project;
9. Highly bureaucratic working environment: One Bank team member described the working situation
    as the "rain forest" of bureaucracy. Indeed, this has been pointed out as one of the major challenged
    faced by many teams, both at the implementing agencies and with respect to the Ministry of Finance.
    The multiple reviews, committees and signatures taxed all teams who worked on the project; and
10. Working with the Bank's complex procedures. This was a major challenge for the project teams
    throughout the implementation period, particularly during the initial period 2004-2005. The issues
    which made implementation that much more difficult with respect to the Bank are outlined in later
    sections of this report.

The following is a brief summary of implementation challenges during the three main periods.


                                                    16
Early project period: 2004-2005. It took 1 year for the project to become effective after approval on
December 19, 2002. Following a declaration of effectiveness on January 6, 2004, the preparation of a
revised procurement plan was launched as a result of the delay in effectiveness and given the fact that a
number of activities had to be revised and new procurement packaging had to be agreed on. That year,
most of the time was spent by the new PIU staff on learning about the project, getting on-the-job-training,
explaining the project to the new Deputy Minister(s), preparing and clearing sets of bureaucratic
documents, and mostly on updating procurement documentation on the basis of information from regions.
Two procurement staff of the PIU had no prior experience with Bank-financed projects. As a result,
much of the procurement documentation had to be redone several times. After 2 years of implementation,
only 2% were disbursed with marginal chances for improvement.

The challenges of this initial period were that much greater because the Bank staff under whose
leadership the project was presented to the Board was replaced by another person who remained as the
TTL for only 1 year of the project and was subsequently replaced by another TTL in mid 2005. These
changes in Bank staff, the changes in Government staff, the novelty of this project, the challenging
environment in the MOH, the inexperienced staff of the PIU, and the generally haphazard coordination
with the multiplicity of donors and international and local agencies, all negatively affected the start-up
phase of the project. It must be noted, however, that despite these challenges, some project activities
were indeed launched and work began across all components during this time, albeit with great delays.

In 2005, when the new TTL from the Bank was appointed, a Quality Enhancement Review was organized
to provide recommendations on possible ways to move forward. The QER report, dated December 8,
2005, pointed out that the project was poorly designed, with fundamental disagreements with Government
on basic aspects of the project (including approach to TB and how to reach vulnerable HIV/AIDS
populations), with constant turn-over of staff on both sides, inflexible interpretation of rules by the Bank
team, heavy Government bureaucratic procedures, and lack of real engagement with key partners working
in the same areas. The QER panel called for increased Bank supervision jointly with other partners, a
greater strategic vision and a clear agreement on activities and expected results based on which the project
could be extended. This review took place prior to the Mid-term review (MTR) by the Bank during
which a new Minister of Health declared strong opposition to the project approach, and soon thereafter
the project was suspended.

Suspension period: (2006) In order to improve project implementation, during the MTR, the Bank
recommended to make amendments in the loan agreement to (i) allow to use UN agencies as procurement
agents to speed up the procurement process; (ii) to contract NGOs to implement those activities which the
MOH and the SDP could not do as effectively; and (iii) to allow the SDP to use its own system of
procurement and FM. The Bank also requested the Government to urgently adopt a new national TB
strategy based on DOTS and to integrate the project management structure into the MOH for more
effective implementation and coordination of activities. Because of inaction with respect to these issues,
the project was suspended in April 2006 and suspension was lifted in Nov 2006 when the Government
finally met the conditions of suspension. The Government also adopted a new TB strategy at the end of
2006 (2007-2011) with an explicit mandate to shift to the DOTS approach.

Final project implementation period: (2007-2009). After the suspension was lifted, the PIU gradually
started its work, under a new project director and had to change the procurement plan and prepare
contracts with UN agencies, as agreed. Given that June 30, 2007 was the original closing date, and by
that time, only 13% of the project was disbursed, the Bank agreed to extend the project for 18 months but
only for those contracts which could be signed by June 30, 2007 (mostly for UN contracts). At the same
time, an attempt to restructure the project was made in mid-2007 (following extension of the Closing
Date) with a view to shift the focus of the operation from a traditional project execution which was clearly
not working to program execution through direct budgetary support against agreed milestones and based

                                                    17
on program results and outcomes. Disbursements were proposed to be made to the MOF Special Account
with a subsequent transfer of funds to the MOH and SDP budgets. After several rounds of discussions, in
the end, the Government of Ukraine did not agree to the proposed option citing internal bureaucratic
challenges which could not be overcome. Instead, the Government requested the Bank to continue the
project based on a revised set of activities. However, the PIU functioned for only a few months in 2008
before it was disbanded on May 1, 2008 because of MOF new regulations regarding taxes. The PIU was
re-established in September 2008 to complete project implementation which focused mainly on three
contracts with UNICEF and two contracts with UNFPA as well as on the preparation of additional
smaller contracts none of which unfortunately materialized delivery could not be carried out by the then
Closing date of December 31, 2008. Due to delays in the payment and full execution of UN contracts, the
project closing date was extended until September 30, 2009.

Agency/partner cooperation. While there were no formal co-financiers, a number of UN agencies
(WHO, USAID, UNCIEF, UNFPA) the Global Fund and other local partners were involved in this
project, either directly or cursorily. These agencies made a significant contribution to the project. For
example, UNAIDS provided assistance to MOH in 2006 to revise the project implementation plan. It also
financed a capacity assessment of MOH and PIU and helped to design and provide comments on the
planned information campaign. USAID financed consultants to review the TB control status in
2005/2006 and WHO provided advice during the project on specific issues, including comments on the
terms of reference, procurement specifications, and on TB strategy, reporting/recording forms and
modules. Other agencies were periodically called upon to review specifications, terms of reference, etc.
Last but not least, a number of these agencies were requested to act as procurement agents for the project
in order to speed up implementation. Following the suspension of the project, at the end of 2006, the
MOH sent a formal request to UNDP to nominate which UN agencies would be best suited to provide
assistance to the project in terms of procuring various sorts of equipment, drugs, supplies, and the to
implement the HIV/AIDS information campaign. Originally, WHO was to procure laboratory equipment,
IAPSO was to be responsible for drugs for opportunistic infections, and UNFPA was chosen to provide
syringes, condoms and disinfectants as well as implementing the information campaign. Also, PATH
was requested to provide training on TB. In the end, only two agencies were able to provide assistance.
UNFPA procured syringes, condoms, disinfectants, information materials and carried out monitoring of
harm reduction programs. Whereas UNICEF was not originally requested to contribute to this effort, it
ended up providing a significant contribution to the project, with the management of procurement of
US$24 million worth of drugs for opportunistic infections as well as HIV/AIDS test kits and CD4 count
reagents and supplies. Incidentally, UNICEF also provided the payment of VAT from the savings of its
drug procurement which helped MOH a great deal at the end of the project. Unfortunately, UNICEF was
unable to sign a major contract for the information campaign due to deviations from the standard Bank
contract for services. The Bank team tried to resolve this issue with UNICEF for one year and when it
was finally resolved and a contract could be signed, the project was about to close.

While these agencies were clearly involved in some way in the project, during the ICR interviews, many
representatives of these agencies claimed that they were not kept consistently informed about the project,
either by the MOH, the PIU, nor by the Bank. They did not consistently receive post-mission aide-
memoires and were not fully involved in project-related discussions nor informed about subsequent
decisions and actions by either the Bank or the Government although these decisions could have affected
their own projects. While some agencies provided important inputs into the project, as described above,
their impression was that their inputs were sporadic, not part of a big picture, and in some cases, they
were not made aware of any follow-on actions as a result of their contributions. Only towards the latter
years of the project these agencies were more systematically included in project discussions and received
appropriate documents. It must be noted, however, that the Bank team did make special efforts to bring
all agencies together to jointly review the overall HIV/AIDS and TB response on occasion. The Bank
Country Director was actually the Chair of the UN Theme Group in HIV/AIDS from 2005-2007 and tried

                                                   18
to coordinate efforts. These were positive steps by the Bank but overall cooperation, especially with
MOH and PIU, could have been more effective, as expressed by all international agencies interviewed.
The same is true for locally based agencies working on HIV/AIDS and TB issues. They consistently
mentioned during the ICR process that they were only marginally involved in the project and that
cooperation with the Government and the Bank could have been better. It must be noted that the Bank
teams also expressed some frustration about the fact that cooperation was not ideal. Indeed, most Bank
staff interviewed said that the overall UN system response was not working as effectively as needed.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design: The PAD Annex 1 lists 11 outcome indicators and 34 output indicators. For unexplained
reasons, on page 2 of the PAD, the HIV/AIDS indicators are entirely different from those in Annex 1 of
the PAD. Also, the Supplemental Letter No. 2 to the Loan Agreement only included output indicators
from Annex 1. Despite these discrepancies, it is clear that the overall intention was to measure the
success of the project both in the general population and in the prison setting with a focus on changes in
prevalence, incidence, mortality, success and coverage of prevention and treatment programs, behavior
changes, as well as on institutional development and response capacity to the epidemic. The overall
quality of the original results framework can be assessed as modest/moderate. There were many
component indicators and some were duplicative in nature, none had baselines (as was typical in pre-2004
PADs), and HIV/AIDS outcome indicators in particular missed some main standard indicators such as
AIDS cases and deaths as well as information on HIV status of ante-natal health clinic attendees and on
voluntary counseling and testing. Also, it was not clear how these were to be measured given the inherent
difficulty of collecting data from the high-risk groups targeted under this project. It must be noted that the
project's first original outcome indicators (reduce prevalence rates and incidence rates no targets were
provided) is a legitimate and appropriate long-term goal of the National HIV/AIDS program, but is not a
realistic indicator for measuring the success of a five-year operation focused on expanding prevention.
While prevention activities may lead to lower incidence rates, increased testing for HIV would only
increase prevalence rates as more people test positive for HIV. Likewise, the provision of treatment for
HIV infected persons would also increase prevalence as people would live longer. Therefore, this
indicator should be viewed in the broader context of other indicators to judge the overall status of the
epidemic.

Implementation: Following effectiveness, it took roughly four years to finally hire an M&E officer in
the PIU (end 2007) and in mid 2008 the entire PIU staff resigned. Clearly, this aspect of the project was
not a central objective of the MOH/PIU and the Bank raised this problem many times as a major
weakness of project management. In sum, practically no attention was paid to monitoring indicators
during implementation. The MOH and the PIU staff interviewed at the ICR stage said that since there
were no activities under the project, there was nothing to monitor. In February 2006, the Bank team
added 3 TB outcome and 2 TB output indicators mainly to reflect agreement on DOTS following the
adoption of the new TB strategy in 2006. HIV/AIDS indicators were also added both in 2006 (4 outcome
and 1 output) and at the ICR stage (4 outcome and 4 output indicators) to better reflect the progression of
the epidemic and behavior change among high-risk groups. Some baseline and target data were collected
at that time but others remained missing. Subsequently, it does not appear that any real monitoring took
place by either the Government nor by the Bank, and as a result, it was a major undertaking during the
ICR preparation to get the necessary data on all indicators. In fact, the entire results framework was
rationalized with many of the original indicators revised or combined with others as well as dropped. The
final total number of indicators included in the ICR Datasheet is 40 (19 outcome and 21 output). The
MOH, SDP, TB Institute, the National AIDS Center, WHO and other partners provided valuable
information during this time as well as additional data on the budgets, surveys, etc.



                                                     19
Utilization: While there was no systematic collection of data by the project team in MOH, the data is
regularly collected by Government agencies, with MOH serving an aggregating function of all data,
generating reports, evaluating the national HIV/AIDS and TB Programs and preparing the follow-on
Programs. The MOH works closely with the TB Institute, the National AIDS Center and the State
Statistical Agency. In turn, these work jointly with the network of medical facilities and TB hospitals and
Regional AIDS centers and NGOs as well as with international and local agencies. The AIDS Center
provides inputs to the UNGASS reports prepared every 2 years, carries out the by-annual behavioral
surveillance (financed by Global Fund) and 1st and 2nd generation epidemiological surveillance, works
closely with the NGO sector, and produces monthly Information Bulletin on HIV in Ukraine as well as
quarterly and annual reports. Importantly, the AIDS Center put in place in 2008 an ARV treatment
monitoring system for each patient which provides up-to-date information on treatment status. Also, a
separate Center for Monitoring and Evaluation is being formed in mid 2009 as part of the National AIDS
Center to provide information on the results of HIV interventions. Lastly, the Center and the MOH has
worked closely with UNAIDS to develop a list of national indicators for monitoring and evaluating
HIV/AIDS activities which are consistent with the UNAIDS Guidelines on Construction of Core
Indicators (UNGASS Guidelines). Likewise, the TB Institute has agreed on the framework of the
recording/reporting forms for TB with WHO. The SDP maintains its own database but works closely with
MOH, TB Institute and the AIDS Center and reports data regularly.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Procurement: In general the project was characterized by a very weak procurement capacity on the part
of the Borrower (both within MOH and specifically the PIU staff), although the individuals did have
some experience with national procurement systems, which were beset by their own problems (CPAR,
2006) and they found it very hard to adapt to and learn Bank procurement procedures. A partial solution
was found through the recruitment (as a Consultant) of an International Project Implementation Adviser
and although this individual also needed to pass through a steep learning curve, there was a clear
improvement after the individual was hired and became familiar with Bank procedures. However,
throughout project implementation, the project was dogged by a very poor quality of initial documents.
The PIU was slow to integrate Bank comments into draft documents (and procurement became
characterized by churning and a continued back and forth of Bidding documents and RFPs, evaluation
reports and draft contracts.). There were frequent changes (amendments) made to Bidding documents
which lengthened the Bidding process to unacceptable levels and MOH/PIU were extremely slow at
finalizing evaluation reports which invariably had to be revised several times prior to their clearance.

However, most concerning was the dual review process which persisted almost throughout the project.
This process meant that in addition to the usual Project-formed evaluation committee, all documents had
to be reviewed (after receiving the Bank's No Objection) by an internal MOH tender committee at several
stages in the procurement process. Effectively, the MOH tender committee was reserving the final right
of "clearance" and changes in the Bidding Documents, Evaluations and Contracts after the Bank had
provided a No Objection. In the situation where the MOH Tender Committee was rejecting or
disagreeing with Bank recommendations this inevitably led to unacceptable delays as the PIU could not
process documents that contradicted or varied from those on which a No Objection had been received, if
these item were to receive financing from the proceeds of the Loan. For example, there would be
attempts to change Contract terms as a result of a review by the MOH Legal department, or the Tender
Committee would try and change the results of an evaluation.

Because of these major problems with the procurement process, the Bank team called for an integrated
procurement and financial management review (June/July 2006) of the project which showed that the
majority of the problems in the project resulted from low capacity and weak management on the part of
the PIU rather than any intentional wrong doing. However, it was also clear that in many instances, the

                                                    20
PIU was simply constrained in trying to balance between MOH requests and those from the Bank which
inevitably caused to misunderstandings, complaints and delays.
Financial management: The financial management (FM) arrangements were continuously monitored
and reviewed during the project. The first FM supervision was done in February 2006 and FM was rated
as Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU). Bank recommended to install an automated accounting system, to
start the procedure of regular reconciliation of accounting records, to update the outdated POM, as well as
to proceed with the process of auditor selection. The capacity of FM staff was low. Subsequently, a
Special Integrated Review of the project was carried out in June 2006 due to some questions from media
regarding possible impropriety in the project. The review covered procurement, goods/services receipt,
payment, accounting, reporting, and loan withdrawal application processes of 75% of all contracts
awarded until May 31st, 2006. The review noted a number of weaknesses in internal controls and
procedures of the PIU and the MOH, however, no instances of misuse of funds were identified. The
recommendation about the need to implement a robust accounting system and to improve the FM
functions was repeated.

During the subsequent FM supervision in May 2007, the rating remained at MU due to noncompliance
with requirements on timely submission of financial monitoring reports (FMRs) and annual audits. The
FMRs were also of low quality and the audit reports were delayed for over 10 months. Also, no progress
in installing the automated accounting system was noted. The FM arrangements improved by February
2008 and the rating was raised to MS. The FM PIU staff became more experienced although the
automated accounting software was still not in place. Unfortunately, on May 1, 2008, all PIU staff
resigned, including the FM staff, and the MOH did not make alternative staffing arrangements until
October 2008. Therefore, starting from May 2008, the project again failed to comply with the reporting
and auditing requirements as well as failed to maintain basic accounting records. The FM rating was
downgraded to U by September 2008 and this situation continued until early 2009. Major factors leading
to this rating were: continuously low capacity and lack of ownership over the FM issues in the MOH and
PIU staff, lack of proper and orderly accounting files and records for the second half of 2008 and 2009,
absence of SOE reports of MOH and Prisons department to report project expenditures incurred during
the last 7 and 5 months, delayed submission of the FMRs for the 2nd, 3rd 4th quarters of 2008 (the FMRs
initially were not acceptable), completion of 2007 audit with delay of over four months, a slow process of
appointment of 2008/2009 auditors, errors in classification of project expenditures by category. Also, a
number of significant points were raised in the auditors' management letter and the audit report, but there
was absence of timely follow-up by the appointed staff.

After February 2009, revised drafts of the outstanding FMRs for 2008 were submitted and FMRs for the
first quarter 2009 were submitted on time and were found acceptable. The errors in classification of the
project expenditures by category were corrected. The audit contract for FY2008  2009 audit was finally
signed, and the audit report is due on December 31, 2009. Based on the above developments, the project
FM risk rating was upgraded to MU level by June 2009.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Given the experience of this project, the Bank is unlikely to engage in this area unless dramatic changes
are made in the MOH to enable more effective collaboration with the Bank. Recent improvements have
been made by the MOH in this regard, including the establishment of the HIV/AIDS Council in the MOH
at the end of 2007, with 23 staff (of which roughly 1/3 are now working). Also, in 2008, a Presidential
Commission on HIV/AIDS was established which signals continued and strong support at the highest
Government levels. The National AIDS Center is establishing a separate Center for Monitoring and
Evaluation which is a further testament to continued commitment to HIV/AIDS. Lastly, the TB Institute
has agreed with WHO on the reporting/recording forms (a major accomplishment) although no progress


                                                    21
appears to have been made with respect to training modules on which WHO provided
comments/recommendations several years ago.

The future collaboration between the Government, the Bank as well as other international agencies will
also depend on a joint recognition of the major weaknesses which led to the failure of this project as well
as active corrective measures to improve the status quo. This ICR can serve to advance this process.
Also, several assessments of MOH/SDP capacity have been done in the past decade. With respect to
HIV/AIDS, the most recent is a UNAIDS Comprehensive External Evaluation of the National AIDS
Response in Ukraine (January 2009) which was prepared by 32 independent international and 50 local
experts (the work of the procurement expert was financed by the Bank) on all aspects of the HIV/AIDS.
The overall conclusion of that review is that the national AIDS response must be significantly
strengthened in order to have an impact on the epidemic, most importantly through "renewed
commitment and leadership (by Cabinet of Ministers and Parliament) to make the necessary changes in
the systems of planning, financing, management and coordination."

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project development objectives remain highly relevant in the global context and are central to the
achievement of Goal #6 to Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Other Diseases (TB included as part of
Target #3 of the goal) of the UN Millennium Development Goals adopted in September 2000. The
project remains highly relevant and consistent with Ukraine's development priorities, including the
current National TB Program 2007-2011 and the most recent National AIDS Program 2004-2008 and the
new National Program for the Prevention of HIV-infection, Treatment, Care and Support of People
Living with HIV and AIDS Patients 2009-2013 which is the first program targeted at the general
population.

The project is also consistent with the stated objectives of the current Bank Country Partnership Strategy
(FY08-11) which focuses on the need to improve the public sector's service delivery, most importantly
tackling governance and capacity weaknesses. The second pillar of the CPS specifically focuses on long-
term development goals (i) to improve social sector outcomes through increased efficiency of social
sector spending, (ii) to increase citizen satisfaction with the quality of public services, and (iii) to reduce
environmental and health risks and increased awareness of these risks. The CPS was prepared at the time
when discussions were underway about using the undisbursed balance of the project as direct budget
support measures linked to progress against certain indicators. This never materialized and instead these
funds were used to purchase drugs for opportunistic infections, funds which were not provided under the
2008 and 2009 Government budgets. In that sense, these funds have actually been a direct contribution to
the budget although the original idea in 2007 was to use the remaining funds to improve public awareness
and fund HIV/AIDS prevention programs, two of the most crucial elements in the fight of HIV/AIDS and
directly supporting CPS goals.

While the overall relevance of this operation remains exceptionally high, the continued relevance of the
project with respect to design has become much less clear. Alternative implementation arrangements,
including direct budgetary support, are possible and should be pursued in view of the numerous
bureaucratic constraints and the general weak implementation history of this project as well as of other
investment operations in Ukraine. However, the need to build capacity in main Government agencies
involved in TB and HIV/AIDS remains a highly relevant goal and will be central to the success of future
investments in this area.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

                                                      22
The project has not achieved its objectives despite all attempts to jump-start it at various times during
implementation. Because of the generally limited direct investments made under the project for planned
activities (roughly 20% of original project cost estimates was implemented), particularly with respect to
the MOH implemented parts of the project, it is impossible to conclude that the project contributed to
meeting its two PDOs (reduced morbidity and mortality) with the exception of some progress made in
prisons, mostly through independent efforts made by the SDP. Clearly, the project has made only a very
limited contribution to the fight against these diseases at an incredible cost in terms of time, effort and
funds spent over a 10 year period. The following table provides a summary of progress made against
each of the 40 project indicators (details on each indicator are in the ICR Datasheet above)

                          Table 3: Status of Progress Against Project Indicators

       Progress not attributable to project              6                   4         25%

In terms of achievements, none of the PDO indicators were achieved. Only the prisons setting has seen
some progress in terms of decreased TB prevalence, TB notification rates, and TB mortality (although
combined MOH/SDP figures for mortality show an increase of 13% since 2003). These achievements are
a result of progress made over the last five years to improve nourishment of inmates, increase drug supply
and laboratory reagents, and provide better overall conditions in prisons (as a result of reductions made in
the number of inmates). Also, severely ill patients have been released from the prison setting in line with
the Criminal Code #408 passed in 2005. However, MDRTB in prisons is extremely high, at roughly
20%.

Substantial progress was registered in six of the twenty-one intermediate outcome indicators (IOs) as
follows: (i) TB DOTS Strategy and new Program adopted in 2007; (ii) TB recording/reporting forms
developed and approved by WHO; (iii) condoms, drugs for opportunistic infections, disinfectants and test
kits provided for HIV/AIDS. The provision of drugs for opportunistic infections in 2008 and 2009 has
been an extremely positive contribution by the project given the high prevalence of associated HIV/AIDS
infections, most notably hepatitis C. It is not currently possible to estimate the precise effect of these
medicines; however, given their large scope, it has been noted by MOH and other partners that these
drugs have likely reduced morbidity and mortality among HIV/AIDS patients who may have otherwise
died as a result of associated complications of HIV/AIDS. This is the single most important achievement
of this project with respect to HIV/AIDS objectives.

In terms of partial achievement, only two PDO indicators show progress (TB prevalence and DOTS
coverage). In the general population, a 15% reduction in prevalence was achieved from 2004 to 2008,
mostly due to increased availability of TB drugs and more effective treatment although the overall figures
are still very high and WHO cautions against any jubilation with respect to this progress because this
reduction must be viewed within the overall context of other TB indicators where there has been less
progress. For example, the number of new TB cases per year has decreased only marginally to reach
2003 levels, TB mortality has increased and MDRTB has significantly increased. Also, treatment success
rate in smear positive cases is only at 53.5%. Lastly, the quality of DOTS is still far from satisfactory.
The proportion of smear positive TB cases among the newly recorded is only at 35% (WHO data) of the
50% target and the case detection rate of smear positive cases under DOTS is at 55% of the 70% target.

                                                       23
Plus, the laboratory network is still not fully developed and there is no National reference laboratory for
monitoring of quality (although it exists on paper). Two IO indicators for TB show partial achievement
(provision of laboratories at 30% of planned expenditures and developed TB training modules (although
not reviewed by WHO) with very limited training of medical personnel). Also, three IO indicators for
HIV/AIDS have been partially achieved, including (i) some information materials on HIV/AIDS
developed and provided; (ii) AIDS centers improved laboratory capacity; and (iii) training provided by
SDP for doctors and training of trainers (no training was done in the MOH).

Progress was made with respect to HIV/AIDS in 6 of the 19 PDO indicators and four of the twenty-one
IO indicators in several critical areas, but none of this progress can be attributed to the project per se.
Examples include (i) a 10% increase in the percentage of HIV+ ante-natal clinic attendees receiving
PMTCT interventions; (ii) an expanded network of facilities offering Voluntary Counseling and Testing
with 300 independent centers operating in Ukraine and 637 special raion offices which offer counseling;
(iii) notable increased understanding, particularly among youths, of correct methods in preventing
HIV/AIDS transmission (from 14% in 2004 to 40% in 2008); (iv) reduction in risky behaviors among
CSWs and IDUs (see PDO indicators 17,18 & 19); (v) gradual reduction in mother-to-child transmission
to 7% in 2008 (from 8.5% in 2004) and increased treatment of HIV+ mothers and newborns from 88% in
2004 to 91% in 2008. Efforts made in these areas are a result of gradual increases in the MOH budget for
HIV/AIDS since 2004 (17.6 million UAH in 2004 to 105.2 million UAH in 2008), the active work of the
National and Regional AIDS centers, as well as contributions made by a number of projects being
implemented by external agencies, most notably by the Global Fund program which has been
implemented over the last five years by the International AIDS Alliance and the Network of PLWHA.

It is important to note that the project financed some key elements of "harm reduction" activities in the
prison setting (provision of disinfectants and condoms, trainings for SDP staff, peer-education activities).
These activities were quite revolutionary for the penitentiary system in Ukraine and opened the door for
other evidence-based prevention activities in prisons. However, some degree of resistance (explained by
legislative issues) towards the introduction of needle-syringe exchange programs (NSP) and substitution
therapy (SMT) in prison settings in Ukraine remains despite efforts made under the project and further
support is needed in this area.

Current status of the epidemics

The charts below provide a clear view of the trend in the TB and HIV/AIDS epidemics over the last two
decades. It is evident that since the start of the preparation of this project in 1999, the reported cases of
HIV have quadrupled and TB cases have seen a steady increase until 2006 with subsequent gradual
decline as a result of steps taken by Government, including to double/quadruple the TB budget in
2006/2007/2008 vis a vis 2003/2004/2005 budgets. However, it should be noted that TB incidence in
Ukraine remains one of the highest in the ECA region and is five times higher than the EU average.

With respect to HIV/AIDS, latest estimates by WHO/UNAIDS suggest that there were roughly 340,000
HIV+ people at the end of 2008 in Ukraine. According to the official count of registered cases of HIV
infection, by mid-2009, the total rose to 151,321 from 122,314 in 2007. A total of 26,804 AIDS cases
were registered with 12,490 deaths since the epidemic began as Figure 2 below demonstrates. With
respect to AIDS deaths, the infusion of resources by the Global Fund for ARVs during the past four years
has led to reductions in the number of AIDS deaths. However, the overall death rate continues to increase
given the very high demand against the total number of patients on treatment. As of January 2009, a total
of 10,629 patients were on anti-retroviral treatment. The official statistics state that this number
represents roughly 64% of the total needs based on the total number of registered patients. However, this
contracts with the latest UNAIDS estimate that roughly 80,000 persons require ARV treatment which is
four times higher that the official statistics indicate.

Likely, the most worrying statistic concerns the mode of transmission of HIV. Whereas in 1997, 84% of
infected were IDUs, in 2003, that figure was reduced to 49% and by 2008, it has decreased to 37%.
Meanwhile, the percentage of HIV infected through sexual transmission increased from 30% to 42%
during the last five years. This confirms that the epidemic is gradually taking on a generalized character.

Summary: Overall, the Government failed in its commitment to meet project objectives, particularly with
respect to HIV/AIDS. Only four IO indicators on HIV/AIDS were achieved under the project. None of
the crucially important prevention measures for high risk groups were provided and the information
campaign to fight HIV/AIDS was not carried out. The only harm reduction activities financed under the
project constituted the provision of 14.6 million condoms which were distributed to locally based NGOs
that work with the high risk groups. The project also financed the purchase of 18 million syringes and

                                                                                                                                                    25
needles for IDUs. However, regrettably, the end users of this procurement were not IDUs because the
syringes were found unsuitable for their use and instead were distributed to health centers across the
country. The achievement against TB indicators can be summed up as modest although the project is
responsible for Ukraine's final adoption of the DOTS strategy even though it came at a high price of
project suspension as noted earlier. The project did expand the laboratory network in the civil and the
prison settings and with additional support from international and local donors and partners, as well as
through Government own efforts, this network will be further improved.

3.3 Efficiency

A cost-benefit analysis was carried out during the project preparation phase which identified both direct
(savings from treatment costs) and indirect benefits (gains made from reductions in disability and death
and associated economic productivity) to be derived from the project. Since only a fraction of the original
project was implemented and no targeted prevention measures were financed under the HIV/AIDS
component, this analysis can now serve to show the dramatic opportunity costs incurred as a result of the
failure of this project.

In terms of benefits for HIV/AIDS, the original study estimated that if the project was implemented
successfully, up to 23,500 HIV/AIDS cases could be averted until 2009 with the present value (PV) of
saved costs ranging from US$13 million-US$8.9 million depending on the high vs. low scenario. The PV
of indirect benefits could be as high as US$164 million to US$118.5 million. This analysis assumed an
average cost of treatment at US$900/HIV/AIDS case, excluding ARV costs. The analysis also concluded
that a three year delay in implementation would result in a negative net present value (NPV) (-US$15.73
million) and negative internal rate of return (IRR) (-5.6%). Given that the project's implementation
delays were closer to 4 years, one can safely assume that costs of the project's failure are indeed very
high.

Notably, in 2005, the Bank, the Alliance and UNAIDS financed a study on the socio-economic impact of
the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Ukraine. A workshop was held in April 2005 to discuss the results of the
study which estimated that roughly 477,000 were infected in Ukraine in 2004 and that younger groups
were affected disproportionately (2/3 of those infected were in the 20-34 age group). The study
concluded that HIV/AIDS has emerged as one of the major obstacles to future economic growth of
Ukraine. Future costs to the health sector for treatment were estimated to be more than 600 million UAH
(US$120 million in 2005 prices) and revenue losses due to lowered productivity would be another 400
million UAH, with a staggering long term macro-economic impact (6% reduction of GDP in constant
prices). Clearly, this study only underlined the critical importance of targeted interventions.

With respect to TB, the original cost-benefit analysis was based on the assumption that the new TB
strategy would change the treatment protocols from 8 months of hospitalization (under the old system) to
2 months hospitalization and 4 months outpatient treatment, producing savings of roughly $900 per case
with a present value of saved costs of US$84.1 million. Additionally this analysis showed that indirect
benefits would total an additional US$98.1 million as a result of averted deaths and therefore gains in
economic productivity. The total NPV was estimated at US$152 million with an IRR of 170%. With a
three year delay in the project, benefits would be significantly lower but still positive. While the 2002-
2005 TB Strategy incorporated some DOTS principles, including more regular drug supply and increased
emphasis on direct observation of drug intake, it was not until the 2007-2011 TB Program that DOTS
became a Government mandate. Under that Program, hospitalization was decreased to 3 months (80-100
days) with a full endorsement of the DOTS approach. Over the last two years of program
implementation, DOTS has been expanding along with improvements made in laboratory capacity (as
supported under the project). However, while the official DOTS coverage is 100% (in accordance with
the Law), actual MOH estimates DOTS coverage at roughly 60%. Importantly, the treatment success rate

                                                    26
of smear positive cases is only at 53% (target was 85% in DOTS areas) and MDRTB has increased
substantially over the past five years (from 2.5% in 2003 to 7% in 2008) with serious implications for the
treatment costs of TB. Lastly, no change has been noted in TB mortality since 2003 (21.8/100,000) to
2008 (22.1/100,000). All these developments suggest that the original estimates of potential savings
which the project could yield did not materialize since the expensive treatment regimen remained intact
until very recently and DOTS is still in the process of being rolled out.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Unsatisfactory

Despite the high relevance of the project, only a limited set of the originally envisaged activities was
implemented with a marginal impact on the project development objectives. As mentioned above, none
of the PDO indicators met their targets fully and only two indicators saw partial achievement. Also, the
original cost-benefit analysis suggests that the failure of this project, particularly with respect to
HIV/AIDS, has already cost the Government millions of dollars and the lost opportunity costs will
continue to accrue into the future as a result of the failure to avert new infections.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Although this project was not explicitly a poverty-targeted operation, it aimed to improve TB control in
Ukraine, a disease widely recognized as a disease of poverty with at-high risk populations living in
overcrowded, poor environments, with a generally weaker health and nutritional status. Likewise, the
project was to provide targeted HIV prevention interventions to specific gender groups, including CSWs
and MSM, and to special target groups such as drug users and prisoners. Given that the project financed
expensive and otherwise potentially unaffordable drugs for HIV/AIDS patients and provided some
prevention measures (condoms, disinfectants, etc) as well as improved the TB laboratory capacity,
particularly in the prison setting, it may be concluded that the project had a modest poverty and gender
impact although lower than the planned intentions.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The institutional development impact of this project and the long-term impact on institutional capacity in
MOH and SDP is modest. Indeed, this is consistent with the conclusions of IEG's evaluation of
Ukraine's portfolio performance in 2007, which states that only 30% of investment projects have a
substantial institutional impact. This project made only a marginal contribution in this area as very little
capacity building took place under the project. Over the five years of implementation, the capacity of
some individuals in the MOH and the PIUs has been improved in terms of knowing how to work with the
Bank-financed projects. In substantive terms, there were a few trainings carried out on the TB and
HIV/AIDS, but their scope was very limited and represented only a small portion of original expectations
and needs. Also, during the project, the MOH and SDP did not contract out important consultancy
services to inform their decision making in several areas. Indeed, not a single international consultant
was ever hired under the project although some international consultants were brought in for special
reviews, financed by the Bank as well as by several UN agencies. A few studies and surveys were carried
out by local consultants and provided some interesting data. For example, the SDP carried out two
studies: (i) on HIV infections among TB patients (tested blood samples of prison inmates in 6 hospitals
and sent to AIDS Center for analysis which showed that 25-30% of TB patients were HIV+); and (ii) a
survey on MDR TB in 6 prison TB hospitals based on 125 samples from each of the hospitals which
showed that MDR has dramatically increased in prisons (roughly 20% prevalence). While these were
important small studies, the SDP never carried out several critical assessments such as the needs


                                                    27
assessment of ARV treatment in the prison system, a feasibility study on the introduction of substitution
therapy in the prison system, a review of the legal barriers for implementing the needle-exchange
programs in the prison system. These activities were agreed with the Bank and unfortunately none were
implemented due to problems with hiring consultants and because this was attempted very late in the
project. In the case of MOH, an enormous amount of training was envisioned under the project,
particularly under the TB component (US$2.6 million), and yet no training was done except for 2
seminars for training of trainers on TB modules.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

The risk to development objectives is considered to be substantial in view of the severity of the epidemics
and their changing nature with increased MDRTB and increased heterosexual transmission of HIV/AIDS.
The Government is committed to increasing its efforts in these areas. Over the past three years, this
commitment is visible in significantly increased budget allocations for both TB and HIV/AIDS (several
fold increases since 2005), the adoption of the 2007-2011 TB Program which is in line with WHO
endorsed DOTS approach, the adoption of the 2009-2013 HIV/AIDS Program targeted on the general
population, the formation of the President's HIV/AIDS Commission in 2008, the establishment of the
MOH HIV/AIDS Council with 23 staff positions in 2007, and the active involvement of the National
AIDS Center. With these developments, the country is increasingly better positioned to deal with the
epidemics but will need to maintain its commitment and actively work with all international and local
partners to make steady improvements in the key areas such as the development of the TB laboratory
network and the targeted prevention activities on high risk groups, particularly on youths.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory
The Bank team exhibited strong commitment and involvement during the three year preparation period.
There were three task team leaders supported by a number of local staff and consultants over the period of
preparation. The Bank management was continuously supportive of this project, recognizing the
challenging environment and circumstances behind designing this first-time TB and HIV/AIDS operation
in the ECA region. There were a total of 12 preparation/appraisal missions by the Bank team, including a
visit by the former World Bank President, James Wolfensohn, in October 2000, which underlined the
high importance and visibility that this project enjoyed and the recognition of the growing threat of the
TB and HIV/AIDS epidemics.

The overall quality at entry was rated as Satisfactory (rating of 2 out of 6) by the Bank Quality Assurance
Group (QAG) in its May 2003 Quality at Entry Assessment. In fact, the project's relevance, technical and
financial aspects and the risk assessment were rated as Highly Satisfactory. The panel's assessment was
that the Bank team was successful in gaining the trust of the Government and the health establishment in
redesigning the TB program to the WHO/DOTS approach and that the project was extremely timely and
critical with respect to arresting the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic. The panel found that objectives were

                                                    28
clear, realistic and focused on outcomes. However, the panel noted that while large sums of the loan were
earmarked for TB training, no details on who would benefit from this training, etc. were provided in the
PAD. Similarly, the panel was concerned that no funds were earmarked for project implementation
capacity at the local government level where most of the implementation would take place. Despite these
weaknesses, the QAG panel concluded that institutional development/capacity building was likely.

While QAG's positive assessment of the Bank's efforts is somewhat understandable given the difficult
and long preparation period in a challenging environment in Ukraine (and particularly in the health
sector), the readiness of the project for implementation was actually not as sound as QAG perceived. In
fact, there were several major problems with the project at entry which, in retrospect, appear as high risks
to implementation that the Bank team should have tried to minimize to the maximum extent possible.

Complexity of project design vs. weak implementation capacity. The project started off in 1999 more
modestly than what it became three years later. As preparation went on, additional sub-components and
activities kept being added, and in the end, it became a highly complex comprehensive project covering
all areas, fit for an experienced Borrower, with strong past implementation record. Instead, MOH and
SDP were first-time implementing agencies with great interest but with very limited prior experience in
working with internationally financed projects. The extremely slow implementation/disbursement of the
PHRD grant should have been a demonstration to the Bank of what was likely to come in the future. The
enormous bureaucratic challenges were self-evident at the time already and were very well outlined in
several reports by consultants. In terms of experience, aside from the PHRD grant, in 1993, some staff
had worked on the preparation of a health operation with the Bank which never materialized in the end.
Therefore, the only staff that gained practical experience in the Bank-financed project were the few
members of the PHRD-financed Project Preparation Unit (PPU) and some staff of MOH and SDP.
Unfortunately, once the project was approved, the PPU was disbanded because there was no bridge
financing provided between approval and effectiveness of the Bank loan. Since it took one year for the
project to become effective, all previous PPU staff were gone by the time the project started. Therefore,
all the capacity which was built during the preparation period was gone. This risk was identified in the
final PHRD report and the Bank should have tried to ensure that bridge financing would be available
either through retroactive financing or other sources, including Government. The importance of staff
continuity and capacity was a lesson which was not taken into account by the Bank at all. This proved to
be a particularly painful lesson during implementation where the first two years were spent on training
entirely new staff in Bank procedures and about the project.

MOH and SDP "sectors". A key recommendation of the PHRD final report was that special "sectors"
should be created in the MOH and SDP with dedicated staff who would work on this project. Indeed, the
Bank identified this as critical for the success of the project at the project appraisal meeting and the
Country Director suggested that the establishment of these sectors should be a condition of Negotiations.
Regrettably, the letter of invitation to negotiate did not include this condition. Instead, this condition
became a condition of project Board presentation. As discussed earlier, while the MOH and SDP wrote
to the Bank on the eve of Board presentation saying that such a sector would be established by the Board
date, only the SDP created this sector. The lack of this sector in the MOH turned out to be one of the
critical aspects for why the project did not start more successfully. Indeed, during every subsequent
supervision mission, the Bank team stressed the importance of MOH establishing this sector. The QAG
panel in May 2003 should have been made aware of this issue.

Lack of implementation readiness (TB and HIV/AIDS Components): The issue regarding MOH
willingness to adopt WHO/DOTS has been discussed at length in this ICR. Clearly the readiness to move
forward with DOTS turned out to be a major issue during implementation and the Bank team should have
likely been more realistic at the preparation stage about the TB component's real chances of success.
With respect to implementing the HIV/AIDS component, the design envisioned implementation of

                                                    29
outreach activities to be done through the NGO sector with the National AIDS Center as the main
executor of this component. However, as it became evident later on, there were legal challenges in the
precise method of contracting NGOs which were not worked out during preparation. This issue was not
resolved until the 2005 amendment of the loan agreement.

Project documents: As the QAG panel noted, the PAD was rather vague in terms of what specific
activities would be financed aside from outlining general directions such as investment in diagnosis,
treatment, training, prevention, monitoring, etc. There does not appear to be a clear set of implementation
arrangements and relationships between the various groups. For example, MOH and SDP coordination
was not explicitly discussed. The Project Operational Manual from 2002 lacks concrete and detailed
descriptions of components and arrangements. In general, project documentation does not appear to have
clear implementation plan/arrangements for a project with two implementing agencies, new staff and
generally weak capacity on the ground. Neither does there appear to be a set of detailed cost tables for
the project which can be used to assess the intended outputs or outcomes. Some more detailed
information is available in a procurement table for the project but this is not a replacement for a detailed
implementation plan with linkages between activities and linkages to the project development objectives.
In addition, as stated above, the monitoring and evaluation framework was not provided in any of the
documents and the quality of the design of the results indicators in the PAD needed improvement.

(b) Quality of Bank Supervision
Rating: Unsatisfactory
Several Bank teams made extraordinary efforts working jointly with Government counterparts to turn this
project around and to find alternative ways to improve project implementation. The Bank Country Unit
supported intensive project supervision and the management team were very much involved and
dedicated to this project, particularly given the high profile nature of the operation and its global
importance. Despite the project being rated as unsatisfactory for most of its life, the Bank management
supported several extensions of the loan to give a chance for this project to work. All Bank TTLs made
this project their top priority and tried their best to resolve problems and the various challenges which
persisted throughout this project. The acknowledgement of this fact was pointed out in most interviews
with counterparts, partners and Bank staff. During the most intensive period of the project (2005-2006),
the Bank team undertook indepth project reviews to find ways to speed up implementation and resolve
major challenges. In late 2005, the team called for a Quality Enhancement Review by the Bank to
provide recommendations on ways to proceed forward. The team brought in various specialists on TB,
Bank operations and procurement for HIV/AIDS. In 2005, based on these discussions, the team finalized
and processed an amendment to the Loan Agreement to make practical improvements in the project
(although it took months to process). Also, in 2005, the Bank financed an important study on the direct
and indirect costs of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This modeling exercise demonstrated the growing negative
economic impact on Ukraine which the epidemic was fueling and hence the urgency for increased
Government action in this area. In mid 2006, the Bank team called for an integrated procurement and
financing management review of the project which provided some recommendations for improvements.
In addition, the team made a particularly important contribution to the Government at that time in
providing an extensive review (together with WHO) of the TB Concept note, the reporting/recording
forms and training modules. Also, the team reviewed project activities in depth and worked closely with
the counterparts to see which packages could be combined and which UN agencies could do to assist the
Government in project implementation.

Bank teams tried various alternatives to improve implementation. This included suspending the project in
April 2006 for 7 months as a result of continued weak Government commitment to taking concrete steps
to move the project forward. The suspension did result in Ukraine finally adopting the National TB
Control Program (2007-2011) in line with the WHO recommended DOTS strategy in mid-2006. The
revision of the strategy and the adoption of DOTS was under discussion since 1999 and its final adoption

                                                    30
was a major step towards improving the diagnosis and treatment of TB as a cost-effective alternative to
the traditional Ukrainian approach. While the suspension propelled this major change, it was a rather
draconian measure which led to serious negative consequences in terms of a number of large ICB tenders
which were put on hold or cancelled at suspension due to the PIU's inability to award and pay against
contracts on one hand or to extend the validity periods of the bids on the other for an indefinite period.
Lastly, in mid-2007, the Bank team offered an alternative in the form of using remaining loan funds for
direct budgetary support against agreed benchmarks and indicators. But this was not accepted by
Government as feasible.

Therefore, despite the Bank's best intentions and efforts, in the end, the Bank team was not able to make
significant improvements in the project and to turn things around. There were a number of problems in
the Bank's approach to supporting the implementation of this project.

First of all, the lack of continuity in TTLs and the Bank team in general contributed to problems in
project implementation. The TTL who appraised the project, participated in Negotiations and presented
the project to the Bank Board of Executive Directors was changed as soon as the project was approved at
the end of 2002. Also, the locally based Bank operations officer who worked on the preparation of the
project for three previous years left the team and moved to HQ. During the delayed process of project
effectiveness (2003/2004), the forth TTL for the project was appointed and stayed with the project for
another year, until early 2005. This was a crucial turning point for the project, after a year of an
extremely slow project start, when a number of large procurement packages were being prepared and
some were on the verge of being launched. At that moment, the Bank team changed again entirely,
including a new 5th TTL for the project, a new procurement officer and a new local FM specialist. A new
local staff was also hired several months later (Sep. 2005). This led to some confusion and additional
delays in project implementation and meant that the critical continuity with the Bank team was again
broken. Several procurement packages which the Government considered were ready to be approved by
the Bank were questioned by the new procurement officer and the overall feeling was that the new Bank
team was setting new rules for engagement. In the view of the Bank team, its apparent caution at that
time was the result of normal due diligence when approaching a new operation, particularly in view of the
previous delays by the Borrower. The Bank local staff changed once again in 2007 which had similar
consequences, and in mid-2008, the 6th TTL oversaw project implementation for 1 year until the project
closing date.

A second major reason for why the Bank may have actually contributed to the poor project performance
was that, despite all good intentions, the Bank was unrealistic and often contradictory in its approach. ICR
interviews revealed a view that the Bank was extremely risk averse in a project which was accepted a
priori as a risky operation which would require a lot of hand-holding, understanding and a lot more time
to implement. Indeed, an implementation period of three years for a US$60 million project in Ukraine
was completely unrealistic and the Bank team should have recognized this and made decisions in line
with that reality. Instead, right at the time when the project was on the verge of turning the corner
(October 2005) and rated as "Satisfactory" in the Bank's internal project rating system, the Bank issued a
letter to Government which essentially claimed that the project was not working and failing to meet its
objectives despite collaboration with the Bank for 6 years. The Ukraine Country Management Unit
(CMU) had just completed a review of the Ukraine portfolio and the overall conclusion was that a number
of non-working investment projects had to be restructured. The letter called for "radical measures,
including implementation alternatives outside Government agencies" and that the project was "being
placed under review with a view to possible suspension or termination." The letter also called for
integration of PIU functions into the MOH right at a time when the Bank team just agreed to increase the
size of the PIU by hiring an additional procurement officer and financial manager. In the view of the
Bank team, the PIU was actually improving its effectiveness, and without a PIU, the Ministry would not
be able to implement the project at all because there were no possibilities to have dedicated separate

                                                    31
project staff at the MOH due to the hiring freeze at the Ministry. It appeared that the Bank's approach
was not internally consistent nor consistent with previous agreements with Government. As interviews
with Bank staff revealed, it looked like the Bank was moving "the goal posts". Interviews with
Government officials also supported this finding; many of the staff involved in the project said that the
Bank was categorical and ideological in its approach and that the Bank management recommendation to
disband the PIU was not based on reality.

It should be noted that although the project was 1.4% disbursed by mid-2005, (with 20% expected to be
contracted soon), the project was only operational for little more than 1 year since its effectiveness. This
is not an atypical situation in the Bank portfolio, particularly in known difficult operating environments.
Indeed, as was described earlier, this was (i) an investment project in Ukraine (typically problematic as
2004 CAS and numerous country portfolio reviews revealed), (ii) with first time implementing agencies,
with little previous experience and weak capacity, (iii) new inexperienced PIU staff (a number of whom
were also not entirely wellqualified for these jobs); (iv) the training for PIU was not allowed by the Bank
procurement officer because in her view these staff were selected because of their experience and hence
they did not require training; (v) a heavy Government bureaucratic operating environment in the Ukraine;
and (vi) constantly changing leadership of the MOH and high political instability. Given these
challenges, it was not a surprise that the project was going slowly. The Bank was aware of these
challenges when the project was approved. After all, it took two years for the MOH PIU to disburse
US$295,000 of the PHRD grant. Clearly, none of this should have been a surprise to the Bank, and the
Bank team was likely too hasty in recommending fast alternatives to implementation and quick
disbursement after one year of slow implementation after effectiveness. In retrospect, it may have been
wiser to give a chance for the processes to work themselves out and for the staff to gain the necessary
capacity, particularly because by mid-2005, some of the previous implementation problems were being
slowly resolved, the PIU was becoming better, an international implementation/drugs/procurement
specialist was hired, the Loan Amendment was processed, and some large packages were in the final
stages of the procurement cycle.

In mid-2007, the Bank proposed yet another alternative to implementation, as a condition for extending
the project for 18 months. The new idea was to use a direct budgetary approach for the remaining loan
funds (estimated US$30 million) linked to outcomes. This alternative was rejected by the Government as
legally impossible to implement within the short time remaining in the loan because of the necessity to
ratify a new loan amendment in order to create a separate line budget in the MOH. As some of the
counterparts pointed out during ICR interviews, "it appeared as if the Bank was experimenting on this
project in trying to find alternatives to implementation." The Government counterparts also pointed out
that the Bank's ideas and new approaches, while logical and well-intentioned, were never thoroughly
researched and detailed before being proposed to Government. For example, an idea to use some UN
agencies as procurement agents made sense at the time in order to speed up implementation. But specific
detailed agreements with each agency regarding the types of services which would be provided were not
as clear. Specifically, the counterparts felt that before suggesting that UNICEF could take on the
HIV/AIDS information campaign, the Bank and UNICEF should have understood whether this would be
contractually feasible. As it turned out, it was not and another year was wasted.

It must be noted that the Bank levied additional conditions for lifting the suspension during the
suspension period, contrary to the original letter of suspension. This was perceived as yet another change
in the Bank agenda. Counterparts also pointed out that the Bank was not consistent in its approach to
project extensions. They noted that the Bank always claimed that it would not extend the project but it
ended up extending it 4 times despite the fact that the project was rated unsatisfactory.

A third reason, as expressed by the counterparts, for less than successful implementation was due to the
seemingly arbitrary Bank's approach to approval of contracts. As a condition for the 18-month extension,

                                                    32
the Bank only approved the implementation of large UN contracts (signed by June 30, 2007) and rejected
all other "traditional" contracts already prepared by MOH. The Bank did not approve these contracts on
the basis of past slow performance by the MOH although the contracts were ready and were agreed on in
the original PAD. Only the SDP was allowed to continue to implement its activities in accordance with a
new procurement plan. In a sense, it appeared to MOH that the Bank was being selective in terms of
giving UN agencies and SDP preferential treatment. This happened again in mid-2008 when the Bank
rejected a large tender of laboratory equipment (US$3 million for the blood safety immune-fermentation
analyzers and systems which were agreed on in the PAD). The reason given by the Bank was that this
contract could not be completed by the then Closing Date (December 31, 2008). But at the end of 2008,
the Bank extended the Closing Date for another 4 months, but only for UNICEF contracts and extended
the closing date two more times to ensure proper delivery under UNICEF contracts. At the end of 2008,
there were several batches of smaller contracts prepared by the MOH and SDP teams which could have
been launched, but the Bank did not consider to include these in the "extension" period because the
original agreement was that work would be completed under all contracts by December 31, 2008. The
end result was that the project was actually extended until September 30, 2009 (for 3 UNICEF contracts),
and as MOH complained to the Bank, the critical laboratory equipment for TB (rejected by the Bank in
June 2008) could have been procured by that time. In terms of the Bank's decision to use UN agencies,
only two agencies ended up participating in the project - UNICEF and UNFPA, of the original 5-6.
Decisions as to which agency should be responsible for which part of the project were made, apparently
without extensive joint consultations with UN agencies and some agencies were surprised to find
themselves and others in the position of getting involved in areas which did not reflect their comparative
advantage. Therefore, not surprisingly, WHO which was selected to provide laboratory equipment ended
up refusing to take this on. A major failure of the project was that the information campaigns could not
be implemented. After the UNFPA declined to take this on, it took the Bank and UNICEF one year to
come to an agreement on an acceptable contract template by which time there was insufficient time to
implement the campaign. As the TTL of the project pointed out, this was a major failure of the entire UN
system (both Bank and UN agencies). The effect of the decision to use UN agencies was that capacity in
the MOH and SDP was not improved but disbursement of large amounts of the loan were indeed realized
under several large contracts, particularly with UNICEF.

A forth area where the Bank could have been more effective was in the kind of staff that worked on the
project. In general, the Bank team was limited in terms of its ability to provide high-level operational
assistance. The project teams (except for one year) did not have a dedicated operations officer, neither at
headquarters nor in the Bank field office. Since 2004, locally based operations officers were new to the
Bank and while they tried to follow-up on issues with the implementing agencies, the efforts were not
sufficient to overcome the enormity of the task required. Also, for a public health operation, the Bank
should have likely considered assigning public health specialists rather than economists as Task Team
Leaders. Additionally, given the nature of the operation, the Bank team should have included a drug and
a medical equipment specialist or consultant on these issues on a continuous basis. Exclusive reliance on
the expertise of UN agencies for such advice was likely unrealistic. Indeed, the UN agencies expressed
the view that the Bank needed enormous technical support which these agencies could not always deliver
given the tight deadlines and requests which came from the Bank.

Additionally, during the ICR interviews, the counterparts complained that there were major delays in
obtaining Bank no-objections. In general, the process of back-forth emails and getting clarifications on
procurement documents from the MOH and SDP, took a long time and in some instances the Bank could
have been faster in its responses.

Finally, with respect to the realism of project ratings, the Bank was generally very realistic in rating this
project as Unsatisfactory from the beginning to the end of its implementation. Two exceptions are: in
2003, during the lengthy period of effectiveness, the Bank rated the project as Satisfactory and as Highly

                                                     33
Satisfactory for implementation progress. This decision is hard to fathom since there were major delays in
getting the project effective and the PIU was disbanded entirely because the PHRD grant was closed. The
ratings were downgraded to unsatisfactory three months after project effectiveness. A second exception
is a six month period in 2005 (March November 2005) when the new TTL was appointed and the project
was rated as Satisfactory. In retrospect, this appears as a rather odd choice of ratings because just six
months later the Bank was already beginning to threaten suspension and termination.

Collaboration with partners: The Bank team tried its best to work in close collaboration with all
international and local agencies, particularly with USAID, WHO, EC and UNAIDS, Global Fund, the
Alliance and the Network of PLWHA, working to ensure a consistent approach to the control of
epidemics and to build on other agencies' experience and ongoing projects. Indeed, the Bank Country
Director was personally involved in the project and was the Chair of the UN Theme Group on HIV/AIDS
from 2005-2007, a coordination mechanism for HIV/AIDS in Ukraine. However, there were clear
challenges in this cooperation, as already described in an earlier section. The Bank team, in its attempt to
improve implementation, expected these agencies to provide full support to this effort and while these
agencies did provide continuous assistance to the Bank, they likely did not expect to be involved so
heavily in supporting this project and certainly not in being procurement agents for it. Also, one of the
main concerns expressed by these agencies was that the Bank could have been a more effective partner in
the overall international effort, with greater coordination and more transparent information sharing about
the project and its operations. These agencies felt that they were involved sporadically and pulled in at
various challenging times rather than being consistently part of the joint dialogue. Some agencies also
claimed that there was no follow-through on some agreements and recommendations made to improve the
project. The Bank team was cognizant of the need to improve international coordination throughout the
project and did make efforts to coordinate and systematically meet with all agencies during project
missions, particularly after 2005. But, it is clear that the Bank team was heavily focused on the many
project challenges which persisted and this may have detracted the Bank team from a more full
engagement.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

For most Bank teams (both at preparation and implementation), this project became their most important
and most consuming task, both personally and professionally. Most team leaders and members (as well
as managers) were highly committed to a successful outcome of this project and to making things work.
However, in the end, the challenges turned out to be more complex than previously perceived and
decisions made by the Bank team in response to these challenges were likely not as appropriate as they
may have seemed at the time. In addition, there were specific areas where the Bank could have been
much more effective in its relationship with the client as well as with other partners.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
Both during preparation and implementation, the project enjoyed strong commitment and support from
the highest levels within the Ukrainian Government, including from the Presidential Administration and
from the Parliament Health Committee. The Vice-Prime Minister (Mykola Zhulynsky) was a particularly
great supporter of the project during its preparation. During the visit of the Bank President, James
Wolfensohn, in October 2000, both he and the President of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, expressed their full
commitment to control the TB and HIV/AIDS epidemics and to the preparation of the project. However,
despite this overall strong interest and support for the project at the highest levels, the budgets for
HIV/AIDS National Programs continued to be minimal until 2005. The same was true for the new TB
Program 2002-2005 which had an increased mandate to develop the bacteriological laboratories in the

                                                    34
country (Order #45, Feb. 6, 2002). Yet, limited budgets were provided for that period, essentially for
financing 1st and 2nd line drugs, with budget increases made only starting in 2006.

Despite the strong commitment, particularly with President Yushchenko showing exceptional leadership
with respect to AIDS, this interest was not uniform and did not trickle down to administrative levels of
government. For example, in 2001 during project preparation, the vice prime Minister openly questioned
the cost effectiveness of working with the Bank and borrowing for this project. As discussed earlier,
numerous Government reshufflings throughout the project period, with the constant changes of Ministers
and Deputy Ministers, had a major negative effect on the project's performance given the various degrees
of commitment and interest in the project. Most ICR interviews revealed that this was likely the most
important factor that led to the failure of this project.

Lastly, the persistent highly bureaucratic well-documented processes in Government were major
constraints to all projects in Ukraine, including this project. Indeed, the set-up and the requirements of
Bank-financed investment operations were alien to the Ukrainian public administration. Every step
required enormous amounts of time. For example, the process of preparing for Negotiations took five
months because of the needed approvals in Government; likewise, project effectiveness took one year
because of the Parliament ratification process. The establishment of the Special Account took almost nine
months because of the various bureaucratic procedures in place. Last but not least, as described above,
there were many stumbling blocks to smooth implementation in terms of the number of signatures needed
to process documents, the constant payment delays and limitations set on advances which could be
provided under contracts (one month). Then, there were the exceeding constraining procurement
processes which conflicted with Bank procurement guidelines. For example, the Government's decree
#332 (dated April 4, 2001) set price ceilings on goods/services and this lasted until 2006 when the
President finally issued a resolution abolishing this archaic practice. On top of that, the procurement
processes were exceedingly complicated, time-consuming, with constant amendments made and
complaints by bidders. Any changes in the Project Procurement Plan had to be renegotiated and passed
through several layers of review. In sum, the Government did not provide an enabling environment for
effective project implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

Project Preparation period: MU for MOH and MS for SDP
The preparation of this project enjoyed considerable support of the Minister of Health in 1999/2000 who
was particularly involved in project preparation and showed great personal leadership and interest in the
project's objectives, despite the novelty of the proposed approaches, including the introduction of the
WHO recommended DOTS approach to TB, involving NGOs in the implementation of the national
program to fight HIV/AIDS, and the implementation of significant harm reduction activities in the
project. The State Department of Prisons was highly committed to the project's objectives and was in full
agreement on the introduction of DOTS. Indeed, at the some point, the Bank even considered working
only with SDP on the TB component because of resistance by the Head of the TB Institute to the
introduction of DOTS and the opposition of the new Minister of Health (2000-2003) to the TB
component if DOTS was included. They questioned the potential effectiveness of DOTS and its
appropriateness for Ukraine and rejected the positive experience of the DOTS pilots in Donetsk and Kiev
carried out by WHO and EU. In fact, in retrospect, it appears that the Minister and the TB institute saw
the project mostly as a vehicle to support the existing agenda and system rather than a vehicle for reform.
A similar situation prevailed with respect to HIV/AIDS with no real commitment to harm reduction
programs and an open reluctance to using NGOs for service delivery of prevention programs. In fact, the
MOH insisted that the project support the newly established AIDS enters. The discussion around the
modalities of implementing the HIV/AIDS component went on for almost two years, and in the end,

                                                    35
agreement was made that AIDS centers would work with NGOs but no clear arrangements were worked
out and not a single contract with NGOs ever materialized. Lastly, the Government did not see the need
for any "soft" components of the project, such as technical assistance or training. Mostly, they insisted on
including hardware components which were important but which signaled that the Government was not
fully cognizant of the weaknesses that stood in the way of effectively fighting these epidemics.

While there were disagreements on the project design, there was an accompanying lack of real
commitment to increase implementation capacity in the MOH. The department in the MOH (infectious
diseases) was staffed with a few people who were not prepared to take on larger responsibilities of
implementing this project. Their functions were mostly bureaucratic in nature. Hence, the formation of a
viable sector in MOH dedicated to ensuring sound coordination and implementation of the project was
made a Board condition which unfortunately never materialized. In general, the MOH was ill-prepared to
implement this 1st health Bank-financed project. The staff had little understanding of the Bank rules and
requirements for successful implementation. Incidentally, commitment in SDP was much higher and the
SDP did form a sector to implement the project, but it was entirely relying on the implementation capacity
in the MOH for its component since a single project preparation unit (PPU) was formed there and
managed a single Special Account on behalf of the MOH and SDP.

The overall effectiveness of the PPU was likewise questionable because it received little support from the
MOH (after the first PPU director left) and a number of Bank aide-memoires described a less than perfect
cooperation that existed between the MOH and the PPU. The issue of PPU physical location and
premises was always an issue. At first, the PPU was placed in the Institute of Neurosurgery (until mid-
2001) and then in the Red Cross (until February 2003). Also, the PPU staff were not paid for many
months due to delays in MOH in signing and processing their payments requests. Despite these
challenges, the PPU staff managed to improve their skills and worked collaboratively with project
Working Groups and with the Bank teams. By project negotiations, 90% of procurement packages were
prepared and an Operational Manual was prepared and the team had relatively good capacity to start the
implementation of the project. Had it remained intact, the implementation was likely going to be more
successful, but in early 2003 after Board approval, all staff resigned because there was no funding
provided to ensure their continued involvement. The PHRD grant closed and no retroactive financing
was included in the loan agreement.

Project Implementation: Rating: U for MOH and MU for SDP
Whatever problems existed during the preparation period were exacerbated during implementation. The
Steering Committee which was supposed to provide project oversight never functioned. The sector was
not formed in the MOH even after the Board presentation and the Bank continuously reminded the MOH
about this issue. The reason cited for this was a need for an official Decree from the Cabinet of Ministers
which would then ensure MOF funding of the sector. In any event, this did not materialize until after the
suspension was lifted in end 2006. Also, the new Minister (2004) transferred the MOH responsibility for
the project to a new Deputy Minister who did not officially oversee the Department of Dangerous
Diseases and this created major problems of coordination. Lastly, the new Minister decided to select all
new PIU staff and to appoint a new project director who had no previous experience with any Bank-
financed projects. Additionally, two procurement staff were hired, neither of whom had any prior
experience with Bank procurement nor training in procurement. On top of this, the Bank team did not
adequately review the qualifications of the selected candidates and let the Minister personally decide on
the selections. What made the situation more difficult was that the Bank team did not allow training of
the PIU staff because these staff were supposed to have been selected based on sound qualifications in the
first place. As the then Director complained during the interviews for this ICR, the staff had to learn on
the job while facing the typical numerous bureaucratic and other challenges from the MOH management.
During the initial period, because of the time lag between approval and effectiveness, the PIU staff had to
renew all procurement documentation on the basis of new information from regions. As the MOH

                                                    36
management kept changing, the PIU staff and particularly the PIU director had to continually explain to
the new MOH Ministers and Deputy Ministers about the project and its goals as well as about Bank
guidelines. Naturally, not all Ministers were as supportive as others and each had their own interests and
agenda. All this only complicated the already difficult implementation environment. Lastly, the issue of
premises remained problematic. At first, the PIU was in the TB dispensary and then in the basement of
the Ministry, with many staff together in a single room.

During the last two years of the project the PIU faced additional challenges. As a new Director was
appointed in early 2007 after the lifting of the suspension, a number of PIU staff left when their contracts
expired because the Bank would not extend contacts as it felt their services were no longer required given
that the project was now going to be essentially implemented through UN contracts. Whatever staff was
left finally resigned in May 2008 due to a new tax policy after which the staff of MOH supervised the
completion of the project. Meanwhile, the SDP continued to function with its new separate Special
Account which allowed SDP to implement its component independently of the MOH.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

Overall, the Government did not use to its advantage the considerable resources which were available at
its disposal through this project. The capacity to implement the project was generally weak and little
institutional building took place during the project. Given the significant changes in Government officials
and the highly bureaucratic processes and the general inability, particularly by MOH, to take proactive
steps in implementation, the project was doomed to failure. As a matter of comparison, the project
supported by the Global Fund and implemented outside of the Government structures was far more
successful and provided critical support for HIV/AIDS. Also, major support was provided by several
international and national agencies through the NGO sector to implement programs directly with regions.
This also worked effectively. Instead, the Bank-financed project attempted to work through the
Government structures and failed, clearly because the existing processes were not effective in their own
right nor adaptive to innovative approaches. It must be noted that much more progress and more effective
implementation was carried out by SDP, likely because its top leadership remained in place and was
consistently committed to the goals of the project, and because a dedicated "sector" was formed at the
start of the project and continued to function throughout the implementation period.

6. Lessons Learned

A number of country-wide lessons and recommendations to improve portfolio performance of investment
projects in Ukraine have been made in numerous assessments and reports over the last several years. The
following are key lessons that have been derived from the implementation of this project.

Critical to ensure adequate appraisal of risks and challenges:
     Are there agreements on sensitive and controversial issues in the project?
     What is the level of Government ownership/commitment?
     What is the experience of project preparation? Difficulties/challenges should be flags/lessons for
        future implementation.
     How realistic are the proposed risk mitigation measures?
     Is project design commensurate with existing implementation capacity?
     Overall project implementation readiness?
     Adequacy of instrument for the operation?
     Are monitoring and evaluation strategy and processes in place?



                                                    37
Government ownership is essential for successful project implementation and should be measured
by whether:
    There is a long-term strategy/plan and whether the project is firmly imbedded in it;
    There is strong leadership for project oversight and management;
    Critical institutional/implementation arrangements are in place (e.g. creation of departments);
    There is willingness to cut through red tape and reduce bureaucratic hurdles (complex and
       lengthy internal approval/clearance/signing processes);
    There is deep commitment to ensuring compliance with Bank fiduciary policies and procedures.

High-risk projects require long-term strategic vision, consistency and perseverance:
    Sustained commitment of senior management/officials to long-term project goals and to
       providing strong support for the operation is essential to maintain momentum;
    Sustained consistency of messages should be maintained at all times. Agreements made should be
       honored in order to avoid confusion and unnecessary wasting of time and resources. This
       includes adherence to mutually agreed deadlines and plans;
    Expectations for fast and successful implementation in high-risk projects in countries with rapidly
       changing political environments should be restrained and some delays should be expected, along
       with slow disbursements during initial project years.

Realistic assessment of project progress is critical to guide future implementation:
    Project difficulties must not be allowed to linger and should be proactively addressed;
    All parties involved should remain flexible and open to alternatives. Options should be examined
        jointly, weighing all benefits and risks, before major decisions are taken by either side.

Strong implementation support/capacity should be paramount objectives:
     Essential to maintain support of senior management/officials for strong project teams;
     Continuity of staff (on Bank and Govt side) is a critical element of project success/failure.
     Prerequisite for strong Bank teams must be a good skills mix to ensure coverage of substantive,
       operational and fiduciary aspects of project preparation and implementation.
     If project supervision is HQ-based, a presence of a senior locally-based Bank sector coordinator
       would be highly encouraged to provide support to both Government and Bank teams;
     Given the extreme importance of having trained and experience project staff to implement
       projects, the selection must be done on a prior review basis to ensure that the best, most qualified
       candidates are selected.
     Bridge financing should be built in to avoid disruptions in staffing (between Board approval and
       effectiveness) particularly in countries with known long delays in effectiveness.

Need for effective coordination between all major partners.
    Management and supervision of projects/programs where many partners are involved should be
       joint during the entire project period;
    Information sharing of all relevant documents among partners is critical for sustained success of
       operations and for ensuring consistency of messages and coordination of inputs.

Specific Operational Lessons include:
    Agreements on major project issues/activities must be detailed and documented with precision so
        as to avoid any mis-interpretation later on.
    For critical issues of compliance with international standards, explicit conditions of Negotiations
        or Effectiveness would greatly reduce the risk of a project becoming a problem during
        implementation. This lesson was applied well in the Russia TB/AIDS Project (closed as a


                                                    38
        successful operation) where disagreements on whether or not to adopt the DOTS approach were
        resolved prior to the start of the project.
       When there are several distinct implementing agencies with clearly different degrees of
        commitment and readiness at appraisal, it is prudent that fiduciary functions and the Designated
        Accounts for these agencies are not placed in either one of the agencies. Otherwise,
        implementation in one agency is totally dependent on the other.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

A beneficiary survey was not initiated due to the limited project impact, with most procurement and
delivery taking place in the last 2 years. However, information from the Network of PLWHA (based on
their survey of stakeholders) has been very positive regarding the provision under the project of drugs for
opportunistic infections and test-kits in 2008/2009 for HIV/AIDS. During the ICR interviews, the MOH
and the AIDS Center have also emphasized the importance of the provision of CD4 count reagents which
will enable Ukraine to identify all patients who require ARV drugs rather than relying solely on
projections for budget planning. Likewise, MOH and SDP were very complimentary about the provision
of laboratory equipment for TB control. Previous to the project, no budget funds were earmarked for the
development of the laboratory network. Only starting in 2006, the MOH budget included funds for
laboratories.

Summary of the workshop. The following were the main conclusions and comments of the participants
regarding the project, the ICR and the lessons for future collaboration:

      ICR provides an in-depth, critical assessment of the project
      Overall agreement by all with ICR outcomes and ratings, except for the SDP whose
       representatives felt that the outcomes of the project were indeed positive with respect to what the
       SDP got out of the project and with respect to the Bank performance
      Lessons of the ICR are extremely relevant
      For a number of participants, the ICR was an emotionally charged document to read (given their
       experience) and they expressed their appreciation to the Bank for offering the opportunity to take
       part in the preparation of this document and to have a chance to review it
      Frankness of the report was well-received and participants were pleased that the Bank displayed
       the necessary due diligence and courage to face a number of difficult project issues which the
       Bank was partly responsible for
      Suspension of the project was likely a very harsh measure and was hurtful to project financial
       planning, without really affecting the final outcome, i.e. that the preparatory steps for the
       endorsement of the DOTS strategy were already in place even prior to the suspension
      High political instability was the main element in project failure (the table in the ICR is an
       excellent summary of changes in top leadership)
      The project suffered from lack of inter-ministerial coordination which MOH did not have the
       capacity to lead despite the hard work of individual MOH staff
      Although there are high levels of bureaucracy throughout Government, this can be overcome if
       there is consistent commitment which was not the case of this project
      Key parts of the project, i.e. TB strategy/activities and how to work with NGOs, were not
       designed at all which led to poor project execution
      Suggestions were made that there should be an autonomous implementation structure, outside of
       Government, to implement Bank financed projects
      There was a general sense of disillusionment about the project, particularly with respect to
       HIV/AIDS and the major opportunity lost in terms of HIV/AIDS prevention (missed 4 years)
      Because of provision in 2008-2009 of drugs for opportunistic infections, mortality and morbidity
       are expected to decline which is a significant contribution of the project
      Several participants mentioned that the Bank did not provide or agree to training of PIU staff
       which was a major hindrance to sound implementation
      Very regrettable and arbitrary that the tender for the laboratory equipment for TB was cancelled
       by the Bank in mid-2008 due to time constraints (as perceived at that time). This could have
       easily been completed during the year that the project was extended
      There was no local level involvement either during the design or implementation phase
      Major disruptions/changes in project management (PIU) were very difficult for staff to handle
       and resulted in lack of institutional memory. In 2008, the PIU was disbanded and the new
       Committee in the MOH had to take over the work with little background information and no
       training
      Bank was not consistent with respect to its position on TB. In 2003, it accepted the National TB
       Strategy Adapted to World Standard (which was not based on a full endorsement of DOTS) but in
       2005 the Bank questioned why DOTS was not being implemented
      Bank procedures are at odds with existing Government legislation and procedures which is at the
       root of implementation problems
      While project restructuring and making valid changes are a positive step, the project should not
       simply become a vehicle for spending funds and a well designed project should not need to
       change more than 10% during implementation.

   Conflict of interest/corruption played a role in the project demise
   Critical to have an assessment of the equipment/supplies provided under the project (whether it is
    being used, its impact, etc)
   A key implication of the project and its lessons is how future collaboration will be managed and
    whether key inputs and recommendations by donors and external agencies are considered and
    implemented
   Risk assessments should be a critical element of project preparation
   Coordination among key players was highlighted as essential and missing under this project
   Alternative lending instruments should be considered, such as direct budgetary support for a
    multi-sectoral project what brings in other relevant Government agencies as well as on-lending to
    regions
   Bank did not always play a helpful role vis a vis Government in that it did not critically assess
    whether proposed Government actions/proposals were technically sound
   The Bank did not supervise the project in the regions. Bank missions only stayed in Kiev.
   The project's existence highlighted the importance of the issues which is a very positive aspect of
    this problematic project
   Future Bank involvement in the health sector should be strategic and programmatic in nature,
    with HIV/AID and TB being a part of the overall program support rather than stand-alone
    operation.

                            Report issued by the Ministry of Health (MOH)

Project objectives: overcoming tuberculosis and AIDS epidemics in Ukraine by means of support to
    realization of National strategy of tuberculosis control developed in accordance with international
    standards and National program on provision of HIV infection prophylaxis, support and treatment of
    HIV-infected and AIDS patients for 2004  2008.
It was planned:
    until 2011 - almost 50% reduction of tuberculosis sickness rate, almost two times reduction of
    mortality, stabilize AIDS sickness, twice reduce the quantity of HIV infected children born by HIV-
    infected mothers; 10% reduction of AIDS mortality rate. The economic effect for 10 years from the
    beginning was estimated at US$253 million.

Brief analysis of tuberculosis and HIV-infection/AIDS epidemic situation

          HIV-infection/AIDS
Scale of HIV-infection/AIDS epidemic in Ukraine continued to grow during 2004-2008. Quantity of new
infection cases increased on 10%-15% annually. During the epidemic period there were registered 141277
HIV-infected citizen including 26804 AIDS patients; 15200 deaths were registered due to diseases caused
by AIDS. There are 91717 HIV- nfected persons on dispensary observation, including 10 410 patients as
of 01.01.09. The rates of HIV-infection and AIDS spreading were 198.6 and 22.5 for 100,000 population
correspondingly. Not taking into account that indexes of HIV-infection and AIDS spreading, HIV-
infection sickness rate and AIDS mortality rate continue to grow, analysis of epidemic situation for the
period 2004-2008 for the first time demonstrates positive changes in spreading of HIV in the country. For
the period 2006-2008 there was registered decrease of the rate of increase of HIV-infection sickness index
from 16.8% to 7.6% that witnesses epidemic slowdown. Especially clear this tendency can be observed
at the time of AIDS sickness analysis. Accordingly to 2007  2008 years results for the first time 3%
annual decrease of AIDS sickness was registered due to wide introduction of antiretrovirus therapy. Little
by little the rate of mortality increase lowers from +56% in 2003 to +7.4% in 2008, although in 2008 this
index became worse comparing with 2007 (+3.8%).

The quantity of HIV tests increased in Ukraine for the last 2 years as well as detection of new cases of
HIV-infection due to expansion of voluntary consulting and testing on HIV-infection: in 2006 comparing
to 2005  on 2.6% and in 2007 comparing to 2006 on 12.8%, in 2008 on 12.1% in comparison with 2007
that resulted in increase of detected HIV-infection cases.

Blood safety: There are 54 HIV diagnostics laboratories functioning as part of blood transfusion stations
with 100% testing the blood donations. 22 cases of infecting through donor blood were registered within
21 years (from 1987 till 2008).

Prevention of mother to child HIV infection transfer: 94% of pregnant women were examined despite the
fact that quantity of HIV-infected women that give births grows annually. Free and free of charge access
to pre-testing consultation is ensured for all the pregnant women. 91% of examined women were treated

                                                                    53
preventively. Children's infecting in 2008 was 7%, while in 2000 it was 27.5%.

         Tuberculosis
Starting from 1995 the number of tuberculosis cases grew steadily and increased twice for this period
from 41.7 for 100,000 population to 84.5 in 2005. Within last three years starting from 2006 we can see
slow decrease of this index. The incidence of tuberculosis in 2008 was 77.8 cases for 100000 population
that is 2.5% lower in comparison with 2007.

Mortality rate for the first time decreased in 2006 in comparison with the previous year on 11.9 % from
25.3 to 22.3 cases for 100,000 population and stabilized in 2007-2008 at the level 22,6-22,1 for 100,000
population.

Over the time of fulfillment of the State Program on tuberculosis disease counteraction for the years
2007-2011 in Ukraine there was performed development of the net of laboratories for tuberculosis
diagnostics including purchase of the necessary modern equipment out of proceeds of World Bank Loan
as well as at the expense of State budget funds. Supplies of equipment purchased out of proceeds of
World Bank Loan started at the end of 2006 and continued in 2007. It had influence on the main
efficiency indicators of tuberculosis control programs  percent of detection of bacterial forms of
tuberculosis among new cases of disease in anti tuberculosis institutions as well as in general medical
institutions performed by microscopy of sputum smear. If at the start of the program in 2006 the structure
of new tuberculosis cases had only 30.4% of confirmed tuberculosis diagnosis for the patients discharging
causative agent, in 2008 this indicator was 47.3 % (WHO criteria is 75%). In 2006 there were only 0.3%
detection among the patients with the symptoms similar to tuberculosis. In 2008 this indicator was 5.0 %
of the cases (WHO criteria  5 %). At present examination for tuberculosis by means of microscopy of
sputum smear is performed in each district hospital.

Positive changes regarding tuberculosis epidemic situation are evened out by spread of multiresistant
tuberculosis in Ukraine: from 2.5% among new cases of disease in 2004 to 15% 2008 and from 30%
among recurrent ases  up to 55% in 2008. The quantity of tuberculosis recurrences increased in Ukraine
from 5.9 cases for 100,000 of population in 2003 t 12.2 cases in 2008.

History of cooperation of World Bank and Ukrainian Party on the Project Tuberculosis and
HIV/AIDS Control in Ukraine

Inaccuracies and miscalculations that will be described later decelerated realization and caused shift of
Project realization schedules. Process of the Project preparation, including analysis of tuberculosis and
HIV-infection/AIDS epidemiological situation in Ukraine, took place in 2000-2002. The measures
foreseen by the Project were developed taking into consideration existing infrastructure and levels of
personnel and material supplies of corresponding medical institutions and existing normative legal base.
The Project consists of a number of interdependent measures that after their realization should lead to
certain outcome and influence on the situation with tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS epidemic. Growth of
state financing for counteraction to these epidemics, funds mobilizing, considerable attraction of GF
assets as well as assets of another donors from the one side and shift of Project realization schedules from
the other side resulted to loss of actuality of several measures foreseen by the Project and/or they were
realized within the Project frames. Moreover it was required to review the Project measures and
performances constantly, to make changes to the project realization plan. What was not only made due to
often changes of Project management from the side of World Bank, MoH and Government, absence of
complete and stable staff of PIU, insufficiently effective cooperation between the Bank and the Borrower,
in the first place with MoH as the main responsible executor. Cooperation had mainly situational
character and was directed to solution of sharp current problems having visible signs. Nevertheless,
Project completion was foreseen in the nearest term outlook.

                                                    54
From the start of Project realization it was clear that it will be impossible to achieve the planned till the
Loan closing date inclusive application of funds. Actually application of funds started in 2005. As for the
March 2006 the Contracts with successful Bidders were signed for the amount more than US$7 millions,
"No objection" from World Bank was received for Bidding documents on the amount more than US$3
millions. Decision of World Bank on 6 months suspension of payments from the 12 of April 2006 looks
doubtful from the point of view of use of funds and increasing Project implementation efficiency.

For financing renewal the Bank laid down a number of stipulations including signature of the contracts
with UN agencies for the purpose of speeding up money disbursement. These conditions were fulfilled
and financing renewed on the 22 of November 2006  7 months before the Loan closing date. No one
possibility of extension of Project terms was discussed. In the frames of project activities the accent was
moved to negotiations with UN agencies, preparation of the contracts with those agencies that would like
and would have possibility to take part in Project realization. At the time of contracts preparation it
appeared that such experience of contract signing with UN agencies for the loan assets in accordance with
IBRD procedures in the countries with sufficiently developed own legislative base neither had Ukrainian
party nor Bank nor UN agencies. Signature of the Contract with UN agencies was the main condition of
possible Project extension. In April 2007 Ukrainian party submitted to the Bank renewed plan of
implementation that foresaw completion of all the planned activities including the contracts with UN
agencies with complete disbursement within 18-months period of the Project extension till December 31,
2008. But such extension was not accepted by the Bank. 18 months Project extension was submitted
relating to the Contract with UN agencies as well as the other contracts signed before 31 of May 2007. At
the same time it was proposed for consideration the new version of Project realization for the period of
extension, version of so-called budget support and maximum transfer of Project management functions
from PIU to the employees of Committee on counteraction to HIV-infection/AIDS and other socially
dangerous diseases  one of the MoH departments. In November 2007 only after long discussions it was
agreed to extend the Project in previous format. New implementation plan was revised and presented
accordingly to which it was foreseen 12 months period left to the final Loan closing date - 31-st of
December 2008. Implementation plan contained proposals of Ukrainian party to extend the Project taking
into consideration the time spent for development of mutual position that was not taken to account by the
Bank. At that time period MoH appointed new Project Manager. Bank required confirmation that such
changes will not have influence to the requirements stated in implementation plan and presented to the
Bank. After negotiations the new purchasing plan for the period of extension left was approved by the
Bank in April 2008. Period of validity left for realization of the Project did not allow purchases of
complicated equipment as soon as the Bank rejected any version of Project extension. At the beginning of
June new Project Manager was appointed. After further consultations with the Bank the list of goods and
services planned for purchase was shortened because of lack of time till the Project closing date as soon
as the Bank canceled possibility of Project extension although final Loan closing date was moved forward
on 6 months more. As result of such developments idea of goods and services purchasing through UN
agencies for the purpose of speeding the process of purchasing and drawdown did not prove to be as it
was planned. Sophisticated laboratory equipment that had been planned for purchasing via UN agencies
was not purchased. Practically half of the time of 18-months time period of Project extension was spent
for clarification of details of World Bank proposal regarding the budget support and development of
general consensus. Staff of PIU was reduced to minimal although there are no corresponding experts and
established posts for Project realization in the staff of Committee on HIV/AIDS counteraction or MoH.
This could not but influence successful Project realization in critical period.

It should be noted that for the period of Project realization Bank made decisions on resumption of
financing and repeated Project extensions subject to concluding the contracts with UN agencies or for
completion of these contracts delays of which were not through the fault of Ukrainian party. It should be
noted that the Bank did not offer such preferences to the other contracts and purchasing procedures.
General term of Project extension is 24 months inclusive three transfers of the Project closing date.

                                                     55
Categorical position of the Bank in fixing the next Project closing date as final did not make possible
development of unified and consecutive plan for completion of the Project as a whole with complete
withdrawal of funds taking into consideration readiness of Bidding documentation for the most of the
goods and working experience.

Lessons

The reasons of ineffective implementation of the Project (further - Reasons) have a number of
components and require certain systematization. Before systematization of mistakes it is necessary to
formulate at least two theses.

The lessons of the Project as well as mistakes made for the period of preparation and realization of the
Project concern all the Parties of the Project: the Bank and the Borrower represented by responsible
executors, authorized ministries and institutions involved to the process and Government as a whole.

Information accumulated in the form of lessons of unsuccess must be proper used. In its turn this process
requires to be controlled. Such approach will enable elimination of similar mistakes in the future.
Otherwise information will bear character of the statement only.

Division of the reasons on objective and subjective is rather relative. One of the components of subjective
reasons is organizational. It concerns both the Bank and the Borrower and it is more actually for the
period of the Project realization. Regardless of the character and the period of appearance of the impeded
Project realization problem and solving of which required agreed position, agreement process or
discussions took considerable time period. There were a lot of such moments. Obviously explanation is in
imperfect preparation of the Project, lack of forethought, reality and more detailed elaboration. From the
other side lengthy period of common position development was determined not only with considerable
bureaucracy of the both parties, but very often with lack of understanding of the essence of the problem or
concealing the real position regarding the problem. There was behind absence of flexibility in making
decisions, categoricity, and internal differences in situation evaluation, sometimes biased estimate from
the side of the Bank as well as lack of institutional memory, human resources (both manpower turnover
and deficit of professionals) and proper attention to the Project from the Borrower.

Organizational reasons are as follows:
        Lack of effective mechanism of coordination of Supervisory Board that would enable timely
           and promptly correction of the Project, determination of the problems, development of
           alternate approaches at Governmental level and efficient conduction of negotiating process
           between the Bank and Ukrainian Party on the corresponding level;
        Not always adequate evaluation of Project current situation by the Bank from the point of
           view of perspective resulted in making decisions such as forecasted delay of Project
           realization that caused delay of drawdown schedule after financing suspension. Reasonability
           of the decision made on financing suspension and its efficiency as a result);
        Lack of stable Project management structure such as PIU (as soon as foundation of similar
           valid alternative as part of the MoH is unlikely at present realities), structure with stable staff
           of well educated experts with clear functions and responsibilities for the total period of
           project realization including period of preparation and completion. Lack of clear defined
           mechanism of cooperation between PIU and corresponding MoH structures.

There is number of reasons that can be defined as related group  surface approach to Project risks
evaluation, complexity of the Project, taking into consideration responsible executors, unreadiness of
Ukrainian Party for realization of some components of the Project at the moment of the planned start of
Project realization. This concerns to:

                                                     56
           lack of common agreed position regarding approaches to tuberculosis counteraction;
           mechanism of NGO financing and their involvement to HIV-infection/AIDS prophylaxis,
            care for AIDS patients at the moment of planned start of the Project;
           necessity of opening of two special accounts for MoH and SDP that was not foreseen by the
            Loan Agreement;
           non-conformity of the few Agreement conditions to national legislation that required
            additional agreement.

Analyzing the stages of the Bank and Ukrainian Party cooperation under this Project one has the
impression that the Project is more used as the tool of political pressure than the tool of prevention of
tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS and decreasing mortality caused by tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. The most
important Project objectives were development of possibilities of responsible executors, society
elaboration of favorable position and acceptance of DOTS-strategy. Evidently the ways of achievement of
such goals has to be declared by the both parties or agreed position shall be developed before the start of
project realization.

Contribution of World Bank to tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS counteraction in Ukraine in the form of
financing the Project Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS Control in Ukraine is surely in evidence but it is
rather difficult to determine influence of this source of financing on the current situation taking into
consideration rather long time period within which the Project was prepared and realized, raise of the
other sources of funds as well as activities beyond the frames of the Project over the same period of time.

Lessons learned at the time of Project realization in the case of their effective application may be
guarantee of successful joint Projects with the World Bank in the future.

                            Report by the State Department of Prisons (SDP)
                              Implementation of the Prisons Component

        The Prisons Component was implemented in the penal system since March 2004 together with
other components of the Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS Control Project in Ukraine which are being
realized by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine.

         Under the component there was foreseen a complex of actions aimed at improving functioning of
bacteriological labs: strengthening their material and technical capacities (provision of up-to-date
equipment, furniture, consumables), ensuring modern lab diagnostics; improving professional level of
corresponding specialists by means of workshops, lectures; equipping labs according to sanitary
standards; improving level of diagnostics, recording and effectiveness of TB patients treatment as well as
awareness level on HIV/AIDS preventive measures among prisoners and staff; reducing spread risk of
this disease and ensuring prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission.
         Prisons Component consists of 2 subcomponents  Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS in prisons.

                                       Tuberculosis Subcomponent
Basic areas:
   1. Strengthening capacities

Aim: creation of automated work places for phthisiatricians with future creation of unique computer
network including central and regional personalized data base for Medical Department of the State
Department of Prisons of Ukraine (SDP) and regional medical departments, TB hospitals as well as
creation of training centers and provision of office equipment.
    To reach aims specified above, SDP procured 301 PCs, 250 faxes, 249 MFOs, office furniture,
automated 242 work places for Medical Department of SDP, Project Implementation Sector, territorial
medical departments of SDP and medical departments of investigating jails, prisons and medical
establishments of SDP. There were created and correspondingly equipped 13 training centers in regions
and 1 in SDP.

    2. Diagnostics

Aim: improvement of effectiveness of TB lab diagnostics and timely TB case detection. It was needed to
provide patients care institutions with relevant lab equipment, to train the staff on up-to-date TB case
detection, diagnostics and treatment methods.
         To reach the aim specified above, SDP received, delivered to patients care departments of SDP
and installed all lab equipment foreseen under the Prisons Component. This enabled strengthening of
material and technical capacities of 85 bacteriological labs of the 1st level (investigating jails, prisons) and
10 labs of the 3rd level (TB hospitals for prisoners). SDP conducted 4 training seminars with lab
assistants of bacteriological labs of TB hospitals (36 people trained) and 1 seminar with lab assistants of
bacteriological labs of the 1st level (medical departments of investigating jails and prisons). 25 people
were trained and certified. SDP staff that was trained under the Project (61 people) comprises 10.3% from
the planned quantity (592 people). The main reason why all planned trainings failed to be conducted is
that the majority of the individual consultants (trainers) that were awarded contracts based on the tender
refused to conclude contracts with SDP as they faced a great number of expenditures and inconveniences
connected with the procedure of Private Enterprise opening, taxation and reporting. These training
seminars were financed by the World Bank under TB and HIV/AIDS Control Project in Ukraine.
         To compensate `loses' of not conducted seminars and to improve professional level on TB of
medical staff of the penal system, SDP provided all departments of the penal system with educational
modules developed at the World Bank cost by specialists of Phthisiology and Pulmonology Institute of

                                                      58
Janovskyi Ukraine Academy of Medical Sciences. These modules were developed for each planned
seminar under the Project.

    3. Monitoring

Aim: creation of TB control system by means of timely gathering and analyzing of statistics, creation of
local computer network among Medical Department of SDP, regional medical departments, TB and
somatic hospitals, medical departments of investigating jails and correction centers, provision of vehicle
necessary for monitoring and inspection.
         To reach aims specified above, SDP conducted sampling of material (blood, sputum) in 6 TB
hospitals of the penal system and conducted research on MDR TB and HIV of TB patients in labs of
Phthisiology and Pulmonology Institute of Janovskyi Ukraine Academy of Medical Sciences and
Republican AIDS Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine. It was the first time such research was
conducted in prisons and the results received were taken as initial data that will be used in the future to
determine effectiveness level of TB and HIV/AIDS prevention measures taken.
         Unfortunately, irrespective of SDP, it was failed to create sole computer network. This activity
was foreseen by the Procurement Plan. During SDP and the World Bank representatives meetings, this
issue was repeatedly brought up and its necessity emphasized. During one of the World Bank missions in
Ukraine, World Bank specialist Alberto Gonima inspected material and technical capacities of electronic
network of SDP and Bucha correction center to define capacities of present computer network of SDP as
well as to define capacities of additional means necessary to ensure functioning of this network. Based on
results received, he prepared a corresponding report. However, no further implementation of this activity
happened. Moreover, SDP made a proposal to create such a network as a pilot project in 3-4 oblasts and
connect it with network of hospitals of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, but the World Bank
representatives did not support this idea.
         At present, information on TB and HIV/AIDS patients is recorded in a written form, however
statistical data is entered in computers that were procured under the Project and transferred via available
electronic network to the Health Department of SDP were it is processed and analyzed.
         Necessary vehicle was not procured:
              Ambulances for transportation of the infirm as well as TB and HIV/AIDS patients to
              hospitals from investigating jails and prisons after they were unbound due to serious illness as
              well as for transportation of doctors to prisons for prophylactic medical examination of
              patients as well as of TB and HIV/AIDS patients to detect concomitant diseases and to select
              patients for planned hospitalization.
              Autos for regional medical departments for Project monitoring in prisons and inspection of
              measures that are to be taken under the Project as well as for transportation of material for
              research of TB and HIV/AIDS patients to bacteriological labs of SDP from prisons were
              these were not foreseen to be conducted and regional AIDS Centers of the Ministry of Health
              of Ukraine.

This activity was also foreseen by the Procurement Plan. SDP conducted tender opening under this
package, however the evaluation of tender proposals was dragged out and soon, as proposed by the World
Bank, this activity was cancelled at all.

    4. Treatment

Aim: ensure effective treatment of active TB patients providing them with TB drugs of first and second
range.
       Under the Project the Government of Ukraine procured TB drugs of first and second range to the
amount of USD3332100 which fully ensured treatment of active TB patients.


                                                     59
        Thanks to realization of activities under the Prisons Component, that is strengthening of material
and technical capacities of bacteriological laboratories, procurement of drugs for coexistent with TB and
HIV/AIDS somatic diseases, disinfectants, bacteriological lamps, modern equipment for surgery
department of TB hospital for prisoners of Kherson oblast as well as thanks to realization of actions
foreseen by the Departmental Program of Complex TB Measures in the Prison Setting of Ukraine, such
as: better nutrition and alignment, provision with fluorography and X-ray film, full provision with
disinfectants, strengthening of material and technical capacities of TB hospitals and medical departments
of prisons, SDP reached the following results: (i) reduction of TB incidence rate in 2008 (938.6 newly
recorded per 100000 prisoners) by 53 per cent in comparison with 2003 (2013,7 newly recorded per
100,000 prisoners); (ii) reduction of TB prevalence rate by 22% (2003  5744 patients per 100,000
prisoners; 2008  4491 patients per 100,000 prisoners); (iii) reduction of TB mortality rate by 20% (2003
 103 deaths per 100,000 prisoners; 2008  71 death per 100,000 prisoners).

                                       HIV/AIDS Subcomponent

Basic areas:
   1. Preventive measures

Aim: increase motivation to safe behavior by distributing brochures, means of individual protection; by
training doctors/consultants on HIV/AIDS issues; training of trainers among prisoners.
         SDP conducted sociological survey on HIV/AIDS in prison settings of Donetsk and Ternopil
oblasts to define basic aspects necessary for compilation of brochures for different categories of prisoners
(men, women, first-time-sentenced teenagers, prisoners who are going to be dismissed soon) and for the
staff. However, individual consultants who won the tender refused to conclude contracts. At UNFPA cost,
SDP distributed 360,000 brochures on HIV/AIDS prevention.
         Under the Prisons Component, SDP conducted 2 workshops with doctors/consultants on
HIV/AIDS prevention and aspects of prior/post testing consulting. 40 doctors  40 per cent of planned
number (100 people) were trained and certified. Also SDP conducted 34 workshops with prisoners under
`equal-to-equal' program on HIV/AIDS prevention. 340 prisoners (34% of planned number 1000
prisoners) trained.
         In 2008, at UNFPA cost, SDP procured and delivered to all prison settings 600,000 condoms and
120,000 lubricants for distribution among prisoners.
          Such trends as `mother-to-child' HIV transmission as well as antiretroviral treatment of children
that were foreseen under this component lost their actuality as there were no HIV-positive pregnant
women and children in need for antiretroviral treatment in the prison settings. In case the
abovementioned categories appear, regional AIDS centers of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine will fully
provided them with all necessary medicines.


                                                    60
          Due to this, while restructuring the Project in 2006, activities foreseen by the trends mentioned
above were canceled and new activities introduced, such as procurement of drugs for opportunistic
infections of AIDS patients as well as HIV prevention under Harm Reduction Program. Under the
UNICEF Agreements concluded in 2007 and 2008, SDP procured drugs for opportunistic infections of
AIDS patients to the amount of US$1,664,900.
         It was not possible to implement such HIV/AIDS prevention measures as needle and syringe
exchange and substitution therapy in the prison settings under the Harm Reduction Program as the current
legislation of Ukraine is not adapted to such issues. In order to study these issues, Procurement Plan
approved in September 2009 foresaw hiring of three individual consultants to study possibilities of
implementing substitution therapy, to asses ART needs within the Prison Settings of Ukraine and to study
legal issues, legal framework for implementing Harm Reduction measures. After SDP received the No
Objection to the Terms of Reference, it placed on its official web-site advertisements inviting to take part
in the competition. Necessary documents were submitted only for the ART needs assessment consultant.
On November 11, 2008 SDP sent tender documents to the World Bank, however these were not given the
No Objection as there was little time left to the Closing Date of the Project  31.12.2008. Although, the
Closing Date of the Project was soon extended to April and June 2009.
         As of July 1, 2009, under the Prisons Component SDP concluded 63 contracts to the total amount
USD 5905,600, that is 57 per cent of the sum allocated (US$10,387,100). 56 contracts are fully executed.
SDP utilized US$5,722,500 which is 55.1% of the sum allocated for the Prisons Component
(US$10,387,100).

Disbursement of loan proceeds in years:
              2004  US$103,900
              2005  US$73,200
              2006  US$873,300
              2007  US$2,755,800
              2008  US$625,300
             2009  US$1,291,000

Cooperation with the World Bank
        In the process of implementation of the Project, the World Bank assisted in realization of the
Prisons Component. It was the first time in Ukraine that the Bank gave SDP (SDP tender committee)
permission as a pilot project to procure goods and services (to the amount USD300 000) under national
procedure. In 2006 under national procedure SDP procured disinfectants and medicines for treatment
coexistent with TB and HIV/AIDS diseases; in 2007  disinfectant plants, bactericide lamps, equipment
for surgery department of the TB hospital, consumables for office equipment.
        Progress under Prisons Component was checked by the World Bank team several times and the
Component was found as a leading one.
        World Bank team, Mr. Paul Birmingham, late Director, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, Mr.
Martin Raiser, Director and Mr. Armin Fidler, Health Sector Leader, visited TB hospitals for prisoners in
Donetsk, Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts and found implementation of activities under Prisons
Component on-site positive.
        We are very grateful for giving the penal system of Ukraine an opportunity to implement such a
high-level project. Thank you for your assistance in the process of its realization. We hope to have further
cooperation in future projects.

Cooperation with ministries and other organizations
        In the process of realization of the Prisons Component, SDP tightly cooperated with the Ministry
of Health of Ukraine, Ministry of Economy of Ukraine, Ministry of Finance of Ukraine, the Phthisiology
and Pulmonology Institute of Janovskyi Ukraine Academy of Medical Sciences and Republican AIDS
Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine. This cooperation was very helpful for realization of the

                                                    61
Prisons Component. In each situation that happened in the process of realization, these ministries and
organizations showed deep understanding of the problem and tried their best to find quick and effective
solutions.

Cooperation with international non-governmental organizations
        In the process of realization of the Prisons Component, SDP tightly cooperated with international
organizations, such as: WHO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNDC, UNAIDS, `VEKTOR' Informational and
Analytical Center, `Ukraina I Svit', `Blagodiinist' Mykolaiv Charitable Fund, `Stalist' Vinnytsa
Congress, `Penitentsiarna Initsiatyva' Mykolaiv Public Youth Organization. This cooperation was
connected with TB and HIV/AIDS programs, their approval, and organization of workshops.
         We are grateful for this cooperation and we hope that we will continue to implement joint TB
and HIV/AIDS activities in the penal system in the future.

Conclusion
         The Project contributed a lot to fight with such dangerous diseases as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS.
Such projects have never been implemented in the penal system before. Therefore, this Project is the
biggest one and the most important that were and have been implemented in the penal system in terms of
strengthening of material and technical capacities and allocated sum.
         Yes, at the beginning, we faced some problems. National Legislation of Ukraine was not adapted
to the World Bank procedures, specifically in terms of procurement, there was no special account.
Notwithstanding all the challenges we faced, we got wide experience which we hope will be used in
realization of future project of such level and scale.
