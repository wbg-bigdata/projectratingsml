MORUI DIU AND RECOMHENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TEE INTERNATIONAL BINK FOR RECONSTRUUCTION AND DEVELOPNENT
TO TEH EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
0N A PROPOSID LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CANEROON
FOR A POOD SECURITY PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation for a proposed loan to the
Republic of Cameroon for US$23.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan will be on standard IBRD terms with 20 years maturity.
including a 5-year grace period, at the standard variable interest rate, and will
help finance a food security project. Funds will be on-lent from the Government
to Cr6dit Poncier du Cameroun (CFC) for market infrastructure with 20 years
maturity including a S year grace period, at a fixed interest rate equal to the
current Bank rate, plus a 1.252 margin for the foreign exchange risk assumed by
the Government, while funds for training will be passed on in the form of a
grant.  CFC will charge an interest rate of at least equal to 132, providing
adequate margin for its intermediation role.  CFC loans will be repayable over
a maximum of 10 years including two years of grace.  For the aerial locust
control program in the North and Extreme North Provinces, funds will be passed
on to the Aerial Pest Control Unit (APCU) by the Government in the form of a
grant to undertake locust control activities in the two Northern Provinces.
Under the micro-projects component (FIVAC scheme), funds will be on-lent to
beneficiaries at the market interest rate (not less than 152 p.a.), with a
maximum repayment period of 4 years, for comercial projects, and at no interest,
with a maximum repayment period of 4 and 10 years for social-type and
infrastructure projects, respectively. The project will be cofinanced by the
Japanese Government.
Background
2.      The Economy.  After a period of robust growth from 1980 to 1985, the
Cameroonian economy is in the midst of an economic crisis due to sharp
deterioration in its terms of trade and falling oil production, exacerbated by
economic mismanagement.  Government intervention has been pervasive.    Until
recently, prices of both domestic and export crops were fixed and controlled, as
were intermediary marketing costs and profit margins. Regulations were imposed
on internal and external trade. The proliferation of parastatals, particularly
in the agricultural sector, attests to the extent of public intervention.
Between 1985 and 1988 per capita income fell by 22 percent. The emergence of
domestic arrears and the decline in foreign assets created a liquidity crisis in
the banking sector which exposed past imprudent lending practices, especially to
public enterprises, inadequate supervision of financial institutions, and a rigid
interest rate structure.   External competitiveness was eroded by a domestic
inflation rate higher than that of Cameroon's trading partners, and by the
appreciation of the CFAF against the U.S. dollar. Together, these factors led
to a 27 percent appreciation in the real effective exchange rate between 1985 and
1988.
3.      Agricultural Performance. The agricultural sector grew at a respectable
rate of 4.4 percent per annum in the 1965-85 period, and food production kept
pace with population growth. Since 1986, however, the economy has deteriorated,
and the agriculture sector has stagnated at best. Faced with the economic and
financial crisis and limited short-term recovery prospects, the Government has
adopted far-reaching macroeconomic and sectoral adjustment measure,.   Cost



2
reduction, rationalization of public expenditures, and increasing productivity
are central to the Government's adjustment program in all sectors. Agriculture.
livestock, and forestry production are major potential sources of growth, given
the favorable population land ratio (20 per hectare), below potential yields, and
abundant natural resources.   The recent declining trend in per capita food
production should be reversed if agriculture is to grow at 3 to 4Z p.a. The food
sub-sector's performance is critical to that of the entire sector as it accounts
for more than 502 of total agricultural production and offers interesting export
prospects to neighboring markets in Gabon and Nigeria.
4.      Food Security Position. The Government of Cameroon defines food security
as access to sufficient quantities of food to ensure a healthy and active life
for its entire population, emphasizing availability of and accessibility to food
as the main pillars of its Food Security Strategy. The country's historic food
supply self-sufficiency tends to disguise structural and natural constraints
which greatly affect the country's food security position. Low yields compared
to potential, growing population, inadequate marketing outlets and post harvest
infrastructure in storage, processing, and transportation discourage sustained
expansion in food products.   Poor infrastructure development and limited
accessibility to agricultural areas in the South and East, and natural
constraints, including recurrent droughts and endemic locust attacks in the North
and limited land capacity in highly productive areas in the West imperil the
country's food security position. Chronic food insecurity exists among the poor
with low purchasing power and limited access to health and sanitary facilities.
Malnutrition is found among children and pregnant women due to limited
nutritional education, and overburdened mothers, lacking time to adequately feed
young children.
5.      Rapid urbanization during the last decade, and an aging rural population,
places an increasing burden on the rural sector to expand food production.
Prospects for increasing food production are favorable given Cameroon's wide
range of agro-climatic resources, presently low yields compared to potential, and
relatively free marketing system. However, inadequate marketing outlets and
post-harvest facilities for storage, preservation, processing, and transportation
discourage sustained expansion in food products. Preventive and curative health
and nutrition programs have suffered severe budgetary cuts during the current
financial crisis. Thus, the ability to assure access to a normal diet and a
productive life to all members of households in Cameroon appears precarious in
the medium term.   Food imports, which have risen rapidly since 1980, are
projected to increeie unless appropriate measures are taken to remove supply
constraints, and to compensate local production for exchange rate distortions and
dumping from food surplus countries.
6.      Past and Recent Strategy. Past public investments were oriented towards
increasing production through financing crop and development parastatals with
limited development  impact.   Marketing interventions have been aimed at
regulating food prices and supply, with very little result. Inadequate attention
has been devoted to basic and maternal/child health care, and nutrition education
has been largely neglected. Non-governmental programs to improve food security
are concentrated mainly in rural areas, are ad hoc and respond to the needs of
limited groups in certain areas.
7.      Recognizing the above problems, the Government has revised its food
security strategy, with Bank assistance.    The Government's food security



3
strategy emphasizes agricultural growth as a basic ingredient for food security.
Removal of supply constraints shall be achieved through agricultural
intensification, which focusses on improving agricultural productivity of a
significant number of farmers, particularly women, through improved national
agricultural research and extension services.   Food distribution shall be
improved by reinforcing the existing liberal marketing onvironment for foodstuffs
through better market information, removing infrastructure bottlenecks, upgrading
marketing facilities, increasing on-farm and village-level storago, and promoting
food transformation. The transitory food insecurity problem in the North will
be partly addressed through the establishment of an early warning system for
drougbts and other phenomena which adversely affect agriculture, contingency
plass to be activated in time of drought, and a locust control program.
8.      Removal of demand constzaints will be achieved by increasing purchasing
power, particularly that of the poor, through income generating activities in
rural areas.   Improving the nutritional status of the population will be
accomplished through nutritional education, reinforcing basic and maternalichild
health care and increasing nutrition ingredient knowledge of local foods.
Institutional food programs should be encouraged only when there is an ability
to manage it and should be done by the private sector. A liberal food marketing
environment shall be maintained, and food imports and exports liberalized over
time. Domestic production of foodstuffs subject to international dumping and
export subsidies will be protected through tariff-cum-subsidy schemes.
9.      Implementation of Food Security Strategy.  The Government has begun
implementing the above strategy through various policy and investment decisions.
Under the Structural Adjustment Program, the Government is in the process of
liberalizing food imports except rice,  sugar and palm oil.   Quantitative
restrictions on imports of these comnodities will be phased out in the longer
term when the tariff-cum-subsidy schemes for such crops prove to be effective.
The Government has decided to restructure the Office C4rdalier (0C) to permit it
to play its role in regulating food supply and price, a mandate which OC has
failed to achieve in the past.  Moreover, these regulatory actions require
massive subsidies which cannot be sustained during a period of severe financial
constraint. Therefore, the Government will be requested to minimize public
expenditure on OC, and to encourage private and village level initiatives in
stabilizing price and food supply.
10.     The Government is implementing programs with a view to improving
agricultural productivity under the National Agricultural Research Project (FY87)
and National Agricultural Extension and Training Project (FY90), with special
emphasis on crop management and processing, much of which falls within the realm
of women farmers. Improving the nutritional status of the population through
better monitoring information, and reinforcing child and maternal health care
centers are to be implemented under the Social Dimensions of Adjustment Project
(FY90). The proposed project will complete implementation of the strategy by
increasing food marketing efficiency and distribution, and supporting income
generating, social and infrastructure micro-projects.

Rationale for 1)11D Involvement.
11.     The Bank has been instrumental in helping the Government formulate and
implement its food security strategy through various instruments mentioned above.
The project will round out the Bank's involvement in food security forming an
integral part of the structural adjustment strategy by cutting costs in the
economy, alleviating the negative impact of adjustment measures on the
population's accessibility to food, and fostering participation of the poor in
the growth process. A number of donors are committed to supporting food security
but have yet to make investments due to the lack of well-defined action programs.
The Bank shall play a catalytic role in translating the Governmeat strategy into
activities which would have a sustainable impact on the long term food security
position of the country, and through the proposed project provide a vehicle for
mobilizing donor  support.    Intervention under the proposed project will
complement specific action programs carried out by BGos in their spheres of
operation and will employ NGOs, where feasible, for training of staff and farmer
groups, and disseminating new technology.
12.     Project Objectives and Descrlption.  The objective of the project is to
improve access to and availability of food by creating opportunities for
increasing employment and incomes of the poor, especially of omen's groups,
addressing food marketing constraints, averting crop loss due to pest attacks,
and improving feeding and dietary practices of children and women. This will be
done through the following componentes (a) self-help micro-projects by rural
com.rtnity groups for cash-generating commercial activities (e.g. retailing,
manufacturing), non-cash generating social-type investments and infrastructure
improvements (e.g. processing and transformation equipment, storage facilities,
wells for water supply, rural tracks, and fish ponds); and provision of training
for staff and commmnity groups in preparing and implementing micro-projects;
financing of the social and infrastructure investments will be subject to capital
reconstitution and cost recovery, while cash-generating investments will be
financed through credits, subject to reimbursement of principal and interest; (b)
an anti-locust program, focusing on the two Northern Provinces; (c) imaroving
market facilities in secondar, cities and rural areas; (d) establishing an
operational early warning  system  and a nationwide  pricing  and marketin&
information system; and (e) developing and implementing a pilot nutrition
education program through research, testing and dissemination of nutrition
messages in high risk population groups as a basis of formulating a national
nutrition education strategy. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
presented in Schedule A.  Procurement methods and disbursements are provided in
Schedule B.   Details on various aspects of Project are available in Staff
Appraisal Report No. 9048-CM.
13.     Risks.  The main risk lies in the complexity in project implementation
and supervision due to the multisectoral nature of the project. Concentrating
the implementation of most of the components under one single ministry and
involving qualified NGOs at the field level will facilitate project
implementation and supervision. Other risks are associated with the capacity of
the financial intermediary to manage the line of credit to municipalities, and
the latter's ability to direct market construction projects and repay loans. The
Government has recently approved changes in municiptlities' budgetary procedures
providing for loan repayment guarantees.   Implicating a viable financial
Intermediary, the Credit Foncier du Cameroun. in the management of the credit
line and provision for training of CFC and councils' staff will reduce the risk



S
attached to this component. narmers' respect for project management guidelines
and reconstituting funds is another risk under the project. Use of peer pressure
among groups as veil as famers' collective assets will provide a guarantee for
recovery of funde. Recovery of funds wil1 be administered at the local level by
sponsoring agencies, including NGOs, who will be supervising several groups at
a time, rotating funds among groups and using group pressure to reconstitute
capital.  Group leaders' training in mngement will mitigate the risk of
associating farmers in the implementation of the micro-projects scheme. Although
the proposed project does not finance pesticides, their use by APCU under the
locust-control program poses a potential environmental hazard. Adoption of Bank
guidelines for the sofe use of pesticides wos agreed to during negotiations.
14.     Benefits.  The project  ill improve food distribution and hence reduce
the cost of food to consumers, increase producers' income be averting loss from
locust attacks, provide incentives to increased production and consumption of
food produced domestically, create employment opportunities and increase incomes
of the poor. By supporting marketing, processing, and transformation activities,
the project will also help reduce the time devoted by women to these tasks,
enabling them to dedicate more time to family nutrition and child care. Most
importantly, the project will encourage self-help initiatives and respond to
community needs. The demand-driven character of the micro-projects component is
expected to be a major factor in ensuring project success. The EU for sub-
projects (micro-projects, market infrastructure projects) is 15X.
15.     Actions Agreed. Agreements which have been reached with the Government
during negotiations are: (a) annual work plans and budgets; (b) final operating
procedures for rural micro-projects; (c) establishing criteria for market
rehabilitation and construction; and (d) adoption of Bank guidelines for use of
pesticides. Prior to loan effectiveness the following actions will be takens (a)
the trade regime will be amended to provide for removal of prior authorization
for exports of animals, animl products and fishery products, and simplification
of requirements for registration of exporters of food products with MINDIC; (b)
execution of a work agreement satisfactory to the Bank between MINSANTE and the
selected NCO in charge of assisting in the implementation of the nutrition
component; Ic) execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government
and CFC; (d) execution of a grant agreement between the Government and APCU; le)
appointment of qualified DEAPA staff for the coordination unit of the Early
Warning and Market Information System; appointment of a qualified national
coordinator for MINSANTE for the nutrition component; and appointment of key
administrative staff at the central level for the micro-project. Disbursements
after October 1 of each year under the micro-project component will be subject
to Bank's satisfaction with progress of activities and audits of accounts during
the previous year and approval of the detailed work program for the following
year. A mid-term evaluation of the micro-project component will be undertaken.
16.      avwiromental Impact.   To mitigate the potential for health andlor
environmental damage from pesticide applications, the following safeguards would
be includeds (a) only those pesticides approved by FAO will be used; (b) Bank
procurement and application guidelines for safe use of pesticides will be
followed; and (c) the ongoing FAO training program in safe handling, which in the
past has coincided with the anti-locust campaign, will continue. Other project
activities are environmentally benipn.
