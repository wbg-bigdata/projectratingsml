GHANA
NATIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                 Republic of Ghana
Beneficiary:              The Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG) and The Volta River
Authority (VRA)
Amount                    SDR 55.2 million (US$80 million equivalent)
Terms:                    Standard IDA, with 40 year maturity
Relending Terms:          The Government would relend SDR 28.44 million (US$41.22
million equivalent) to ECG and SDR 26.21 million (US$37.98
million equivalent) to VRA for 20 years, including 5-year grace
period at the prevailing IBRD interest rate. ECG and VRA , ould
bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project Description:      The project is comprised of three main components: (i) a portion
of a time slice (1993 to 1997) of the investment program defined
under an IDA-financed National Electrification Planning Study
(NEPS), which would include connection to the national power
grid of all of the district capitals that are not supplied from the
grid; (ii) re-inforcement of the ECG's existing distribution network
by expanding substations, and building or replacing major links
between substations; and (iii) institutional strengthening of ECu
through regrouping of all its commercial activities under one
Directorate and hiring an outside firm under a performance-based
management contract to run this new Directorate.
Project Benefits and Risks:  The proposed project will help: (a) provide the relatively
inexpensive hydro-generated electricity from the national grid to
small urban centers and rural areas in different regions of the
country, which would assist the Government to bring more of the
benefits of the recent economic growth to the regions, and
accelerate the socio-economic development of areas outside of the
major urban centers; (b) improve the reliability of ECG's existing
distribution network which is being constrained by rapid growth in
demand for electricity; and (c) implement institutional reform of
ECG to improve its efficiency which is required to make the utility
a commercially viable entity.
One major risk of the project is that it may overburden ECG's
commercial operations and further contribute to ECG's weak
financial position. This is being addressed through proposed
institutional reform. Also, adequate and timely tariff increases is a
potential risk which is being addressed through an upfront tariff
increase and establishment of a tariff formula.

GHANA
NATIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
A. Energy Resources and Consumption
1.01         Ghana has substantial energy resources, of which fuelwood and hydropower are
the most important. About 18.3 million hectares are under tree cover, equivalent to three
quarters of the country's land area, of which about 8.8 million hectares is forest. The high forest
zone is concentrated in the southwest, where most of the timber industry is located. The northern
savanna woodland has less timber potential, but is the most important source of domestic
fuelwood. Deforestation is a growing problem in this area and fuelwood scarcities are beginning
to develop as a result. This issue is being addressed under the Ghana Environmental Action Plan
and the Ghana Forest Resource Management Project.
1.02         Ghana's hydroelectric potential has been the subject of many studies, some dating
from the 1920s but which have mainly covered specific projects or regions. The country's total
technically exploitable hydro potential is estimated at 10,000 GWh annually (2,300 MW installed
capacity), derived mainly from three major river systems (Volta, Tano, Pra) in the central and
western regions. The presently installed hydro plant capacity is 1,072 MW, based on two dams
on the Volta River. Other sites on the Black Volta, Pra, Tano and Oti rivers have been studied to
pre-feasibility stage and one of these, Bui (300 MW and 1,175 GWh) has been studied to full
feasibility level. There has been a comprehensive, country-wide survey of small hydro potential,
and some recently identified sites could possibly provide an economic supply to isolated centers.
Offshore deposits of both crude oil and natural gas have been identified, but their size and
commercial viability remains to be confirmed. Ghana has no known deposits of coal. Solar
energy is plentiful with most regions receiving in excess of 1,900 hours of annual sunshine. This
potential has not yet been exploited to any extent. Wind regimes are moderate, and insufficient
for energy purposes based on existing technology.
1.03         Net domestic energy consumption in 1990 1/ is estimated at 4.165 million toe,
rather low given the structure of the economy and its favorable energy resource endowment. The
bulk of consumption is woodfuel and agricultural residues (69.5%) followed by petroleum
products (20.4%), and electricity (9.9%). Households and commerce accounted for 65 percent of
domestic energy consumption, industry/mining 17.4 percent, and transportation 12.6 percent. An
overall energy balance for Ghana is contained in Annex 1-1. Petroleum products and electricity
consumption increased steadily throughout the 1970s and early 1980s despite the deteriorating
economy, spurred by subsidized petroleum products and low real prices for electricity. However,
consumption declined sharply after 1982 because of shortages of both petroleum and electricity,
but have since recovered as supply conditions returned to normal.
1/    1990 is the most recent year of consolidated energy supply and demand data for Ghana.

B.  Energy Sector Organization
1.04          The Ministry of Energy (MOE) has principal responsibility for petroleum and
electricity; it establishes and implements sector policy. MOE supervises the state-owned Ghana
National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), Ghana Oil Corporation (GOIL), and the refining
company Ghanaian Italian Petroleum Corporation (GHAIP), as well as the two power sector
entities -- the Volta River Authority (VRA) and the Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG).
VRA supplies electricity in bulk to ECG, the Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO), several
mines, the Akosombo Textile Company, and Akosombo Township. VRA also exports electricity
to Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB) and Energie Electrique de la Cote d'Ivoire (EECI).
Under the IDA-assisted Northern Grid Extension Project (Credit 1759-GH) of February 1987, the
responsibility for generating and distributing electricity in Northern Ghana was transferred to
VRA from ECG. These responsibilities are handled by VRA's Northern Electricity Department
(NED). ECG distributes the electricity it receives from VRA throughout the rest of Ghana.
1.05          Since its foundation in 1961, VRA has operated as a quasi-enclave within Ghana,
enjoying a high degree of autonomy. VRA is a relatively well-run public utility with few
institutional and financial problems. ECG, which is a much larger organization, was set up in
1967 to succeed the Electricity Division of the Ministry of Works and Housing, but has never
satisfactorily made the transition from a Government department to a commercially viable
enterprise, and it is yet to establish itself as an autonomous and effective public utility. In an
effort to improve performance of the power sector, the Electricity Supply Board of Ireland (ESB),
acting as consultant to GOG, studied the situation in 1985 and concluded that a merger of VRA
and ECG offered the best prospect for the future development of the sector. GOG, with the
concurrence of IDA, considered that a merger would have strained VRA's capabilities,
particularly at a time when it was embarking upon a major expansion program in northern Ghana.
ECG's position was extremely weak, both financially and managerially, and required major
reforms and external assistance to establish it as a sound public utility. Consequently, the merger
did not proceed but was retained as one of several sector organization options, to be considered in
the light of ECG's performance over the next few years. Meanwhile, attention has been focussed
upon sector reforms and other measures needed to strengthen ECG. With ESB's assistance,
progress has been made in technical operations under the Power System Rehabilitation Project
(Credit 1628-GH) and ECG Fifth Power Project (Credit 2061-GH). However, ECG's commercial
operations needs substantial improvement. To improve commercial operations of ECG, a
performance-based management contract with a private firm will be financed under the proposed
project (para. 1.21).
C.  Energy Policy and Pricingi
1.06          Government policy in the energy sector is designed to: (i) reduce the cost of
energy supplies to the economy through rehabilitation and proper maintenance of installations in
the petroleum and electricity sub-sectors; (ii) reduce dependence on petroleum imports through
promotion of more efficient energy use and proper pricing; (iii) improve forestry management to
provide an adequate long-term supply of fuelwood; and (iv) strengthen sector institutions through
a program of public enterprise reform focusing on commercialization.
1.07          Prices of petroleum products and electricity fell sharply in real terms from the
mid-1970s till 1983, as a result of Governmental energy pricing management, which failed to
fully reflect in petroleum product and electricity prices the extent of high domestic inflation or to



- 3 -
adjust for over-valued exchange rates during that period. After the major devaluation of the cedi
in 1983, domestic energy prices were increased very sharply to bring them back into line with
their international equivalents. Subsequent increases in petroleum prices have kept up with the
successive devaluations until early 1991. Petroleum product prices are now within the range of
international levels and are unsubsidized. Electricity pricing is discussed below (paras. 1.22).
D.  Existing Electricity Supplv Facilities
1.08         Ghana's total installed public generating capacity is about 1,122 MW of which
1,072 MW (95%) is hydroelectric from two stations on the Volta River at Akosombo (912 MW),
and Kpong (160 MW). Both stations are owned by VRA and are capable of providing firm
energy (in 49 years out of 50) of about 4800 GWh/year and can deliver 6100 GWh/year on
average. The Akosombo Power Stations will be retrofitted under the ongoing VRA Sixth Power
Project. Total diesel capacity is less than 50 MW of which Tema (30 MW) is the largest and is
currently being rehabilitated with U.K. financing and is expected to become operational in 1993.
The remainder comprises a number of small isolated stations which are being retired under the
ECG Fifth Power project.
1.09         Ghana's transmission system comprises over 2,100 km of 161 kV lines. Eight
circuits of 67 km each connect the Akosombo and Kpong hydro plants to the VALCO smelter at
Tema and to other industrial loads, while a 650 km transmission loop supplies ECG and mines in
southern Ghana. A 161 kV double circuit line provides an interconnection with CEB, connecting
Akosombo to Lome, Togo. The Cote d'Ivoire was interconnected in 1983 through a 225 kV
transmission line capable of supplying a demand of 100 MW.
1.10         ECG distributes power in the urban centers located within an interconnected grid
in the southern part of Ghana. ECG's facilities comprise a number of 33 kV subtransmission
systems, feeding power from VRA's transmission system, and a number of 11 kV distribution
systems. In recent years, service within the distribution system has deteriorated due largely to
poor maintenance and inadequate reinforcement of the distribution system. These problems are
now being addressed under ECG Fifth Power Project and the distribution system rehabilitation
would be completed by 1994.
E. Trends and Pattern of Electricity Consumption and Exports
1.11         Domestic and export sales of electricity since 1985 are detailed in Annex 1-2.
The main categories of electricity sales are VRA's sales to ECG and NED, VRA's sales to
VALCO, VRA's sales to neighboring countries and ECG and NED retail sales to domestic
consumers. Until the severe drought of 1982/84, when electricity supplies were seriously
curtailed, about 75 percent of sales were for export to neighboring countries and to the VALCO
aluminum smelter. During the drought the latter was completely shutdown and supplies to CEB
and to ECG were reduced. Total system sales fell from 5071 GWh in 1981 to 1594 GWh in
1984. Since 1985 supplies have been restored to all customers.
1.12         Sales to VALCO recovered from very low levels over 1984 and 1985 to exceed
2100 GWh from 1986 onward. Maximum energy assigned to VALCO is now 2760 GWh
annually, for four potlines, with the right of first refusal for any additional available energy, at a
price to be negotiated. VALCO's expected annual consumption is about 2760 GWh. ECG's
sales fell sharply as a result of supply restrictions from 1005 GWh in 1981 to 723 GWh in 1984,



- 4 -
but have since recovered to about 1500 GWh in 1991, in part assisted by the improvements under
the ongoing rehabilitation project. ECG's total system losses (i.e., technical and non-technical
losses) in 1991 were reported to be 20 percent of energy purchased from VRA. This is expected
to be reduced as a result of the ongoing rehabilitation of the ECG's network and the
improvements in its commercial operations expected under the project (para. 1.21).
1.13         VRA pioneered electricity supply across national boundaries in Western Africa
and established links with CEB in Togo/Benin (1972) and with EECI in Cote d'Ivoire (1984).
Sales to neighboring countries declined from 684 GWh in 1985 to 301 GWh in 1988, following
the commissioning of CEB's Nangbeto hydrostation, but grew to 526 GWh in 1989, 737 GWh in
1990, and 788 GWh in 1991. These exports are covered by two contracts: (i) a firm contract
with CEB (expiring in 1994) providing CEB with up to 438 GWh per year, and (ii) a contract
with CIE in Cote d'Ivoire (to be renegotiated in 1993) providing for annual determination of the
contract volume. The future volume of these exports depends upon VRA's ability to supply
energy and capacity, CEB's and CIE's internal supply capability, the continuation of a large
enough cost advantage in VRA's favor to make the continuation of this trade worthwhile, and the
importers' confidence in the reliability of the supply arrangement, which to date has not been a
problem. Over the next several years, there is a question about the adequacy of supply to sustain
recently experienced export volumes, given high domestic load growth and the forthcoming
Akosombo retrofit. Cote d'Ivoire is also contemplating the development of its off-shore natural
gas resource and gas turbine electricity generators, which could displace VRA sales to CIE;
however, the evolution of this project may be slow. These exports make an important
contribution to VRA's revenues, insofar as export prices are about five times greater than the bulk
supply tariff to ECG. Hence, as domestic loads grow relative to export loads, the adequacy of
domestic pricing arrangements becomes a more important consideration for VRA's financial
health.
1.14         The domestic load has experienced high growth from the mid-1980s to now, and
this upward pressure of demand is expected to continue through the mid-1990s, as the system is
progressively improved and the economy continues to grow. With the electrification of northern
Ghana, NED demand is expected to quadruple by the year 2000. VRA's and ECG's forecast of
the load growth and the corresponding energy (GWh) and capacity (MW) balances through year
2001 are detailed at Annex 1-3 and Annex 1-4.
F. Access to Electricity Service
1.15         In Ghana about 24 percent of the population has access to electricity.3/ ECG has
about 324,000 customers, 67 percent of whom are concentrated in the three cities of Accra,
Kumasi and Tema. VRA has about 30,000 customers in northern Ghana and also supplies a small
number of major customers directly from the grid. About 78 percent of ECG's customers are
classified as residential and 22 percent are non-residential, with less than one percent classified as
industrial. ECG's sales (kWh) are about 51 percent to residential, 14 percent to non-residential
and 33 percent to industrial customers. Residential customers generate about 38 percent of ECG's
sales revenues, while non-residential and industrial customers account for 28 percent and 34
percent, respectively.

G. Power Sector Objectives. Strategy and Development
1.16         Energy sector issues were examined in considerable detail in a recently completed
Energy Sector Review prepared by IDA. This sector review report was discussed with the
Government of Ghana in June 1992. During appraisal, a draft Letter of Power Sector
Development Policy dealing with various issues identified and analyzed in the Energy Sector
Report was reviewed with the Government. Before negotiations, the Government submitted to
IDA a Letter of Power Sector Development Policy which is given in Annex 1-5. Ghana
Government has embarked upon an ambitious program of economic growth, a major element of
which is the reform of the public enterprise sector. Under this program ECG and VRA are key
public utilities to be commercialized. For many years VRA has been a relatively autonomous,
financially viable and well-run entity; attention is now focussed upon bringing ECG to a similar
standard. The ultimate objective is a financially viable, well-managed sector, whose institutions
enjoy a high degree of autonomy and are capable of delivering a reliable and economic supply of
electricity. Specific measures identified in the Letter of Sector Development Policy to facilitate
the achievement of these commercialization objectives include:
(a)    Depoliticizing the tariff making process using a formula-based approval (para.
1.26 and Annex 1-10); the Government should also consider establishing a
regulatory approach operating at arms length from the political process;
(b)   Improving the internal efficiency of critical commercial operations in ECG, by
ECG engaging a contractor on the basis of a performance-based management
contract to revamp billing, collection and customer relations;
(c)    Engaging a consultant to recommend a scheme of service for both utilities,
including matters such as staff deployment, renumeration levels, incentive
schemes, sanctions, and any other such matters likely to affect the motivation and
efficiency of the utilities' personnel.
1.17         Improving the sector's efficiency and delivery capability is now of the highest
priority. As a result of a renegotiated contract with VALCO in 1984, VRA is now better able to
protect the domestic market against power restrictions than in the past, by reducing supplies to
VALCO in years of poor rainfall. Reliability of the present Akosombo units has deteriorated in
recent years and studies confirmed that VRA needed to undertake a major retrofitting of the 25
year-old Akosombo hydroplant to avoid the risk of major breakdowns. This work is now being
carried out under the VRA Sixth Power Project. VRA's investment program (1992-1999)
totalling about US$870 million equivalent is set out at Annex 1-6. A major component of this
investment program is an addition of up to 400 MW of thermal capacity (combustion turbines) to
VRA's generation capacity. To clearly demonstrate the economic and technical viability of this
investment, VRA has prepared a feasibility study which is under review. To improve the service
reliability and development of the sub-transmission and distribution network which had
deteriorated because of poor maintenance and under investment caused by lack of access to
foreign exchange, with the assistance from IDA, ECG has embarked on a major rehabilitation of
its system under the ongoing ECG 5th Power Project. The proposed project also includes a
component to complement the rehabilitation work to be carried out under ECG 5th Power Project
and provide for system reinforcement to meet the larger than expected growth in demand for
electricity. The ECG's investment program (1992-1999) totalling about US$470 million
equivalent is set out in Annex 1-7.



- 6 -
1.18          A major GOG long-term (30 year) goal is to provide electricity to most of the
population, by extending the interconnected transmission grid to small towns and rural areas
throughout Ghana under a National Electrification Scheme (NES) . The implementation of NES
which began in earnest in 1989, has focussed on the District Capital Electrification Program
(DCEP) which aims at connecting all the 110 district capitals in the country to the national
electricity grid; and on the Self-Help Electrification Program (SHEP) under which villages/towns
within 20 km of the national grid are connected to the grid after they have made material
contributions (poles, labor) to the construction of the lines. With mainly bilateral assistance from
other countries (e.g., Japanese and India), twenty district capitals have been provided with
electricity supply from the national grid, in addition to sixty other towns/villages along the supply
routes and surrounding areas of these district capitals. In addition to this, about 180 towns and
villages have also been connected to the national electricity grid through the SHEP program. In
order to establish a sound framework for development of NES, including appropriate policies and
standards, and to identify priority programs for the extension of the grid to unelectrified areas of
Ghana in accordance with satisfactory economic criteria, a National Electrification Planning Study
(NEPS) was prepared under the ECG Fifth Power Project. The electrification component of the
proposed project is based on the NEPS and comprises investment identified in the early phase of
the study, by taking into account not only the economically optimal timing of the electrification of
each area within the program, but also the Government's priority to electrify district capitals and
maintain some regional balance in the progress of electrification.
H. Private Sector ParticiDation
1.19          One major institutional issue facing the power sector is the management of ECG's
commercial operations (i.e., metering, billing, revenue collections) which need be strengthened
substantially. In line with the Government's objective of commercializing ECG mentioned above,
ECG's management has now focused on improving ECG's commercial operations through
participation of the private sector in these areas of its operations. ECG with the assistance of
ESB, with whom it has a twinning arrangement, has examined the problem and identified
shortcomings in: (i) meter control (compliance with the customer recording and control system);
(ii) customer data base (accuracy, application of proper tariff, elimination of unmetered supplies,
independent testing of SLT metering and clearance of queries/rejections from data processing);
(iii) meter reading (observance of reading cycles, and minimization of no-access cases); (iv)
billing system (inability to generate appropriate customer information); and (v) disconnection of
non-paying customers (timely and indiscriminate disconnection). The addition of new and widely
dispersed customers through the expansion of the ECG network under the proposed project may
over-burden ECG and further contribute to weakening ECG's financial position if its commercial
operations do not improve.
1.20          ECG has already taken or is considering a number of measures to address these
problems. It has accepted a proposal from ESB to adapt ESB's own billing system to suit ECG's
requirements. The new system would require approximately 18 months to be operational. Also
with bilateral financing from France, ECG intends to clean up its consumer data base. To
address the other issues, ECG has begun to hire private contractors for meter reading, and it is
contemplating contracting out some other functions, such as meter installation and bill
distribution. Nevertheless, the process is painstakingly slow, it dilutes responsibility among
several parties and leaves some issues unresolved, notably those referring to the validation of the
customer data base, revenue collection and disconnection for non-payment. Although entrusting
more commercial functions to different private parties would improve the present state of affairs,

-7-
appropriate incentives are needed to achieve adequate and sustainable improvements in reducing
losses and disconnect those who do not pay for the service that they receive.
1.21          During the appraisal agreement was reached with the Government and ECG that
adequate and sustainable improvements can be achieved by involving the private sector in a more
comprehensive fashion, through a performance-based management contract to run the commercial
operations of ECG. ECG's management has proposed: (i) to reorganize the utility by grouping
all the commercial activities which are now under two different Directors (i.e Operations and
Finance) under a new Directorate of Customer Services, and (ii) with bilateral financing from
France hire the Electricite du France (EDF) under a performance-based management contract to
run the new Directorate of Customer Services. See Annex 1-8 for the proposed organizational
structure of the new Directorate of Customer Services. Under the performance-based
management contract, the contractor (i.e. EDF team) will be given the necessary and sufficient
authority to manage the commercial operations of ECG, and the contractor's remuneration will be
linked to its performance. The management contractor will be under the overall direction of the
ECG's Managing Director. With bilateral financing from CCCE, ECG expects to have the
management contractor in place in a relatively short time. ECG also requested IDA to finance
under the project's PPF, services of an expert or a consultancy firm to advise and assist ECG on
the management contract and in negotiations with the contractor. ECG's proposal and request
were reviewed favorably by the appraisal team. During negotiations, agreement was reached on
the main elements of the performance contract and the nature of the performance indicators to be
used, as well as a draft terms of reference for the services of the expert to assist ECG with the
management contract. These documents are provided in Annex 1-9. An expert to assist ECG
with review and negotiations of the management contract has been hired with financing from the
project's PPF. Signing of a performance-based management contract satisfactory to IDA is a
condition of Credit effectiveness.
I. Electricity Tariffs
1.22          Consistent with GOG's goal to provide an efficient, economic, and affordable
supply of electricity to the whole country, a high priority is accorded to the mobilization of
resources from within the sector by charging tariffs sufficient to cover supply costs, to contribute
a reasonable portion of investment costs and to earn a reasonable return on invested capital.
Hence, under their respective statutes, ECG and VRA are required to operate in a commercial
manner. However, the Government must approve tariff changes and in recent years, electricity
tariffs have not kept pace with the substantial increases in costs associated, in particular, with
major Cedi devaluations. Partly for this reason, ECG has experienced difficulties in meeting its
financial obligations, including those to VRA, whose position has been cushioned by its
substantial foreign currency earnings from VALCO, CEB and EECI.
1.23          In an attempt to put the sector on a sound financial footing, consultants (Coopers
& Lybrand, U.K.) were commissioned in 1986 to undertake a tariff study of the power sector.
The objective was to develop tariffs which reflect the economic, i.e., long run marginal costs
(LRMC) of supply, and which at the same time are affordable, generate sufficient revenue to
ensure financial viability, and are easy to administer. GOG agreed to adopt a uniform national
tariff structure, based on LRMC principles. For 1988, the level of tariffs recommended by the
consultants were substantially adopted following a review by MOE, ECG and VRA and
approximated about 75 percent of LRMC. In order to ensure the financial viability of the power
sector, GOG has also established a target rate of return of at least 8 percent on currently valued



- 8 -
net fixed assets in operation. Tariffs adopted for 1989 were designed to enable VRA to continue
to earn an 8 percent and ECG a 6 percent rate of return, as agreed under the Fifth Power Project.
Increases ranged from 6 percent for low-income consumers to 20 percent for non-residential
users. In fixing tariffs for 1989 GOG expressed serious concern at the prospect of further
adjustments to domestic tariffs to reflect recent devaluation and inflationary pressures at a time
when the service remains unreliable. While maintaining its commitment to previously agreed
tariff objectives, GOG wished to re-examine certain aspects of the 1986 tariff study in the light of
developments since then. A comprehensive tariff study, financed by CIDA, was undertaken to
address the GOG's concerns and was completed in February 1992. 4/
1.24          The study calculated the LRMC of Ghana's power system on the basis of a load
forecast similar to that in this report, tested the sensitivity of LRMC to the implementation of the
NES, and determined that there are very large gaps between current tariffs and tariffs which
would reflect LRMC with or without the NES. These alternative tariffs are shown in Table 1-1.
The gap between actual and LRMC tariffs is very large. The "Full Financial" tariff shown in
Table 1-1 is that needed for the utilities to strictly meet all of the conditions of their current
financial covenants. There is very little difference between the LRMC tariff and the "Full
Financial" tariff. Approximately 27 percent of LV LRMC is incremental generation cost, and the
remainder is HV and LV transmission and distribution cost, and other expenses for rehabilitation,
maintenance and system improvements.

1.25           The tariff study spells out the consequences of "deferring the problem", that is,
not implementing any tariff change:
- The utilities would be unable to meet even their most basic financial requirements.
- It would be difficult, if not impossible, to raise money to cover expansion or basic
cash flow needs.
" - The power sector would face the risk of defaulting on loans unless government
bailouts could be ensured..."
This is a realistic prognosis.
1.26           The process of preparing the tariff study and its recommendations has resulted in
Ghana Government implementing positive steps to reduce the identified gap between the 1991
tariff and the LRMC of supply. As of January 1992, new electricity tariffs were introduced (see
Annex 1-10) which have the following main features:
(i)    the residential tariff increased from about 20 percent to 30 percent of LRMC;
(ii)    ECG's non-residential tariff reflects LRMC; and



- 10-
(iii)  the LV and HV industrial tariffs moved from 26 percent and 33 percent of LRMC
to about 42 percent and 54 percent of LRMC respectively in the case of ECG, and
to about 70 percent of LRMC in the case of VRA.
Furthermore, Ghana Government has asked the utilities to construct a tariff formula for making
further progress toward overall attainment and maintenance of electricity prices at LRMC. The
Government has also welcomed IDA's advice on this matter. Tariff formulas presented in Annex
1- 11 were discussed with the Government and the Utilities during the appraisal. The formulas
provide for phasing-in current tariffs to LRMC adjusting for inflation and exchange rate
movement from 1991 onward. Apart from these adjustments, the 1991 LRMC calculation could
change, particularly on account of changes in projections of load growth and thermal energy
requirements. Azreement has been reached (a) upon a formula procedure to set and adjust
electricity tariffs; and, (b) that beyond 1993, each year's tariff must be high enough so that each
utility earns at least 8 percent rate of return on net revalued assets in operation (see paras. 2.11
and 2.33). It is the Government's intention that the tariff approximate LRMC by 1996 and
remain at LRMC thereafter.
J. Bank Role in the Power Sector
1.27         The Bank Group has been closely involved in the development of Ghana's power
sector, with eight lending operations in the past 30 years. Since 1961, three Bank loans to VRA
have assisted in the financing of the Akosombo and Kpong dams and power plants and recent
Credits (1628-GH and 1759-GH) have helped VRA rehabilitate its system and extend grid supply
to northern Ghana. Under the ongoing VRA Sixth Power Project (Credit 2109-GH), assistance is
provided for a major overhaul of Akosombo hydro generation facilities. Lending to ECG began
soon after its formation in 1967 and currently, the ECG Fifth Power Project (Credit 2061-GH) is
assisting with improvement of ECG's network in the major urban centers. Bank Group lending
for power projects in Ghana has helped finance virtually all the major sector investments since
Ghana's independence. The Bank's participation in the Akosombo and Kpong hydro generation
projects and the ongoing Northern Grid Extension Project was especially important in mobilizing
the large amounts of cofinancing needed for these ambitious projects.
1.28         The Bank Group has been closely associated with Ghana's power sector for almost
30 years. Since Ghana embarked on its economic recovery program in mid-1980s, IDA's
objective has been to help remove the power sector as a potential constraint to the country's
economic development and to assist the Government in developing a financially viable and well-
managed sector, whose institutions enjoy a high degree of autonomy and are capable of delivering
a reliable and economic supply of electricity. In recent years, under several completed and
ongoing projects financed by IDA, the Government has embarked on rehabilitating and improving
Ghana's power generation and distribution facilities and it is very keen on IDA's further
assistance to extend the benefits of power supply to more of the population. IDA's continued
participation in the sector through the proposed project is justified in order to assist the authorities
to develop a sound national electrification program, to expand the social and developmental
benefits of electricity to more of the population, facilitate the development of a more balanced
distribution of economic productive activity across the country, act as catalyst to facilitate co-
financing, and encourage the strengthening of utility commercial structures essential for the health
of the power sector in general and the electrification program in particular.

II. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
A. Volta River Authority
2.01         The 1961 Volta River Development Act requires VRA not only to operate its
plant according to sound public utility practices but also to develop the Volta Lake for
transportation, fishing and tourism. VRA is authorized to sell the electricity it generates in bulk
to any public corporation, including power utilities in neighboring countries and to Government
departments. By a recent amendment, to reflect its extended responsibility agreed under the
Northern Grid Extension Project, VRA is also authorized to distribute electricity in Ghana.
1. Oryanization. Management and Stafrin2
2.02         VRA is governed by a Board, whose members are appointed by the Head of
State, and is composed of a Chairman (currently the PNDC Secretary for Energy) and seven
others, including VRA's Chief Executive and the Managing Directors of ECG and of VALCO.
The Board, by tradition, is composed of persons from outside Government services, and its
quality has successfully preserved for VRA the essential autonomy from undue interference by
Government endowed from the earliest days of VRA's creation.
2.03         Following a review of departmental responsibilities in 1990, VRA's senior
management structure has been modified. Three Deputy Chief Executives (DCEs) - for
Corporate Planning and Finance, Engineering and Operations, and Resources and Services - now
report to the Chief Executive. The Board Secretary/Legal Adviser, the Director of Internal Audit
and the Corporate Relations Officer also report to the Chief Executive. Each functional area is
the responsibility of a Director, with appropriate supporting staff. An organization chart is at
Annex 2-1. VRA is a well-run utility with a local staff of about 2850, including 450 personnel
engaged in power distribution in Northern Ghana. Of the rest, about 400 are engaged in the
provision of support services in Akosombo and Akuse townships.
2.04         Since its establishment more than 25 years ago, VRA has enjoyed a "twinning"
arrangement with Ontario Hydro of Canada under which it has obtained a whole range of
specialist advice and management services, including term assignment in Ghana, and training
facilities for its own staff in Canada. VRA currently employs, at its own expense, several senior
Ontario Hydro managers in specialist areas of system planning, materials management,
management information systems, vehicle workshop maintenance, and general management
consultancy. VRA also makes use of overseas consultants in engineering, management and
finance to assist it in developing and designing new systems or to undertake sophisticated system
planning tasks. VRA staff are always assigned to such tasks in order to ensure in time full
"technology transfer". In addition, under the ongoing Northern Grid Extension Project, VRA has
engaged a number of key expatriate project engineering staff, financed under Credit 1759-GH.
2.05         While Engineering, Systems Operations and Administration Services are well-
established, the Corporate Planning and Finance function has recently been reorganized. In the
past there has been a division of responsibilities between Accounting and Finance for financial
matters. Accounting and Finance have now been brought together under one Director, which has
improved the quality of service to senior management and the Board.

2.06          In addition to an extensive overseas training program VRA has a local training
facility to meet its non-specialist training needs. However, its present buildings are cramped and
there are no residential facilities. In order to remedy these problems and to provide for the
necessary expansion of local training, VRA has proposed to provide a training center with donor
assistance. VRA has received DANIDA's assistance to undertake a full feasibility study of this
project. The feasibility study is expected to be completed by end-1992.
2. Accounting and Audit
2.07          The accounting and budgeting systems used by VRA are generally satisfactory and
provide timely and reliable financial information. The reorganization of the Corporate Planning
and Finance function in 1990-91 has been completed and the key managerial positions filled.
Improvements in financial management and information systems, corporate planning and reporting
have been made following the full computerization of VRA's accounts. Other improvements are
expected as a result of the full integration of financial management. VRA's electricity operations
are financially separate from the other activities--resettlement, lake research and lake transport--
for which separate accounts are kept. NED's activities are also kept separate from those of
electricity generation/transmission, but are consolidated at the year-end. VRA maintains its
accounts in accordance with appropriate international standards. Each year its fixed assets are
revalued, using a satisfactory indexation formula, following the latest physical inspection and
valuation in 1991. Depreciation and rate of return are calculated on the full replacement cost of
VRA's fixed assets. The Cedi value of foreign currency loans is also adjusted annually at
prevailing exchange rates.
2.08          VRA has an independent internal auditing department which forms part of its
system of internal control. The Director of the internal auditing department reports to the Chief
Executive and is independent in the discharge of this function and in the expression of opinions
and findings. Following a reorganization of the department in mid-1991, when the present
Director was appointed, the department has made good progress in improving its effectiveness in
VRA. The immediate objectives are to strengthen the financial and computer audit functions.
Over the longer term, the department's objectives are to enhance capacity through staff
recruitment and training and to enable it to carry out operational and management audits and
increasingly focus on efficiency, effectiveness and value for money auditing. Building the
required capacity in the department would need technical assistance and logistic support through
overseas and local training and the acquisition of computers and a vehicle.
2.09          VRA's auditing arrangements are satisfactory. Its accounts and auditors' report
are submitted within the 6 month period agreed with IDA under the ongoing Sixth Power Project.
VRA's auditors (Coopers and Lybrand, Accra) have never had occasion to qualify VRA's
accounts. In the future, VRA would continue to submit to IDA satisfactory audited accounts
within six months of its fiscal year end, as agreed during negotiations.
3. Recent Financial Perrormance
2.10          Since the drought of the early 1980s which caused VRA to curtail supplies to all
customers between 1983/85, VRA's financial position has continued to show a steady recovery.
From a low 1670 GWh in 1984, sales in 1991 increased to 5,912 GWh, an increase of 254
percent, and have since continued to rise. The earlier renegotiation of the VALCO agreement
and subsequent increases in export (to CEB) and domestic tariffs has enabled VRA's revenue/kWh



- 13 -
to increase significantly, to offset higher operating costs arising from cedi devaluations and local
inflation. Notwithstanding the difficult circumstances of the mid-1980s, VRA's recent financial
performance measured by its profitability has been generally satisfactory. However, its rate of
return on revalued average net fixed assets (ANFA) in operation, has declined from about 11.2
percent in 1989 to about 8.3 percent in 1991.5/ In 1987, VRA took over the responsibility for
power distribution in Northern Ghana as a result of which it agreed to absorb an operating loss on
the activities of NED in 1988 of about 71 billion, equivalent to 0.8 percent rate of return.
NED's operating losses, which increased to a high of C1.8 billion in 1989, have since declined to
1.5 billion in 1990 and C927 million in 1991. The significant improvement in NED's financial
results for 1991 are attributable to a 47 percent increase in power sales revenue and the resulting
decrease (39 percent) in its operating loss. NED's financial position has continued to improve
with a small profit of 101 million expected in 1992.
2.11          In order to ensure adequate liquidity and to protect VRA's future viability, under
the IDA Credits 1759-GH and 2109-GH, VRA agreed: (a) to earn at least 8 percent p.a. on
currently valued average net fixed assets in operation; and, (b) not to incur future long-term
borrowings without IDA agreement, unless future debt service is estimated to be covered at least
1.5 times by future net revenues. The minimum 8 percent per annum rate of return requirement
is to be continued under the proposed project. The new tariff arrangements (para. 2.18) wolld
enable VRA to achieve the arreed 8 percent rate of return throughout the project period, with the
exception of 1993 when it would earn a minimum of 6.5 percent owing to the expected decline in
export sales. Agreement was also reached on the need to ensure that future debt service is
adequately covered (i.e., 1.5 times) by future net revenues. VRA's total debt service coverage at
end-1991 was satisfactory at about 4.3 times. Audited financial results for the last three years
ended December 31, 1989-91, are summarized in the following table and detailed at Annex 2.2.
5/     Under Credit 1759-GH of February 1987 and 2109-GH of March 1990, VRA's agreed
annual rate of return on ANFA is 8 percent.

2.12          VRA has in the past (1984/85) faced foreign exchange shortages when it had to
obtain short-term loans to meet its foreign exchange commitments, and it could again be faced
with shortages of foreign exchange to cover debt service during times of less favorable export
revenues. VRA is permitted to operate an external US dollar account into which are paid dollar
revenues from VALCO and from exports, and from which VRA services its foreign debt and
finances operational and capital foreign exchange requirements as well as its cedi requirements
when necessary. Consequently, VRA agreed under the previous Northern Grid and Sixth Power
Projects to set aside funds (a Debt Contingency Fund) in foreign exchange from its foreign
currency earnings, equivalent to not less than one year of its future annual foreign debt service
obligations. This requirements has been reaffirmed under the proposed Project, and it has been
agreed that the fund would be built-up by annual appropriations from VRA's foreign currency
earnings to an amount equivalent to the lesser of the amount of VRA's foreign exchange debt
service obligation due during the succeeding twelve-month period and the equivalent of US$25
mill ion.
2.13          At the end of 1991, VRA's capitalization was US$1,246 million equivalent; its
debt/equity ratio was comfortable and its current ratio acceptable, but its receivables had increased
to levels in excess of the one month billings agreed under the Sixth Power Project (para. 2.14).
VRA's capitalization at December 31, 1991 is summarized in Table 2-2 below:

2.14          VRA revalues its fixed assets annually, in accordance with indexes agreed
following a full revaluation in 1986. VRA also revalues its foreign currency loans at the end of
each year, at prevailing rates of exchange. Consequently, VRA's balance sheet provides a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Authority in accordance with internationally-accepted
accounting standards. As a large part of VRA's fixed assets are now debt free and have a long
life, VRA's debt/equity ratio is low (19/81). Though the current ratio has been declining,
liquidity at end 1991 was adequate with a current ratio of 1.0. Customer receivables were about
2.2 months billings at end 1991. Commencing with the ECG Fifth Power Project, and
subsequently also agreed under the Sixth Power Project, the mutual current obligations of
Government, ECG, GWSC and VRA, were to be settled on a monthly estimated basis through a
Cross-Debt clearing system and would be reconciled quarterly. The clearing system was rendered
ineffective by the non-payment of Government obligations for the first three-quarters of 1992,
which amounted to 5.3 billion in early-September 1992.6/ Following the agreements reached
Of this amount, Government obligations to VRA, ECG and GWSC are estimated at C4. 1
billion, Q:857 million and C316 million, respectively.



- 16 -
during negotiations, the Cross-Debt Clearing House System has since confirmed to IDA the
payment of over 50 percent of the arrears estimated at the end of the third-quarter 1992. It has
been agd that all obligations due to the Cross-Debt Clearing House System would be
reconciled and settled in full as a condition of effectiveness of the project. VRA also aree
during negotiations to settle all bills payable through the Clearing House System on a monthly
basis.
4. NED Finances
2.15          Following the transfer of responsibility to VRA of the distribution of electricity in
Northern Ghana, VRA established in 1987 a separate department, NED. The gross value of fixed
assets transferred from ECG and valued at current replacement cost in 1987 was C6,820 million.
Service was provided to about 25,000 customers from isolated diesel stations, some of which have
been retired, and the rest are to be retired as the grid is extended to these and other areas to be
electrified under the proposed project. In the meantime, VRA has improved the quality of
service, extended the power supply to new customers and has ensured the availability of diesel
fuel for generation, which had previously been a major problem. By agreement under Credit
1759-GH, VRA is required to meet operating losses from its surplus on bulk supply operations.
VRA maintains separate accounts for NED's operations. NED's audited financial results for the
years ended December 31, 1989-91 are summarized below. Actual and projected income
statements for NED through 1999 are set out in Annex 2-3.

2.16          NED's recent financial position is attributable to the cost of establishing the
relatively new organization and of improving the quality of service-involving expensive fuel
purchase and transportation--pending the commissioning of grid supplies. Its financial position is
also impaired by a uniform national tariff which is below the cost of service. However, as grid
supply becomes progressively available, expensive thermal is being eliminated and as new
distribution projects have been completed NED's customer market has expanded rapidly. Under
the Northern Grid project, VRA agreed to meet the operating losses of NED and consequently has
every incentive to control costs and expand the market. VRA has been successful at substantially
increasing sales (47 percent in 1991) and reducing NED's operating loss (39 percent in 1991).
With the introduction of new tariffs, NED is expected to make a small profit for the first time in
1992. VRA's required 8 percent rate of return on ANFA is calculated after taking into account
NED's operating losses.
5. Financing Plan (1992-1999)
2.17          VRA's financial projections through 1999 which cover the proposed project period
(1993-97) are set out in Annex 2.2, and the assumptions made in their preparation in Annex 2.3.
Its estimated capital requirements during the 1992-1999 period amount to about US$929 million
equivalent of which 24 percent consists of ongoing projects. About 33 percent of VRA's
requirements would be raised from IDA and other cofinanciers and the remaining 67 percent
would be generated by VRA after providing for working capital, debt service and the required
appropriations to its debt contingency fund. VRA agreed during negotiations to review annually
with IDA, until the projects are completed, the composition of its capital expenditure program for
the following five years, together with a related financing plan.

6. Future Financial Position
2.18         The main features of VRA's projected financial performance from  1992 through
1999 are summarized below. Tariff increases are expected to be phased in as a result of an
agreed tariff formula (para. 1.26) the implementation of which has been confirmed by the
Government. The tariff adjustments needed to close the gap between adjusted LRMC for 1992
and the phasing in of new tariffs to achieve LRMC by 1996 are also summarized in the table
below. The ongoing requirement under the Sixth Power Project for VRA to earn at least 8
percent rate of return on currently valued average net fixed assets would be achieved in 1992, and
will be achieved under the proposed project except in 1993 (owing to an expected decline in
export sales in that year) when the agreed rate of return is 6.5 percent. VRA's operating ratio
declines from 50 percent in 1993 to about 25 percent in 1999. Debt service coverage is
comfortable (well above 1.5). Liquidity would be satisfactory, and after 1993, receivables would
be at one month's billings throughout the remaining project period (para. 2.14). The current ratio
and the debt equity ratio would be very satisfactory during project implementation and through
1999.

B.  Electricity Corporation of Ghana
2.19         The ECG, established by Government Decree in 1967, supplies electricity within
Ghana, excepting certain specified customers who are supplied by VRA and some areas in the
northern part of the country (e.g., Brong Ahafo, Northern and Upper Regions) which are supplied
by NED, a department of VRA. The 1967 Decree requires ECG to conduct its affairs on a sound
commercial basis and ongoing reforms over the years have sought to strengthen ECG as an
efficient public utility. This project would expand the availability of electricity to a larger number
of customers in the geographical area serviced by ECG and also reinforce the process of
institutional strengthening.

1. Oreanization and Manaueenent
2.20       ECG is governed by a Board, appointed by GOG, which is responsible for
formulating policy. The Board comprises a Chairman, ECG's Managing Director (Chief
Executive) appointed by GOG, VRA's Chief Executive, and other persons representing
government, industry and consumer interests. The Managing Director and Directors of
Administration, Engineering, Finance and Operations and Audit are all qualified, experienced
Ghanaians. ECG has been working closely with ESB consultants, a division of ESB, Ireland,
which has been advising ECG on various issues including organization restructuring. Under the
revised organizational arrangement, ECG is organized into eight regions, including two regions in
Accra, each headed by a Regional Director, reporting to the Director of Operations at
headquarters. ECG's organization chart appears in Annex W24. In order to improve its
commercial operations, ECG has proposed to create a new Directorate of Customer Service (see
para. 1.21). ECG's proposed organization chart appears in Annex 2-5.
2. Manpower Planning. Staff Development and Training
2.21       ECG currently employs less than 2,850 staff, down from about 3,800 in 1987, as a
result of a staff reduction program which is part of their performance contract with the
Government. ECG is trying to upgrade the skills-mix of its staff through better recruitment,
training and human resources policies. ECG's remuneration and benefits program is not
competitive. In order to recruit and retain good quality staff, ECG is planning to introduce
incentives which include, among others, a scheme for performance-related bonuses, improved
housing, etc. The latter is a normal feature in Ghana where housing costs are high and public
service salaries are low. During negotiations, agreement was reached to retain management
consultants to review the scheme of services of power sector utilities with a terms of reference
satisfactory to IDA to be prepared no later than December 31, 1993.
2.22       Tema training center will be expanded under the ECG Fifth Power Project. ECG
plans to continue to develop its human resources management with assistance from local
consultants and with the use of the facilities at its Tema Training Center, supplemented by local
academic institutions. A few ESB staff remain in advisory roles as short-term consultants
assisting ECG in various operational and functional areas. ESB's technical assistance program
has been generally effective in the technical areas and cordial relationship has developed between
the two. IDA is financing a staff development plan under the ECG Fifth Power Project. This
plan which is currently under preparation by ECG with assistance from ESB is to improve ECG's
management and technical capabilities at various levels and areas of operation. IDA has provided
to ECG its comments on a preliminary draft of the staff development plan.
2.23       ECG has a Corporate Planning Unit responsible for the preparation and updating of
ECG's annual corporate plan and the performance contract to be signed with the Government.
Annual performance targets are based on ECG's corporate plan and the budget approved by the
Board, and ECG undertakes a quarterly evaluation of compliance with the performance contract,
e.g., the evaluation for the period from October to December 1991 indicates that more effort is
needed to improve metering, billing and revenue collection.
3. Accounting and Audit
2.24       With the exception of a computerized billing and payroll system, ECG utilizes a
predominantly manual accounting system. With ESB's assistance, new accounting and budgeting
systems are being installed leading to improved financial controls, better and more timely
management information, and accounts which meet acceptable standards. Accounting has been
brought to a current basis (quarterly financial statements are produced) which provides ECG



- 20 -
management with a much clearer view of its financial situation. Furthermore, ECG has been able
to recruit several young, qualified staff to strengthen its accounting and internal audit activities.
ECG would continue to improve its financial systems with ESB assistance under the ongoing Fifth
Power Project.
2.25        ECG is required to provide accounting information similar to that required of a
private company and to submit its accounts, with the report of an independent auditor (Coopers
and Lybrand, Accra), within four months of the year end. Present auditing arrangements are
satisfactory. With the improvements to accounting and MIS systems and staff, ECG's audited
accounts in recent years were submitted on time and were unqualified. ECG has been able to
submit to IDA satisfactory audited accounts within six months of the year end, as agreed under
the Fifth Power Project. In future, ECG would continue to submit to IDA satisfactory audited
accounts including audits of the Special Account within six months of its year end, as agreed
during negotiations.
2.26        ECG has an independent internal auditing department as part of its system of internal
control. The Director of the internal auditing department reports to the Chief Executive, submits
quarterly reports to the Board and is independent in the conduct of his operations and expression
of his opinions and findings. The department was reorganized in 1989 after which a centralized
internal audit structure is being developed and a large number of staff involved in the formerly
decentralized structure are being redeployed. Following the reorganization, good progress has
been made in achieving the objectives of the reorganization and strengthening the department.
There are still some management positions in the new structure that are being filled.
2.27        ECG has, with the assistance of external consultants, recently completed
documenting its accounting policies, systems and procedures in an Accounting Manual which is to
be put into effect in early 1993. This will enable the internal auditing department to shift its
emphasis from the present transaction based auditing (primarily vouching and verification of
transactions) to systems based auditing. The immediate objectives of the department are to
complete the reorganization and staffing of the department and to broaden the educational and
experiential base of its staff to enable it to commence audits of efficiency and effectiveness.
Longer term objectives are to change the direction of audits from largely transaction and financial
audits to operational audits and reviews of efficiency, economy and effectiveness and to give
sufficient emphasis to internal and external training. With respect to training, the department
would benefit from exposure to mature utility practices outside Ghana and, if possible, the
development of a long-term training relationship with a suitable utility. The training needs of the
department over the next 3-4 years are expected to cost about US$200,000. In addition, the
department would benefit from logistic support particularly with respect to the need for computers
(3) and printers.
4. Customer Receivables
2.28        It is difficult to provide reliable historical performance indicators for ECG's
commercial operations given the problem with the existing customer database. Accounts
receivables for the 1989-91 period are around five months of billing. ECG has made efforts with
some success to reduce the accounts receivable by improving its collection efforts and has
proposed to achieve further improvements by reorganizing its commercial operations and hiring a
contractor to run its customer service under a performance-based management contract (see para.
1.21). During negotiations, agreement was reached that accounts receivables will be reduced to



- 21 -
1.5 months billing by June 30, 1996. An action plan to reduce the receivables shall be adopted
no later than October 1, 1993.
5. Recent Financial Performance
2.29       ECG was established to operate on a sound commercial basis and to ensure that its
revenues are sufficient to produce a reasonable return on the fair value of its assets, service its
debt and contribute to expanding and improving the quality of its services (1967 Government
Decree). Since the difficult circumstances of the mid-1980s, ECG has had difficulty in
consistently achieving satisfactory financial performance. By 1988 it had accumulated heavy
losses and negative total equity and had a high debt/equity ratio, negative debt service coverage
and a need to improve its working capital. It also had a heavy capital investment program
through 1993. ECG's capital was in urgent need of restructuring. This was satisfactorily
completed with effect from end-1988, immediately prior to the Fifth Power Project. Under the
terms of the ECG Fifth Power Project, ECG was expected to earn an acceptable rate of return on
its average net revalued fixed assets (rising from 6 percent in 1989 to 8 percent in 1991), it was
expected to contribute at least 25 percent to its investment program, to maintain a debt service
coverage of at least 1.5 times and to achieve an acceptable level of customer receivables. ECG's
recent financial performance measured by its inability to achieve these financial obligations has
been less than satisfactory, and its financial position and profitability have deteriorated
considerably. Cedi devaluations (from C260/US$ in 1987 to Q2390/US$ in 1991) have had a
serious impact on the cost of electricity supplied by VRA and on ECG's debt servicing
obligations. At the same time, domestic cost increases resulting from high annual inflation in
Ghana during this period, have had a detrimental impact on its operating performance. These
cost increases have not been fully compensated for through increases in retail tariffs.
Consequently, ECG has incurred losses which, by end-1990, had accumulated to about (C18.7
billion which exceeded the paid-up capital of C10.8 billion. There has been a modest
improvement in customer receivables. However, the excessive time taken to collect receivables,
as a result of billing and collection problems, have exacerbated the situation to a point where
ECG was unable to meet some of its obligations to VRA and was in breach of some subsidiary
loan covenants. Consequently, the GOG decided to capitalize some of the debt that ECG owed to
VRA and has been encouraging ECG towards more efficient operating and management controls.
The proposed tariff program (para. 2.34) will enable ECG to meet its financial objectives and
covenants. Recent financial results for the years ended December 31, 1989 through 1991 are
summarized in the Table 2-6. Detailed audited results for 1989 through 1991 are in Annex 2.6.

2.31        ECG revalues its fixed assets annually in accordance with agreed indexes following
the revaluation in 1987 initiated under Credit 1628-GH. ECG also revalues its foreign debt at the
end of each year at the prevailing exchange rates. As a result, ECG's balance sheet and financial
statements provide a true and fair view of the Corporation in accordance with internationally-
accepted accounting standards. ECG's debt/equity ratio had eased to 32/68 (from a high of 53/47
the previous year) and its current ratio was comfortable at 2.3. Customer receivables at 4.7
months billings remain high at the end of 1991. As mentioned in para. 2.14, the cross-debt
clearing system established under the ECG Fifth Power Project to settle monthly the mutual
current obligations of the Government, GWSC, VRA and ECG has been rendered ineffective by
the non-payment of Government obligations for 1992. The amount owed to ECG by the
Government in early-September 1992 is estimated at C2857 million. Since project negotiations, the
Cross-Debt Clearing House System has confirmed to IDA the payment of over 50 percent of the
arrears estimated at the end of the third-quarter 1992. It has been agreed as a condition of
effectiveness of the project that all obligations due to the Clearing House System would be



- 24 -
reconciled and settled in full. ECG will also in future settle all bills payable through the Clearing
House System on a monthly basis.
6. Tariffs
2.32        Since 1989 tariff increases have not been large enough to maintain revenues
sufficiently above expenses to earn net profits, and to meet the utility's financial covenants, except
for a modest profit in 1989. By 1991, ECG's net loss was C4,066 million (see Table 2-6) and its
total expenditures were C 18,618 million--over most of which it has little or no discretion. ECG
power purchases from VRA, interest, depreciation, and foreign exchange fluctuations amounted to
1215,300 million, leaving insufficient funds for operating and maintenance expenses. ECG's total
expenses cost is 13.3/kWh in 1991, while the average tariff yield was 1O. 1/kWh. Similarly in
1992, the average tariff to enable ECG to achieve its 8 percent rate of return should have been
18.8 but the estimated average tariff is about 17.7. Notwithstanding the need for ECG to
reduce distribution losses to acceptable levels and to increase its efficiency through improved
collections, ECG's main financial problem is that of revenue deficiency, mainly due to inadequate
tariffs.
7. Financing Plan (1992-99) and Future Financial Position
2.33        ECG's financial projections through 1999 which encompass the proposed project
period (1993-97) are presented in Annex 2.6; and the assumptions made in their preparation in
Annex 2.7. In summary, it is assumed that ECG meets its performance targets through 1999,
including the critical revenue collection target to reduce customer receivables below the level of
three months' billings and that tariff increases are phased in commencing in 1993 with the
objective of reaching LRMC in 1996. It has been agreed that ECG would earn a rate of return of
7 percent in 1993 and resume earning the minimum 8 percent rate of return on average net fixed
assets from 1994 onwards. ECG has also agreed to maintain an adequate debt-service coverage
(i.e., not below 1.5) and to enter into a management contract to improve its commercial
operations (para. 1.21) and the level of its receivables. These requirements would help strengthen
ECG's financial position and ensure its future financial viability and its ability to comply with its
financial covenants. ECG's estimated capital requirements during the 1992-99 period amount to
about US$504 million equivalent. As the proposed project comprises new ECG's principal
investment through 1997, it has been a2reed that ECG would not incur any other capital
expenditure above the equivalent of US$2 million annually without prior consultation with IDA,
and that ECG would review annually with IDA its rolling 5-year investment program and its
related financing plan. On the basis of the above assumptions, ECG would be able to contribute
35 percent of its total capital investment requirements from 1992 through 1999 after providing for
working capital and debt service, and at the same time strengthen its underlying financial position.
About 62 percent of ECG's requirements would be raised from IDA and other cofinanciers and 3
percent from consumer contributions. A financing plan for ECG is summarized in Table 2-8.

2.34        The main features of ECG's projected financial performance from 1992 through
1999 are summarized below. On average, tariffs were increased 38 percent in 1993 (from
17.73/kWh to C24.48/kWh). Tariffs would increase significantly from 1993 onwards, as a
result of implementing the agreed tariff formula (para. 1.26) and the rate of return (8%)
requirement. ECG's operating ratio increases to a high of 85 percent in 1995 and declines to
about 82 percent in 1999. Debt service coverage would be satisfactory (i.e., above). Debt/equity
would be acceptable during the project implementation period, decreasing from a high of 43/57 in
1993 to 32/68 by 1999. Liquidity would improve progressively and would be satisfactory with
receivables reducing to less than three months' billings after 1994 and to about one and a half
months' billings after 1996. The current ratio would be comfortable throughout the project period
and beyond.

111. THfE PROIFECT
A. Project Objectives
3.01         The proposed project would: (a) enable the Government to provide electricity from
the national power grid to small urban centers, district capitals and rural areas through a
systematic electrification program; (b) improve service reliability in the existing ECG network;
and (c) improve ECG's operational efficiency by assisting ECG to reform and strengthen its
commercial operations.
B. Project Description
3.02         The proposed project would:
(a)   Connect to the main grid about 434 communities located in all 10 regions of the
country and would cover the cost of connecting about 119,000 consumers. The
proposed project would involve in particular
(i)   the construction of about 1000 km for VRA and 1200 km for ECG of
medium-voltage (33 kV and 11 kV) and low voltage (400 v) lines, distribution
transformers, breakers, reclosers and other related electrical equipment;
(ii)  the construction of about 119,000 household connections (Service Drops);



- 27 -
(iii)  the construction of service centers required to operate and maintain the power
system at the district level;
(iv)  the supply of vehicles, tools, and specialized equipment for construction
supervision, operation and maintenance of the distribution network in the new
areas;
(v)   consultancy services for distribution engineering design, bid preparation and
evaluation, and construction management (including stock management,
construction supervision), and design and implementation of a pilot program
for productive uses of electricity.
(b)   Implement a time slice of approximately three years of distribution works needed to
expand sub-stations, build or replace major links between sub-stations and to
continue the loss reduction program;
(c)   Assist in institutional strengthening and reforms to improve operational efficiency of
ECG, particularly in the commercial services by involving the private sector through
a performance-based management contract.
(d)   Provide technical assistance and studies to support the utilities in the following areas:
(i)   staff development programs with special attention to the training requirements
of staff that will be responsible for the operation of the new systems;
(ii)  study to design, develop, and implement a pilot demonstration program for
promoting productive uses of electricity; and
(iii)  study of the scheme of services of power sector utilities.
A detailed description of the project scope is provided in Annex 3-1.
C. Project Cost
3.03        For present purposes, the costing approach is to adopt the methodology applied in
the NEPS, to be refined as detailed design and bills of materials become available. The unit cost
derived for substation, subtransmission and generic distribution designs in the NEPS study were
used to determine the cost of the project components as follows:
(a)   Substation costs in dollar per type of specified substation capacity and voltage levels
were determined from station base cost, power transformer cost, and switching cost
for all voltage levels.
(b)   Transmission and subtransmission costs were determined on the basis of applying
unit costs in dollar per kilometer to 161-, 33- or 11 kV line length as applicable to
each project.
(c)   Distribution costs were defined by applying unit costs in dollars per kilowatt of load
to the estimated 10-yr load demand forecast for each community. To recognize the



- 28 -
differences between characteristics of communities across the country, separate unit
costs were developed for generic distribution systems in northern and southern
communities. This distinction took into account conditions of high load densities in
the southern communities and low-load densities in the northern communities.
Further distinction was made in the unit cost between 33- and 11 kV distribution
systems.
The NEPS cost estimates have been refined and improved as follows:
(d)   Substation, transmission and subtransmission costs have been verified by comparing
them with average cost levels experienced by VRA, NED and ECG in recent times.
(e)   The 1990 cost levels have accordingly been adjusted to 1992 levels by using current
prices for materials and erection.
(f)   Distinction has been made between foreign and local components of the cost.
All the works to be done under the electrification component of the project has been grouped into
29 sub-projects. A complete listing of the 29 electrification sub-projects in the VRA and ECG
service areas are given in Arnex 3-2 and Annex 3-3, respectively. These sub-projects that were
proposed by the Government were identified through a feasibility study prepared by the
Consultants, Acres International of Canada.
3.04        The total project cost is estimated at US$166.23 million equivalent (excluding any
interest during construction) of which the foreign exchange component is about US$122.46
million (74% of the total cost). Given the absence of project design but considering the repetitive
and routine nature of the work, physical contingencies of 10 percent on the major components of
the project, and price contingencies based on current domestic and international inflation trends
were added.7/ There are no taxes and duties applicable to the project. The detailed cost
estimates are present in Annex 3-4 and are summarized as follows:
7/ Inflation rates used are given in Annex 2-3.

3.05       Because the equipment, materials and services for this project are quite standard and
their costs reasonably well-known, it is expected that once the final project costs can be
determined from detailed design and bills of materials, they are unlikely to differ enough from
these estimates which include 10 percent physical contingencies.
D. Project Financing Plan
3.06       An IDA Credit of US$ 80 million equivalent is proposed to the Government of
Ghana, which under Subsidiary Loan Agreements would be onlent to VRA and ECG. During
negotiations, agreement was reached that equivalent of US$37.98 million would be onlent to VRA
for 20 years, including 5 years grace period at the prevailing IBRD rate, and equivalent of
US$41.22 million would be onlent to ECG for 20 years, including 5 years grace period at the
prevailing IBRD rate. The signing of Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and
VRA, and between the Government and ECG will be a condition of Credit effectiveness. The
proposed IDA Credit would finance 48 percent of the total cost of the project (excluding interest
during construction) as indicated in para. 3.29. A financing plan indicating other sources of
financing for the project is presented as Anex 3-5 and is summarized in the Table below.
CCCE is expected to finance the ECG's management contract, signing of which is a condition of
effectiveness of the IDA Credit (para. 1.21). With the exception of cofinancing from CCCE, the
IDA-financed components of the project will proceed independent of financing arrangements from
other sources. Fulfillment of conditions of effectiveness of CCCE financing is a condition of
Credit effectiveness.

About 27 percent of total financing required (i.e., total project cost plus interest during
construction) is expected to be provided by VRA and ECG from internally generated funds and



-31 -
from the National Electricity Fund (NEF). The NEF was set up in January 1989 to primarily
support the local cost of projects under NES. The NEF is administered by MOE in cooperation
with VRA and ECG.8/ Originally a one percent surcharge on all categories of domestic
consumption was instituted to finance the NEF which was later modified in January 1992. The
tariff schedule that went into effect as of January 1992 has a specific charge of Cedi 1.0/kWh for
all categories of domestic consumers that is to be collected by the utilities and deposited in the
NEF. With the projected sales of about 2750 GWh per year during the project implementation
period (1993-1997) and an average exchange rate of Cedi 550=US$1 for the period, it is
expected that US$25 million could be available from the NEF. During negotiations, it was
agrud that VRA and ECG will provide to IDA, on a quarterly basis, a report detailing the
funding requirements to implement the project. The report will indicate the source of funds
including how much is expected from NEF.
3.07       The upfront cost of wiring houses and the inability of customers to obtain credit to
finance the cost of internal wiring could be a major factor in slowing down the penetration of
electricity usage in newly electrified areas. During negotiations, agreemen was reached that the
Government will establish by December 31, 1993 a scheme for the financing of internal house
wiring, with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA. Contribution to the scheme could come from
external sources, as well as from the Government.2/
E. Proiect Implementation
1. Status of Preparation and Execution
3.08       After the completion of NEPS, and in anticipation of the proposed project, the
Ministry of Energy hired consultants to assist the utilities in updating the information relating to
the rural areas to be electrified. Implementation of this program is an important part of the
Government's objective to balance the economic and social development of the country. A total
of 434 villages will be electrified. A cost estimate was prepared and the characteristics of the
equipment and materials were determined with the assistance of consultants and they are found to
be reasonable.
3.09       The proposed project would be carried out with the participation of the Ministry of
Energy at the policy making level, and the utilities ECG and VRA/NED, as the executing
agencies. Each utility, with the assistance of consultants, will be responsible for the
implementation of the sub-projects that fall in its appointed service area. Grouping of sub-
I/ The NEF account is kept with the Agric Development Bank of Ghana. There are three
signatories to the account: the PNDC Secretary of Energy, the ECG Managing Director, and
the Chief Executive of the VRA. At least two signatories are required before any funds can
be withdrawn from the account and one should be from the MOE. When a withdrawal
request is made by one of the utilities, the other utility is required to also be a signatory in
addition to MOE. This arrangement is to ensure consensus for expenditure on electrification
projects.
2/ For the 119,000 customers to be connected under the Project, equivalent of about US$14.0
million could be required. This is based on the estimation that the cost of internal wiring of
houses is about US$120 per connection (C47,000 for two rooms and an outside light).



- 32 -
projects is in accordance with administrative regions of the country in the VRA and ECG service
areas. The list of sub-projects in VRA and ECG service areas are given in Annex 3-2 and Annex
3-3, respectively. Both utilities have experience in the execution of projects under IDA guidelines
for procurement and preparation of withdrawal applications, as well as in working with foreign
consulting firms.
3.10        ECG would have responsibility for the execution of 18 sub-projects, and VRA would
be responsible for 11 sub-projects, which represents about 53 percent and 47 percent of the total
cost of national electrification component, respectively. IDA would participate in the financing of
8 and 9 sub-projects in the ECG and VRA service areas, respectively. See Annex 3-5(b) and
Annex 3-5(b). The remaining sub-projects would be financed by other cofinanciers and their
implementation will be in accordance with bilateral agreements, with the utilities and the
Government. To achieve uniform designs in each service area, it was agreed during appraisal
that IDA would finance the foreign costs of the engineering services necessary for all the sub-
projects of the national electrification component, although the implementation of the IDA-
financed sub-projects will proceed independently from that of sub-projects financed by other
donors.
3.11        The national electrification component of the project will be implemented in
accordance with the overall project implementation schedule presented in Annex 3-6(a). Detailed
project engineering design will start approximately one year after project start. Given the volume
of the work involved, the utilities would be assisted by engineering firms to be selected in
accordance with Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants. The proposed project would include
about 290 man months of consulting services for project engineering. During negotiations, a
draft terms of reference for the project engineering, and monitoring and control consultants given
in Annex 3-7 was agreed to. Also, it was agreed that VRA and ECG will prepare annually a
program satisfactory to IDA for the training of their staff, focussing on the requirements of the
staff responsible for the operation of the expanded electricity grid.
3.12        The sub-stations, sub-transmission and distribution equipment and materials to be
used by the utilities as well as construction standards for distribution facilities have been agreed
upon. For the proposed project, some adjustment to the distribution standards were introduced to
reduce costs of the rural distribution system as compared to the costs of urban distribution
systems, without impairing the quality of service. Therefore, technical specifications of
equipment and materials to be used are available.
3.13        Each utility will organize and operate a project executing unit which will be assisted
by consultants as required by the working practice of each utility throughout the different phases
of the works. This unit will be responsible for the implementation and supervision of the
following steps: (a) field survey, (b) design layout of MV and LV lines, (c) assemble bill of
materials, (d) estimate cost in detail, (e) procure and manage materials, (f) erect and install
facilities, and (g) commission and energize. Additionally each project executing unit will be
responsible for monitoring and controlling project costs, expenditures, implementation and
reporting. Organization charts for project management for VRA and ECG are given in Annex 3-
1 and Annex 3-9, respectively.
3.14        The distribution re-inforcement component of the project is restricted to the ECG
service area and would be implemented by ECG under the project implementation organization
established for the execution of ECG's Fifth Power Project (Credit 2061-GH), which is working



- 33 -
satisfactorily and is supervised by ECG's Director of Engineering. ECG was assisted in the
preparation of this component by ESB, which is assisting them in execution of ECG's Fifth Power
Project. ECG intends to also use ESB to assist them in executing this component of the project.
Under the Fifth Power Project, ECG has improved its stores and material management systems,
which will be utilized for handling the materials that would be procured for this component.
3.15       During appraisal, it was agred that IDA would finance a Productive Use study to:
(a) identify the factors constraining the development of productive uses in existing rural areas, and
any additional factors that would become constraints in the new areas to be electrified; and (b)
develop and implement a pilot demonstration program for promoting productive uses of
electricity. A draft Terms of Reference for a Productive Use Study given in Annex 3-10 was
agreed on during negotiations.
2. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
3.16       The proposed Project would require close coordination between the utilities and
frequent supervision by IDA. The utilities would submit to IDA quarterly reports covering the
work of consultants, physical progress, project costs, financing, disbursement and administrative
aspects of the Project. Detailed reporting requirements were discussed during appraisal. During
negotiations, agreermen was reached that there will be a mid-term review mission no later than 2
years from the date that IDA credit becomes effective during which project status will be
exhaustively reviewed. During this review, particular attention will be paid to: (a) the
performance of the management contractor; (b) the compliance with covenants, particularly the
financial and auditing covenants; (c) review of the level and structure of tariffs; (d) the evolution
of key performance indicators; (e) the progress of procurement and in general, of all project
components; (f) the provision of counterpart funds for the project; (g) recommendation of the
scheme of services study; (h) progress in executing the Power Sector Master Planning Study
financed under the VRA Sixth Power Project; and, (i) plans for the further implementation of the
NES. The midterm review will be carried out jointly by the Government, the respective utilities,
the cofinanciers and IDA. As a result of this mission, corrective steps will be proposed. These
might include modifications in project scope and/or components, changes in covenants, and
perhaps most important of all, steps to be taken once the management contract comes to an end.
The proposed supervision program for the project and key performance indicators for monitoring
the progress of the project are provided in Annex 3-1 1. The utilities would also undertake to
prepare and furnish to IDA, within six months after the loan closing date, or such later date as
might be agreed for this purpose, a Project Completion Report of such scope and detail as IDA
shall reasonably request.
3.17       Furthermore, and in order to improve existing database to be used for planning
future development of other phases of the NEPS, it is strongly recommended that the utilities
would collect regularly data on the socioeconomic characteristics of the communities electrified
during recently completed projects (Self-Help, JICA), communities to be electrified through
projects under construction and under the proposed Project. These data would include:
electricity consumers, electricity consumption by voltage level and consumer type, operating costs
and others. Details are provided in Annex 3-12.
3.18       During negotiations, agreement was reached that the project accounts, Special
Accounts (SA), and the Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) would be audited annually by
independent auditors satisfactory to IDA according to acceptable auditing standards. The audited
accounts and the auditor's report would be submitted to IDA within six months following the end



- 34 -
of the fiscal year. SOEs will be reviewed by IDA on a regular basis. Also, during negotiations,
agreement was reached that the Government and the utilities would submit to IDA copies of all
consultant's reports and studies financed under the proposed Project.

3.20       The National Electrification Component of the Project is divided in 29 sub-projects
located in all 10 regions of Ghana. For implementation, each utility would be responsible for the
sub-projects that fall in its service area. ECG would have 18 and VRA 11 sub-projects with a
total cost of US$61.2 and US$54.59 million equivalent, respectively. These costs include the
necessary materials, equipment and erection services to carry out the sub-station, sub-transmission
and distribution (including low voltage networks and service connections) works require to
connect the sub-projects to the existing grid. These cost include price and physical contingencies.
3.21       IDA would be financing 8 sub-projects in ECG's service area, and 9 sub-projects in
VRA's service area. These sub-projects would be procured through ICB for the supply and
erection, in accordance with Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits.
Local costs for IDA financed sub-projects would be provided by the Government of Ghana out of
the National Electrification Fund. The remaining sub-projects, 10 for ECG and 2 for VRA,
would be financed by other co-financiers and contracted, in accordance to their own guidelines.
3.22       IDA would finance the Engineering Services and equipment (US$10.48 million)
required for detailed design, supervision of construction and monitoring of all sub-projects.
These consultancy services would be contracted, in accordance with World Bank's Guidelines for
the Use of Consultants.
3.23       IDA financed EguiDment, for both ECG (US$2.33 million) and VRA (US$1.56
million), includes telecommunications, office and miscellaneous equipment, tools and spares that
would be required during the operations of the new areas. These components would be procured
through ICB, in accordance with Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits.
3.24       IDA financed Civil Works to build Service Centers in the newly electrified areas, for
both ECG (US$1.26 million) and VRA (US$0.83 million), will be contracted following LCB
procedures acceptable to IDA, since the value of these contracts is relatively small. LCB
documents and procedures will be reviewed by IDA prior to release of documents, to insure that
these include advertising, public opening, clarity of evaluation criteria and award to the lowest
evaluated bidder, and that foreign bidders are not excluded from participation.
3.25       The Distribution Reinforcement component would be financed by IDA and would be
executed by ECG, with a value of US$31.6 million. Local costs will be provided by the utility.
The sub-station and sub-transmission materials and equipment and necessary erection services will
be procured through ICB, in accordance with Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and
IDA Credits. The type of contract will be single responsibility style. Most of the materials and
equipment (94%) for Distribution Development would be procured through ICB, in accordance
with Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits. About 6 percent of the
materials and equipment of this component would be procured under direct contracting for
reasons of being a proprietary (addition of a breaker module to an existing switchgear) or needed
spare parts from original equipment manufacturer. This component of the project was prepared
by ECG'S Planning Unit with the assistance of ESB. Presently ESB is providing the engineering
services needed for the implementation of Fifth Power Project (Credit 2061-GH) and has assisted
ECG in organizing the Fifth Power Project's office. The services required are of the same nature
and the works are an expansion of the work started under Credit 2061-OH. In view of the small
value (US$0.88 million) of the needed extension services, it would be convenient for the
implementation of this component of the proposed project to retain the services of ESB.

3.26       The Management Contractor needed to run ECG's new Consumers Services
Directorate would be financed by CCCE. Following request of the Government, this contract
would be sole source to Electricite de France (EDF) as a continuation of on going services in this
area.
3.27       Technical Assistance and Studies for both ECG and VRA would be procured in
accordance with World Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Training manuals and
other training aids would be procured through international shopping; for such items the Utilities
would obtain written price quotations from at least three qualified suppliers.
3.28       The Estimated Procurement Schedule for all tenders is presented as Annex 34b).
All bidding and contract documents for works, equipment and materials to be financed by IDA,
and costing over US$100,000 each would be subject to prior IDA review. Other IDA-finance
contracts costing less than this threshold value would be subject to post-award IDA review.
Procurement matters will be discussed in the Quarterly Reports to be submitted by the utilities.
Additionally, procurement matters will be reviewed during each supervision mission. During
appraisal agreement was reach on the format to record the procurement information.
4. Disbursements

The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan is shown in Annex 3-13 and has
been computed on the basis of standard profile for similar power projects. The Project is
expected to be completed by March 31, 1998.
3.30       To expedite project implementation, a special account in the amount of US$2 million
covering four months of eligible expenditures financed by IDA, will be established separately for
VRA and ECG, and replenishment requests would be fully documented except for claims for



- 38 -
expenditures under contracts whose value is less than US$50,000 equivalent. Supporting
documents would be retained by the utilities for audit purposes, and reviewed periodically by the
Bank. This documentation, in addition to being held for one year after the audit for the year in
which the last withdrawal form the loan proceeds is made, would be examined by auditors
acceptable to the Bank, and made available for review by Bank representatives upon request. No
retroactive financing or advanced contracting is involved in the proposed project.
F. Environmental Aspects
3.31       The Project is under environmental Category B and is not expected to have any
significant adverse environmental effects. Much of the sub-transmission system will follow the
existing roadways and lines will be supported on single poles. Utilities would coordinate the
routing of the lines with local authorities to minimize their impact and purchase land as required
for supporting facilities. Equipment provided under the project would have limited noise level,
adequate safety standards will be in place to minimize the risk of electrocution, and transformers
used would not contain PCB's (polyclorinated biphenyls). Proper occupational health safety
practices would be used in the installation and maintenance of project facilities. The project
would have limited aesthetic impacts on the landscape. The project would not require additional
new generating capacity since the new load is relatively small compared to total power supply.
G. Project Justification. Benefits and Risks
1. Project Justification
3.32       The electrification component of the proposed project would provide the relatively
inexpensive hydro-generated electricity from the national grid to small urban centers and rural
areas in different regions of the country, which would assist the Government to bring more of the
benefits of the recent economic growth to the regions and, in line with the policy of expanding
democratization at the district level, accelerate the socio-economic development of areas outside of
the major urban centers. The first phase of the NES focuses on electrification of District Capitals
throughout the country which requires inclusion of sub-projects of varying economic rate of
return. The electrification component of the project consists of 29 sub-projects having Economic
Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) in the range of 5 percent to 24 percent, with 23 of the sub-
projects having an EIRR of 10 percent or more. The project is designed to contribute to balanced
regional development and equity in the country and to improve the standard of living of the rural
population in general. The EIRR for the electrification component as a whole is estimated at 11.9
percent. Detailed economic analysis of the electrification component appears in Annex 3-14, and
the main features of this analysis are discussed below.
3.33       The main determinants of the forecasted demand for electricity in the areas to be
electrified under the electrification component of the proposed project are town population,
population growth rate, and rate of penetration of electricity among new customers. The demand
forecast based on these factors is then modified to reflect the increase in the real income of the
consumers as well as the expected increase in the electricity tariffs. It is expected that with an
average growth rate of about 8.5 percent in the first 10 years after completion of the project, the
demand for electricity will reach its peak of about 200 GWh per year by the year 2006. The
incremental demand to be served under the Project(i.e. the difference between the 'with the
project' and " without the project " cases) is the forecasted demand since the areas to be
electrified under the project do not have electricity at present.



- 39 -
3.34        The main benefit of the investment under the proposed project which is quantified
and captured in the economic analysis is the incremental demand served valued at the consumers'
willingness to pay for electricity. The willingness to pay for electricity is estimated at
US$0.2/kWh and is used in the base case scenario of the economic analysis. Also included on the
benefit side is the avoided capital cost of equipment using the alternative fuel (i.e., kerosene). Of
course, there are many other benefits associated with the proposed project that because of their
nature and lack of adequate data could not be quantified and included in the analysis. On the cost
side, the analysis includes: capital investment in substations, sub-transmission, distribution,
offices, and equipments; associated engineering services; operation and maintenance expenses;
cost of wiring premises and purchasing appliances; cost of electricity supply valued at the long
run marginal cost; and the system's technical losses. All investrnent costs and associated
engineering services include physical contingency.
3.35        As stated above, the base case EIRR is estimated at 11.9 percent which is within the
acceptable range for this type of projects and is robust as indicated by the sensitivity analysis
carried out with respect to various parameters. Sensitivity analysis with respect to the consumers'
willingness to pay for electricity indicates that a 25 percent increase or decrease in the estimated
value used in the base case would increase the EIRR to 16.7 percent or reduce it to 5.8 percent,
respectively. A 10 percent cost over run would reduce the EIRR to 10.7 percent. If the demand
for electricity in each year is 10 percent less than the forecast used in the analysis, the EIRR
would be reduced to 8.8 percent.
3.36        Estiniation of the EIRR for each sub-project, assuming the base case values for each
of the parameters, indicates that the EIRR varies from as high as about 24 percent to as low as 5
percent. There are six sub-projects in Brong-Ahafo, Central, Northern, Upper West (2 sub-
projects), and Western Regions of the country that have an EIRR of less than 10 percent and a
corresponding negative NPV. Of these six, IDA will finance only two in Brong-Ahafo and the
Northern Regions. These two sub-projects in Brong-Ahafo and Northern Regions, each are
considered to be a part of a larger project in that particular region. Clustered by Regions, these
sub-projects have a positive NPV and an acceptable EIRR of more than 10 percent. This,
together with the fact that extension of the national grid to all of the 29 sub-projects is the least-
cost solution to provide electricity, justifies including these sub-projects in the proposed project.
Inclusion of these sub-projects is designed to contribute to balanced regional development and
equity in the country and that supply from the national grid is the least-cost solution.
3.37        The investment proposed for improving the existing ECG's distribution network is
well justified with an estimated EIRR of about 36 percent. See Annex 3-15 for details. The main
benefits are: reduction in the system's technical losses; improvement in system reliability (outage
reduction); and provision of service to new customers in the existing service areas. Reduction in
technical losses results in savings due to reduction in energy consumption and investment required
to expand capacity of the system. Improving system reliability benefits the consumers of
electricity by reducing the frequency and duration of power outages. The benefits to the new
customers is the incremental demand served valued at the consumers' willingness to pay.
3.38        An equal if not a more significant benefit of the project than those already referred
to is that the project also serves as a vehicle and a catalyst to assist the Government and the
utilities to formulate and implement much needed institutional and tariff reforms. These reforms
would be accomplished through the reorganization of ECG and the performance-based



- 40 -
management contract for its commercial operations as well as by instituting a mechanism for
adequate and timely tariff adjustments based on the tariff formula envisaged under the project.
2. Project Risks
3.39        The main risks of the project are that it may overburden ECG's commercial
operations which are already experiencing great difficulties and further contribute to ECG's weak
financial position if tariffs remain insufficient to recover marginal costs. These risks are being
addressed through the institutional strengthening and tariff reforms that are envisaged under the
Project. Inadequate and untimely tariff increases could delay project implementation if this
caused a lack of adequate counterpart funds. A further risk is that households may not start using
electricity as soon as their villages are connected to the national grid because of the high upfront
cost of internal wiring of houses. This risk will be reduced substantially by subsidizing the cost
through a scheme to be established under the project for financing of the internal house wirings.
Also it is expected that the recommendations of the "productive uses' study would be
implemented to achieve better utilization of the infrastructure developed.

Mr. Edwin Lim
Director
Western Africa Operations Department
The World Bank
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Lim,
National Electrirication Project:
Power Sector Development Policy
The Government of Ghana views electricity as a major long-term development priority
and has established a National Electrification Scheme (NES) to expand electrification to cover
the whole country over a thirty year time period from 1989-2019.
The Government is committed to an economically sound and orderly growth of the
power sector, taking into account the contribution of electricity required for the country's
economic and social development, the amount of available development finance which can be
reasonably allocated to the sector, and the social-economic benefits which can be expected
from the distribution of the services of electricity across all income and occupational strata of
Ghanaian society.
The five major elements of Ghana's Power sector development policy are:
(i)    effective planning of the power sector;
(ii)   an efficient structure and organization of power sector institutions;
(iii)   appropriate growth of services;
(iv) electricity pricing which reflects the value of resources to be
committed to the growth of power supply; and
(v)    the financial viability and efficiency of the electrical utilities.
The essential framework and thrust of Ghana's future power sector development
policy are now well established and articulated in the Government's Policy document,
"ENERGY & GHANA'S SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: and the recently
completed Bank-assisted ENERGY SECTOR REVIEW.



-2-                                          ANNEX 1-
Page 2 of 4
The main components of the NES, of which the present project constitutes Phase I,
will be the expansion of the distribution networks in existing service areas, the connection of
new service areas to the national power network, and the addition of the generating and
transmission capacity which will be needed to meet the growing demands of an expanding
economy for electricity.
The present project is designed to have an acceptable economic rate of return for the
aggregate of its component sub-projects, and to distribute the benefits of electricity equitably,
taking into account the importance which the Government attaches to regional balance in the
development of the country's infrastructure, the administrative requirements of the districts,
and alleviation of poverty.
It is intended that future phases of the NES will follow the same general approach for
selecting and sequencing sub-projects, which requires an evaluation of the economic rate of
return of each sub-project as an essential first step, augmented by the additional socio-
economic considerations already mentioned.
In the above respect, four main planning issues will need to be addressed in Ghana's
Power sector; viz.
(1)   load forecasting and load management;
(2)   the criteria for prioritizing and timing interconnections under the National
Electrification Programme;
(3)    planning co-ordination and capability within and between the utilities and the
Government; and
(4)   institutional and financial capacity of the utilities to implement these plans.
Government recognizes the need to improve our understanding of the main factors
which influence electricity demand growth, and to implement measures which manage demand
economically. This involves improving the data base on household and industrial energy
consumption and its determinants, and taking better account of the roles which pricing,
demand management and energy efficiency improvements can play in shaping the growth of
electricity demand. This will be particularly important over the next several years, when we
anticipate a supply/demand imbalance, as a result of the VRA retrofit programme and load
growth which has been greater than previously predicted or provided for.
Important cost considerations entering into the viability of the NES are system
reinforcement and connection costs. The present project includes an important component of
system reinforcement, and the need for future reinforcement will be re-assessed periodically.
The Government also recognizes that the success of the NES will be influenced
heavily by consumers' rate of connection. Because the front-end cost of house wiring may be
greater than many can afford to pay at once, serious consideration and thought are being
given to the idea of increasing the levies paid into the National Electrification Fund, whereby
all consumers of electricity pay a transparent surcharge included in the tariff, from which
house wiring costs for new consumers could be financed. These new consumers may also be
required to advance some downpayment for their house wiring, in order to secure their



PgANNEX 1-3
financial commitment to the investments being made on their behalf. These measures should
help to assure the levels of demand expected and required for the viability of the programme.
With regard to generating capacity expansion, there are specific proposals now being
assessed. The Government's general policy approach to this investment is that it should be
mindful of the economic merit of complementing and augmenting the hydro system with
thermal capability in a least-cost manner, and it should be robust to a range of supply and
demand outcomes, given some inevitable uncertainty about the availability of hydro energy
and the exact size of future demand on the system. The need for an increment of generation
capacity is urgent. The VRA will develop this project mindful of the possibility that at some
future time, it may prove economically viable to use natural gas as the fuel of choice for
thermal generation.
The export market is of some importance in generation planning. The Government
supports VRA's interest in maintaining and further developing electricity export markets,
provided that the terms and conditions of the exports - including price and assurance of
market - will yield an attractive risk-adjusted rate of return.
As you know, the on-going Power VI Project includes the preparation of a Power
Sector Master Plan. The Mfinistry believes this to be an opportune time to consolidate and
integrate all of the aforementioned objectives into a coherent and consistent programrnme to
ensure the sustained development and growth of Ghana's Power Sector. In this respect, the
Terms of Reference for the Master Plan study are being drafted, with a view to its execution
and implementation within the time frame of the present project.
An efficient ownership and corporate structure with a correspondingly appropriate
division of roles and responsibilities between entities within the Power sector is essential to its
effective development. The Energy Sector Review provided a helpful discussion,
complementary to the Government's on-going consideration, of matters relating to corporate
structure, ownership arrangements and division of responsibility within the power sector. The
Government supports the idea of creating a Task Force with broadly-based local expertise to
evaluate options for improving upon the efficiency and efficacy of the ownership and
corporate structure arrangements now in place in the utility sub-sector. Implementation of
fundamental structural change could ensue from this assessment. I address the more
immediate problems of ECG's commercial operations further below.
It is well established here that the Mlinistry is responsible for general policy, and the
utilities for implementation and operation of electricity supply, on a commercially viable
basis. The Government supports the view in the Sector Report that practice should generally
respect this principle.
In the above respect, one of the fundamental matters which deserves further
consideration is the role of Government in the tariff-making process. Government has stated
that electricity tariff should reflect the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of supply. The
Government is committed to the implementation of electricity tariffs which reflect LRMC and
are adequate for the financial viability of both VRA and ECG. In this regard, the
Government implemented a major tariff increase early in 1992. It is recognized, however,
that on the whole the present tariff is still well below LRMC. It is the Government's
intention that the tariff approximate LRNMC by 1996, largely as recommended in the recently
completed Electricity Tariff Study. To this effect, as part of the present project, the



ANNEX IIS
.4-                                           Page 4 of 4
Government will adopt a formula-based approach to tariff adjustment, which will include a
tariff increase for 1993, and provide for the regular and systematic adjustment of the tariff
thereafter on the basis of an agreed formula.
The Government intends that the utilities should operate as commercially viable
enterprises. While the Tariff programme will make an essential contribution to the
commercial viability of the utilities, the Government also attaches great importance to the
internal efficiency of the utilities' technical and commercial operations. The main focus of
this concern is now with the ECG, wherein the Fifth Power Project is expected to assist in the
reduction of technical losses. In order to improve ECG's commercial operations, it is
proposed to implement a performance-based management contract with a utility/contractor as
an integral part of the recently appraised NES project. The contractor will be given the
necessary and sufficient authority to manage the commercial operations of ECG, and the
contractor's remuneration will be based on performance.
The Government also recognizes the importance of the utilities' paying competitive
salaries and in general having conditions of service which retain competent staff and motivates
them to perform effectively. I hope that this matter could also be studied in the present
project and the Master Plan. While these measures should have an early and constructive
impact on utility "corporate culture", the Government also looks forward to the potential
further contribution of the proposed Task Force on corporate arrangements for the longer
term.
It is the Government's expectation that the overall approach to Ghana's Power sector
development outlined in this letter will meet the key requirements for its orderly and
economic development and management over the foreseeable future.
Yours sincerely,
PNDC SECRETARY FOR ENERGY

ANNEX 1-9(a)

GHANA
NATIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
PERFORMANCE-BASED MANAGEMENT CONTRACT FOR
COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS OF ECG
1.           Given the substantial improvements needed in the ECG's commercial
operations, it is proposed to involve the private sector in the management of ECG's
commercial operations. This participation would be in the form of a performance-based
contract. ECG has proposed to hire EDF as the contractor to be financed by the French
Government through CCCE. ECG has already proposed to reorganize its operations to bring
together under one directorate all the functions related to its commercial operations. This new
directorate would be called Customer Service Directorate. It is expected that the management
contractor (EDF) would take responsibility for management and operation of the Customer
Service Directorate under a performance-based management contract, where compensation of
the contractor is linked to achieving a certain measurable performance targets. Compliance of
contractor with its contractual obligations would be guaranteed through a performance bond or
similar instrument. Failure to meet the performance targets would result in penalties, while
improving on them would produce a bonus.
2.           It is clear that the choice of performance indicators and performance targets is
critical to the success of this arrangement. The performance indicators would need to be
transparent, easy to measure, and as much as possible not be to influenced by factors out of
control of the contractor. If chosen too stringently, they will discourage the contractor and,
hence, increase the cost of the services. If too lax, they will not lead to a reasonable
improvement of ECG's commercial operations in a reasonable time. Furthermore, the
performance indicators must be easily quantifiable and verifiable, in order to avoid lengthy
and inconclusive discussion at the end of each year (or period) when the rewards or penalties
are decided. Finally, as much as possible, they must be independent of ECG's performance
in years past and relate to the timeframe in which the contractor would be providing its
management services. Examples of likely performance indicators to be considered are: the
billing of at least a given percentage of the energy the ECG purchases from VRA; and
collecting at least a given percentage of the energy billed during the year. One additional
factor to be considered will be the weight to be given to each of the different targets, as some
might be more important than others.
3.           Since compensation is linked to performance, the contractor should be given
sufficient and clear authority to manage the Customer Services Directorate. It is envisaged
that the head of the team to manage the Customer Services Directorate would report to the
ECG's Managing Director as one of the several ECG directors. After reviewing the present
management of ECG's commercial operations, as much as possible, he will try to use the
services of the existing personnel but will have the right to reassign them to other functions,
including advisory position. The management contractor would be at liberty to choose the
number of expatriate experts that it wishes to attach to ECG at the management level in the
Customer Services Directorate. The head of the management team would have to be given
the authority to hire, fire, reassign the staff that is needed for him to fulfill his responsibilities
under the Contract and to achieve the agreed targets. The relationship and interaction



ANNEX 1-9(a)
Page 2 of 2
between the management contractor and other departments of ECG would need to be clearly
defined to ensure adequate cooperation between the Customer Services Directorate and other
ECG directorates. Also, the period of the contract should be long enough to provide adequate
incentive for the contractor and give it sufficient time to have a reasonable impact on ECG's
commercial operation. Therefore, a contract period of at least 3 years is deemed necessary.
Finally, there has to be mechanism for arbitration between ECG and the management
contractor, in case of disputes on fulfillment of the contractual obligation.
4.           To assist ECG with review and negotiations of the management contract with
EDF, IDA is financing an expert under the project's PPF. Terms of Reference for this expert
is included in this annex.

DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE
FOR AN EXPERT TO ASSIST ECG IN
THE HIRING OF A MANAGEMENT CONTRACTOR
1.    The scope of work of the expert to be hired under the PPF to assist ECG with review
and negotiations of a performance-based management contract for the commercial operations
of ECG will include the following:
(a)    Review existing management contracts (Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, etc.) to
identify those characteristics that might be suitable and desirable for the case
of Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG).
(b)    Determine performance indicator to be used to judge performance of the
management company. These might include billing as percentage of energy
purchased, collections as percentage of bills issued, number of customers per
staff, etc., as well as other specific items such as:
(i)  Training and transfer of technology; and
(ii) Substitution of expatriates by local management/staff.
(c)    Determine the nominal or initial values for the performance indicator and the
values to be achieved (targets) in the following years.
(d)    Propose bonus and penalties to be applied as a function of the targets.
(e)    Propose a mechanism to share the bonus and/or penalties between the
management company and the resident expatriates.
(f)    Define the authority to be vested in the management contractor (hire, fire,
transfer of personnel).
(g)    Review the management contract proposed by EDF with ECG and with IDA.
(h)    Assist ECG in negotiating the contract with EDF.

AN ELECTRICITY TARIFF FORMULA PROPOSAL FOR GHANA
1.            For each of VRA and ECG, the electricity tariff should provide adequate
revenue to meet LRMC and commercially acceptable financial ratios (in particular, the debt
service ratio,l/ the self-financing ratio,2/ the operating ratioQ/ and the current
ratio);4/ the appropriate rate of return on net revalued assets in operation is that
commensurate with the values chosen for these ratios. The revenue requirement consistent
with LRMC may diverge from that needed to meet these ratios. The higher requirement
prevails. The analytical procedure is to first calculate LRMC revenue requirements, then
measure the achievement of financial ratios at the LRMC revenue yield. If any of the ratios
are not met, the revenue requirement is increased by increasing the tariff.
2.            Revenue is the product of price and quantity sold. Price and quantity are
related because price elasticity of demand is greater than zero: i.e., as price increases,
growth of sales will be slowed. The demand adjustment factor (F) to account for price
elasticity is:
F = (1 + % real price increase) c' ............ [11
An elasticity of -0.25 means that there will be a 2.5 percent demand reduction (relative to
demand without the price increase) for each 10 percent real increase in tariffs.5/ For
example, an elasticity of -0.25 and a 10 percent real increase in price results in sales which
are 97.6 percent of the original level.6/ It is essential to estimate F in order not to
1/    Debt service ratio = net income + depreciation + interest paid all divided by interest
and long-terrm loan payments.
2/     Self-financing ratio = net internal cash generation - working capital - debt service
requirements all divided by investment requirements (averaged over several years).
I/     Operating ratio = operating expenses/revenue.
4/     Current ratio = current assets/current liabilities.
5/    This note assumes, for sake of simplicity, that the full impact of the price increase
happens in the year that the price change occurs. In reality, the impact could be
spread over a longer period, but a high proportion of the impact is most likely near
term.
_/     F = 1.1^ - 0.25 = 0.976. Thus, if demand in year t were projected to be 1000 GWh
with no price increase, and a 10% price increase were imposed for year t, demand in
year t would be 976 GWh rather than 1000 GWh.

exaggerate the impact on revenues of a price increase.7/ Price elasticity can differ between
categories of consumers.
3.           Total revenue is the sum of price times quantity for each customer category.
Since each customer category has a different cost of service (normally differentiated by
service voltage level and divergence of maximum demand from system peak demand), each
customer category will have a different LRMC tariff. Hence, the price formula should reflect
not only the aggregate revenue requirement, but a price structure commensurate with the
LRMC of the customer category.|/
4.           When the divergence between current and LRMC tariffs is very large, and for
policy reasons it is decided to close the gap over a period of some years, the tariff adjustment
formula must include a phase-in factor (V) which takes into account not only the real price
difference between the current tariff and the current measure of the LRMC tariff, but also the
impact of inflation and currency devaluation on LRMC revenue requirements over the phase-
in period. (ITe price charged is a nominal price.) V is the proportion of the gap between
LRMC and the 1992 tariff to be included in the following year's tariff. The formula for the
next year's tariff, including phase-in, is:
T, = T2 + V.(ALRMC2 - T2) ............. [21, where
ALRMC = adjusted LRMC (see paragraphs 6 and 7 below),
T = tariff
Subscript 2 = current year
Subscript 3 = next year
5.           Two important design features of the tariff formula are (1) simplicity and (2)
application interval. With regard to simplicity, the most complex set of estimates are those
needed to derive LRMC. However, in the case of Ghana, this has been done very recently in
the Ghana Power Sector Tariff Study.21 The LRMC per kWh is driven largely by
forecasted investment requirements and forecasted demand. As these forecasts change
periodically, the LRMC will change accordingly. Hence, LRMC is a 'moving target' which
7/    The demand forecasts prepared in Ghana do not embody explicit assumptions about
price elasticity of demand. Demand elasticity in Ghana can be low because a
substantial part of electricity consumption is covered in the lifeline Tariff-a bloc
charge for 100 kWh per month; furthermore, some consumers' bills are paid by their
employers. Apart from these circumstances, it is reasonable to expect demand
elasticity to be greater than zero because consumers can economize on consumption
and they can switch between fuels for certain uses as relative prices change.
I/    A life-line tariff in the residential category yields a loss relative to LRMC which
should be compensated transparently, either by a cross-subsidy between electricity
consumers, or by a Treasury contribution to the utility. These options have not been
assessed in this paper.
2/    Ghana Power Sector Tariff Study, February 1992, by Acres International Ltd., in
association with Ontario Hydro, for the Ghana Ministry of Energy.

should be re-assessed, using the framework in the Acres Report, whenever major changes of
underlying assumptions are eiher expected or are observed to have taken place.
6.           The approach adopted here is that the LRMC in the Acres Report will
adequately reflect the structure of the power sector at least over the next few years (i.e., the
investment program and demand outlook in the Report will remain largely correct), hence the
main changes required are to adjust LRMC to provide for annual currency devaluation,
international inflation and domestic inflation. Once these adjustments are made, the result is
ALRMC (adjusted LRMC). The ALRMC plus V yield the next year's tariff requirement.
7.           ALRMC is derived by applying a currency devaluation index and an
international inflation index (the MUV) to the foreign cost share of LRMC, and the domestic
inflation index (the CPI, which is available on a current basis in Ghana) to the local cost share
of LRMC. (Typically in Africa, these cost shares would be in the range of 0.80 to 0.85
foreign and 0.20 to 0.15 local. Precision is only important if there were major differences of
escalation indices between foreign and local costs.) The LRMC in the Acres Report is for
1991. Hence, the first year of ALRMC will be to update it to 1992 for implementation in
1993. The ALRMC formula (for example, to get 1992 ALRMC) is:
E M~          P2
ALRMC2_[(M* 2 MUV2)+(D* )]LRfC ..... [3]
El MUV1       pi
where:
E = exchange rate (average over the year)
P = domestic price index (average over the year)
M = import share of LRMC
D = domestic share of LRMC
MUV = international import price deflator (manufactures unit value index, published
by World Bank)
Subscript 1 = previous year
8.           To derive the 1993 tariff (T3), after applying formula [31 to derive 1992
ALRMC (ALRMC2), formula [2] is applied for phasing in part of the difference between the
1992 actual tariff and the 1992 ALRMC. The ALRMC is always, at most, one year behind
the year for which the tariff change applies, because the changes to E, P and MUV for the
coming year are the ratio of the current year's values over the previous year's values. Thus,
the calculation should be done near the end of the current year for application in the next
year. This approach has the merit of relying on actual rather than forecasted adjustments. As
some further tariff adjustment may anyhow be needed in light of the need to also satisfy
financial ratios, it is not necessarily problematic that, on average, the tariff will be some
months behind the ALRMC for the current year.
9.           With regard to the application interval, it is recommended to be guided by
what is administratively feasible. The yearly requirement can be sub-divided into quarterly or
half-yearly portions, in order to graduate the rate change over the year, and implemented



ANNEX 1-11
Page 4 of 6
accordingly. The Ghana Ministry of Energy has expressed a preference for quarterly
adjustment of the tariff, and it is agreed that an item would be included in the ECG
commercial operations management contract to assess how this may be handled efficiently. In
no case would the application period exceed one year.
10.           To conclude, the formula-based tariff adjustment process for each customer
category every year would consist of the following steps:
(1)    Calculate ALRMC.
(2)    Calculate the tariff taking into account the phase-in ratio between
ALRMC and the 1992 tariff.
(3)    Calculate the percentage change in the tariff which results from steps
(1) and (2) above.
(4)    Use this percentage price change and an assumed demand elasticity to
calculate F. (Not applicable to the VRA bulk supply tariff to ECG,
because this is a wholesale transaction. Demand elasticity is measured
at point of final consumption.)
(5)    Apply F to the sales forecast which assumes no price elasticity,
yielding a forecast of sales with the impact on sales of the price
change.
(6)    Apply the new tariff to the adjusted sales forecast to derive a revenue
forecast.
(7)    Verify whether the revenue is sufficient to meet the financial ratios
criteria. If not, increase V until financial ratios are achieved. Once
LRMC is achieved, it is unlikely that the financial criteria would
remain unmet. If they did, higher tariffs or a re-examination of costs
are indicated. In this respect, the LRMC in the Acres Report already
includes an assumption that overall system losses are gradually
reduced from the current level of about 20 percent, down to about
14.5 percent.
11.           Attached is an example of tariff adjustments needed to close the gaps between
ALRMC and the 1992 tariff over the period 1993 to 1996, using (World Bank) forecasted
values of E, P, and MUV. All input assumptions are given in lines 3 to 20, and results in
lines 23 to 41. Annex I is a set of sample calculations for steps I to 4 above. The
projections for VRA's bulk supply tariff in 1993 and 1994 only are moderated relative to
those consistent with the phase-in factors of line 6, in order to bring ECG's rate of return to
acceptable values, while maintaining VRA's rate of return at satisfactory levels.
12.           Looking at lines 23 to 26, it is readily apparent that the largest price increases
are required for the ECG residential tariff and the VRA bulk supply tariff, followed by the
ECG LV tariff, then the ECG HV tariff. The ECG non-residential tariff and the VRA HV
tariffs are close enough to LRMC now that only moderate changes are needed in the future.

In sum, apart from tariff increases, there is indicated here a considerable need to re-balance
the tariff between customer categories in order to satisfy the objective of charging each
customer category according to its appropriate share of system costs.

ANNEX I: Example of 1993 Tariff and Demand Adjustment Calculation
(1)    Derivation of ECG residential ALRMC92 for the 1993 tariff, from formula [3]:
[(.85 * 442 * 102.8)+(.15 * 13]39.9=47.9
375   100           100
2)     Derivation of 1993 tariff with phase-in:
T93 = 11.8 + .25(47.9 - 11.8) = 20.8
(3)    Derivation of price increase 1993/92: (% as decimal):
(20.8/11.8) - 1 = .76
(4)    Derivation of F:
F = [(1.76) / (113/100)]4Z5 = .895
The expression 113/100 (P92/P91) converts the nominal price increase into a real
price increase for purposes of calculating the demand adjustment factor as a function
of price elasticity and real price change.
(These input values and results are as indicated in the accompanying tariff forecast of 1993 to
1996.)

4.    Income Statement
Revenue
Sales Revenues. Sales forecasts, as projected at Attachment 2, are based on the load
forecast as projected in the Acres Combustion Turbine Feasibility Draft Report (September 1992) and the
supply projected by VRA/Acres (September 4, 1992). Sales forecasts take into consideration existing
bulk supply contracts, reasonable domestic demand forecasts and adjustments for unserved energy. The
load forecast is based on an average consumption growth rate of about 1.9 percent per annum. Revenue
forecasts are based on average and projected London Metal Exchange aluminum prices for VALCO,
supply contracts for foreign consumers, and on tariffs as described in Annex 1-10.
Other Income. This comprises rents, service charges and miscellaneous receipts and has
been adjusted for domestic inflation.



ANNEX 2-3
Page 2 of 4
OMerating Expenses
Salaries. Based on the 1992 budget and increased annually thereafter by local inflation
and 7.5 percent to cover promotions and salary increases.
Materials. Based on the 1992 budget and adjusted annually for domestic inflation.
Transportation Costs. Based on the 1992 budget for maintenance and operating costs and
adjusted annually for domestic inflation.
General Expenses. Expenses reflect budget provision for 1992 adjusted annually for
domestic inflation. These comprise items such as office rentals, repairs and maintenance, and other
expenses not directly related to operations such as staff welfare, education subsidies, consulting services.
Generation Costs. Includes thermal generation costs in the NED area and operating and
maintenance costs of thermal generation at Tema from 1993 onwards and for other thermal plants from
1996 onwards. Based on the draft Combustion Turbine Feasibility Report, generation cost per kWh is
US$0.0584 (0.0534 for fuel and US$0.0005 for operating and maintenance cost) for the Tema diesel plant
and the first 300 MW addition.
NED Deficit/Surplus. NED's projected income statements 1992-99, (see Annex 2-3,
Attachment 4).
Depreciation. Depreciation has been calculated on a straight-line basis over the expected
life of the assets, at an average rate of 2-1/4 percent on the average revalued gross fixed assets in
operation.
Deferred Expenses. Expenditures for on-going and projected studies will be written off
upon completion of the studies.
Foreign Exchange Losses Written Off. VRA's foreign currency loans, and subsidiary
loans on which it bears the foreign exchange risk, are revalued every year-end at prevailing exchange
rates. Foreign exchange losses on loans related to fixed assets in service are accumulated in the Exchange
Fluctuation Debt Account at the end of the year in which they occur. Foreign exchange losses related
to loans for ongoing works are added to Work in Progress, and capitalized. The balance on the Exchange
Fluctuation Debt Account has been amortized over an assumed average 10-year life of loans.
Interest. See Debt Service Schedule (Attachment 2).
Debt Contingency Fund. Appropriations are based on the need for VRA to set aside and
maintain in foreign exchange the lesser of one year's foreign exchange debt service obligations or
US$25.0 million equivalent.



ANNEX2-_3
Page 3 of 4
5.    Balance Sheet
Fixed Assets. Fixed assets have been revalued on the opening balance each year, by
applying local inflation rates to 20 percent of total fixed assets and foreign inflation rates to the remaining
80 percent.
Dereciatio. Accumulated depreciation has been revalued on the opening balance each
year by applying local inflation rates to 20 percent of total accumulated depreciation and foreign inflation
rates to the remaining 80 percent.
Work in Progress. Capital investment (Annex 1-5) at average exchange rates is
accumulated in work in progress pending commissioning after which it is transferred to fixed assets.
Expenses incurred in carrying out the Akosombo retrofit, and other fixed asset rehabilitation work are
accumulated in work in progress and upon completion of the works, charged to revaluation reserve.
Commissioning of assets in the Capital Expenditure Program is based on estimates of VRA's Engineering
Department.
Debt Contingency Fund Investments. These amounts represent the investment of funds
appropriated from net income for building up and maintaining the debt contingency fund.
Ca. Includes VRA's normal daily cash requirements for operating expenses and
projected surplus cash. While no short-term investments have been projected, surplus cash could be
invested in short-term instruments.
Inventories. These have been estimated annually at 0.4 percent of gross fixed assets in
operation.
Receivables. These have been estimated to progressively decrease from the 1992 budget
amnount representing 4 month's billing to 2 month's in 1993 and 1 month's billings from 1994 onwards.
Equity and Liabilities
Revaluation Reserve. VRA's revaluation reserve is consistent with generally acceptable
accounting principles in Ghana. This account reflects net surplus on revaluation of fixed assets and
depreciation. The account has been reduced by expenses incurred by the Akosobo retrofit and other
rehabilitation work on fixed assets.
Grant. Grant financing from Danida and the National Electrification Fund are expected
to total about $13.8 million equivalent.
Long-term Debt. See the attached Debt Service Schedule (Attachment 2).
Accounts Payable. These have been estimated at one month's cash operating expenses
plus 5 percent of capital expenditure.
Loan Interes was estimated at 3 months' annual interest.



ANNEX 2-3
Page 4 of 4
6.    Funds Flow Statement
Working Capital Changes. Relate to movement in inventories (0.4% GFA), debtors (4
months in 1992, 2 months in 1993, and 1 month from 1994 onwards), creditors (1 month's cash operating
expenses, 5 percent of the year's capital expenditure program for construction), and accrued interest (3
months annual interest).
Debt Service. Calculations are given in detail in the Debt Service Schedule (Attachment
2).
Capital Investment. Details of the Capital Expenditure Program are given in Annex 1-5
and interest during construction in Attachment 2.
7.    Northern Electricity Department (ND)
Income Statement
Energ Revenues. Forecasted sales are based on projected VRA sales to NED plus
projected energy generated by NED up to 1996. Revenue forecasts are based on load forecasts and tariffs
as described in Annex 1-10.
Losses. Distribution losses are projected to gradually decrease from 21 percent in 1992
to 12 percent by 1998 and remain at that level thereafter.
Other Reven. Estimates of revenues from service connections, sale of equipment, etc.,
were based on VRA's budget and adjusted for local inflation for the outer years.
Oprating ExRMnse
Salaries. Based on 1992 salaries and increased by local inflation and 7.5 percent to cover
promotions and salary increases. The projected salaries also account for staff movements.
Materials. Projections based on VRA's 1992 budget and escalated by inflation thereafter.
Transptation. Calculations were based on the 1992 budget for maintenance and
operating costs and adjusted by local inflation thereafter.
Power Purchases. Power purchases were calculated at VRA's supply rate to ECG.
Fuel Costs. The 1992 budget which assumes fuel costs at C73.81/GWh for 1992, is the
basis for future projections, which have been adjusted for foreign inflation.
Dereciatign. Depreciation has been charged on a straight-line basis over the expected
life of the assets at a rate of 4 percent on the average revalued gross fixed assets in operation.

ASSUMPIIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
General
1.           ECG's audited 1991 accounts and the approved corporate budget for 1992 provide the
basis for the financial projections.
2.           The following exchange rates were used in the preparation of the financial projections.
Year                       Rate
1992                        442
1993                        528
1994                        552
1995                        560
1996                        568
1997-1999                   576
Future inflation rates used are as follows:
Year                  LocaI               Foreign
1992                 13.0%                  2.8%
1993                 23.0%                  3.9%
1994                  8.0%                  3.9%
1995-1999             5.0%                  3.8%
Income Staterment
Revenue
3.           Sales Revenue. ECG's GWh sales are derived from the VRA supply forecasted for ECG
(as provided in the Acres Combustion Turbine Feasibility Draft Report of September 1992) less the
assumed distribution losses of 20% in 1992, falling to 19%, 17%, 15%, and 14% from 1993, 1994,
1995, 1996 and thereafter, respectively. Sales are assumed to increase on the basis of an average
consumption growth rate of 6 percent per annum. Sales revenues are based on projected sales growth
and tariffs described in Annex 1-11. Thereafter, tariffs are adjusted by local inflation.
4.           Other Income. This consists primarily of disconnection and reconnection fees, overhead
services for customers, sales of stores, and miscellaneous receipts. The 1992 budget has been adjusted
by local inflation for future years' projections.
5.           Consumer Contribution Amortization. See para. 23.



ANNEX 2-7

Oprating Expenes
6.           ECG Bulk Supply. ECG's purchases from VRA have been assumed on the basis of the
latest demand projections contained in the draft Combustion Turbine Feasibility Study.
7.           Generating Expenses. ECG's 1991 budget has been increased by local inflation until 1996
when most of the system will be connected to the grid.
8.           Distribution Repairs and Maintenance.  Expenses for 1992 reflect ECG's budget
provision; from 1993 onwards they are projected at 0.5 percent of gross fixed assets.
9.           Transportation. Costs have been calculated based on historical maintenance and operating
unit costs per vehicle, adjusted by local inflation, and the changes to vehicle fleet numbers.
10.          Salaries. Based on ECG's 1992 budgeted average wages for 3,415 employees adjusted
for proposed staff reductions and local inflation. The salaries expenses also include normal retirement
benefits.
1l.          Other Administrative Expenses. These comprise typical overhead items such as office
rentals, maintenance, supplies, and other expenses not directly related to operations and are based on
ECG's 1992 budget, increased by local inflation.
12.          Bad Debts Written Off. Based on ECG's 1992 budget and projected at 0.5 percent of
total sales.
13.          Dereciation. Depreciation has been charged on a straight-line basis over the expected
life of the assets, at an average rate of 4 percent on the opening balance of gross fixed assets in operation.
14.          Consultancy and Training Write-Off. Expenditures under the Power V and NES projects
will be written off over five years following project completion.
15.          Contingency - Assumed at 2.5 percent of operating expenses excluding purchased power
from VRA.
16.          Interes . See ECG's Debt Service Schedule (Attachment 2).
17.          Foreign Exchange Losses Written Off. ECG's foreign currency loans, and subsidiary
loans on which it bears the foreign exchange risk, are revalued every year-end at prevailing exchange
rates. Foreign exchange losses on loans from 1992 onwards related to fixed assets in service have been
written off against the Revaluation Reserve at the end of the year in which they occur. Foreign exchange
losses related to loans for ongoing works are added to Work in Progress, and capitalized. The balance
of cumulative foreign exchange losses not written off in 1991, are written off over an assumed average
10-year life of loans.
18.          Staff Performance Incentives. Performance incentives are calculated at 5 percent of base
benefits to reward performance and efficiency improvements of ECG staff under the performance
contract.

Funds Flow Statement
19.          Working Capital Changes relate to movement in inventories, debtors, creditors, and
prepayments, as described in paras. 28-30 below.
20.          Debt Repayment. See ECG's Debt Service Schedule (Attachment 2).
21.          Capital Investment. See the attached investment program of ECG (Annex 1-6).
22.          Borrowing. See the Debt Service Schedule (Attachment 2).
23.          Consumer Contributions. Consumer contributions are based on the 1992 budget and
increased by the sales growth rate. Contributions relating to capital investment, assumed at 4 percent of
the previous year's consumer contribution closing balance, are amortized annually.
24.          Gants includes government and grant-financed rural electrification projects to be passed
on to ECG by the Government as equity upon project completion. Total grant financing by Danida,
CCCE, the Dutch (ORT) and the NEF under this project is expected to amount to $33.4 million.
Balance Sheets
25.          Fixed Assets and Accumulated Depreciation. Fixed Assets and Accumulated Depreciation
have been revalued on the opening balance each year by a factor comprising 40 percent local inflation
and 60 percent foreign inflation. This reflects the historic relationship of foreign to local investment
costs. The surplus is carried each year to ECG's revaluation reserve.
26.          Work in Progress. Capital investment at average exchange rates is accumulated in work
in progress pending commissioning. Upon completion of the work the related investment, interest and
effects of foreign exchange fluctuation are transferred to fixed assets.
27.          Deferred Charges. Refer to consultancy and training charges related to Power V and the
institutional development and technical assistance components under the Power VII project.
28.          Receivables are assumed to decrease from 4.2 months' billings in 1992 to 1.5 months by
1997 and thereafter following efforts to improve revenue collections.
29.          Inventories are projected at 1 percent of gross fixed assets in operation.
30.          Prepayments are projected at 2 percent of gross fixed assets to cover advance payments
to contractors and suppliers.
31.          Other Current Assets include other trade and sundry debtors and staff advances are
projected to increase by local inflation from ECG's 1992 budgeted amounts.
32.          Long-term Debt. See the attached Debt Service Schedule (Attachment 2).
33.          Payables have been assumed at 3 month's cash operating expenses.

NATIONAL ELECTRIFCATION PROJECT
DERAILED PROJECT DESCRIPION
1.    The proposed Project comprises three major areas, namely: an institutional
improvement component in ECG, an investment component to be executed by VRA and
ECG, and a technical assistance component.
A.    Institutonal ImDrovement Comyonent
2.    This effort focusses on the urgent need to improve the efficiency of the commercial
operations of ECG through:
(a)    The creation of a new Consumers Services Directorate, that will concentrate
all the commercial and technical activities required to provide an efficient
service to all type of consumers.
(b)    Contracting of a qualified utility and/or a utility consulting firm to manage
ECG's new Consumers Services Directorate under a performance-based
management contract for a period of three (3) years.
B.    Investment Component
3.    A part of this component (National Electrification Scheme) would enable the
Government of Ghana to provide electricity from the national power grid to small urban
centers, district capitals and rural areas through a systematic electrification program. The
National Electrification Scheme would be carried out by ECG and VRA through its Northern
Electricity Department, each are responsible for the sub-projects in its respective service area
as shown in Table 1 of this Annex. Additional information is presented for VRA on ECG
sub-projects in Annex 3-2 and Annex 3-3, respectively. The nature of the works, goods and
services is describe as follows:
(a)    Connect to the main grid about 434 communities located in all 10 regions of
the country and would cover the cost of connecting about 119,000 consumers.
The proposed project would involve in particular:
(i)     The construction of about 1000 km for VRA and 1200 km for
ECG of medium-voltage (1540 km at 33 kV and 585 km at 11
KV) and low voltage (400 v) lines, distribution transformers,
breakers, reclosers and other related electrical equipment;
(ii)     The construction of about 119,000 household comections
(50,000 for VRA and 69,000 for ECG);
(iii)    The construction of buildings required to operate and maintain
the power system at the district level;



ANNEX 3-1
Page 2 of 4
(iv)      The supply of vehicles, tools, and specialized equipment for
operating and maintaining the distribution network in the new
areas;
(v)      Consultancy services for distribution engineering design, bid
preparation and evaluation, and construction management
(including stock management, construction supervision), and
design and implement a pilot program for productive uses of
electricity.
4.     The other part of this investment component is the re-inforcement of the ECG's
distribution network through the execution of a time slice of approximately three years of
distribution works needed to expand substations, built or replaced major links between
substations and to back the loss reduction program.
(a)    Sub-transmission System. Reinforcement and extension of the key sub-
transmission links in Accra, Kumasi, Takoradi, Koforidua, Tema and Cape
Coast. This includes: (i) supply and erection of high voltage 33 kV and 11
kV overhead lines and underground cables; (ii) supply and erection of 40
MVA 33/11 kV transformers and associated switchgear.
(b)    Distribution. Supply of service cables meters and necessary accessories
needed to connect new consumers, to replace faulty meters over a period of
three years.
C. Training and Studies
5.      Both utilities have ongoing staff development and training programs, as well as
studies financed under ongoing IDA credits. Therefore, the activities listed below have the
intention of complementing these activities. The areas identified in need of training, and of
technical assistance and studies are the following:
(a)    A study to design, develop and implement a pilot demonstration program for
promoting productive uses of electricity.
(b)    Training for the existing and new staff that will be responsible for operation
and administration of the new systems in both technical and commercial areas.
It is recommended that this would be achieved through arrangements to be
made with mature utilities in Canada and the USA, because of language
similarity and the need of the utilities to know distribution methods of North
America.
(c)    A study to review the scheme of services of power sector utilities and offer
recommendations in regards to salary policies and incentives.
(d)    Training of the staff of the utilities in the following areas: finance, audit,
systems planning, corporate planning, utility management and marketing.

(e)    Supply of computer hardware and software for carrying out and implementing
the recommendations of the Training Assistance and Studies activities; and
training needs for in-house training activities.

STUDY FOR PRODUCTIVE USES OF ELECTRICITY PROGRAM
Objective
1.           The program would be to assist the Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG),
the Volta River Authority/Northern Electrification Department (VRA/NED) and others to put
in place and carry out a sustainable program for increasing the productive uses of electricity
in agriculture, agro-business, in small business enterprises, and in the home. Such a program
should be targeted to be implemented in three to five selected areas through the provision of
technical services and demonstration equipment in both the ECG and the VRA/NED service
areas as a part of the National Electrification Scheme.
Scope of Work
2.           Undertake the study on Productive Uses of Electricity through the provision of
an estimated three-person month effort to include, but not necessarily be limited to, the
following:
(a)    Document Review
To include the National Electrification Scheme documents and all relevant
materials pertaining to past and projected use pattern.
(b)    Field Review and Selection of Pilot Areas
(i)     Visit and analyze a minimum of three presently electrified and
yet-to-be electrified areas to verify present and potential uses
of electricity patterns in such areas. It is suggested that a
suitable Demand Assessment Model (DAM) or equivalent for
rural electrification site selection be used for this review.
(ii)     Use the above findings and data, in coordination with and
additional input from MOE, ECG and VRA/NED staff, to
select three to five areas for inclusion in the Pilot Productive
Uses of Electricity Program.
(c)    Preparation of Program Design
Program design for implementation of the productive uses of electricity
program will include:
(i)     Overall objective of the Productive Uses Program.
(ii)     Suggested life of the program and illustrative budget.

(iii)     Suggested timetable for life of program (to coincide with the
proposed life of the WB-funded program 1992-1997).
(iv)      Suggested staffing pattern and job description for key staff.
(v)      Suggested training program for staff selected by the MOE and
the utilities to carry out the program.
(vi)      Illustrative list of materials, equipment and supplies and
estimated budget needed to carry out the pilot programs.
(vii)     Illustrative program of activities to implement and carry
forward the productive uses program.
Level of Effort and Cost Estimate
3.            Level of Effort. It is estimated that it will require 2.7 person months to
complete this effort, as follows:
(a)    Two professionals. Three work days each in the home country for
preparation. Twenty-six work days each in Ghana for field work and
programs design. Six work days each in the home country for final design,
final rewrite and publication. 35 work days for each specialist for a total of
70 consultant work days.
(b)    Cost estimath. 'Me consultant will quote an appropriate fee in line with the
level of effort shown above.

GHJANA
NATIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE ELECTRIFICATION COMPONENT
Costs
1.           Project costs consist of: (a) capital investment in subtransmission, substations,
distribution (including service drops and meters), plus associated engineering services; (b)
operations and maintenance expenses at 2 percent of accumulated capital investment cost; (c) cost
of wiring premises and purchase of appliances running on electricity; (d) cost of electricity supply
received at the sub-transmission level valued at the long-run marginal cost (US$0.045/kWh) plus
8 percent technical losses; (e) cost of offices and equipment for commercial services. All costs
are in 1992 US dollars at border prices. Local costs have been converted to border prices by
using a Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of $0.92. All capital investments and associated
engineering services include 10 percent physical contingency.
Benefits
2.            Project benefits include: (a) incremental demand served valued at the consumers'
willingness to pay for electricity (WTP), and (b) avoided capital cost of equipment using the
alternative fuel (i.e., kerosene) estimated at US$0.02 kWh.
Demand Forecast
3.           The demand forecast for the residential load is driven by four factors: town
population, average household size, initial and 10-year market penetration, and consumption per
customer in kilowatt-hours per year. Town population estimates are based on the 1984 census,
and increased at the weighted average annual growth rate for the local council containing the
town. Average household size is also based on the local council average. Market penetration
rates are assumed to start at 35 percent, 45 percent, and 55 percent for town sizes of less than
2000, between 2000 to 5000 and greater than 5000, respectively, increasing to 55 percent, 65
percent, and 75 percent by the end of the 10-year period after completion of the project. The
non-residential demand is forecasted by estimation of per customer consumption for each of the
town sizes mentioned above, and assuming that it will increase directly in line with town
population growth.
4.           The main determinant of forecast load (aggregated residential and non-residential
demand) are town population and the rate of population growth. This has been modified to take
into account the expected growth in customers incomes, as well as the dampening effect on
consumption due to expected increases in electricity tariffs. Given Ghana's recent economic
recovery and its expected accelerated growth, a 4 percent per year growth in income per capita is
assumed with an income elasticity of 1.1. On the other hand, it is assumed that electricity prices
will be increased to the full LRMC level within 4 years with the price elasticity of demand for
electricity taken at -0.25. This slightly reduces the population-based demand forecast and the net
result is a demand growth rate of about 8.5 percent per year in the first 10 years after project
completion. It is assumed that the demand for electricity would reach the saturation level after



ANNEX 3-14
Page 2 of 5
this period, with little or no growth. See the attached Economic Analysis Table for the demand
forecast.
Consumers' Willingness to Pay
5.           Consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for residential and non-residential
consumers is estimated as follows. The introduction of electricity causes consumers to substitute
electricity for other fuels, and it also induces new demands for the services of electricity. For
residential consumption, field observations by consultants indicate that electricity would substitute
for the equivalent of 259 kWh per year per connection (household) at US$0.404/kWh. Over and
above this, the induced demand is estimated at 991 kWh per year. Hence, total consumption per
residential connection is estimated at 1250 kWh/year at the existing tariff rate of US$0.015/kWh.
Assuming a straight line demand function between the two observation points (259 kWh at
$0.0404 and 1250 kWh at $0.015), WTP for electricity is estimated to be, on average,
US$0.25/kWh. The willingness to pay for induced demand is reduced by the Standard
Conversion Factor of 0.92 to derive its border value. At the income per capita of $400 in Ghana
and with an average of 10 persons per connection, the estimated WTP of $0.25 implies that
individual consumers would spend up to about 8 percent of their income on electricity, which is
considered to be on the high side. The exact shape of the demand curve is not known and a
straight line demand curve is usually assumed to obtain a reasonable approximation of the WTP.
However, in this case, the check against consumer's income indicates that based on a straight line
demand function, the proportion of income spent on electricity would be high. Therefore, two
other frequently used demand functions (semi-log and log-log) are considered. Based on a semi-
log demand function, the WTP is estimated to be about US$.20/kWh and proportion of income
spent on electricity would be about 6 percent. Assuming the log-log functional form results in
WTP of about US$0.15/kWh and proportion of income spent on electricity would be about 5
percent. The estimated demand functions are presented below and are illustrated on the attached
graph.
Functional Form             Estimated Dlemand Function
Linear                      Q = 1288.2 - 2547.6 P
Semi-log                    InQ = 7.19 - 4.0 P
Log-log                     InQ = 5.125 - 0.477 InP
For the purpose of this analysis, the WTP associated with the linear and log-log demand functions
are taken as upper and lower boundaries, respectively, and the WTP of US$0.20/kWh estimated
from the semi-log demand function is used in the base case for valuation of the incremental
demand served.
6.           A similar exercise is carried out for non-residential customers with substitution
equivalent of 7169 kWh/year at US$0.239/kWh and additional induced demand estimated at 5,465
kWh/year/connection. The total demand per non-residential connection is 12634 kWh/year at the



ANNEX 3-14
Page 3 of 5
prevailing tariff rate of $0.082. The estimated average WTP for non-residential consumers based
on a linear demand function is about $0.21/lkWh. With a semi-log demand function, WTP for
non-residential customers is estimated at about $0.20/kWh, which is very close to the estimation
based on the linear functional form. The WTP of USS0.20/kWh for non-residential consumer is
used in the analysis. The total demand for electricity is estimated to be about 65 percent
residential and 35 percent non-residential. The (weighted) average of WTP for the residential and
non-residential used to value the incremental demand served is, therefore, US$0.20/kWh.
Economic Rate of Return
7.           The Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) for the base case is estimated at
11.9 percent based on the parameters discussed in the above paragraphs. Sensitivity analysis
carried out with respect to various parameters are shown in the attached table and are discussed
below. The base case EIRR is within the acceptable range and it is robust as indicated by the
sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis with respect to WTP of US$0.25/kWh and US$0.15/kWh
(corresponding to the estimations of the WTP based on the two outer forms of the demand
functions) indicates that the base case EIRR would increase to 16.7 percent or decrease to 5.8
percent, respectively. A 10 percent cost over-run (in addition to the 10 percent physical
contingency) would lower the base EIRR to 10.7 percent. If the demand for electricity in each
year is 10 percent less than the forecast used in the analysis, the EIRR would be reduced to 8.8
percent. If the demand for electricity is 10 percent higher than what is forecasted, the EIRR
would be increased to 15.1 percent. A combination of lower demand of 10 percent and cost over
run of 10 percent would reduce the EIRR to 7.6 percent. The EIRR would be further reduced to
2.1 percent, if in addition to the lower demand and higher costs, the WTP is assumed to be at the
lower boundary of US$0. 15/kWh. The EIRR is not significantly sensitive to variation in other
parameters as indicated in the Annex Table 1.
Analysis by Sub-Drojects
8.           Estimation of the EIRR for each sub-project, assuming the base case values for
each of the parameters, indicates that the EIRR varies from as high as about 24 percent to as low
as 5 percent. The EIRR and the net present value (NPV) of the sub-projects are shown in Annex
Table 2. The discount rate used in calculation of NPV is 10 percent. There are six sub-projects
in Brong-Ahafo (BA08), Central (CR02), Northern (NR02), Upper West (UWOI, UW02), and
Western (WR02) Regions of the country that have an EIRR of less than 10 percent and a
corresponding negative NPV. The four sub-projects in Brong-Ahafo, Central, Northern, and
Western Regions, each could be considered to be a part of a larger project in that particular
region, which has a positive NPV as indicated in Annex Table 3. That is, clustered by Regions,
these sub-projects have a positive NPV and an acceptable EIRR of more than 10 percent. This,
together with the fact that extension of the national grid to all of the 29 sub-projects is the least-
cost solution to provide electricity, justifies including these sub-projects in the proposed project.
The other two sub-projects in Upper West Region (UWOI and UW02) have a negative NPV of
about US$1.2 million and a total cost of about US$5.5 million. Inclusion of these sub-projects is
also deemed justified considering that the project is designed to contribute to balanced regional

development and equity in the country and that supply from the national grid is the least-cost
solution, as well as taking into account that the cost involved is relatively small. 1/

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF IMPROVEMENTS TO THE EXISTING SYSTEM
Description of Improvements
1.           Table 1 shows the schedule of works and the description of benefits from each
investment. As the table indicates, there are multiple benefits associated with each category of
costs. It has not been possible to reliably disaggregate costs according to each category of
benefits; therefore the analysis is integrated, looking at total costs relative to the group of
benefits.
2.            The benefit categories are: loss reduction, outage reduction and new consumers.
Assumptions:
Project Investment Costs:
3.            The costs are those shown in Table 2 including 10 percent physical contingencies.
There are costs specific to the net benefit calculation for new consumers, and these are discussed
below.
Benefits of Loss Reduction:
4.           It is assumed that these investments will cause system losses to be reduced by 1
percent of each year's sales on the ECG system. The sales projection is given in Table 3, as is the
resulting loss reduction per year. This amount of energy is worth approximately 4000KW of MV
and LV distribution works. From the Acres Tariff Study, Table 4.3, this is worth an annuity (at 8
percent discount rate) of approximately $0.3 million per year, plus a saving of $0.045/kWh
LRMC of energy otherwise served from the HV transmission system.
Benefits of Outage Reduction:
5.           It is estimated that these investments will reduce outages by about 0.25 percent of
sales (in energy terms). Table 3 shows the resulting GWh of outage reduction per year. A
conservative value of only $0.30/kWh is assigned to outage reduction. (The usual range for this
variable is from $.30/kWh to $.60/kWh, with considerably higher values in specific processes
which are very cost-sensitive to unreliability of power supply).
Net Benefits of New Connections
6.            This analysis is analogous to that used for the electrification component of the
project discussed in Annex 3- . The main benefit is the willingness to pay of $0.20/kWh.
Subtracted from this benefit are:
O+M costs of 2 percent of investment,
wiring and appliance costs of $0.045/kWh of incremental consumption,



ANNEX 3-15
Page 2 of 6
LRMC of power supply to the HV/MV interface of $0.045/kWh.
New connections are phased in at a rate of:
21,000 in 1994
another 22,000 in 1995, and
another 23,000 in 1996.
These are a mixture of urban and rural consumers. It is assumed that their weighted average
consumption builds up to 21OOkWh per year per new connection, at a rate of 10 percent per year
over a period of 10 years. The phase-in of new consumption is shown in Table 4.
7.           The net benefits arising from new consumers is shown in Table 2 along with the
benefits of loss reduction, outages, and net benefits of the whole improvement program.
8.           The EIRR of this project component is 36.0 percent.
