                         Following the signing of the Amended EU/World Bank administration Agreement in January 2011, a Grant Agreement between the Government of Malawi and the World Bank (as
                         administrator of the EU grant) was signed on 18 May, 2011 and the EU co-financing of US$ 3.7 million started being utilized to finance agreed activities that were part of the project

                         design. A second order restructuring (re-allocation of proceeds) was also approved by the Acting Country Director in April 2011.

                         Actual IDA expenditure to date, including commitments was at 99.9%. All EU funds were committed by 31 December 2011 as agreed and because of the delay in the signing of the
                         Grant Agreement, the ending date of the EU Trust Fund was retroactively extended from 31 December, 2011 to 30 June, 2012 with a grace period for all payments being extended to
                         31 October, 2012 (i.e four months after the closing the Trust Funds) in order to complete all EU Trust Fund activities. All EU Trust Fund goods and services were delivered by 30
                         June, 2012. The closing date of BESTAP will remain 31 December, 2012 as originally scheduled.

                         All fiduciary aspects of the project are satisfactory. The project procurement and financial management are currently rated as satisfactory, and have been since project effectiveness.
                         Financial management is Satisfactory and the project is up-to-date with Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) as well as Audit Reports.
