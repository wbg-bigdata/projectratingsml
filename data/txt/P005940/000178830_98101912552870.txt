I. THE SECTORS
A. The Industrial Sector
Introduction
1.0      Argentina was one ot the first Latin American countries to develop a
sizeable industrial sector. The growth of industry was fostered by a growing
domestic demand and by natural protection resulting from its distant location
from major world centers of industrial production. By the turn of the century,
industry's share ot GDP was about 15%, and about 20% of the nation's labor
force was employed in a large number of relatively small plants mostly involved
in the primary processing of agricultural products such as wool, beef, hides
and leather, dairy products, vegetable oils and extracts; wood pulp, paper
printing and publishing; and non-metallic minerals and construction materials.
During the first half of the twentieth century, the industrial sector went
through periods of rapid growth during the depressior of the 1930's and during
World Wars I and II, largely because of the need to substitute for imported
goods that were no longer available.  The textile industry increased its share
of the domestic market from less than 30% in the 1920s to 50% in the 1940s.
Even more rapid was the shift to domestic rubber production, which had provided
less than 101' ot total consumption before 1930 but was able to furnish nearly
90% by the end of the decade. During World War II, Argentina's industrial
sector further increased its overall share of the domestic market (to about
85%), as basic industries were established to produce metals, machinery and
appliances, and the first public investment in industry was made in the
strategic steel industry.
1.02      In the early post-war period, the industrial sector continued fu
grow quite rapidly with the introduction of modern technology and knowhow,
achieved largely through substantial foreign investment, which increased
from US$15 million in 1954 to over US$100 million by 1961, increasing the
foreign share of industrial investment from 3% to nearly 10%. Protection
from competing imports was granted almost indiscriminately, and favored
traditional industries such as processed foods, textiles and other consumer
goods, as well as the establishment and rapid expansion of new durable goods
industries, especially automobiles, metal products and petro-chemicals. The
government took an active role in stimulating the growth of industry through
the use ot a combination ot toreign exchange and import controls, high tariffs
and special tax incentives, and by establishing public sector enterprises in
basic industries such as steel and petro-chemicals. At the same time, the
government pursued policies which encouraged high wage settlements, which
resulted in rapidly increasing labor costs.  Under these conditions there was
little incentive for industrialists to establish efficient, cost-effective
plants, and many enterprises suffered from low capacity utilization, high
operating costs and low productivity.  In addition, recurring high inflation
discouraged real competition among firms and did not provide an incentive
for increasing efficiency or reducing costs.
1.03      From the mid-1950's to the late-1970's, fluctuations in industrial
output and investment were more significant in Argentina than in the other
major industrial nations in Latin America. The growth of the sector was
either zero or negative during 6 of 25 years in the period 1955-79, reflecting
foreign exchange shortages and numerous government price stabilizacion efforts
to cut back demand.   Nevertheless, average growth rates both for industry and



-2-
GDP, were about the same in Argentina and its neighbors. The major reason for
the continuing growth of Argentine industry was the initial dynamism of newly
established industries such as petro-chemicals, mechanical engineering and
transport equipment, which more than doubled their output between 1950-75, and
increased their share of total manufactured output from 16% to 34% during the
same period. Anniual growth in manufactured value added, which had averaged
4.1% in the 1950's, rose to 5.6% in the 1960's and accelerated to 7.2% between
1970-74, before i.t fell by -0.1% during 1975-79. As a consequence, the share
of manufacturing in total value added rose from 25% in 1950 to 29% in 1970 but
has since been reduced to the 26% level (see Annex 1, Table 1).
The Structure of Industry
1.04      Manufacturing represents the principal sector in the generation
of gross domestic product. In many respects, Argentina's industrial
structure is similar to that of industrialized countries. It is highly
diversified with a substantial proportion (exceeding 60%) originating outside
the traditional consumer-goods industries and involving the production
of relatively sophisticated capital goods, intermediates and durable goods.
Nevertheless, the high price structure of many manufactured products,
especially among the more "dynamic" industries, suggests that industrial
output is overvalued (i.e. at international price levels the value of indus-
trial output relative to other sectors of the economy is less than the relative
value stated in domestic prices).
1.05      While there has been substantial restructuring with the various
subsectors of the manufacturing sector during the 1976-80 period, the data
for the major subsectors indicate a continuation of the earlier trend away
from the traditional industries.   Compared to 1970, food  beverages, tobacco,
textiles and clothing lost over 5 percentage points of their contribution to
manufacturing value added, while the metal mechanical, vehicle and machinery
sectors gained over 4.5 percentage points (See Annex 1, Table 2).
1.06      The most recent industrial census in Argentina was carried out in
1974. It indicated that over one-half of the industrial firms registered
in Argentina are located in the city or surrounding province of Buenos Aires.
Tw-o other provinces, Santa Fe and Cordoba, also are important industrial
centers, and together account for an additional one-fourth of registered firms.
Firms in the province and city of Buenos Aires area tend to be larger than
those in the rest of the country, and consequently, almost three-fourths oF
the nation's industrial workers are employed in those areas.  The pattern of
distribution is as follows:
Province                   No. of Firms   % of Total   No. of Workers   % Total
Buenos Aires                   50,144           38           710,600           47
Buenos Aires (city)            26,448           20           370,300           25
Santa Fe                       16,053           12           144,500           10

Manufactured Exports and Imports
1.07      Since high-cost import substitutes, sold almost exclusively to
domestic customers, continued to require large amounts of imported inputs, both
industrialists and policy-makers realized by the early 1960's that high and
stable growth rates could not be achieved without engaging in a program of
export diversification. In 1962, several fiscal measures, such as 'drawbacks"t
and rebates on taxes as well as special lines of credit at subsidized rates
of interest, wqere introduced. Because of an erratic exchange rate policy,
however, these measures had little effect on industrial exports during the
early years of the export diversification drive. Significant strides were
made only in the late 1960's when the authorities simplified the exchange rate
system, extended the "drawbacks", instituted a tax refund incentive of 10%
of the value of exports and negotiated new preference agreements with the
LAFTA partners. These measures were further bolstered by increased export
credit facilities by the Central Bank and by establishment of an export
insurance scheme.
1.08      Argentina has traditionally been an exporter of processed agricul-
tural goods, such as meat and dairy products, vegetable oils and extracts,
wood and, more recently, sugar and soybeans. It is only in the last 15 years
that manufactured exports have become important. The rapid expansion of the
"dynamic" industries is reflected in the changing export shares experienced
by the various subsectors, with machinery and vehicles accounting for nearly
40% of total manufactured exports by 1976, metal products industries increasing
their share to 13%, and the share of traditional industries falling from 50%
to 25%. Argentina used its more advanced technical knowledge in entering into
preference agreements within the region to sell goods to other Latin American
countries; about one-half of manufactured exports went to other LAFTA countries.
1.09      Real export growth was fairly rapid, averaging 18.6% per year
between 1966-70, and 21.6% between 1970-74, and about 15% on average, there-
after. Since the mid-1960's industrial exports have made an increasing con-
tribution to the growth of total exports. In 1965, industrial exports amounted
to 25% of total exports but by the mid-1970s their share had risen to almost
one-half; although agro-based manufactures are the main component of this
trade, the share of the non-agro based manufactures has also risen. Manu-
factured exports reached a high of US$1.6 billion in 1978 but declined
subsequently as a result of the significant real appreciation of the exchange
rate. Consequently, after manufacturing's share of total exports advanced
from 8% in 1966 to 26% in 1978, it declined to 20% by 1980. 1/ Declines in
exports were significant in automobiles and in such traditional and rela-
tively labor intensive activities as textile and leather products. This
shortfall was partially offset by substantial increases in the foreign sales
of resource-based products such as petroleum derivatives and metals, par-
ticularly aluminum, iron and steel (see Annex 1, Table 3).
I/   Since industrial exports represent only about 10% of industrial output
but about 50% of total exports, a relatively minor shift in terms of
output can have a major impact on the composition of exports.



- 4 -
1.10      Industrial imports doubled between 1970-75, increased only margin-
ally between 1976-78, but grew by 73% in 1979 and 55% in 1980.  The import!
GDP ratio rose from 8% to 10% in :L979, and in 1980 to 12%.  Increasing
i'mport competition for industry is indicated by the expanding share of imports
in total supply of manufactured products; by 1979-80, there was a substantial.
degree of openness in the capital goods sector, a relatively large and still
expa-nding share of imports in the intermediate goods industries, and a small
but rapidly increasing import penetration in the consumer goods sector.
Industrial Employment
1.11      The manufacturing sector has offered limited new opportunities for
employment during the last thirty years. This has been due primarily to the
fact that: (i) new industries and technologies introduced were relativel,y
capital intensive; (ii) successive governments artificially reduced the
relative cost of capital by subsidizing interest rates and overvaluing the
foreign exchange rate for capital goods; and (iii) labor legislation with its
inflexible rules and substantial fringe benefits discouraged labor intensive
production.
l112      Total employment in the manufacturing sector, which had reached
1.4 million in 19509 expanded by about 1% p.a. on average between 1950
and 1970. In spite of its rapid growth in output, the share of employment
generated by the "dynamic" industries has remained constant since the late
1950's (at 38% of total manufacturing employment). Manufacturing employment
as a percentage of total employment actually declined from 28% in 1950 to 25%
in 1970. It was only in the early 1970s that labor absorption by industry
began to grow, (averaging about 3% p.a. between 1970-75), but this increase
was almost entirely the result of a rapid expansion of output and employment
by state-owned enterprises.  During the 1976-80 period overall unemployment in
Argentina was the lowest ever recordeid, largely caused by large labor transfers
between the manufacturing and service sectors.  It is estimated that employment
in manufacturing fell by about 20% between 1975 and 1980, and that by the end
of the latter year, employment in manufacturing was only 20% of total employ-
ment. The reduction in employment was particularly sharp for the intermediate
and capital goods industries, which decreased their work forces by nearly 30%
in the last five years. While tax legislation, introduced in October 1980,
has lowered labor costs by reducing the social security contributions of
industrial enterprises by 20%, the effect on employment has yet to be realized.
1.13      This development combined wiith the investments in new machinery and
equipment made by those sectors led to substantial productivity increases in
the 1977-80 period, particularly in capital goods industries. Output per worker
in 1979/80 was on average 30% above the 1975/76 level, and output per working
hour realized a 20% gain (see Annex 1,, Table 4).



-5-
Industrial Policy
1.14      In the past, Argentine foreign trade and investment policies have
paid inadequate attention to considerations of economic efficiency and long-
run balance of payments equilibrium. They have focused on growth and diversi-
fication through an import substitution strategy utilizing multiple exchange
rates, import tariffs and restrictions, as well as numerous fiscal and credit
incentives for investment in less developed regions. While the general
pattern of trade policies is readily described and summarized, the actual
effects of these policies on industrial development are difficult to measure.
Output, employment, exports and imports and other variables have been subject
to a great number of other policy measures, some of which had very little
economic rationale. Due to the structural disequilibrium between a low-cost
export oriented agricultural sector and a high-cost domestically oriented
industrial sector, several Argentine governments opted for multiple exchange
rate systems; these were characterized by fixed nom-iral exchange rates which
were adjusted sporadically by substantial jumps, combined with import tariffs
and surcharges to limit imports and varying sets of fiscal and monetary
incentives to stimulate non-traditional exports.
1.15      Protective tariffs have existed since 1875, but it was only during
the Depression that they were raised to significant levels. This system
became more prohibitive in World War II and in the early postwar period with
the introduction of prior import deposits and bilateral trading agreements.
Throughout the postwar period Argentina continued the policy of high protec-
tionism. Although nominal tariffs were among the major tools of import
protectior. during the early 1960s, exchange surcharges ranging from zero to
235% were the most important means for protecting industry. Low or zero
surcharges were levied on such important inputs as iron ore, rubber, newsprint,
fertilizer, coal and petroleum products. On the other hand, consumer goods,
automobiles and luxury goods were charged with rates of over 200%. Due to the
overvaluation of the basic import rate this structure of surcharges increased
the "effective" protection for many consumer goods even more. In addition,
special protection was granted to such industries as steel and textiles
through the introduction of "official" prices, on which duties were based.
1.16      It was not until 1967 that a general tariff reform attempted to
rationalize the whole protection system according to the extent of import
competition, degree of fabrication, and economic end-use. By reducing the
extremely high tariffs for certain products, the average legal tariff level
was reduced from 119% to 62%; at the same time, the peso was devalued by 42%.
Since tariffs continued to be set higher for consumer than for industrial
inputs or investment goods, "effective" rates were one-and-a-half to two times
above the nominal rates, reflecting the fact that imported inputs of raw
materials and intermediate inputs were either freed from import duties or were
taxed at low rates.  The tariff reform of 1967 was reversed, by increasingly
restrictive foreign trade policies in subsequent years. Tariff rates for most
durable consumer goods and those capital goods produced in the country were
set at levels of over 100% in the early 1970s. In addition, the authorities
designed an increasing number of import controls and import finance restric-
tions. During the balance of payments crisis in 1974, imports of 600 items,



- 6 -
mostly consumer goods, were prohibited; another 1,200 items were added to
the prohtbited list in 1975. Importers were furthermore required to deposit
a sum equal to 40% of the C.I.F. value at the Central Bank; these prior
deposits were raised to 100% at the beginning of 1975.
Tle 1976-80 Program and its Impact onz the Industrial Sector
1.17      In 1976 a new Government came into power, with a basic aim of
achieving a more stable growth and increased productivity through: (i) stabil-
izing prices through control of public expenditures and wages; and (ii)
liberalizing trade to enable Argentine industry to become more competitive
internationally.  Steps were taken to unify the exchange rate, and imports of
most items covered by the 1972 and 1975 prohibited lists were freed in July
1976. In November 1976, tariff rates for 4,000 of 7,600 positions in the
tariff schedule were reduced by an average of 25%. In order to lower effective
protection more rapidly, the authorities concentrated on cutting import tariffs
on final products.
1.18      Interest rates were freed, and quantitative restrictions on imparts
and advance import deposits were abandoned in 1977. To recover
quickly from several years of price control, a large number of manufacturers
raised their prices more often and at higher rates than was justified by cost
consideration.s. Consequently, the Government initiated a number of discussions
with individual industry groups and used reductions in import tariffs as a
tool to enforce relative price stability. Import tariffs for manufactured
goods were brought down from an average of 94%, in 1976 to 53% in late 1977.
1.19      When industrial prices continued to increase at about 150% per year
in 1978, the government adopted a strategy designed to more radically open up
the economy to foreign competition by combining tariff reductions together
with a preannounced exchange rate policy of stepped reductions utilizing
decreasing rates of devaluation. Preannounced limits on rates charged by
public utilities, wages, and net domestic credit, were introduced to low-er
inflationary expectations and to restrain Argentine businesses from increasing
prices. Import tariffs on industrial products were further curtailed in 1978
to an average of about 30%. 1/
1.20      Prior to 1976, the swings of Argentine economic policy went between
favoring urban-industrial-import substitution activities and rural-agricultural-
export activities. In 1979/80 this was changed. Both import substitutes and
exports suffered from the low peso/dollar exchange rate.  Meat packers and
textile factories alike were squeezed. The main criteria separatirig the favored
from the unfavored were: (a) a firm's capital structure; and (b) the distinc-
tion between traded and non-traded goods. Industrial firms that had high
debt-equity ratios were hurt, while more conservative firms with either
a lower debt or a larger part of their debt in, foreign currencies were less
affected. Producers of goods that were exporting or that were subject to
1/   Nevertheless, effective protection still averaged close to 70% in early
1980, after all non-tariff import fees as well as freight and insurance
charges were included.



import competition suffered, while producers of services and of nontrade-
able goods prospered. Some firms were affected indirectly. Suppliers
of synthetic textile firms did not suffer from direct import competition,
but their market weakened because of import competition in textiles. Paper
produjcers and glass bottle makers supplying packaging material to domestic
food processors suffered as food products exports fell and imports rose.
Diesel engine manufacturing was cut to one-fourth of capacity, because
the demand for domestic tractors and earth-moving equipment fell precipi-
tiously.
1.21      The hardest hit were firms with high peso indebtedness and rapidly
decreasing import protection coverage. The archetype was the fruit canning
industry, which formerly had exported a significant part of sales, but then
became subject to import competition.  It is an inherently seasonal industry,
accustomed to financing high seasonal working capital requirements including
high cost tin cans. because half of all tin plate used must be purchased
at high prices from SOMISA, the state-owned steel plant. Major companies
in this industry ceased operating in 1980. Other hard-hit activities included
electronics (competition from the Far East), but not color TV which enjoyed
"infant" industry protection; meat packing and fishing (high input prices,
relatively low international prices); some textiles (competition from Brazil,
the Far East and elsewhere); paper products, and some chemicals (a reflection
of their customers' problems); tractors and earth-moving equipment (import
competition plus weak investment demand from the agricultural sector); and
associated engine and tire manufacturers.
The New Government Program
1.22      When on March 29, 1981, a new government assumed office in the face
of a deteriorating balance of payments situation, it opted for a devaluation
of the peso by 30%. In order to diminish the inflationary impact of the
devaluation: (a) export taxes for traditional agricultural products were
raised to 12%; (b) export reimbursements for regional products were lowered by
three percentage points; and (c) export reimbursements for manufactured
products were limited to a maximum of 25%.
1.23      On the import side, all external tariffs of 55% and over were
reduced by 12 percentage points. The maximum tariff for all commodities
over 43% and less than 55% were cut to 43%. A Governmental Commission of
representatives of the Ministries of the Economy and Finance, Industry and
Mining, Agriculture, Trade, and Public Services is to evaluate the current
import tariff and export reimbursement system and make suggestions for
possible change in late 1981.
1.24      Although the maxi-devaluation was accompanied by a modest attempt
to confiscate windfall profits in exporting activities, the basic policy
principles of the current authorities have been very much the same as the
1976-80 guidelines. The new Minister of Economy made it clear that the
government was determined to: (i) maintain the program of opening up the
economy; (ii) unify external tariffs and export reimbursements; and (iii)
minimize negative effective protection in the productive sectors.



- 8-
1.25      Uncertainty prevailed until mid 1981, characterized by a continuous
outflow of foreign exchange; industrialists pressured for increased protection
and/or more devaluation.  In June a second and third devaluation of 30% each
was undertaken, giving to the manufacturing sector a real exchange rate which
was over 257% above the one which they experienced in 1977, at a time when the
sector realized rapid advances in output and exports.
Prospts and Project Implications
L126      The new economic team, which took office at the end of March, has to
resolve a number of problems simultaneously. It will have to walk the tight-
rope between stimulation of production on the one hand and stabilization on
the other. After the recent devaluations inflation accelerated again, although
economic activities were depressed. Resolution of the inflationary problem
will involve important decisions, bearing directly on the welfare of the
industrial sector. Currently, the authorities are engaged in a renewed attempt
to control public sector outlays and with it decrease spending on non-
tradeable goods and services. On the other hand, there seems increasing need
of industry specific policies. While the new President's promise to stimulate
the productive sector, has not yet been translated into specific fiscal
and monetary incentives beyond the peso devaluations, which reduced
competition for imports and increased the profitability of exports, the
financial restructuring of a large number of enterprises is to proceed with
help of the public sector through substantial rediscounts from the Central Bank.
1.27      Significant structu-ral changes have occurred in the last few years;
yet it is too early to detect a clear pattern of industrial development
which is broadly in line with Argentina's comparative advantages. At first
sight, it would seem that the change from the traditional to the more modern
and capital intensive subsectors has continued, but a series of interviews
conducted by the Bank with over 50 inclustrial firms (both large and small)
shows that relative gains which certain subsectors made in one year were
cancelled out later. The degree of uneven protection in 1979/80, together
with the real appreciation of the peso, had an important bearing on indus-
trial production of major subsectors, the capital goods sector being probably
the most prominent example. The 1980 tax changes and the more recent exchange
rate increases have, however, significantly improved the productive sector's
situation in general and the incentive system of the manufacturing sector
in particular. If the policy objective of lower and more even protection is
implemented, it is likely that the emerging industrial structure will become
more efficient, but also more capital intensive.
1.28      While the economic policies of the previous government to restructure
the industrial sector became increasingly severe and were encountering
mounting difficulties, they held the promise of increasing industrial produc-
tivity through greater specialization and consolidation and improving resource
allocation. The concepts of more effectively controlling production costs,
operating efficiently and meeting the challenge of external competition had



- 9 -
become part of industrial thinking. To what extent the current authorities
will be able to continue the opening-up process without incurring major
disruptions and distortions in the industrial sector will depend crucially on
their ability to improve rapidly public finances and control inflation. The
Government has indicated its intention to the Bank to promote increased
industrial efficiency and exports and to liberalize foreign trade, using
policy instruments which will take into consideration trade policies of
Argentina's major trading partners. A comprehensive industrial sector profile
study will be undertaken by the Ministry of Industry in 1981/1982 and will
include an analysis of effective protection of Argentine industries, which
will help to set guidelines for future action with regard to industrial sector
policies. Satisfactory terms of reference for the effective protection study
and the assignment of qualified personnel for carrying out the study will be a
condition of loan effectiveness. The government has agreed to discuss with the
Bank the study on effective protection, and its future course of action with
regard to industrial sector policies. The specific study on effective protection
will be carried out not later than June 30, 1982.
B. The Financial Sector
The Financial System
1.29       The financial system in Argentina consists of the Central Bank
(BCRA), four national banks (Banco de la Nacion, Banco Nacional de Desarrollo,
Banco Nacional Hipotecario, and Caja de Ahorro y Seguro), 31 provincial and
municipal banks, 177 private commercial banks, 230 finance companies and 28
mortgage banks. The total number of financial institutions declined from over
700 entities in the mid-1970s to 470 entities in 1980. As a consequence of
the 1977 legislation favoring the establishment of all purpose commercial
banks, the number of commercial banks nearly doubled while the number of
finance companies have more than halved. The process of consolidation and
restructuring of the banking system can be expected to continue until the
present period of economic adjustment is completed.
1.30       The previous system.  From September 1973 until May 1977 a system
of nationalized deposits was in effect in Argentina for the second time in
the post-war period. In the centralized system deposits were accepted on
the account of the Central Bank which paid interest while financial entities
received a commission fee for their intermediary role. Banks were res-
ponsible for credit and investment management under Central Bank established
limits, conditions and guarantees of bank portfolios. Levels and direction
of credit were determined through rediscount policy, which attempted to be
selective in two aspects: (a) channeling credit volume to particular financial
intermediaries according to criteria unrelated to the volume of deposits
received by those same financial intermediaries; and (b) channeling credit
to particular economic activities and particular geographic regions. The
official justification for this system was to allow tight monetary control
by the Central Bank and to obtain the best distribution of available credit
according to the requirements of the economy.



-- 10 -
1.31      While possibly attractive in theory, the application of the system
had negative effects. Credit redistribution among financial entities affected
their profitabilities differently and reduced competition. In order to affect
the desired redistribution of credit, interest rates were differentiated
according to sector, region and time of the year. Conceptual and practical
difficulties of defining criteria for credit assignment, and the impossibility
of controlling the marginal use of resources, prevented the system from
attaining its goals, resulting in an inefficient assignment of resources.
1.32       Ihe process of accelerating inflation that started in 1974, jointly
with a fixed interest rate policy pursued during the period, resulted in
negative real interest rates for most financial assets and led to changes in
the system of centralized deposits. A subsystem in the form of an acceptance
market developed. The system of term deposits, even though operating formalliY
within the centralized system, started to work de facto in a decentralized
way, with banks allowed to issue credit automatically in relation to the
amount of deposits that they had captured. l/ The system resulting from these
changes was a hybrid, composed on one side by a centralized subsystem for
which a 100% reserve requirement was in effect and on the other by a sub-
system with a zero percent reserve requirement. Since the subsystem with no
reserve requirements expanded rapidly., the actual average reserve requirement
for the system as a whole tended to decline over time. in late 1974, the
Central Bank progressively lost control over the system and hence the money
supply. The financing of the public sector deficit and the level of redis-
counts increased at the same time as the money multiplier increased with
the effective decline in the reserve requirement. Thus, both the behavior
of the monetary base and of the multiplier led to an explosive increase
in the money supply.
1.33      The new system.  The economic program announced on April 2, 1976,
included a profound reform in the financial system among its goals. This
reform reintroduced the full intermediation role of the banking system,
provided the financial system with a legal and regulatory framework that has
led to increasing degrees of competitiveness and efficiency, and set solvency
and responsibility requirements on financial institutions in accordance with
the nature of their respective activities. One of the first measures taken by
the new economic authorities in pursuit of those goals was to convert the
previous centralized deposit system to a new system! where monetary control was
achieved through the application of a minimum reserve requirement and through
open market operations. The new system started to operate on June 1, 1977. It
reserves monetary intermediation to commercial banks, the only entities
allowed to accept current deposits, and allows complete freedom of interest
rates; it establishes competition as the means to obtain an efficient finan-
cial system, and thus places minimal regulation on entry into the market; and
it establishes a guarantee system for deposits in national currencv in all
financial entities.
1/   For a while this last system was subject to interest rate regulations,
but starting in June 1975, banks were permitted to freely set interest
rates on loans and deposits.



- 11 -
1.34      The impact of the reform has been substantial.  The deregulation of
interest rates has resulted in positive real rates and, thus, for the first
time in decades Argentine savers have beern able to protect their savings
against inflation in the domestic financial markets. The increase in savings
channeled through the banking system has progressively raised the monetization
of the Argentine economy. The ratio between monetary assets (M3) of the
private sector to GDP has climbed from 8% in 1976 to 18% at the end of 1978,
21% at the end of 1979, and 30% in 1980.   The increased monetization has
allowed a two-fold increase in real terms in the volume of credit available
through the financial system. At the same time, a shift in the composition of
that credit has occurred. In 1976, total credit to the private and public
sectors accounted for 64% and 36% respectively; as of December 1980, credit to
the public sector accounted for 23% of total credit, thus raising the private
sector share to 77%.
1.35      Even thcugh the financial reform has been successful in promoting
savings, increasing monetization of the Argentine economy, and expanding
private sector credit, the Argentine banking system encountered growing prob-
lems in 1980/81 as a result of the weakened financial position of the indus-
trial sector and the lack of experience of the monetary authorities. The main
issues relating to the Argentine banking system and its operations have been:
(a) the short-term and unstable nature of its deposits and the associated
difficulties of extending the maturities of the loans; (b) the volatility and
relatively high levels of domestic interest rates; and (c) the weak portfolios
of many private domestic banks leading to numerous failures and increased
participation of foreign and public sector banks.
1.36      In order to improve the financial structure of firms in the indus-
trial sector, the authorities plan to introduce a policy of Central Bank
rediscounts in late 1981, which commercial banks will be able to use for
long-term lending. Financial institutions can borrow up to the equivalent of
12% of their deposits from the Central Bank and use these funds for four year
loans with a grace period on principle of two years and interest payments to
be made by the end of each year. The rediscount rate is determined by a
bidding process, with the minimum rate set by the daily interest rate of
depositors in the Argentine banking system. Eighty five percent of the loans
have to go to the primary sectors and manufacturing in order to restructure
the debt of enterprises in those branches. Borrowers may not receive more
than 30% of their total outstanding debt.
1.37      The strengthening of the financial system is to be achieved by in-
creased capitalization of banks, enforcement of inflation accounting to
prevent financial intermediaries from distributing illusory profits, and
increased financing for the mergers and acquisitions among national financial
institutions. In addition, financial incentives will be offered to broaden
the demand for stocks on the domestic capital market.



- 12 -
Monetary Policy
1.38      Monetary and credit policies from 1976 to 1980 have been an
integral part of the economic stabilization and reconstruction program,
aiming At remonetizing the economy and at improving resource allocation
thro-ugh the reformation and liberalization of money and capital markets.
Since the fiscal deficit had become the major source of monetary expansion in
1975 and early 1976, the thrust of the stabilization program was on control-
ling public expenditures, raising tax collection and covering the remaining
deficit through non-inflationary financing.  For the monetary authorities it
meani reducing deficit financing by the printing press and attracting private
finds for Treasury obligations.  Until late 1978, several attempts were made
to control money supply and with it total credit. With the adoption of the
prefixed exchange rate policy within the monetary approach to the balance of
payments in early 1979, mobility of external capital became a keystone of
economic policy, leaving the monetary authorities only with the control over
net domestic credit.
1.39      Interest rates. The most recurrent complaint of the industrial
business coAmunity during the last four years in Argentina refers to the high
levels of interest rates.  Many firms have experienced difficulties because of
high fJlancial costs, which in some cases rose to over 20% of total revenue.
However, a look at the development of interest rates indicates that after the
initial surge in 1977 and early 1978, real interest rates were well below 10%
for over 18 months.  It was only during the second semester of 1980 and the
first quarter of 1981 that interest rates increased rapidly in real terms,
this time as a consequence of strong expectations of a large devaluation.

1.40      With total freedom of capital movements, the Argentine financial
system became rapidly integrated into the world financial system. Foreign
funds have been playing a major role in providing financing for Argentine
firms and in establishing upper limits to interest rates. Internal interest
rates are determined largely by international interest levels plus expected
peso devaluation. Until early 1980, expectations were increasingly contained,
but after the banking crisis in March and April expectations of a substantial
peso devaluation ran high. The change from the original adjustment schedule
to a 1% per month (October-December 1980) and later 2% per month devaluation
(January-March 1981) and finally the 10% devaluation in February 1981, forced
domestic interest rates even higher without attracting new external capital.
The new authorities devalued the peso by 30%, when they came to power in
April 1981. That measure, however, was insufficient to stabilize expectations
and consequently the government introduced a two tier exchange rate system in
June 1981, after devaluing the Argentine peso by a further 60%. The export/
import exchange rate was fixed at a$4,963 per US$1 ard has been adjusted upwards
according to the difference of international and domestic inflation. The free
exchange rate for financial transaction started out at a$7,565 per US$1, in-
creased slightly in July but has since then stabilized.
1.41      Bank portfolio status.  The portfolios of most Argentine banks
contain significant amounts of bad debt. A 1980 Central Bank survey of
the portfolio structure of 200 banks set the figure at 40% but that included
all loans which were in arrears by 10 days or more, an unusually conservative
definition of "bad" debt. The relative inexperience of Argentinian bankers
in risk assessment and the existence until recently of a guarantee system
for bank portfolios have been major causes of portfolio weakness. Two
generations of Argentine bankers have grown accustomed to risk-free banking
activity. With the establishment of a free banking system, many Argentine
bankers have failed to recognize the new risk component or have lacked risk
assessment expertise. Furthermore, the difficulties in risk evaluation have
been compounded by the unstable economic environment. The short-term impact
of the tariff reform and exchange rate changes made projections of the future
based on past experience of particular sectors and firms difficult.
1.42      Another dilemma was presented by the 100% guarantee system for bank
deposits. That guarantee system was introduced to give domestic banks a
better chance to compete with foreign and official banks. The system,
however, allowed banks to grow by competing for deposits with above-market
deposit rates. Those banks then accepted above-average risks. While guaran-
tees were lowered in late 1979, many Argentine banks and financieras are still
offering high interest rates and accepting high risk loans and thereby leaving
open the possibility of future bank failures.
1.43      Resource mobilization and industrial financing.  Total gross private
investment, which had grown by almost 86% in real terms during the period from
1967 to 1975, fell back to the 1973/74 level during the 1977/80 period (Table
1.2). The decline in investment in the 1977/80 period can be attributed to
three principal factors: (a) declining demand for goods experienced by some
subsectors as a result of the opening of the economy and the restructuring of
the industrial sector; (b) higher financing costs; and (c) uncertainty about
future economic developments.



- 14 -
1.44      Private investment financing needs in Argentina have traditionally
relied heavily on depreciation and retained earnings. The difficulties expe-
rienced by some industries in the 1977/80 period reduced the availability of
financing from these sources. The mix of loan financing changed in this
period as domestic interest rates soared and external capital became available
at lower rates. The percentage of foreign loan financing as a share of
private investment almost tripled from 1975/76 to 1977/80, while the percen-
tage of domestic loan financing declined by about a third. The amount of new
equity investment including direct foreign investment, although not large in
absolute terms, took a large percentage jump from 1% to 2.7% of total financing
in the period 1975/76 to 1977/80.

C. The Mining Sector
Background
1.45      Although Argentina shares some of the favorable geological
features of its neighbor Andean countries, the mining sector makes a far
smaller contribution to its economy than it does in those countries.  Since
1960 the sector's participation in GDP has been between 1.5-1.7%, equivalent
to about US$350 to US$400 million per year (1978 prices). Most of this con-
tribution comes from the mining of non-mnetallic minerals including construc-
tion materials and cement.  Mining of the base metals such as copper, lead,
and zinc, has been restricted to a relatively limited number of small opera-
tions. The only exception has been "Minera Aguilar," which is controlled by
a U.S. company and operates a 2,200 tons per day mine and concentrator in the



- 15 -
Andes producing zinc, lead, and silver concentrates. The government that came
to power in 1976 committed itself to increasing the importance of the mining
sector in the Argentine economy by promoting private sector exploration
and development.
Supply-Demand for Mineral Products
1.46      To understand better the mining sector in Argentina it is necessary
to differentiate three subsectors: (a) mining of base metals, (b) mining of
iron ore, and (c) mining of non-metallics. As shown in Table 1.3, Argentina's
relatively small requirements for base metals, with the exception of copper,
tin, nickel, and other minor metals, is practically covered by domestic
supply. Imports in 1978 amounted to US$56 million for copper, US$10 million
for tin, and US$5 million for nickel.

l/   Domestic supply includes only Argentine mine production, it does not
include metals imported as such or contained in concentrates.
1.47      The mining of iron ore is practically restricted to one operation,
Hierro de la Patagonia, with a total production of about 200,000 tons per year
of ores containing 44% iron. Steel consumption in the country is estimated to
be about three million tons per year, with total imports of iron ores, steel,
and related products amounting to some US$274 million in 1978. The industry
of non-metallics, including construction materials (crushed stone, ballast,
gypsum, lime, clay, etc.) and cement is well developed in the country and it
appears that the local supply is adequate. Nevertheless, imports of salt,
sulphur, stones, ceramics and other non-metallic products amounted to some
US$40 million in 1978.
Government Policy and Legislation
1.48      Although the government that came to power in 1976 stated from its
inception its intention to promote the development of Argentina's mining
sector, it has been only recently that two key decree-laws have been issued to



-- 16 -
is erfect   The MIning Promotion Law (Regimen de Promocion Minera), (Ley No.
22095 of October 1979) is intended to promote the development of mining
activities, including research, exploration, development, and exploitation of
m:ness-. .-prodlucts and its beneficiation, smelting and refining, through duty
exerarstions and tax incentives for investments in these activities (Annex 1,
Attac:hment ).  In addition, the mining code was amended (Ley No. 22259 of
Ju1;7 I.9A,C' tn bring it up to date with new technological developments and, by
add1ng two new chapters, to outline a legal framework for developing large
sca:le. min_n_ through concession contracts for exploration and exploitation.
These contracts are to be let by the government under International competi-
tisiea `dding and are intended to attract foreign investors.
1.eif     Tihe 14ining Promotion Law also regulates the operation of the Mining
Devel opment Funid, which was created in 1974 to  provide financial assistance
for exploration and mining feasibility studies to medium and small scale
inling projects.  This fund is basically financed through a duty on imports of
mineraf pAroducts and semi-processed metals and special contributions by the
Ministry of Finarnce.  Terms and conditions for the loans are specific for each
project.  However, should the results of a mining exploration project be
neg at Ire  the fund ca;: waive the repayment of up to 80% of the amounts loaned.
The Funad ts handled directly by the Secretariat of Mining, through its tech-
nical   r  a-ld  oarn administrationr is carried out by BANADE,

about 20 to 30 small/medium eniterprises are involved.  The financial require-

II. THE BANCO NACIONAL DE DESARROLLO (BANADE)
A. The Institution
Background
2.01      BANADE was created as an autonomous government-owned development
bank in December 1970, out of the reorganized Banco Industrial, which in turn,
had been established in 1944 to provide term financing for industry. By early
1976, however, lending at highly negative real interest rates during a period
of very high inflation had almost completely eroded BANADE's equity base, and
its operations had come to a virtual standstill. Prior to 1976, BANADE's low
interest loans frequently became a channel for subsidies to industry and in
particular to deficit-ridden state enterprises. Recognizing the importance of
the institution as virtually the only domestic source of term financing for
industry, the new more open market oriented government that came to power in
1976 recapitalized BANADE, brought in an experienced board of directors and
adopted a new Charter. 1/ The new Charter was promulgated by Law No. 21629,
dated August 26, 1977. The Charter set the principal objective of BANADE to
be the support of industrial and mining development, particularly in the
private sector. In doing so, it gave priority to long- and medium-term
financing needs, using its own resources and those it obtains in domestic and
foreign capital markets. The Charter provides safeguards for the maintenance
of BANADE's operational autonomy, sound evaluation standards and financial
viability. BANADE's Statement of Objectives and Policies, adopted in 1977,
provides support and detail for these objectives. 1/ Since 1976, BANADE's
management has sought to concentrate its financial assistance on sound private
sector industrial and mining development projects and to apply lending,
interest rate and indexation policies designed to conserve its capital base.
2.02      In addition to its primary development banking objectives, BANADE
also provides commercial banking facilities and currently ranks third in
Argentina among financial institutions in total deposits, having about 4% of
the total in the banking system (Annex 2, Table 1). The Banco de la Nacion
and the Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires rank first and second in
deposits. BANADE ranks fourth in the country in loans outstanding, behind
the aforementioned banks and the Banco Hipotecario Nacional, with about 3% of
the total (Annex 2, Table 2). BANADE has an important role providing working
capital loans to industry and is active in promoting and supporting foreign
trade.
Board of Directors, Organization and Staff
2.03      BANADE's Board of Directors consists of a President, Vice-President
and ten directors, all appointed by the government for terms of four years.
The members of the Board have had varied industrial, administrative and
managerial experience (Annex 2, Attachment 1). The Board appoints BANADE's
1/   BANADE's Charter and Statement of Policy and Objectives appear in Annex I
and II of the Staff Appraisal Report for the First Industrial Credit
Project, Report No. 1521b-AR, May 25, 1977.



- 18 -
General Manager, the Assistant General Managers and Department heads. It
is responsible for establishing strategy and policy within the framework
of BANADE's charter and approving operations. BANADE's Board Chairman and
President is Dr. Celestino Carbajal, who was appointed to his position earlier
this year, after extensive experience in industry, government and finance.
2.04      BANADE is administered by its General Manager and six Assistant
General Managers, who receive support services from five departments that
report to the General Manager (see Organization Chart, Annex 2, Attachment 2).
The General Manager, Dr. Hector Ghirlanda, a career BANADE employee, with 2 7
years experience in the organization was appointed to his position in 1978 .
BANADE has 33 branch offices throughout the country. About one third of
BANADE's 3,600 employees are assigned to branch offices. The level of lending
authority delegated to branch offices is related to branch office size and
varies from $a490 million to $a980 million. In the head office, the General
Manager has been delegated maximum lending authority of up to $a2.4 billion.
Loans above these amounts must be approved by the Board of Directors.
2.05      Lending operations in BANADE's head office are conducted through
four departments headed by Assistant General Managers. These Departments
are Investment and Development Credit, Mining, Ordinary Credit and External
Finance. The Departments are headed by persons with extensive experience
and are staffed with knowledgeable and skilled personnel. Many of BANADE's
technical personnel have second jobs; a practice that has been common for
many years in the Argentine civil service. Undoubtedly, this affects staff
productivity, but the system works and is accepted by BANADE's management.
The phenomenon arose partly because of low public sector salaries. The
macro-economic pressures to reduce public sector expenditures by holding down
public sector salaries, however, are such that it would not be useful to press
for basic changes in compensation levels at this time. There are also atti-
tudinal adjustments toward public sector employment that would have to be
addressed in a broader context than this project, if the issue of dual employ-
ment is to be successfully resolved. The BANADE management is concerned
about dual employment problem and some of the measures to be considered in
the manpower development program (paras. 2.09 and 2.10) should help address
the problem.
2.06      In addition to the Departments concerned with lending, the Bank has
taken an interest in the activities of the Economics Department, because of
the support it can provide to lending operations in assessing priorities and
making sound economic judgements.  Since 1977 the Economics Department has
produced 8 to 10 market studies annually of various industrial subsectors.
The quality of these studies has improved significantly in the last two
years. The studies have been a useful tool for BANADE's project promotion
and analysis. The Department has also begun to supply to BANADE's lending
departments information on major economic indicators and industrial produc-
tion, investment and export plans. Several special studies are planned,
including one analyzing industry's sources and uses of medium and long term
capital. The department will also be responsible for engaging a consultant
to carry out the qeffective protection study which is discussed in parae. 1.28



- 19 -
Appraisal, Supervision and Procurement
2.07      Project appraisal is conducted by teams of financial analysts,
engineers, accountants and economists.  The engineering specialists--other
than mining and oil and gas specialists--are located in the Technical Services
Division of the Investment and Development Credit Department. Those projects
that have been reviewed by the Bank have met satisfactory professional
standards. Management has been agressive in promoting courses in project
analysis which have been taught by BANADE personnel and outside consultants.
The Technical Services Division has published manuals and guidelines on
project preparation and evaluation which have assisted BANADE staff and
clients. As a result of the influence of the First Industrial Credit Project,
financial and economic rate of return analysis has become accepted as a
valuable tool within BANADE. BANADE agreed with the Bank under this project
that economic rates of return would be calculated on new or expansion projects
receiving subloans cver US$500,000. Economic rates of return on re-equipment
or modernization projects --which are defined to be projects which will not
increase production more than 30%--are only calculated for subloans over US$2
million. Financial rates of return are calculated for new and expansion
projects that receive subloans of over US$100,000. Financial rates of return
are also calculated on re-equipment or modernization projects that receive
subloans over US$500,000. BANADE has agreed to continue to use the same
standards for rate of return analysis for the proposed loan. BANADE has
agreed to calculate economic rates of return on projects of any size where
there has been a significant increase in the effective protection of the goods
to be produced by the project, unless the Bank otherwise agrees. BANADE has
instituted procedures for supervising loan implementation. Procurement and
shipping documents are checked and visits made to project sites to verify
project progress. BANADE requires three quotations for the purchase of goods
and services, unless the borrower demonstrates that the obtaining of such
quotations is not feasible. BANADE maintains a comparative list of prices
of goods and services it normally finances and checks the reasonableness of
proposed procurement prices against that list. For procurements of $500,000
or more under the project, BANADE has agreed to require sub-borrowers to
identify sources of supply on an international basis, as well as to solicit
sufficient price quotations so as to assure efficient procurement.
2.08      Although BANADE's procedures for supervising physical progress on
projects has been satisfactory, it has not been as diligent in evaluating
the developmental impact of completed projects. BANADE has agreed to improve
this aspect of supervision and to provide supervision reports to the Bank on
a regular basis.
Manpower Development
2.09      BANADE has maintained its manpower at about the same level for the
past five years. Except in rare circumstance, hiring has been restricted to
new professionals in junior level positions and clerical staff. The number
of BANADE's staff does not seem to be excessive in view of the limited use of
data processing facilities in BANADE's operations. A large amount of BANADE's
paper work still must be hand processed. Although BANADE has a large core of
experienced professionals, many of them do not work full time and maintain



- 20 -
outside jobs (para. 2.05). Management's tolerance of second jobs, employment
security and a relatively attractive package of fringe benefits have limited
employment turnover. BANADE has, however, experienced difficulty in retain-
ing its brightest and most dynamic technical people.
20lG      Recently, due to the economic slowdown and consequent limited employ-
ment opportunities, BANADE has been able to hold some of the experienced and
highly qualified employees, who in more normal times might have left for more
Lucrative private sector opportunities. Although BANADE is currently able to
keep Lts existing staff and to attract young qualified professionals, it seems
to have difficulty in attracting mid-career professionals necessary for
certain technically specialized areas (e.g. data processing, geology, and
mining engineering).  This is in part due to the excessively inward looking
policy adopted by BANADE's personnel management, that any kind of professional
can be created from within the organization. This policy has reduced the
level of professionalism in technically specialized areas, including the
personnel management area itself. It has also aggravated the distorted age
distribution of BANADE's staff, which consists of a large number of older
professionals and young trainees, with an insufficient number of mid-career
professionals. Recognizing these problems, BANADE's management has agreed
to prepare a comprehensive manpower development plan by June 30, 1982 and to
carry- out the plan according to a timetable satisfactory to the Bank. The
Dian would include systems and programs for personnel evaluation, promotion,
incentives, training, hiring and recruitment, as well as a program for
the preparation of managerial personnel to assume positions of increased
resoonsibility.
nana ement Control and Information
2.11      BANADE's management is aware that significant improvement can be
made in BANADE's management information system which would permit more effi-
cient programming of operations, financial planning, allocation of resources
and monitoring of operations. Voluminous but uncoordinated financial data
is rnormally provided to BANADE's management, but it does not contain suffi-
cient a-nalysis and is also not presented in a way which would facilitate
managerial decisions. BANADE's management considers that a key role could
be played by computerized data processing in improving this situation and in
reducing the amount of time spent by professional and technical personnel on
routine and frustrating tasks for which they are overqualified. BANADE's data
processing center is currently installing additional new equipment necessary
to enlarge and improve its system. The equipment should be fully operational
by late 1981 and will provide BANADE satisfactory processing capability.
2.12      The Central Bank of Argentina's (BCRA) new accounting procedures and
auditing requirements 1/ have increased the urgency and importance of review-
ing existing data processing applications. BANADE's management intends to
hire additional experienced data processing analysts to improve its capability
1/   BCRA regulations require that BANADE have its 1981 annual financial
statements certified by external auditors. Beginning in 1982 the
regulations require a quarterly audit report in addition to an annual
report.



- 21 -
of expanding into new programming applications which would meet BCRA require-
ments and other needs. New applications to be considered are: (i) a system
to monitor foreign currency operations (e.g. maturities position and repayment
schedule of loans, portfolio analysis of foreign currency loans and analysis
of loans in arrears and reschedulings); (ii) analysis of arrears and resched-
ulings of local peso-denominated loans; (iii) general information of branch
offices and the consolidation of such information with head office activities;
and (iv) personnel administration. BANADE has agreed to a timetable for the
carrying out of a plan of action for the design and installation of management
control and information systems.
B. Operations
General
2.13      BANADE has experienced a rapid increase in its lending operations
over the last five years (Table 2.1). In dollar equivalent terms, the total
portfolio of loans grew 728%, so that at the end of 1980, loans outstanding
were the equivalent of US$3.6 billion. About 33% of the loan portfolio
contained loans denominated in foreign currency, while the remaining 67%
contained loans denominated in Argerntine pesos. BANADE's foreign currency
denominated loan portfolio has increased more rapidly than its peso denominated
portfolio, growing from US$84 million at the end of 1976 to US$1.2 billion at
the end of 1980. The rapid growth of the foreign currency portion of the
portfolio reflects the success that Argentina and BANADE have had in attracting
foreign lines of credit in recent years. BANADE's foreign currency loans may
be used by BANADE's clients to finance both foreign and local costs, unless
the foreign credit line to BANADE contains specific restrictions on its use.
BANADE's normal policy is to pass the foreign exchange risk on to its borrowers,
so that foreign credits are onlent in the currency in which BANADE is obliged
to repay.

1/   BANADE's automated information and data retrieval system is programmed
to provide loan profile information on peso loans.  Data for foreign
currency loans is manually retrieved and therefore frequently more
difficult to obtain. The information presented in this report reflects
this situation.

2.14      Although BANADE lends to many industrial and mining subsectors, its
lending in the last several years has given emphasis to the chemical industry
(see Annex 2, Table 3). Peso loans to this industry accounted for about 21%
and 36% of loans in 1978 and 1979 respectively. This in large part reflects
the recent rapid development of the petrochemical industry in the Bahia Blanca
area utilizing indigenous natural gas and petroleum resources. Mining loans
have represented close to 10% of BANADE's total commitments in these two years
and the balance has been committed to a broad range of other industrial
subsectors. BANADE's loans are principally made to finance fixed investments.
(See Annex 2, Table 4 on Loans and Guarantees Classified by Purpose.) Fixed
investment peso loans have accounted for over 70% of the local currency loans
made annually in every year but one since 1977, while working capital financing
has represented less than 20% of such loans in all but one year. The following
is a summary analysis of this relationship:

2.15      Although BANADE makes short--term and commercial bank type loans, it
is basically a long term lender. It classifies its loans as short-term (up
to three years), medium term (between three and five years) and long-term
(over five years). Over 80% of BANADE's outstanding local currency loans were
for terms of more than three years as of November 30, 1980. About 42% of the
loans were for terms of three to five years; 40% for terms of more than five
years; and 18% for less than three years.
2.16      BANADE's effective delegation of lending authority, has permitted
its branch offices to play an active role in committing loan resources. The
branch offices have been responsible for committing since 1977 between 20%
and 40% annually of BANADE's peso loans. In the last three years for which
data have been collected the Federal Capital and the Greater Buenos Aires
area have received less than 20% of loans granted by BANADE. Excluding
this area and the province of Buenos Aires, the rest of the country received
between 40% and 60% of BANADE's peso loans in the three year period. This
distribution of lending is presented in the following summary table:

Operations by Department
2.17      BANADE's lending operations are principally carried out by the tour
departments,--Investment and Development Credit, External Finance, Mining and
Ordinary Credit. Bank loan funds in the first project have been channelled
through the first three departments. The departments act with considerable
autonomy and BANADE's operations can best be understood by a brief review of
each of them.
2.18      Investment and Development Credit Department.  The Investment and
Development Credit Department makes medium- and long-term development loans
to industry. The projects may be new or expansion of existing facilities. It
is the largest of the lending departments with 247 employees. More than half
of the employees are in Technical Services, which provides engineering,
financial, economic and other technical support services required for credit
application evaluation to the Investment and Development Credit Department,
as well as to BANADE's other departments and branch offices. The department
committed about 45% of the Bank funds available for onlending under the first
project. Its lending over the last three years has been as follows:

2.19      The decrease in lending activity in 1980 is attributable to lower
investment in expansion projects, particularly by those industries exposed
to increased competition from imports. The reduction in the volume of lending
in 1980 was 7ess marked than the drop in the number of projects, due to the
financing of several very large capital intensive projects in the petrochemical
and oaper industries. Lending in these two sectors accounted for an average
of over 60% of the Department's peso lending over the last two years.
2.20      Lending by the department has been medium- and long-term, with
most loans fall ing into the five to ten year range. The economic rate of
returni of the projects for which the return was calculated fell into the 20%
to 40% range, while the financial rate of return was in the 15% to 30% range.
2.21      External Finance Department.  The External Finance Department was
established in 1978 and has been financing imported equipment to modernize
Argentine industry with lines of credit from abroad. About 53% of the funds
available for onlending under the Bank's First Industrial Credit Loan to
BANADE were utilized by this Department. The Department which has 145 staff
members also has the responsibility for financing exports and mobilizing
exter-nal capital.
2.22      Between 1978 and 1980, the Department extended 209 credits, total-
ling US$180.8 million.  The number of loan operations began with an initial 17
in 1978, increased to 91 in 1979 and 101 in 1980. During this period World
Bank ftunds accounted for 18.6% of the total value of the loans made by the
Department, but represented almost three quarters of the loans made.  The
World Bank resources during this period were used to finance smaller equipment
purchases and in general smaller borrowers. The average subloan size in this
period was about US$215,000. Loans for equipment are for shorter terms than
those financed by the Investment and Development Credit Department, with 80%
of the loans being for five years or less, and none of the loans having a term
of more than 10 years.
2.23      Mining Department.  The Mining Department is responsible for medium-
and long-term lending for mining and oil and gas exploration and development.
The department has recently expanded from two to three divisions in connection
with the Bank's Oil and Gas Credit Project. The new division is responsible
for carrying out the Bank financed Oil and Gas Project and has seven employees.
The other two divisions employ about eighty persons. The Mining Development
Division provides technical support services to and promotes new projects in
the mining industry through its eight mining promotion offices. It receives
assistance from a West German Government technical assistance team. The
Credit Division evaluates loan applications and supervises the mining loan
portfolio. The department has used about 5% of the funds available for onlend-
ing iander the Bank's First Industrial Credit Project.
2.24      Government interest in promoting mining development has stimulated
additional lending in the mining sector. Peso loans committed in 1979 in-
creased 185% in dollar equivalent terms from 1978 to 1979. The rising trend
continued into 1980, with lending for the first nine months of the year
almost equalling lending for 1979. Foreign currency loans were only US$2.0
million and US$2.5 million in 1978 and 1979. Foreign currency loans increased
significantly--to US$63 million--in 1980. The sharp increase was due to
lendinag for oil and gas exploration, which represented 72% of foreign currency
lending in 1980.

2.25      Ordinary Credit Department.  The Ordinary Credit Department has
three divisions with 167 employees. The Department has an Ordinary Credit
division which extends working capital and other short-term credits to in-
dustry. A Small Industries Division provides working capital credits to small
industry and provides longer term financing for new and expansion projects of
less than US$2 million, provided those projects do not have direct import
financing requirements. If they do, the projects are referred to the Invest-
ment and Development Credit Department if related to new and expansion
projects, or to the External Finance Department for re-equipment and modern-
ization projects. The Litigation and Payment Arrears division is responsible
for following up on late payments for the Department and the other lending
offices of BANADE.
Financial Policies
2.26      BANADE's Policy Statement sets forth financial limitations on its
operations which are adequate to protect the institution from unreasonable
financial risks. These policies cover concentration of risk assets, equity
investments, liquidity and liability management, financial ratios, and
management of special funds.
2.27      In its medium- and long-term lending, BANADE may finance up to 80%
of total project cost but not more than 150% of the borrower's unimpaired
capital and reserves. Short-term loans to a single borrower may not exceed
30% of the borrower's capital and reserves and the total of this amount plus
short-term guarantees may not exceed 50% of medium- and long-term loans
granted by BANADE. All guarantees, short- and long-term, issued by BANADE in
favor of a single borrower may not exceed 150% of the borrower's total funded
indebtedness. Furthermore, the total exposure of BANADE in loans and guaran-
tees with a single borrower may not exceed 200% of the borrower's capital and
reserves nor 30% of BANADE's capital and reserves. Finally, the borrower's
total debt-to-equity ratio may not exceed 3:1.
2.28      BANADE may participate in new equity issues of private industrial
and mining enterprises up to 10% of the private firm's total subscribed
capital. Aggregate equity investments may not exceed 20% of BANADE's capital
and reserves, and, furthermore, the holding period of equity investments is
limited by the Charter of Incorporation to three years after listing on a
stock exchange.
Lending Terms
2.29      Foreign currency loans are repayable by BANADE's sub-borrowers in
the currency in which BANADE borrows and carry an interest rate that includes
a fixed margin above BANADE's borrowing costs. Peso loans are subject to
indexation and have rates of interest that vary depending on the location and
type of the projects. The lowest rates of interest apply to industrial
projects located in frontier areas and mining exploration projects. All peso
loans, with the exception of short-term working capital loans provide for
indexation based on interest rates paid on term deposits; short-term working
capital loans charge a high fixed rate of interest. (A discussion of the
indices BANADE has used and their effectiveness in preventing erosion of
BANADE's capital is contained in paras. 2.36 - 2.38.).



- 26 -
2.30      The objective of loans for industries in frontier areas is to
promote regional development and decentralizaiton. The period of amortization
of these loans is up to 12 years including two years of grace and they bear
an interest rate of 2% per annum plus indexation. Mining exploration projects
use funds administered by BANADE for the Mining Exploration Fund of the Mining
Secretariat.  These loans are set at varying terms (para. 1.49).
2.31      BANADE's interest rates for new projects qualifying under the
Industrial Promotion Law are 5% and 7% plus indexation for expansion projects
and equipment financing. The foregoing loans are made on terms of up to
12 years, including 2 years of grace. Permanent working capital credits
bearing interest rates between 9% and 13.5% per annum plus indexation are
provided to industries for up to 12 years (including 2 years grace) for
credits to expand production and also to restructure debts. Seasonal working
capital loans of less than a one year term are available at a fixed rate of
9.8% per month.
2.32      The First Industrial Credit Project provided that the loan be relent
in dollars at 11%, with the cross currency risk born by the government. The
subloan interest rate on these loans was raised to 12% in November 1980. The
subloan interest rate for this project is described in paras. 3.11 and 3.12.

Capital
Financial Position and Results
2.33      General.  During 1976 BANADE was recapitalized by the Government
through an infusion of new capital and a capitalization of liabilities amount-
ing to an equivalent of US$208 million. 1/ This action reduced the debt/equity
1/   Annex 2, Tables 5 to 10 contain BANADE's past and projected balance
sheets and income and source and application of funds statements.



- 27 -
ratio from 36.6:1 at year end 1975 to 1.6:1 at year end 1976.  BANADE's
Policy Statement issued in 1977 provided that the recapitalized institution's
total debt would be limited to ten times its capital and reserves. The
debt/equity ratio limitation is reasonable, given BANADE's role as a mixed
commercial and development bank.
2.34      As of year-end 1980, BANADE's debt/equity ratio was 5.5:1, which,
although much higher than the 2.6:1 ratio at year-end 1979, still allows for
considerable additional leverage. 1/ The debt/equity ratio rose due to
continued growth in liabilities (both locally mobilized time and demand
deposits and foreign borrowings) and some equity erosion in real terms.
Total assets reached $a9,068 billion at year-end 1980 (about US$4.6 billion
equivalent), a 29% p.a. increase in real terms (using the WPI, wholesale price
index, as deflator) over the year-end 1979 level. The growth of assets, loan
portfolio and equity compared with the inflation rate are shown below:
Table 2.6: GROWTH OF ASSETS AND EQUITY COMiPARED TO INFLATION RATE
(in $a billion)

1976    1977      1978       1979      1980    Increase

2.35      As shown above, from 1976 to 1980, total assets (which are almost
all financial) increased 42 fold, the loan portfolio 60 fold from a smaller
base, and equity about 17 fold. The wholesale price index increased about
22 fold over the same period. Thus, while assets, including the loan port-
folio, increased substantially in real terms, the equity base of BANADE
declined by about 30% in real terms over the same period. Although not
satisfactory, this result is still a distinct improvement over the results
in 1975 prior to the Bank's involvement with BANADE, when equity declined to
only about US$7.0 million equivalent after years of lending at highly negative
interest rates in real terms.
2.36      BANADE's improved ability to protect itself against domestic infla-
tion and preserve its equity base has been due to several factors. BANADE's
foreign currency loans are not affected by domestic inflation and have grown
to represent about a third of BANADE's portfolio at year end 1980. The source
1/   BANADE's foreign borrowings include government guarantied loans for
state enterprises in 1980 which carry little or no risk to BANADE.
Were borrowings for state enterprises not included in BANADE's financial
statements, the debt/equity ratio for 1980 would be reduced.



- 28 -
of these funds are from BANADE's foreign borrowings. The funds are then relent
to BANADE's clients and are repayable in the currency in which BANADE is
obligated tc repay its loan. The medium and long term peso denominated loans
have since 1976 been subject to indexing while short term loans have carried
nominal rates of interest exceeding the inflation rate. BANADE's policy has
been to retain earnings--including that portion attributed to indexation.
Thus, were the index on peso-denominated loans and the nominal interest rate
on short term loans adequate, BANADE should have been able to protect its
equity base, provided portfolio losses could be contained. To the extent that
there has been an erosion of BANADE's capital, it has principally been due to
two factors. The first is that some of the older medium and longer term loans
in the portfolio did not have any provision for indexation. Except for high
interest short-term loans, non-indexed loans no lornger represent a significant
percentage of BANADE's portfolio.  The second is that the indexing mechanism,
as explained in the following paragraph, has not always been adequate.
Management has been aware of the problem and has made adjustments to help
ensure maintenance of equity value in real terms in the future.
2.37      Revenues, costs and profitability.  BANADE aow charges a floating
interest rate on its term loans in pesos which is based on the Central Bank-
computed weighted average of interest rates paid on term deposits (tasa
testigo). BANADE used to charge peso interest rates in term loans linked to
the wholesale price index (WPI), which proved satisfactory at a time when most
peso lending Twas made using Central Bank and equity funds.  However, with the
growth of time and demand deposits, which now fund some 30% of assets (up from
8% in 1977), BANADE became exposed to substantial risks arising from divergence
between the deposit rates and relending rates. This eventually caused a
negative spread leading to the erosion of BANADE's equity in real terms
mentioned above. Since May 1980, all new term loans in pesos have interest
rates based on the tasa testigo. In March 1981, interest rates on all out-
standing term peso loans were converted from a WPI base to a tasa testigo base
invoking a clause incorporated into loan agreements allowing BANADE to change
the index for peso interest rates.
2.38      BANADE maintained a steady growth in its net earnings in the period
1976 to 1979. Return on total assets averaged between 11% and 15% during that
period. The situation changed sharply in 1980, when return on total assets
dropped to 2% and net income decreased to $a 181.7 billion (US$90.8 million).
The relatively poor 1980 performance was attributable to the negative spread
on some of BANADE's peso lending caused by the use of the WPI in setting inter-
est rates on BANADE's peso loans. Poor earnings in the first quarter of 1981,
prior to the adoptioin of the tasa testigo, will cause some further erosion of
BANADE's equity base and an increase in the debt/equity ratio to 7:1. A
strong recovery is projected for 1982 as a result of using the tasa testigo
interest rate on all outstanding peso term loans in 1982.   BANADE's 1982
return on equity after taxes will rise to 56% after being at 13% and 37%
in 1980 and 1981, respectively. i/ Beyond 1982, BANADE's income continues
to increase, but at a diminishing rate as deposit growth and net external
1/   Based on the inflation assumptions explained in Annex 2, T-5.

borrowing slow. Should inflation exceed BANADE's expectations, projections
for income growth and real return on equity should remain substantially
intact, since about one third of BANADE's loans are foreign exchange deno-
minated and BANADE's peso loans are satisfactorily indexed. However, in
order to help protect BANADE further against possible erosion of capital as
a result of exchange losses, inflation and business failures, the government
has agreed to require BANADE to take such measures as may be necessary to
maintain BANADE's equity in real terms.
2.39     BANADE's administrative expenses have been kept between 2.0% to 2.4%
of average total assets over the last five years. The administrative expense
level seems moderate given the large number of small loans made by BANADE,
its branch system and the still large number of certain categories of staff
relative to volume of operations. The ratio of administrative to total assets
should decline over the next several years as BANADE's efficiency further im-
proves due to programs for manpower development (para. 2.09) and improvements
in management control and information systems (para. 2.11).
2.40      Portfolio quality and reserves.  In spite of the problems affecting
Argentina's economy, the quality of BANADE's loan portfolio has remained
satisfactory due to its: (a) conservative approach to lending (e.g., sizeable
collaterals and/or guarantees and BANADE's ratio analysis test); (b) good
appraisal capability; and (c) proportionally large lending to industrial
subsectors that have been less seriously affected by competition from imports
(e.g. petrochemi-cals, cement and construction industry).
2.41      The Board of BANADE reviews the status of past due loans monthly,
in order to ensure that proper reserves are set aside for loan losses. As of
December 31, 1980, BANADE's reported total arrears of principal and interest
over 10 days amounted to $a308.2 billion (US$154.1 million equivalent), re-
presenting 6.4% of BANADE's total outstanding portfolio (Annex 2, Tables 11
and 12). Arrears over three months, totalled $a183.1 billion (US$91.6 mil-
lion equivalent), or 4.0% of the total portfolio. Peso-denominated and
foreign currency loans in arrears over three months represented 0.2% (US$2.65
million equivalent) and 3.7% (US$88.9 million equivalent) of BANADE's total
outstanding portfolio for year-end 1980, respectively. Peso denominated loans
totalling about $a5.9 billion (US$3.0 million equivalent) were rolled-over and
rescheduled in 1980. Almost twice the value of foreign currency credits
(about US$6.1 million equivalent) were renegotiated during the same year.

2.42      Loss provisions as a percentage of total portfolio have increased
from 7.2% (December 31, 1979) to 10.2% (December 31, 1980). Provisions for
bad debts by BAiNADE appear adequately to cover possible losses in its loan
portfolio. BANADE's term loans are secured by pledges on assets, mortgages
and other tangible guarantees.  Most of the short-term working capital
credits representing about 13% of BANADE's portfolio are unsecured.
2.43      As of December 31, 1980, 1,807 firms were in arrears.  Most of the
arrears were concentrated in three industrial sectors representing 71% of the
firms and about 75% of total money value in arrears.

2.44      The mission reviewed about 10% in amount (9.2% in number of firms)
of BANADE's portfolio in arrears and found that high financial costs and a
sluggish demand are the main reasons for loans in arrears and reschedulings.
Industries experiencing reduced demand are those which must compete with low
priced imports.  Those industries that still have high effective protection
have experienced little difficulty in servicing debt.
2.45      Source of funds and needs.  At year-end 1980, about 40% of BANADE's
liabilities were accounted for by time and demand deposits, another 41% by
foreign currency obligations and the remaining amount accounted for by mis-
cellaneous obligations. BANADE's sources of funds have gone through a sig-
nificant change since 1975. Prior to 1975 local currency funds were obtained
by rediscounting loans at the Central Bank, and by borrowing from ofLicial
sources. Beginning in 1976, BANADE was authorized to accept deposits and this
has become the major source for peso resources. BANADE's extensive system of
branches has facilitated raising short-term funds in the domestic market to
meet its resource needs. Foreign currency borrowings were also at minimal
levels in 1976 as a result of Argentina's relatively poor international credit
standing. As confidence in Argentina's economic management grew in inter-
national money markets, BANADE was able to tap foreign financing sources.
Foreign currency obligations have grown 10 fold in the 1976-1980 period,
from US$157.2 million in 1976, to US$1,574.2 million in 1980.



- 31 -
2.46      BANADE's time and demand deposits have increased rapidly over the
1976-1980 period partly due to its strong efforts, but also due to uncertain
condition in the financial sector which led to deposit shifts from private
to m.ore secure public banks. BANADE's time and demand deposits are expected
to remain practically constant in real terms during the 1981-1985 period.
However, foreign currency obligations are expected to grow a significant 31%
in 1981 largely as a result of borrowing for several state-owned enterprises,
with BANADE acting as financial agent. BANADE's foreign currency loan obliga-
tions are expected to 4increase at a more modest nominal growth rate (in US
dollars) of 15% per year through 1985. Assuming a 10% dollar inflation
rate, real growth in foreign currency obligations will be about 5% per year.
BANADE's equity resources are also projected to grow a modest 4.8% per year in
the 1981-1985 period, taking into account some initial deterioration in 1981,
prior to the adoption of the cost of funds index for local currency lending
(para. 2.37). Although real resource growth will be slow in the forecast
period, it is antic4pated that there will be structural shifts in lending.
Over the past few years, BANADE, as a secure state owned financial interme-
diary with a large share of deposits, found it necessary to provide a larger
share of working capital credit to industry than it might otherwise have
done. With expected improvements in the financial system BANADE will then
be able to  give more emphasis to medium and long term lending.   BANADE's
projected assets, loan portfolio and equity are shown below in 1980 pesos.

2.47      BANADE has been reasonably successful in obtaining certain types
of foreign financing since 1976. The financing it has obtained has fallen
into two categories: (a) export financing from official banks, which is
frequently long-term and low interest rate in nature, but with restricted
sources of procurement; and (b) medium term and short-term commercial bank
financing, with interest rates set at fixed amounts above the floating London
Inter-Bank rate. As of January 31, 1981, foreign commercial and official
bank lines of credit amounting to US$632.7 million were outstanding, of which
US$451.6 million remained to be utilized (Annex 2, Table 13). BANADE is
active in negotiating foreign lines of credit and recently completed negotia-
tions for a US$250 million from a group led by Citicorp for the benefit of
several state enterprises. (BANADE loans to these arid other state enterprises
are guaranteed by the government and carry no risk of loss by BANADE.) BANADE
has several other major credits under negotiation and anticipates cofinancing
about US$200 million of commercial bank loans with the proposed Second
Industrial Credit loan.

2.48      Bank funds represent about 11% of BANADE's estimated foreign cuirrency
commitments during the loan commitment period (through year-end 1983). The

2.49      It is likely that up to 40% of the Bank loan funds available to BANADE
would be used to continue to finance equipment replacement (see para. 3.02 for
a description of project components). Another 40-45% of loan funds would
likely be used to finance new and expansion projects. The major demand for
such financing is currently from the cement and petrochemical industries.
There are also several projects in the pipeline that are receiving incentives
under the government's regional development program. At appraisal the pipeline
for new and expansion projects for which applications or serious inquiries had
been received was US$290 million. The pipeline of applications for mining
projects was US$54 million at appraisal. It is estimated that about 5-10% of
loan funds would be used to finance projects in the mining sector. The remain-
ing 10% of loan funds would be used to finance projects for industrial energy
conservation.
2.50      It is estimated that total foreign currency loan commitment demands
on BANADE--including new applications not yet in the pipeline--would amount
to US$700 million through the loan commitment period. Bank funds will,
tnerefore, have to be used with other external funds to meet the financing
need of projects now in BANADE's pipeline and that are likely to enter the
pipeline during the loan commitment period.



- 33 -
Cofinancing
2.51      BANADE has asked that the Bank enter into a cofinancing agreement of
up to twice the size of the Bank loan. BANADE anticipates that the association
with the Bank will allow it to obtain better terms from private foreign banks
than it might otherwise be able to negotiate. A US$100 million Eurodollar
loan was obtained from a syndicated group of foreign banks under a cofinancing
agreement concluded in connection with the first project at a time when
Argentina was beginning to reestablish its standing in international credit
markets. As in the first project, a new cofinancing arrangement would include
a cross-default clause, agreement to exchange relevant information and provi-
sion to channel service payments through the Bank. It is expected that the
maturity of a private foreign loan obtained through cofinancing will be about
eight years. In order to facilitate the mixing of the shorter term private
funds and Bank funds and to assist BANADE in matching the amortization of
subloans to the amortization of its external borrowings as closely as possible,
the Bank agreed to permit BANADE to adjust toward the later maturities the
amortization of subloans from Bank funds. Such action would permit a more
even subloan repayment schedule and a less onerous debt service burden on
subborrowers during the early years of a project.
External Auditing Arrangements
2.52      Until early this year Argentine law required that BANADE's accounts
be audited by the Central Bank (BCRA). The first project provided that the
audit of BCRA be submitted to the Bank within four months of the end of
BANADE's fiscal year. BANADE's accounts were last audited by BCRA for its
fiscal year ending December 31, 1978. The 1980 banking crisis placed compet-
ing demands on BCRA staff and BCRA has been unable to assign personnel to
audit BANADE's accounts. BCRA issued a decree in February 1981 requiring that
all banks, including BANADE, be audited by private external auditors for the
year ending December 31, 1981. BANADE is now in the process of selecting a
private auditing firm to undertake the 1981 audit. In view of the difficulties
for external auditors to verify control systems in effect in prior years, BANADE
proposed and the Bank agreed to an interim arrangement with its Sindico 1/
to hire qualified auditors to perform the audit of BANADE's 1980 accounts
following Bank guidelines. This audit certifies financial statements for 1980
and uses comparative figures for 1979. For the year 1981 and subsequent years
BANADE has agreed to annual audits of its accounts by external auditors
satisfactory to the Bank and the submission of the audit to the Bank within
six months of the end of BANADE's fiscal year.
1/   The Sindico is the government's appointed representative who is
responsible for supervising BANADE's compliance with its Charter
and with applicable laws, decrees and regulations.

III. THE PROJECT
A. The First Industrial Credit Project
3.01      The First Industrial Credit Project provided US$100 million in a
loan to BANADE to assist in financing the foreign exchange costs of fixed
assets for investment subprojects in the industrial sector and technical
assistance for BANADE. The project was approved by the Executive Directors
in June 1977 and became effective in November of the same year. The US$99.75
million of loan funds available for onlending for investment subprojects was
completely committed by BANADE in May 1981.  The remaining funds for technical
assistance should be completely committed in the near future. About 53% of
the funds available for onlending have been used to finance the replacement
and modernization of equipment, principally by smaller and medium size enter-
prises.  The remainder of onlending was to finance new and expansion projects
of larger enterprises (45%) and mining enterprises (2%). Although the first
project was initially slow in getting started, commitments began to accelerate
after BANADE and its clients became more familiar with Bank procedures and
requirements.  It is anticipated that the loan should be fully disbursed by
mid-1982, only six months beyond the date anticipated in the Staff Appraisal
Report.
B. Project Objectives and Design
3.02      The principal objective of the proposed second project is to
support the Government's goal of making the industrial and mining sectors
more efficient. It would do so by continuing to help BANADE finance the
type of subprojects that have been financed under the first loan, including
modernization and replacement of equipment as well as new and expanded pro-
duction by industrial and mining firms. In addition, new features would be
introduced focussing on several more narrowly defined development objectives
within the Government's overall program. Major emphasis would be given to
a program for industrial energy conservation (see Annex 3, Attachment I).
Development credits would also be channeled through provincial banks to help
stimulate regional development and mobilize the provincial bank resources for
industrial development. The project would include technical assistance to
help BANADE in its institutional development and INTI in undertaking its
responsibilities in developing an industrial energy conservation program. To
assist in financing the project, complementary external medium term funds from
private financial institutions would be raised by BANADE through cofinancing
arrangements.



- 35 -
3.03      In order to help assure that the project continues to support the
goals of developing a more efficient industrial sector in Argentina two sets
of actions have been agreed to with BANADE and the government. The first
allows the Bank to require economic rate of return analyses for subprojects
of any size, whenever there have been changes by the government which would
significantly increase effective protection of the goods to be produced by
a proposed subproject (para. 2.07).  The second will cause the government
to complete a study on effective protection of Argentine industries.
The results of that study and the actions proposed to be taken on its
conclusions will be discussed by the Argentine authorities with the Bank
(para. 1.28).
The Industrial Energy Conservation Component
3.04      The industrial energy conservation program supported by the project
will involve a strengthening and extension of the capabilities of BANADE and
the National Institute for Industrial Technology (INTI). (Annex 3, Attachment
2 contains a description of INTI). BANADE will establish a line of credit for
conservation investments, i.e., investments whose purpose it will be to reduce
production costs through a more efficient use of energy, including but not
limited to retrofit equipment. The Bank loan will allocate US$10 million to
this program. Although it is possible that demand for these funds could reach
as much as US$40 million during the loan commitment period, a more conservative
allocation is justified in view of delays that could be encountered in initiating
a new program. This credit line will be coordinated by a senior loan officer
in BANADE who will combine resources made available by the Bank with BANADE's
domestic credit lines to provide a financing package for the investments.
For this purpose BANADE will perform the credit appraisal based on its standard
procedures and will rely on INTI for the technical appraisal. The terms of the
relationship between BANADE and INTI will be established in an agreement
between the two institutions. The signing of this agreement will be a condi-
tion of disbursement for the energy conservation component of the project.
3.05      The agreement between INTI and BANADE will provide that INTI will
promote energy conservation, perform energy audits and perform technical
appraisals of conservation investments. The audited firms would then be
referred to BANADE where they would apply for financing using the special
credit line. The agreement will permit technical appraisals to be performed
by third parties, such as private consultants or the firms themselves. The
agreement will provide that BANADE pay INTI a fee for the performance of the
appraisal.
3.06      INTI's participation in the conservation program will have four
principal components: (i) an energy advisory service that will perform energy
audits for all subsectors of industry and perform the technical appraisal of
loan applications under BANADE's conservation credit line; (ii) a trining
program to prepare energy auditors and company energy managers; (iii) a promo-
tion campaign  for energy conservation; and (iv) laboratory services as neces-
sary to support the program. INTI's service would be mainly directed at
medium and small industry and would, within three years, be able to perform



- 36 -
about 200 energy audits per year. This program will complentent the planned
energy conservation study under the Bank's Refirnery Conversion Project (Loan
2032-AR) which includes a number of audits of major plants. The program will
provide a subsidized service to a clientele that is not expected to turn to
private conservation consultants because of their perceived high cost. The
subsidized energy audits are necessary to promote energy conservation and
accelerate the transition of the industrial sector toward greater energy
efficiency.  The subsidy would be paid out the national budget In the same
way that INTI covers its research activities. The government has agreed to
have INTI carry out the program.
The Provincial Banks
3.07      The provincial banks are those owned or controlled by the provincial
governments in Argentina. There are currently 26 such banks in the country.
These banks have about 20% of the deposits in the banking system and account
for about 19% of total bank loans. They were formed initially to fill banking
needs in the provinces which were not being met by private commercial and
foreign banks. They have growrL in importance since the first provincial
bank--the Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires--was established in 1822.
Each of the provinces now has a bank and they provide a wide range of commer-
cial banking services, as well as lending for agricultural development and
provincial infrastructure. Except for a relatively small effort begun by
the Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires in 1978, little has been done by
the provincial banks to provide term credit for private sector industrial
development. The provincial banks have extensive field office networks in the
provinces that they serve, which allows them to reach communities that BANADE,
with its more restricted  field office establishment is unable to reach. The
provincial banks represent a largely untapped resource for channeling credits
to the industrial sector.
3.08      The provincial banks included in the project would promote the
credit line and would provide project preparation assistance to potential
subborrowers. They would assume the credit risk for loans and would provide
complementary funds where necessary.  BANADE would do the appraisal of sub-
projects for the provincial banks and charge a fee for this service. The
provincial banks would have the following obligations and duties: (i) assure
that BANADE's loan policies and regulations are observed; (ii) give their
approval in principle to subloans before they are submitted to BANADE for
appraisal; (iii) supervise the use of funds by the subborrower; (iv) issue
periodic reports on the progress of subprojects; (v) maintain records of sub-
loans; and (vi) comply with reasonable requests for information from BANADE.
3.09      BANADE has agreed that provincial banks participating in this
program would sign subloan agreements which would reflect their and BANADE's
responsibilities. The signing of such subloan agreements satisfactory to
the Bank would be a condition of disbursement for onlending those loan funds
allocated to provincial banks.

Technical Assistance
3.10      The technical assistance part of the project will consist of:
(a)  The study of the Argentine incentive system discussed in
paragraph 1.28.
(b)  Institutional support for the energy conservation program
discussed in paragraphs 3.04 to 3.06.
(c)  BANADE's manpower development plan and program discussed
in paragraph 2.10.
(d)  The design and installation of the management control and
information systems for BANADE discussed in paragraph 2.12.
Loan resources will be used for financing technical assistance costs for all
of the above items, except the energy conservation program and the effective
protection study of the Argentine industries which will be financed with the
Government's own resources. Project items will include studies, consultant
services, training and computer software programs.
C. The Proposed Loan
General Description
3.11      The proposed loan of US$100 million would finance the foreign
exchange component of projects in the industrial sector and technical assist-
ance to BANADE and INTI. The loan would be made to BANADE with the guarantee
of the Government of Argentina at the current bank interest rate of 11.6% p.a.
and the standard commitment fee on the undisbursed balance (3/4% p.a.). Loan
categories and onlending arrangements will be as follows:
Amount
US$ million
A.   BANADE loans to subborrowers and to provincial
banks (i.e., for onlending) for industrial
and mining subprojects.                                         89.5
B.   Industrial energy conservation subprojects.                     10.0
C.   Technical assistance and training.                               0.5
Total               100.0 million



- 38 -
3412       Bank funds for subprojects would finance the cost of imported
equipment and the foreign exchange component of locally manufactured equipment.
BANADE will relenid the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan either in the same
basket of currencies as the Bank loan with a spread of at least 2.5% to cover
administrative costs, or in dollars with a spread of at least 5% to cover
administrative costs and the cross currency risk.  If BANADE chooses to
onlend in the same basket cf currencies as the Bank loan it will first have
to furni sh the Banlk satisfactory repayment procedure for its subloans. The
proposed loan is expected to be committed by March 319 1984. and disbursed
by March 313 1986. Following standard DFC practice, the amortizatiorn of the
credit portion of the loan would conform to the aggregate of the amortizattian
schedules of individual subloans, subject to a maximum term of f ifteen years.
The technical assistance component of the loan would have a termt of 15 years,
with a three year grace period and a fixed amortization schedule.
Subloan Terms
3.13      Subloans from BANADE and the provincial banks would be for up to
fifteen years including a reasonable grace period not to exceed three years.
BANADE may adjust principal payments on Bank subloans for subberrow7ers using
funds from both the Bank loan and other external financing in order that th1v
aggregate principal payments by the subborrower may be approximately equaL,
Unless the Bank otherwise agrees, Bank loan funds for any one subproiece wzould
be limited to US$7 million if there were no other external financing includad
in the subproject.  Bank loan funds for a subproject could exceed US$7 rn   on
and be as much as US$12 million, provided that Bank loan funds over US$7
million would be matched by an equal or greater amount of external financing.
It is anticipated that this arrangement would encourage additional cofinancing.
As indicated in the preceding paragraph, subloans may be reloaned in the
disbursed basket of currencies, or in dollars. The interest and fee schedule
of provincial bank subborrowers would be no less than that established for
BANADE subborrowers. The provincial banks' repayment obligation would either
be in dollars or the disbursed basket of currencies, depending on the repay-
ment obligation of subborrowers.  Interest payable by the provincial banks to
BANADE on such loans will have a spread of at least 2.5% to cover BANADL'S
bearing of the cross currency risk on dollar denominated subloans. The spread
to cover BANADE's administrative costs would be negotiated by BANADE wti
provincial banks on a case by case basis.
Approval Limits
3.14      The requirements for the calculation of financial and economic rates
of return analysis for BANADE subprojects are described in para. 2.07. The
same requirements will apply to provincial bank subborrowers. The free limit
for subloans would be set at US$2.5 million, except that:  (i) BANIADE  il  submit
for the Bank's approval, the first two energy conservation subprojects and the
first two subprojects from any provincial bank; (ii) where there has been a
substantial change in effective protection since loan signing or the product
which would be produced by a subproject for which financing is being sought
the free limit would be reduced to US$500,000, The Bank would then revieu
the subproject to assure that it has a satisfactory economic rate of reuurn.
BANADE has agreed to advise the Bank when submitting subprojects for aorproval



- 39 -
of any measures the government has taken since loan signing which would
significantly increase effective protartion for the product which would be
produced by the subproject for which financing is being sought.
Retroactive Financing
3.15      Retroactive financing of up to US$5 million would be available
to finance equipment purchases for modernization subprojects made since
the date of approval of the loan by the Bank's Executive Directors. The
financing would be available for individual purchases of up to US$500,000
and will assist BANADE in meeting credit demand and in promptly initiating
the project.
Procurement and Disbursement
3.16      BANADE seeks to ensure the k.Lods and services it finances are suit-
able for the purpose intended, and reasonably priced taking into account
operation specifications, delivery time, availability of spare parts and
repair facilities and other relevent factors. BANADE requires, as indicated
in para. 2.07, that its borrowers receive three quotations in purchasing goods
financed by its loans, unless it is demonstrated that the obtaining of such
quotations is not feasible. A further administrative check is made by BANADE
on the reasonableness of prices, even after quotations are received using
comparative price lists. As noted in paragraph 2.07, BANADE will require
that for procurement of US$500,000 or more under the project sub-borrowers will
identify sources of supply on an international basis, as well as solicit
sufficient price quotations to assure efficient procurement. Disbursement of
funds from the loan for subprojects would be on the following basis: (a) 100%
of foreign expenditures for direct imports; (b) 60% of total expenditures of
foreign equipment purchased off the shelf; (c) 45% of total expenditures for
locally produced equipment for energy conservation subprojects; and (d) 30% of
total expenditures for locally produced equipment for all other subprojects.
The percentages for "'b"f, "c" and "d" represent estimated average foreign
exchange costs. Under the technical assistance component, the Bank would
disburse: (i) 75% of the cost of consultancy services and computer software;
and (ii) 100% of the training expenditures abroad.
Project Benefits and Risks
3.17      The proposed project would help support the Government's objective
of making the industrial sector in Argentina more efficient. It would do so
by financing the foreign exchange costs of credits for the purchase of equip-
ment to modernize industry, to expand and create new production, to assist
the mining industry and to aid industry in conserving energy. The loan will
stimulate cofinancing of US$200 million and loan funds will be used with
shorter term and higher interest commercial credits to finance high priority
subprojects. The joint use of funds will permit amortization schedules to be
established that will relieve subprojects of heavy service obligations during
their early years.



- 40 -
3.18      The loan will be of particular assistance to smaller and medium
industries, since many of the borrowers for equipment financinig are industries
of that size who find the purchase of such equipment essential to maintain
their competitive position in light of the availability of cheaper imported
goods. The project will provide institutional assistance to INTI to estab-
lish an industrial energy conservation program.  The energy audit surveys
conducted by INTI under the program will be the basis of obtaining credits
from BANADE to finance energy saving capital investments. Such investments
will not only make Argentina industry more efficient, but will have positive
effects on the balance of payments. Institutional assistance would also
be Drovided to BANADE in improving its management control and information
systems and developing its human resources. The loan will bring the resources
of provincial banks to bear in making development credits available to indus-
tries that might not otherwise be reached by BANADE.   It is anticipated that
the project will gererate 1,500 new jobs.  This figure is relatively low
because the equipment financing and energy conservation components of the
project will not generate net new employment and the new production and
expansion projects will be designed to be labor efficient so that their
products might be internationally competitive.
3.19      The project's major risk is that various pressures may cause the
government to retreat on its policy of maintaining an open economy and cause
it to return to a policy of high protection and subsidized credit for domestic
industry. If this were to happen, the objectives of the loan would be frus-
trated. The government has provided a letter to the Bank indicating its
intention to continue to support the development of efficient industry in
Argentina and the project provides the mechanism for the Bank and the govern-
ment to conduct a dialogue on this matter. Other risks in the project are
that the new program in industrial energy conservation and provincial banks
might run into start-up problems. These are normal risks for new programs and
are acceptable.
IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Agreements Reached
4.01      During negotiations agreements were reached with respect to the
matters described below.
(a)  Conditions of effectiveness for the loan are satisfactory
terms of reference and an assignment of personnel by the
Ministry of Industry for a study on effective protection
(1.28).
(b) Conditions of disbursement for individual loan components:
(i) A satisfactory agreement between BANADE and INTI would be
a condition of disbursement for the energy conservation
component (3.04);



- 41 -
(ii) The signing of a satisfactory agreement between BANADE and
a provincial bank would be a condition of disbursement of
loan proceeds for onlending to that provincial bank (3.09).
(c) Other agreements reached with BANADE were:
(i) New or expansion subprojects will have economic rates of
return calculated when they receive subloans over US$500,000;
financial rates of return would be calculated when such sub-
projects received subloans over US$100,000. Re-equipment or
modernization subprojects will have economic rates of return
calculated when they receive subloans over US$2 million;
financial rates of return will be calculated when such
subprojects receive subloans over US$500,000.  Economic
rate of return may be calculated on subprojects regardless
of size, if there has been a significant increase in effec-
tive protection in the product produced by the project (2.07).
(ii) The free limit for subloan approval would be US$2.5 million,
except that:
1.  BANADE will submit for the Bank's approval the first
two energy conservation subprojects and the first two
subprojects from any provincial bank (3.13); and
2.  Where there has been a substantial change in effective
protection since loan signing for the product which would
be produced by a subproject for which financing is being
sought, the free limit would be reduced to US$500,000
(3.13).
(iii) When submitting a subproject for Bank approval BANADE will
advise the Bank of any measures that the government has taken
since loan signing which would significantly increase effective
protection for the product which would be produced by the
subproject for which financing is being sought (3.14).
(iv) BANADE will relend the proceeds of the loan either in the same
basket of currencies as the Bank loan with a spread of at least
2.5% to cover administrative costs, or in dollars with a spread
of at least 5% to cover both administration costs and the
cross currency risk (3.12).
(v) Subloans from BANADE and the provincial banks would be for
up to fifteen years including a reasonable grace period
not to exceed three years (3.13).
(vi) Principal payments on BANADE subloans may be adjusted
so that total service payments may be approximately
equal on an annual basis when Bank funds are being used
with other external resources (3.13).



- 42 -
(vii) Bank loan funds for any one subproject are limited to US$7
million if no other external financing is used. Subloans
with Bank funds may go as high as US$12 million, provided
that amounts over US$7 million are matched by equal amounts
of external financing (3.13).
(viii)  Retroactive financing of up to US$5 million would be
available to finance purchases of up to US$500,000 (3.15)..
(ix) BANADE will have its accounts audited for year 1981 and
subsequent years by auditors satisfactory to the Bank
and will submit the audit to the Bank within six months
of the end of BANADE's fiscal year (2.52).
(x)  The government will take such measures as may be necessary
to maintain BANADE's equity in real terms (2.38).
(xi) A plan and a timetable for its implementation satisfactory
to the Bank for development of BANADE's manpower (2.10).
(xii)  A program and a timetable for its implementation satisfactory
ot the Bank for improving BANADE's management control anac
information system (2.12).
(xiii) Sub-borrowers will identify sources of supply on an inter-
national basis and solicit sufficient price quotations so
as to assure efficient procurement (2.07).
(d) It was agreed that the government would:
(i)  Require BANADE to take measures to maintain Its equity in
real terms (2.38);
(ii) Discuss the study on the industrial sector and its plan
of action with the Bank by mid-1982 (1.28); and
(iii) Require INTI to carry out an energy conservation program
(3.06).
B. Recommendations
4.02      With the above agreements reached, a Bank loan of US$100 millison is
recommended on terms and conditions outlined in Chapter III.

Attachment 1: Mining Promotion Law
1.        The mining promotion law (REGIMEN DE PROMOCION MINERA-LEY NO. 22095)
was approved by the Government of Argentina on October 26, 1979. It is intended
to promote the development of the mining sector through tax incentives, duty
exemptions, coordinating state and federal taxes and facilitating foreign
investments (in conjunction with the foreign investment law).
2.        The main objectives stated in the law are:
(a) to contribute to economic development through the increased
production of minerals;
(b) to ensure a rational utilization of mineral resources;
(c) to strengthen and to support the expansion of national
mining companies;
(d)  to ensure the development of mining activities related to
defense and national security;
(e) to develop employment, improve working conditions, living
standards and training of mine workers;
(f) to provide assistance to small and medium scale industry;
(g) to promote the development of national mining consultants;
(h) to supply the internal demand, through free trade at
international prices.
3.        The law is applicable to all companies operating in Argentina,
including subsidiaries and branches oiE foreign companies. The mining activi-
ties defined in the law include research, exploration, development and
exploitatior, of mineral products, beneficiation, smelting and refining. The
law explicitly excludes the following industrial activities: cement, ceramics,
hydrocarbons, non-metallic sands and ballast.
4.        The law provides for specific tax incentives which would be applied
on a wide basis to any company that qualifies under the law. These incentives
are. (a) all expenditures in exploration, research and technical assistance
and investments in fixed assets can be deducted from income taxes; and (b) a
full exemption of value added tax to the mining products, during the first
seven years of operation and after that, a partial exemption declining from
80% in year eight to 10% in year fifteen.

5.        The law also provides for additional incentives that should be
specifically approved by the government for each project. The additional
benefits that can be granted to any project under the law can include part
or all of the following:
(a)  full income and capital gains tax exemptions during the first
seven years of operations and declining from 80% on year eight
to 10% on year fifteen. Alternatively, payment of these taxes
can be deferred for up to five years with no interest payment
nor monetary adjustment for inflation;
(b) exemption of 100% of custom duties for imported equipment and
spare parts;
(c) local investors can defer for up to five years payment of taxes
derived from other activities, in amounts equivalent to equity
contributions to mining projects;
(d) a form of accelerated depreciation can be approved for specific
periods.

ARGENTINA - SECOND INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
Industrial Energy Conservation
1.        The industrial sector in Argentina consumed approximately 12 million
tons of oil equivalent in 1978. Of this amount, 49% was accounted for by
petroleum products, 24% by natural gas, 11% by electricity, 10% by biomass
fuels and 6% by coal. The use of gas was especially marked in energy inten-
sive industries such as cement, glass, ceramics, sugar and chemicals. The
consumption of biomass was principally accounted for by the sugar industry's
use of bagasse and one steel furnace use of charcoal. The use of coal was
limited to one steel company. Considering that industry accounted for 36% of
Argentina's total energy consumption, an improvement in the sector's energy
use efficiency could have significant balance of payments implications as
well as being one of the important ways in which industry can become more
competitive.
2.        An Energy Assessment of Argentina being undertaken by the
Secretariat of Planning with assistance of the US Department of Energy has
focussed government attention on energy conservation as one of the major
areas where action is required. One of the results of the Assessment has
been the establishment of the Directorate of Conservation within the
Secretariat of Energy in January 1981. A program of action for this
Directorate is going to be recommended by a study under the Bank's Refinery
Conservation Project (Loan 3264-AR). Another result of the Assessment has
been the collection of a detailed data base on energy use in industry. This
data base has permitted a Bank consultant to perform an estimate of the energy
conservation potential in the industrial sector.

This estimate suggests that industry's energy use efficiency can be increased
by approximately 15% through the introduction of a number of "good housekeeping"
practices and specific retrofit equipment that seem economically desirable
given current energy prices. The reduction in industrial energy costs implied
by those energy savings are estimated to be US$216 million/year. It was
further estimated that 36% of this conservation potential can be achieved by
1985 if an effective industrial energy conservation program is started in
1981. An effective conservation program would require a promotional campaign,
training workshops and approximately 500-600 energy audits to be performed
over the 1981-85 period. The estimated investment in retrofit equipment
required to achieve that level of implementation is about US$100 million.

ARGENTINA - SECOND INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Industrial (INTI)
1.        INTI was created in 1957 and currently is the principal public
institution in Argentina responsible for carrying out industrial research,
development and engineering. As such it is the most appropriate Argentine
institution to carry out the industrial energy conservation component of
the project. Although INTI is a decentralized entity under the Ministry
of Industry and Commerce, it is no longer financially autonomous. In 1980 the
0.25% tax on industrial credits from which INTI derived most of its income was
abolished. INTI will now receive an annual appropriation from the government
to carry out its activities. INTI does not expect this change to lead to a
reduction in its level of activities, only to a reorientation towards closer
support of national industrial policies.
2.        INTI's activities are carried out through a group of 8 central
laboratories and 26 research centers. The central laboratories are organized
according to academic disciplines such as chemistry, thermodynamics, construc-
tion and computation. The research centers specialize in industrial sub-
sectors such as pulp and paper, mining, dairy products, meat products, etc.
INTI's total staff numbers more than 1,500, out of which 27% are in the
central laboratories, 40% in the research centers and the rest in adminis-
trative departments. About 56% of INTI's total staff are professionals and
technicians engaged in research activities. The major portion of INTI's
facilities, including all the central laboratories, are located in Buenos
Aires, although there are research centers in Cordoba, Mendoza, Rosario, Mar
del Plata and Rio Negro.
3.         The principal function of the central laboratories is to carry out
applied research and provide consulting services to industrial firms which are
not specific to any particular industrial subsector. 1/ Several activities
they are now undertaking are closely related to the proposed energy conserva-
tion program. Among these are the thermodynamics lab's current studies on
combustion techniques in equipment, furnaces and boilers, boiler water treat-
ment, utilization of Argentine (Rio Turbio) coal and improvement of charcoal
production. The construction lab is also undertaking a series of tests on the
thermal behavior of building materials and fixtures such as plasters, windows,
panels and airconditioning units. Such tests and services are made available
to industry based on a fee system that reflects the direct and indirect costs
to INTI.
1/   In 1980 approximately 60% of the central lab's staff time was spent
on research and 40% on consulting services.

4.        The management of INTI has expressed a strong interest in establish-
ing an energy conservation unit that would serve the needs of industry. This
interest is supported by the Directorate of Conservation of the Secretariat of
Energy, and the Secretariat of Planning, who see INTI as the appropriate
institution to perform this service, both because of its strong links to
industry and the fact that it already possesses a substantial proportion of
the staff and lab facilities that would be necessary.
