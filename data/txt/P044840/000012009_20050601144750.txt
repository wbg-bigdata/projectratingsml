3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
(i) Help empower rural communities by strengthening their capacities to make decisions, organize, and
manage; and (ii) Improve the quality of basic social and economic services for rural populations in
Moldova, particularly the poor. (The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) did not indicate any order or
priority).

These objectives were fully consistent with the 1999 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Moldova and
the Government's priority. Moldova's economy was badly exposed when the shock wave from Russia hit
in August 1998. As a result, poverty had become a serious problem. The per capita income of about
US$500 made Moldova one of the poorest countries in Europe. In 1999, poverty incidence and extreme
poverty incidence were 71.2% and 61.3%, respectively.              As elsewhere in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), poverty rates in large cities had been lower than rates in small towns and among
the rural population. In this context, the project's rural focus was a valid and efficient poverty
targeting strategy. In addition, the Government, at both central and local levels, lacked the capacity to
implement poverty reduction programs because of delayed reforms in the social sectors, increased social
costs and limited resources.

3.2 Revised Objective:
No revision to the original objectives.

3.3 Original Components:
Component 1: Improved Delivery of Basic Services (US$15.0 million excluding contingency). This
component was meant to provide poor communities with small grants and technical assistance for the
implementation of microprojects (MPs), which would: (a) improve the delivery of basic social and
economic services; and (b) provide the communities with learning-by-doing opportunities to improve their
institutional capacity. Eligible types of MPs included construction and rehabilitation of kindergartens,
schools, local health posts, water supply systems, gas distribution systems, roads and bridges, sewage and
sanitation systems, cultural centers, reforestation, soil erosion control, and landslide rehabilitation.

Component 2. Strengthened Children's Social Development and De-institutionalization (US$0.35
million excluding contingency). Like Component 1, this component was also designed to support MPs, but
of different types, which would reach out to institutionalized children and provide them with alternative
care to state-run institutions.

Component 3. Capacity Building for Community and Local Government (US$1.15 million excluding
contingency). This component was designed to complement Component 1 by providing training and
technical assistance to community groups, local NGOs, local contractors, and local government, with the
objective to build skills and relationships, and foster new community-government partnerships in the
management of social and economic infrastructure beyond the scope of microprojects.

Component 4. Project Management Unit (US$1.38 million excluding contingency). This component was
to support salaries and wages of core MSIF staff and long-term consultants, limited office equipment and
operating costs.

The total baseline costs were estimated to be US$17.88 million (see Annex 3 of the PAD). In addition,
there were provisions for physical and price contingencies in the combined amount of US$2.01 million,
making the total project costs of US$19.89 million.

3.4 Revised Components:
No revision was made to the original component structure.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
No Quality at Entry (QAE) review was conducted by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG). However, this
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) rates the project's QAE as satisfactory, based on the following
considerations. First, the project's objective was fully consistent with the CAS of the time and the
Government priority to mitigate rural poverty. Second, the project design was in full compliance with the
Bank's safeguard policies. Third, the operational design of the project adequately reflected the lessons
learned from social investment funds (SIFs) in other countries as well as pilot implementation of the
Moldova Social Investment Fund (MSIF), which had been supported by the USAID, SIDA and PHRD. It
was also well designed and documented, as illustrated by the detailed description of Annex 7-10 of the
PAD, as well as the high-quality of the Project's operational manual. Finally, the commitment of the
Government at entry was adequately demonstrated by its sustained support of the pilot MSIF
implementation.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Highly Satisfactory - the Project's overall achievement surpassed its original objective as summarized
below:

l Strong post-MSIF community capacity (first development objective): Between 1999 and 2004, MSIF
    supported 479 microprojects (449 under Component 1, 30 under Component 2; PAD forecast was 233
    in total) in rural communities. These communities, without further MSIF interventions, initiated 950
    new projects and programs.
l Quality of basic services improved substantially (second development objective): Both quantitative and
    qualitative indicators strongly demonstrate that: (i) economic and social well-being of the beneficiary
    communities have improved both overtime (pre- and post-MSIF comparison) and in comparison to
    control groups; and (ii) community members are highly satisfied with improved facilities.

The assessment above is fully supported by two independent survey-based impact evaluation studies (2001
and 2004) as well as an independent cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis study (2004), and
consistent with the findings of the Bank supervision and ICR missions.                Another noteworthy
accomplishment that supports the "Highly Satisfactory" rating is the fast project implementation. The
credit (SDR 10.9 million) was fully disbursed ahead of schedule by April 13, 2004, more than seven
months before the closing date.

4.2 Outputs by components:
Component 1: Improved Delivery of Basic Services (Actual Costs: US$20.51 million) - Highly
Satisfactory
This component supported 449 microprojects throughout the rural areas in the country with nearly 700,000
direct beneficiaries. These far exceeded the original plan as described in the PAD, i.e. 223 microprojects
and 500,000 direct and indirect beneficiaries (using mid-point of PAD forecast, 500-4,000/microproject).

Four types of microprojects (school rehabilitation, water supply, gas supply and road) consumed
approximately 90% of MSIF investment resources. Priorities were given to smaller communities (with less
than 2,500 inhabitants), which were perceived to have higher infrastructure deficit and less capacity to
prepare proposals.




                                                    - 3 -

Other microproject selection criteria and processing mechanism were similar to other SIF in the region and
the rest of the world, and well enforced throughout project implementation. They included, among others:
(a) the minimum community contribution, set at 15% of the total microproject cost; (b) at least 30% of
community members to be the direct beneficiaries of the microproject (a measure to prevent
over-concentration of benefits on a small segment of the community); (c) key microproject-related
community decisions to be made at a meeting attended by at least 30% of the community's adult
population, with at least 40% of the attendants being women; and (d) the requirement to formulate a
beneficiary organization.

The impact evaluation surveys showed high percentages of beneficiary satisfaction, e.g. 89% of
beneficiaries satisfied with infrastructure investments, 86% with resulting service quality improvements,
83% with improved cooperation between the local authorities and people in the village, 81% with stronger
commitment of people to solve the problems of the village, and 84% with increased belief of the population
in their own efforts. Furthermore, 83% of representatives of local authorities, implementing agencies,
beneficiaries' associations and NGOs stated that the village acquired better organizational skills as a result
of their cooperation with MSIF.

These beneficiary perceptions are consistent with objective quantitative indicators. Several examples are:

l Increased winter-time average classroom temperature by 6.7 degrees Celsius (school rehabilitation)
l Decrease in mean daily absenteeism rate from 7.4% to 2.3% (school rehabilitation)
l Increased average household water consumption from 86 liters to 105 liters (water supply)
l Increased average household winter temperature by 1.3 degrees (gas supply)

Component 2. Strengthened Children's Social Development and De-institutionalization (Actual Costs:
US$0.35 million) - Satisfactory
The component supported 30 microprojects for community-based social care services, including
psychological counseling, medical and hygienic care, legal services, temporary placement of at risk
children, improved pedagogy, professional orientation and increasing public awareness, and improvement
of physical facilities and equipment. The primary beneficiaries under this component were approximately
2,400 children at-risk (i.e. children with special educational needs and/or disabilities), 958 parents and
teachers. The resulting impact of this component included the integration of 103 children in general
schools, re-unification of 195 children with their parents or extended families, and transfer of 34 children
from residential institutions back to the care of their original communities. The impact evaluation studies
have recorded high level of beneficiary satisfactions.

Component 3. Capacity Building for Community and Local Government (Actual Costs: US$1.29
million) - Highly Satisfactory
As originally planned, this component assumed critical support functions to Component 1 and the first
development objective. From the point of view of the beneficiaries, these two components (1 and 3) were
indistinguishable.   Training and TA were provided to approximately 27,800 beneficiaries, including
community members, local government officials, local NGOs and local contractors. The ultimate success
indicator of this component is the 950 post-MSIF projects initiated by the communities themselves (see the
2nd bullet under Section 4.1 above)

Component 4. Project Management Unit (Actual Costs: US$1.12 million) - Highly Satisfactory
As evidenced by the faster-than-plan project implementation (see Section 4.1 above) and the success of
substantive Components 1-3 above, project management was highly effective and efficient.

In addition, US$0.25 million was disbursed for PPF refinancing.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
According to the PAD, no detailed economic analysis had been carried out prior to project implementation,
due to the demand-demand driven nature of microprojects, their number and their small size. This was a
common practice for SIFs appraised in the 1990s. However, the PAD mentioned that pilot microprojects
did result in 2.6-20.5% savings of the pre-pilot cost estimates.

A more comprehensive and detailed ex-post economic analysis carried out in 2004 (see Annex 7 for
reference) estimated the overall economic rate of return of the MSIF to be about 10.8% (17.5%, according
to another analysis carried out for the PAD for MSIF II). This analysis was based on the assessment of the
four types of microproject in the table below, which represents 91.8% of the total MSIF investments.

                                      School        Gas         Roads      Water      Weighted
                                   rehabilitation systems                 systems     average
IRR                                    9.3%        21.3%        0.0        23.0%       10.8%
Share in the total investment         41.9%        27.0%       17.7%       5.0%        91.8%

The higher return on the gas and water systems is noteworthy as the number of directly benefiting
households is considerably large (167,965 and 65,945, respectively; or 33% of the total direct
beneficiaries). The return on school rehabilitation, in particular with respect to heating systems, is only a
very partial measure and probably under-estimated, as it does not capture the impact of these projects on
educational attainment and its future economic import. The return of roads projects may be greater once
traffic volumes have increased.

In terms of cost-efficiency, as in many other SIFs, MSIF has employed ceilings for cost-per beneficiary.
Where the characteristics of the intervention are known and the definition of beneficiary is strictly
controlled, this is a useful rule-of-thumb way of avoiding inappropriate technology choice and/or the
over-pricing of contracts. In addition, available evidences (see for example, two independent procurement
reviews 2001 and 2003 listed in Annex 7) suggest that the MSIF has robust, competitive contracting
procedures, which are based on a well-designed cost database. These factors are likely to have led to
effective cost control measures. This explains, at least partially, the gap between the PAD estimate of
average microproject cost (US$65,000 equivalent) and the average microproject cost (US$45,000
equivalent), which resulted in a larger number of microprojects (449 actual under Component 1 versus 223
planned).

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable - MSIF and its microprojects are not revenue generating activities.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
Rated Substantial. Institutional development is one of the two developmental objectives of the projects.
Therefore, the assessments in Section 4.1 as well as in Section 4.2 are directly applicable in this section. In
addition, MSIF itself also evolved from an organization without record of accomplishment into a major and
respected player in Moldova. As a result, the Government decided to extend and expand MSIF activities
through a larger follow-up IDA credit (Credit No. 3931-MD, SDR 13.8 million, US$20.0 million
equivalent), which was approved by the Board on June 17, 2004 and became effective on September 15th
of the same year.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Three factors affected the implementation and outcome of the project. The first was the volatile political
environment that led to the collapse of the previous coalition government with which the Credit Agreement
was signed and the decisive victory by the Communist Party of Moldova (CPM) in the 2001 elections. The
second was the increasing risks perceived by the donor community resulting from policy measures taken by
the CPM government that led to the suspension of the IMF program. The third was the volatile situation of
Transnistria, the eastern territory of Moldova controlled by a separatist government. While any of these
three factors could have devastating impact on the project, in hindsight, they were negligible.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Government continued commitment and support positively affected the project. In spite of the change
of government in 2001, there was no change in key MSIF staff members. During the initial phase of the
project, delays in VAT refund created significant problems with small local contractors, some of which
bankrupted as a result. Purchase of construction materials for MSIF microprojects was tax-exempted, but
contractors still had to pay VAT and then request refund from the state budget. However, the government
often delayed VAT refund due to fiscal constraints. This problem was corrected at a later stage of the
project.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Strong commitment and action within the implementing agency enabled the project to exceed PAD
expectations in practically all aspects as described in Section 4. The MSIF implementation management
was excellent.

5.4 Costs and financing:
The PAD estimated the total project cost as US$19.89 million, including SDR10.9 million (US$15.0
million equivalent at appraisal). The actual cost at project completion was US$23.52 million, including
US$14.36 million (smaller due to exchange rate fluctuations) from the IDA Credit. The SIDA support also
became slightly smaller than anticipated, US$0.74 million (US$0.51 million less). The resulting net
financing gap was filled by community counterpart funds as well as two additional grants that were
unforeseen at Board approval.         The first was a GBP 2.74 million DFID Grant (US$4.175 million
equivalent) approved on October 16, 2001 and the other, a US$0.8 million JSDF, approved on September
27, 2001.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Highly Likely. In terms of microprojects themselves, 454 user groups have been created and actively
managing the infrastructure renovated/constructed with the MSIF support. The impact evaluation studies
showed that post-MSIF ownership of microprojects by beneficiary communities remains strong, and that
adequate measures were taken for maintenance and operation.               In terms of community and local
government capacity, a large number of post-MSIF initiatives (see Section 4) taken at the local level and
resulting success stories indicate that the project impact is highly likely and long lasting.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Inspired by the success of the project, the Government initiated a larger repeater project, the Moldova:
Social Investment Fund II Project with a US$20.0 million equivalent IDA credit. This new project was
approved by the Board on June 17, 2004 and became effective on September 15th of the same year.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
Highly Satisfactory. The Bank was instrumental in: (a) transferring worldwide and regional experience of
SIFs, (b) transferring the experience of Romania and Lithuania in the social inclusion of at-risk children
and families; (c) mobilizing PHRD (US$368,500), PPF (US$500,000) and USAID technical assistance
(US$500,000) to support project preparation, including a pilot-testing of microprojects; (d) mobilizing
SIDA support (US$716,000 equivalent) for Component 2; and (e) mobilizing the support of Soros
Foundation, UNICEF, EU TACIS and Save the Children. The knowledge transfer was a critical success
factor of the project because Moldova had no experience in SIF-like programs prior to this project. The
Bank team's skill/experience mix and budget (US$317,870 total during FY1996-1999) were adequate.
Risk identification and the design of mitigation measures were also candid and appropriate.

7.2 Supervision:
Satisfactory. Regular supervision missions (at the pace of twice a year) and the mid-term review were
effective in providing adequate technical assistance with respect to key implementation issues, including
M&E, microproject sustainability, and linkages to broader social sector issues. There was no deviation
from Bank safeguard policies and procedures. The Bank team's skill/experience mix was adequate and the
supervision budgets were in line with the norm of the ECA region. The Bank continued to be instrumental
in mobilizing other donor support, including DFID (US$4.175 million equivalent) and JSDF (US$979,500
for microprojects in Transnistria) to support the MSIF implementation.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Satisfactory. The Government fulfilled its commitment to and ownership of the project by establishing the
MSIF as an autonomous public organization under the office of the Vice Prime Minister. Also, during
project preparation, the Government established the National Steering Committee (NSC, later National
Board) to involve and reflect the views of broad-based stakeholders. The NSC was chaired by the Vice
Prime Minister and participated in by representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy
and Reforms, the NGO sector and the donor community. The Government support of the PPF/PHRD
implementation was satisfactory.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
Highly Satisfactory. In spite of the change of Government and administrative reforms in 1999-2000 and
2003, the Government maintained its strong commitment to the MSIF implementation.                Key staff
appointments were timely.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
Highly Satisfactory.     The highly successful project implementation (see Section 4) speaks for the
performance of the MSIF as the implementation agency.          The MSIF has supported twice as many
microprojects as originally planned, and even more admirably faster than the original plan without any
major qualitative and technical deficiency.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Highly Satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

The SIF is a tried-and-proven type of project. Consequently, there are no radically new lessons that the
MSIF experience can provide to practitioners, researchers and international community. However, the
following elements would be noteworthy.

l Coalition building pays off.         From identification to project completion, the MSIF was active in
    coalition-building between and within communities, local and national governments, private
    contractors, NGOs and donor communities. As a result, the Government's strong commitment and
    donor support were uninterrupted and even increased in spite of the political turmoil and change of
    government in 2001 (see Section 5).             This ultimately contributed to the highly satisfactory
    implementation of the project.
l Good and well-balanced operations management was a key to effective implementation.
    Technically and conceptually, the MSIF possess no feature that had not been tried elsewhere in the
    Region or the World. Its poverty targeting mechanism, for example, was rather rudimentary for
    today's standard. The Operational Manuals were well written, but not necessarily the best in the
    world. However, what the MSIF exceled is that all functions within its operation were very well
    balanced--nothing was overdone, but there were no noticeable weak links in its organization and
    operation either, resulting in a high level of efficiency and effectiveness.
l Strong focus on building community-based organizations and their networks is a key to
    sustainable institution development at the community level.            This approach is already common
    among Latin American SIFs, but has been under-utilized in Europea and Central Asia (ECA). The
    MSIF has proven the validity of this approach through its active support of the strengthening of CBOs
    and their networks through the provision of information and resource centers.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Text below was extracted from the Executive Summary Section of "Borrower's contribution to ICR:
Implementation Completion Report", dated January 31, 2005 (full report in Annex 8).

The MSIF project had the following objectives, which have been achieved: help empower rural
communities by strengthening their capacities to make decisions, organize and manage; improve the
quality of basic social and economic services for poor rural population; and provide improved
conditions for the social development of children at risk. For this, an IDA credit (15 million USD)
and about USD 10 million of grants were used.

The project obtained the following major results. 479 microproject were implemented with and
amount USD 20.5 million, out of which 189 schools, 116 gas pipelines, 77 roads, 30 children social
development centers and 27 water pipelines. Significant impact was achieved in area of energy
conservation and rehabilitation of heating system. In 300 microprojects (Schools, gas projects,
Children social development centers) estimated savings from heating systems maintenance if about
120 000 USD per season.

Significant results were obtained in community development. About 27 800 persons obtained from
MSIF training and TA. The institutionalization measures led to creation of 454 Community Based
Associations,   grouped     in   4   Beneficiaries    Networks,    acting   countrywide through   17
community-based information centers. This led to strong sustainability: 59% of microprojects were
further extended, and other 950 new projects and programs were started without MSIF support
after MSIF intervention

Activities toward the children social development objective have led to creation of 30 centers

providing alternative social care services and led to changes in public opinion, legal framework and
better understanding of the problem of children at risk.

The general conclusion of the report is that the project was successful; its experience should be
studied and replicated at the state level.

(b) Cofinanciers:
No official comments were received.          However, the Impact Evaluation Study (2004) conducted
semi-structured interviews with representatives of the Soros Foundation, SIDA, UNICEF, DFID and
UNDP, and the recorded comments were generally supportive of the MSIF.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

1. Participatory methodology and the economic rationality of MPs

In Social Investment Fund projects, which make small investments in social infrastructure, it is not
normally customary to conduct rigorous cost-benefit analysis of each individual MP, due to the high costs
of such analysis. The key mechanism used to ensure economic rationality is the direct involvement of the
beneficiaries in the prioritization of the investment. This should enable the practical expression of a
legitimate "social preference function" in each beneficiary community.

In line with this, the key element in the MSIF's project design that seeks to ensure economic rationality in
MP choice is the Fund's participatory methodology, which aims to ensure that the investment funded by the
MSIF responds to the community's priority needs. Evidence (presented above) from the 2000 impact
evaluation study has shown that MSIF generally manages to invest in areas perceived to be high priority
for the community.

If this is achieved, so long as the community has good knowledge of the costs and benefits of different
interventions, it is unlikely that the chosen MPs will report poor rates of return. This would only be likely
to arise if there were no MPs available to the community that had acceptable rates of return. Given the
collapse over the past decade of mechanisms to support rural communities' basic infrastructure services,
this is unlikely to be the case in most villages in Moldova.

2. A simplified methodology for Cost Benefit Analysis

Conducting a full-blown CBA is a complex and costly process, which cannot easily be carried out by local
consultants on limited budgets. For this reason, and taking into account the small scale of the MSIF
investments, it is appropriate to use a simplified methodology for the CBA to be carried out by local
consultants, which respects the main principles of the analysis while avoiding spurious complexity. The
key elements of the proposed methodology are the following:

    l Specification of the MP's goals;
    l Clarifying exactly what difference(s) the MP will make through the specification of "with MP" and
         "without MP" scenarios;
    l Identification of the costs and benefits of the MP;
    l Identification of who pays the costs and who derives the benefits;
    l Calculation of net present value and internal rate of return of the MP, based on costs and benefits
         whose value can be expressed in monetary terms; and
    l Analysis of sustainability considerations (Is provision for operation and maintenance costs
         adequate to guarantee the robustness of the benefit stream?).

4. Choice of numeraire and shadow price adjustments

One of the most complex technical aspects of economic cost-benefit analysis is the choice of numeraire and
the adjustment from market prices to economic costs. It is recommended that the Cost Benefit analysis be
conducted in local currency (lei) at the national price level, in constant lei of the year the MP was built,
using the prices registered in the MSIF databases. It is further recommended that no shadow price
adjustments be made to the MP costs as calculated by MSIF. Thus, foreign exchange, material inputs and
labor will continue to be valued at their contracted prices. In some circumstances, these short cuts could
lead to important distortions in the rate of return estimates. However, in this case, the simplification is
justified, for the following reasons:

   l Following the liberalization process of the 1990s, which reduced average tariff protection to 7.5%
         (EIU, 2003), there are few remaining distortions in the macroeconomic environment and tax
         structure in Moldova. Indirect taxes are levied through VAT at a general rate of 20%, with limited
         exceptions for basic consumption goods.
   l There is no clear evidence that the exchange rate is either over or under-valued. There was



                                                      - 14 -

         considerable real exchange rate appreciation in the mid nineties, followed by a sharp depreciation
         after the 1998 Russian financial crisis. Since then, the rate has stabilized and shown no clear
         upward or downward trend. There is a large trade deficit and an important, but smaller, current
         account deficit, which would suggest that the exchange rate might still be over-valued in real terms.
         On the other hand, although the last three years have seen significant real wage appreciation,
         Moldovan labor remains very cheap in terms of dollars per hour, which suggests that real exchange
         rate depreciation might not be needed.
   l Imports used by MSIF MPs are tax-free and - as explained in Section 3 - the MSIF's cost
         estimates exclude VAT, which is the only indirect tax or subsidy likely to affect the prices of the
         program's inputs. None of the inputs to the MSIF's investments benefits from significant subsidies.
   l Ideally, since there is close to 10% real unemployment (according to ILO estimates), the cost of
         unskilled labor should be adjusted to reflect its economic opportunity cost. Where there is
         widespread unemployment, this is normally lower than the market price. However, these
         calculations need to reflect local labor market conditions in the place where the investment takes
         place. National conditions are not necessarily a reasonable proxy for local realities in this regard.
         Even if the necessary data were available, the calculation of a shadow price for labor in each place
         where MSIF invests is not feasible in the framework of the present consultancy. It should also be
         borne in mind that this adjustment, if made, would tend to increase the economic rate of return of
         the MSIF investments. Therefore, the rates of return calculated based on the full labor cost of the
         investment budgets can be considered lower-bound estimates of the real profitability of the MPs.

For these reasons, the recommended methodology for MSIF cost-benefit analysis is limited to the
calculation of rates of return based on the prices in lei paid by MSIF.

5. Cost data

A rate of return analysis requires information on direct costs of the investment and the future cost stream
(operation and maintenance costs) related to the "with MP" and "without MP" scenarios. The availability
of information determines which cost variables can be included in the analysis. Fortunately, data on the
cost of investment is always available and the streams of operation and maintenance costs can normally be
determined. The MSIF has detailed information on all MPs' investment costs (direct, contractors overhead,
community contributions, supervision, and MSIF overhead costs). However, data on maintenance costs for
the operation period is not kept in MSIF. These should be gathered from direct community-level interviews
and secondary sources.

6. Benefits

The rehabilitation of social infrastructure by MSIF generates two sorts of benefits: increased flows of
services to the users, and (often) significantly reduced future operation and maintenance costs associated
with the pre-existing level of service provision.
The valuation of future cost savings that are achieved due to an investment to upgrade a building can be
quite straightforward. For example, investments to improve insulation and heating systems may lead to big
savings in future heating bills, which can easily be quantified. If the flow of savings (discounted to a
present value using a reasonable discount rate) is sufficient to pay back the initial investment, it can easily
be shown that this sort of investment is economically rational.

In contrast, the economic valuation of the increased service flow can be more difficult, depending on the
availability of information. For example, the value of an improved road will depend on the reduction in the
cost of journeys (including wear and tear on vehicles, travelers' time, and fuel costs) together with the (net)
value of the additional journeys undertaken due to the road improvement. Similarly, the valuation of
cheaper and more abundant supplies of water and gas will depend on the reduction in costs and increase in
the volume consumed; the latter will depend on the users' price-elasticity of demand for these commodities
(which also determines the "consumer surplus" associated with the increased consumption).

It can be seen that in each of these cases, the analysis requires data for the level of demand and unit costs
and prices of the service before the MP was undertaken to enable a comparison with the situation that
prevails after it was completed. In the absence of baseline data of this sort, it is difficult to make a precise
estimate of the benefit stream.

The value of the improved educational attainment that results from improved learning environments in
schools will depend on its impact on the future productivity of children who are being educated. If we know
the impact of our MP on probable educational attainment, the economic value of the benefit can be
estimated by analysis of databases that contain data on educational attainment and wages. However,
assigning value to these benefits can be a difficult task, especially when there are uncertainties about the
country's economic future.

information to be used. The term "Community sample" refers to a small MP sample to be visited for the
purpose of the present study.

MSIF MPs; this will be further developed with an increased sample to be undertaken by the local
consultants.

7. School Building Upgrading

The MPs financed energy conservation works to establish a satisfactory insulated envelope (changing
windows, repairing of walls, ceilings and roofs). They rehabilitated school's heating equipment, replacing
obsolete furnaces and boilers and constructing new, appropriate, and adjoining to the heated buildings
boiler stations.

The goal of these MPs is to improve the learning environment, making schools more comfortable and
attractive places for students and teachers, increasing attendance rates and improving academic outcomes.
Rehabilitated heating facilities produce a substantial reduction in heating costs. With the MP, the learning
environment is made acceptable, heating costs are lowered, usable areas are increased and attendance rates
are improved. Without the MP, the schools would continue as they are, incurring the historically registered
heating costs and achieving a deficient learning environment in the winter months. Parts of the buildings
would continue to be unusable, and staff and student attendance rates would continue to be affected by
aversion to the cold. The findings suggest that these MPs have a high economic return on investment and
one of them can be justified exclusively from the savings achieved in fuel consumption of the heating
system. The following school rehabilitations have been taken as case studies:

The conclusion that can be drawn from Table 3 is that the MSIF should be giving preference to the
rehabilitation of schools that include repairs of the heating system (IRR is greater than 10% for them).
However, this should not be a fixed rule, because one has to keep in mind that energy conservation works
are essential and in these cost-benefit analyses, many of the benefits are left out because they are not easily
quantified. If the budget permits, i.e. it does not exceed the $75,000 limit and the community contribution
amount is enough, modernization of the heating units is more than appropriate.

8. Gas systems

The MSIF finances the connection of villages to the national gas distribution system through the
installation of pipelines and pressure reduction plants. It may also finance the distribution network in the
village, but not the household connections from the final pressure reduction point, which are paid for by the
residents. All MSIF gas MPs connect the village school immediately. The extent of the local distribution
network that can be funded depends on the distance of the village from the main distribution system, which
determines what proportion of the investment cost ceiling of $75,000 allowed by MSIF will be needed to
establish the primary connection. Villages that connect to the system become clients of the gas distribution
company and pay the user tariff.

The goal of these MPs is to give public and private buildings in the village access to gas as a source of
power for heating and cooking. Piped gas is a much cheaper source than the alternatives of bottled gas,
coal and firewood, and has fewer environmental negatives. With the MP, the village's buildings are
progressively connected to the gas system, allowing the adoption of gas technology for heating and cooking,
producing reduced unit costs and increased consumption of heat. Without the MP, the status quo of
expensive and dirty solid fuels is continued, and the consumption of heat and expenditure on fuel remain
unchanged. The following gas supply system MPs have been taken as case studies:

It can be seen from Table 4 that MPs involving individual households have higher IRR. These MPs in fact
imply substantial additional investment from beneficiaries in order to be connected to the supply network
and to benefit from the natural gas advantages.

9. Water supply systems

The MSIF finances the construction and rehabilitation of water systems. A typical MP includes the
establishment of a supply from an artesian well, including sleeving and installation of an adequate pump
and as needed, chlorination capacity, the building of a primary distribution line to the village and the
building of the local distribution network within the village. As with gas MPs, the amount of money
available for the latter depends on the cost of the well and primary line, but the MSIF requires that at least
1/3 of the population can immediately be connected, which is a good guarantee that there will be an
immediate benefit flow. Households must pay the cost of the household connection to the system and pay a
user tariff to cover the operation and maintenance of the system.
The goal of these MPs is to provide the village with an improved water supply. With the MP, villagers
have access to an increased volume of good quality water delivered under pressure through a network to
household connections, allowing increased consumption and reduced cost in time and money. This will have
benefits for household economies and for health conditions. Without the MP, villagers use water from
community wells or buy it from water carriers. The following water supply system MPs have been taken as
case studies:

Table 5 shows a considerable variation in the returns of water MPs according to the zones where they are
built. It is not surprising that the return is higher in areas where there are insufficient surface water sources.
However, the results show also that the return can be high in areas where there are sufficient water sources.
Therefore, MSIF should keep executing these types of MPs.

10. Rural roads

The MSIF is the only agent helping municipalities to rehabilitate or to build new access roads to rural
communities. The central government is taking care of the primary road network, and secondary roads, but
financial limitations do not allow them to take care of all roads. The technical specifications of roads built
with MSIF funds are determined within cost benefit reasoning, taking account of projected vehicle flows. If
traffic volume is expected to increase, roads are built wide enough to accommodate the expected flow. The
roads vary from one community to other, but in general are gravel roads (75%). In 25% of cases, paved
roads (with asphalt cement) are built ­ but this doubles the cost per kilometer.

The goal of these MPs is to improve access to the beneficiary communities, reducing the cost and time
taken to reach the rest of the country, including markets and services. Without the MP, often, communities
have access roads that are difficult or impossible to travel in rainy conditions or during the winter. Journeys
are costly and slow and the volume of traffic is low. With the MP, travel becomes faster and cheaper,
public transport services are established or improved in frequency, private cars can travel more cheaply,
and in response to this reduce cost, the traffic volume increases. The village becomes more attractive for
investors and villages can more easily access the social and economic services in nearby towns. The
following rural road MPs have been taken as case studies:

             Type             MP       Village             Raion                         IRR     Subtype average
             R1               526      Antonesti           Stefan Voda                   0.0%

Table 6 shows low IRR for road MPs, but one cannot conclude that these MPs represent a bad investment
for Moldova because many of the benefits are not easily quantified. On the other hand, there is not a good
transport study showing the increase in future traffic due to induced demand caused by better roads, or by
improvement of the country's economy, which seems to be very likely in the future. However, MSIF will
want to study in detail each road MP and decide whether to execute them or not, perhaps only when the
benefits are clear or when an entire large community is demanding the MP, that a quick analysis should be
sufficient (if a sufficient large population demands a road, this one must have a high return, even if the
benefits can not be quantified).

11. Average Return of MSIF MPs

Having the average IRR for each subtype one can calculate the weighted average IRR for each major type
of the MPs:

The MPs considered so far account for more than 90% of all investment, so an approximation for the an
average rate of return (for this sample) of MSIF MPs taken into consideration, their respective weights on
total investment, would be around 10.8% (Table 8).

The higher return on the creation of gas and water systems is noteworthy as the number of benefiting
households is considerable. The return on the investment in schools heating systems is only a very partial
measure, as it does not pick up the impact of these MPs on educational attainment and its future economic
import. The return of roads MPs will likely be satisfactory if traffic volumes will increase sufficiently and
the investment reduces the cost of journeys significantly in a sustainable way.

                                               Executive summary

      The MSIF project had the following objectives, which have been achieved: help empower rural
 communities by strengthening their capacities to make decisions, organize and manage; improve the
 quality of basic social and economic services for poor rural population; and provide improved
 conditions for the social development of children at risk. For this, an IDA credit (15 million USD) and
 about USD 10 million of grants were used.

      The project obtained the following major results. 479 microproject were implemented with and
 amount USD 20.5 million, out of which 189 schools, 116 gas pipelines, 77 roads, 30 children social
 development centers and 27 water pipelines. Significant impact was achieved in area of energy
 conservation and rehabilitation of heating system. In 300 microprojects (Schools, gas projects, Children
 social development centers) estimated savings from heating systems maintenance if about 120 000 USD
 per season.

      Significant results were obtained in community development. About 27 800 persons obtained from
 MSIF training and TA. The institutionalization measures led to creation of 454 Community Based
 Associations, grouped in 4 Beneficiaries Networks, acting countrywide through 17 community-based
 information centers. This led to strong sustainability: 59% of microprojects were further extended, and
 other 950 new projects and programs were started without MSIF support after MSIF intervention

      Activities toward the children social development objective have led to creation of 30 centers
 providing alternative social care services and led to changes in public opinion, legal framework and
 better understanding of the problem of children at risk.

      The general conclusion of the report is that the project was successful; its experience should be
 studied and replicated at the state level.

 I.   Introduction

     Since the break-up of the Soviet Union Moldova has been undergoing a difficult transition period.
 Moldova faced drastic GDP declines, serious unemployment and under-employment problems, and the
 vast majority of the population has experienced a drastic decline in their living standards. Deteriorating
 social conditions have been exacerbated by the dramatic collapse of Moldova's agricultural and
 industrial base due to the loss of traditional markets for goods and sources for production inputs. Under
 these conditions the provision of basic needs for population and support to prevent further deterioration
 of the infrastructure is very important.



                                                  - 27 -

     To address these needs, the Government of the Republic of Moldova, by its resolution has decided in
1997, to set up Moldova Social Investment Fund (MSIF) as an independent public organization. The
National Board (NB) composed of 5 representatives of donor countries and 5 representatives of the
Government, Parliament and science supervised MSIF's activities.

     Main milestones of MSIF activity are the following. The pilot phase of MSIF started in November
1997. The World Bank Mission assessed the MSIF project during September-October 1998, and the
credit negotiations between the Government of Moldova and the World Bank took place in December
1998. The Credit Agreement was signed in March 1999. In June 1999, the Parliament of Moldova
ratified the project. In November 2004MSIF Project has been finished.

     The pilot stage of the MSIF Project was financed mainly from Grants offered by the Governments
of USA, Sweden and Japan, the total amount of which was US$ 1,368,000. The total project cost was
approximately US$ 26 million, including US $15 million IDA credit, Swedish Krona 6 million SIDA
grant, GBP ·2.744 million United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (DFID) Grant, US$
1.8 million ­ 2 grants from JSDF. Rural communities contributed with US$ 2,4 million.

II.   Assessment of Project Objectives, design, implementation and operational experience

1.    Original objectives

      Objectives of the project were related with the social-economic situation of the country at the
moment of project's design. The project was designed to support public sector reform with a renewed
focus on poverty alleviation, in part through improved coverage and targeting of social services to the
poor. This was concordant to the strategy of longer-term structural reforms in the social sectors. The
main sector issues included: i) serious and growing poverty and inequality, especially in rural
populations and among vulnerable groups; ii) deterioration of public services and poor targeting of
social assistance; iii) need for fundamental structural reforms in health and education; and iv) lack of
capacity at the central and local government levels to implement poverty reduction programs.

      According to the investigations done in 1997, the poorest group in the country was rural
population. According to the WB researches, In August 1997, per capita consumption in rural areas was
only 75 percent of that in urban areas with the poorest 20 percent of the population in rural Moldova
consuming about 73 percent of the corresponding consumption of the urban poor. Similarly, only 6.7
percent of the population in Chisinau was found to be relatively poor, compared to 17.2 percent of the
population of other cities, and 21.1 percent of the rural population [4].

      Thus, the objective of MSIF project was to contribute to the provision of improved living
conditions for the poor rural population in Moldova through:

1.    Help empower rural communities by strengthening their capacities to take decisions, organize, and
manage;
2.    Improve the quality of basic social and economic services for poor rural populations in Moldova.

     The poorest communities were achieved through a special targeting mechanism. Between the
regions, the funds were distributed on the per-capita basis, proportionally to rural population in the
region. Inside the region, poorest villages had priority. The level of poverty was measured by means of
two approaches. First approach included a set of poverty criteria (village size, remoteness from national


                                                 - 28 -

roads/ railways, percentage of households with piped water and gas, percentage of vulnerable
population, percentage of natural growth during the last 5 years, etc.). The second approach included
only the villages' size, because studies shown a significant difference in social infrastructure in villages
with population over 2500 and those with a population under 2500 inhabitants. The second approach is
simpler, is objective and easier to explain to communities.

    The implementation of MSIF project has shown that these objectives were correctly set out, and
achieved. The project really contributed to the public sector reform and improvement of the life's quality
in rural communities.

2.    Revised objectives

       After the project appraisal, SIDA has agreed to participate in MSIF implementation in order to
contribute to children social development and de-institutionalization in Moldova. A new small
component was designed to meet the objective:

       Provide improved conditions for the social development of children at risk and disabled
children through

·     Creation of patterns of alternative care for the children at risk, including children with disabilities
·     Prevention of abandonment and institutionalization of children
·     Re-integration of children at risk in their families and society

    The area of activity was countrywide and not only in rural area, because the children at risk and
(especially) their institutions are concentrated mainly in the urban area. The main goal of the new
component was to pilot new models of social services for children at risk, and to increase the awareness
of public opinion and government agencies toward the problems of the children at risk.

    Due to the complexity of the problem addressed and incomparably small time frame and funds
available, the expectations in this area were modest: although this component appeared in the project
design, the objective of this component was not set up at the project's objective level. The main goal of
the CSD component was the piloting rather than expectation of significant results. The expected impact
was the understanding of the processes and models working in this area and not significant changes in
the life of the children at risk.

3.    Design

    The above-mentioned objectives were achieved through the following project's components:

·     Improved delivery of basic services. The villages with stringent needs in social and economic
infrastructure rehabilitation were the main beneficiaries.
·     Strengthen Children Social Development and de-institutionalization. The children at risk
together with their adult supervisors were the main beneficiaries.
·     Capacity Building for Communities and Local Governments. The passive communities and local
authorities formed the main group of beneficiaries.
·     Project Management Unit. The MSIF office, which is aimed to implement activities, planned and
thus led to the achievement of the stated objectives.

4.   Implementation and operational experience

Component 1. Improved Delivery of Basic Services

      This component presumed to achieve the objective to improve basic services through the
implementation of community level microprojects of two major types: (i) infrastructure microprojects
and (ii) non-infrastructure microprojects.

        (i) The types of infrastructure microprojects that the MSIF financed included:

        1. Social Infrastructure: Rehabilitation of pre-school and school facilities, including building
        repairs, hygiene facilities, sanitation, cold and/or hot water supply, roof repairs, energy
        conservation, efficient space utilization and consolidation and procurement of minor equipment
        and supplies; rehabilitation of foster homes, old age homes, centers for street children and
        children at risk, which are organized by communities;

        2. Economic Infrastructure: Rehabilitation and construction of local (community) level
        potable water networks: supply lines, distribution networks, source development, construction
        of new artesian wells and pumping stations; construction of new and extension of gas supply
        systems; rehabilitation of community-based irrigation networks; rehabilitation of village or
        neighborhood roads, access roads to isolated villages, access roads to agricultural lands and
        farms (including bridges, drainage, culverts, retaining walls, etc.);

        3. Sanitation and Environmental Infrastructure:                    Rehabilitation and expansion of
        local/community level sewage networks, and pumping stations; environmental improvement and
        rehabilitation through tree planting and cleaning up; erosion control activities (tree planting,
        terracing, drainage canals) on public lands.

        (ii) The types of non-infrastructure microprojects that MSIF might finance included:

1.   Introduction of new child education programs for pre-schools and schools (e.g. Step by Step
program, including teachers training);
2.   Community health information/education programs, including community workshops on safe
motherhood, family planning, nutrition, water and sanitation etc.;
3.   Training of FAP staff in primary health care (e.g. CDD, ARI, pre-natal care etc.);

        The following major outputs were achieved under this component.

        During the project activity, 906 microproject proposals have been received under this
component, out of which 449 were successfully implemented, and 60 were rejected because there were
not met the preliminary appraisal criteria. The maximal allowed microproject budget was 75 000 USD,
while the average budget constituted 43 000 USD. Although the amounts were apparently small, due to
the efficient use of market prices and procurement mechanisms, villages received a significant help in the
rehabilitation of their infrastructures. The main results are given in the table below.

        The table shows that major investments were channeled to schools rehabilitation. Due to demand
driven nature of the project, this structure of typologies reflects the most stringent needs of the country
and the understanding by the communities of their needs. Traditionally, the Moldovan communities pay


                                                  - 30 -

significant attention to improve the health and the learning conditions for children, fact which explains
the highest percentage (44.4%) of investments made in schools rehabilitation. In all schools rehabilitated
with MSIF support, there were implemented new educational programs "Step by Step" for primary
classes. Other 5 schools, without MSIF school rehabilitation microproject, committed and implemented
"Step by Step" programs.

Remark. Microprojects under Children Social Development (USD 1,177 million) are described in the next
compartment.

      It is important to highlight that communities contributed financially to project implementation. The
average community contribution under this component was 16,35% (while the planned minimal
contribution was 15%).

      A significant impact was achieved in the area of energy conservation of rehabilitated facilities. In
all the schools rehabilitated with MSIF support, the consumption of fuel decreased several times, which
lead to significant savings. The case study attached in Annex 1 gives a picture of such an impact. An
estimate analysis of 300 rehabilitated heating systems (in schools, gas projects and CDS centers) has
shown that the savings after the implementation of these microprojects during only one heating season
constituted 1,6 mln Moldovan leys (before rehabilitation ­ it was necessary 2.4 million leys per season,
after rehabilitation ­ 0.8 million leys). The temperature in classrooms has increased from 11-13 Co
degrees to 18-20 degrees.

      Surveys conducted [1,2,3] show that one of most important impacts achieved by the project was
the psychological help to the rural population. At the moment when the project started, the complicated
economic situation thwarted population's hope in their capacity to survive. The project implementation
has lead to increment of population's trust in their future. Population is satisfied with the
implementation of the project: 89% of the respondents according with the survey conducted in 2000 and
94% - according with the survey from 2004 mentioned their satisfaction with rehabilitated facilities and
improved services. Many of these answers contained an emotional load. For example [1], a notable
answer from A.I. Cuza village (Rehabilitation of school): "You don't probably realize what a holy act
you did. This school that costs millions of lei in some years could be completely destroyed. Now the
process of destruction is stopped. The sports hall will now unite many young people, who until now,
since they did not have any activity started to drink alcohol. I believe that some of them will stop
drinking and the younger ones will not take the road of drinkers. Even the presence of the
construction men who worked even in winter time, under winds and frost, is an example of how one
should work. I myself am a construction man and I believe that the contractor has done a great job
under difficult conditions". Another example from the latest survey [3]: "It is just as somebody has



                                                 - 31 -

made a gift to us. It is like a gift from God. The help was huge, as we could never have done it by
ourselves. We are very thankful for this to the investment fund"

Strengths:
-     MSIF activity has covered all the country, 610 000 persons (26.6% of rural population) have
directly benefited (to compare with 11% of targeted beneficiaries) from MSIF activity, and other 140
000 ­ indirectly. This number continues to increase, because the communities extend the microprojects
(water and gas pipes, roads). Out of 286 villages monitored in December 2003, in 168 (59%)
communities the microproject has been extended by themselves.

-     The population was highly involved in the microproject's implementation. The total amount of
community contribution was approximately USD 2.4 million. 590 000 persons have been involved in
decision-making through 1332 general community meetings (according to surveys, 98% respondents
considered the rehabilitated facilities as being the most stringent problem in their community). Demand
driven approach, with involvement of population in decision-making and financial contribution, has
guaranteed that the most stringent community problem in the most efficient way is solved, thus
contributing directly to poverty alleviation.

-     The technical audits mentioned the high quality of civil works in MSIF supported microprojects
and very efficient use of funds. Significant economic effectiveness has been obtained in energy
conservation and rehabilitation of heating systems.

Weaknesses:
-     The underdeveloped civil construction market (the majority of qualified civil workers has left the
country) has caused a significant number of problems, especially in buildings rehabilitation typologies
(schools, kindergartens). The first one consists of low skills of civil companies' managers to implement
projects with MSIF requirements to the quality of works and materials and to the respecting of the
implementation schedules. This has led to a significant number of contracts, in which the contractors
were not able to finish the microproject. A large number of contracts were cancelled due to incapacity of
contractors to finish microproject. The second caused problem consisted in a large number of repeated
tenders. The lack of sufficient number of companies, the errors in bidding documents, and their attempts
to control tenders (make agreements between the tenders participants) has caused this problem.

-     The uncertainty in the procedure of VAT payment created problems to contractors. The MSIF was
not paying VAT to contractors, because it was the GoM contribution. On the other hand, contractors
were buying materials with VAT. Contractors experienced problems with recovery of VAT from the
Governmental budget. For the contractors having only MSIF contracts, this was a serious obstacle in
their development. At the end of the project this problem was solved, but contractors suffered from this.

Component 2. Strengthened Children's Social Development and Deinstitutionalization.

      Children's Social Development Component aimed at financing innovative and reforming
microprojects oriented towards the prevention of abandonment and institutionalization of children,
providing of new options of alternative care for the children at risk, their re-integration in family and
society. The Program was promoted and implemented in all the rural and urban localities of the
Republic of Moldova. The emphasis was done in the course of the implementation of microprojects on
the piloting of methods of microprojects promotion, identification, selection, appraisal, procurement,
implementation and monitoring.




                                                   - 32 -

       The CSD component allowed financial support for following potential directions:

·     Programs for promotion of the children' rights
·     Programs for prevention of abandonment
·     Programs for prevention of institutionalization
·     Programs for development of community services
·     Programs for rehabilitation and integration into the society of disabled children
·     Programs for the support of children during post institutionalization period
·     Programs for de-institutionalization
·     Programs for reformation of institutions
·     Other types of innovative microprojects oriented towards the achievement of the CSD.

         The component was mainly financed by SIDA and contained facility rehabilitation
microprojects ($US500 000), training and specialized technical assistance program (US$375,000), the
rest of activities was financed from IDA credit and DFID grant. The total amount of USD 1,177 million
was used only for microprojects under this objective, while for the training and TA USD 0.35 million
have been used.

         The main achievement under this component follows.

    Two major programs have been implemented in MSIF project: Social Development of Children at
risk, and Social inclusion of children at risk.

1.    Social Development of children at risk

    24 CDS centers have been implemented with MSIF project support, out of which:

-     Day care centers ­ 16;
-     Centers with temporary placement ­ 6;
-     Mixed centers ­ 2.

         These centers were aimed to improve living condition of children at risk and their families
through: creation of community based Social Care Services; ensuring equal opportunities for all the
children, including those with disabilities; prevention of institutionalization.

         Services provided by these centers are grouped in: social care services, psychological assistance,
rehabilitation, pedagogical, logopaedics, medical, legal, temporary placement, hygienic, professional
orientation, sensitizing of public opinion, etc.

         In 2003, these centers had over 2000 beneficiaries, out of which: 578 children with special
educational needs, 504 children at risk, 263 children with disabilities. Significant attention was paid to
training and involvement of the parents. In 2003 year, over 700 parents benefited from such training
(80% of which ­ mothers of the children at risk).

         As a result of activity of these center, 103 children have been integrated in general schools, 34
children were returned back into their communities from residential institutions, 152 children have been
reintegrated in their biological families, 25 in extended families, and 18 - under other form of
Deinstitutionalization. New jobs were created for over 400 specialists and over 100 volunteers.
         Significant training efforts have been done under this component. 69 members of Implementing


                                                  - 33 -

Agencies and Local Public Administration, all the 24 managers of created centers, and 150 specialists of
these centers have benefited of training. The total number of person*days of training provided equals to
10400.

        A case study, reflecting the activity results of the Children Social Development centers created
with MSIF support, is given in Annex 2.

2.   Social inclusion of the children at risk

        The objective of this program was to ensure access to communities' general schools for children
with special educational needs. This is in line with the objective of Moldova strategy "Education for
every child" developed with UNDP assistance.

         5 microprojects have been implemented under this program. Main efforts were channeled
toward: creation of favorable environment for social inclusion of children with special educational needs
(equipment, furniture, adjustment of rooms); training of teachers and parents; and promotion of social
inclusion ideas and increment of consciousness of communities' members. In this direction, 7 workshops
have been conducted, in which 258 persons took part.

        Over 200 children benefited from this program.

        A case study, reflecting the activity results of a Social Inclusion Program, is given in Annex 3.

    Strengths.
-    New models of Social Care Services for children at risk were developed and implemented. These
models show the ability of communities to implement and maintain new types of SCS. Local public
authorities cover all operational the costs and maintenance costs of these CSD centers. According to the
surveys [3], services created with MSIF support are highly appreciated by benefiting children and their
parents.
-    MSIF participated to the development of favorable environment for activity of such centers
through: intensive promotion of deinstitutionalization ideas; participation in the development of legal
framework; and active participation in many task force and working groups acting in this area. Several
national conferences have been undertaken with MSIF support. Several books and many brochures with
analysis and description of these centers have been published.

    Weaknesses.
-    The underdeveloped legal framework in this area has made significant obstacles in the creation and
functioning of such centers. In last few years the situation has been changed, nevertheless it still needs
improvement and adjustment. The principle "Money follows the client" should be implemented.
-    Established at the beginning a community contribution amounting 15% of microprojects budget
has led to significant delays in the implementation of the component. Communities were not able to
contribute with both such significant investment and operating & maintenance costs. After the decrement
of the percentage to 3% the situation has been changed and communities became able to contribute
properly.

Component 3. Capacity Building for Community and Local Government

        This component was essential in support of the project's primary development objective of local
capacity-building and community empowerment. The component targeted community groups, local


                                                 - 34 -

NGOs, local contractors, and local government, with the objective to build skills and relationships, and
foster new community-government partnerships in the management of social and economic
infrastructure. The component included local and foreign training and technical assistance, as well as
workshops and study visits, including to the MSIF PMU. Local governments received specialized
training as members of Implementing Agencies, as well as concerning public sector finance and
management, the management of divested social assets, the role of beneficiary associations and NGOs in
civil society, etc.

             The major results in this area are the following.

               Training and TA. Training and TA were the main tools for capacity building, in the same
time it was understood that they need additional measures in order to achieve full effectiveness. The total
number of persons benefiting from MSIF training and TA equals to 27800. Obviously, MSIF partners
from communities have received intensive training, 100% of mayors, Implementing Agencies and Users
Associations received training in community development and MSIF procedures. 70 Strategic plans for
social-economic development of communities have been developed. In order to ensure a high quality of
training, MSIF trained its own specialists using local and international resources. Over 30 outside /
international trainers were employed in order to conduct training for MSIF staff and for communities.
100% of MSIF staff received significant training in MSIF office and outside.

      Participation/partnership. MSIF considers the involvement of the community members as a
crucial factor in the community development. This led to involvement of a significant number of
persons, which contributed to the implementation of MSIF supported project. Communities were
involved both in project implementation cycle and in the community contribution collection. As result,
communities collected USD 2.4 million of contribution in cash and about USD 1.6 million in kind.
Needs and capacity assessments conducted by MSIF covered all rural communities, which has led to
work in focus groups in all villages. 590 000 villagers participated in decision-taking process during the
conducted general community meetings (1332 GCMs). 22.5% of beneficiaries became members of
Users/Beneficiary Associations. Such a large involvement has led to proven skills to solve community
problems. 59% of monitored microprojects have been extended, while communities initiated and/or
implemented other 950 new projects/programs after MSIF intervention (and without MSIF support).
Special attention was paid to creation of real partnerships between all community actors. Special
training have been delivered to the community actors. The already existent NGOs have been involved in
MSIF activity (136 NGOs). The contractors created within MSIF' s supported microprojects over 16
000 temporary jobs, which not only contributed to the job generation but to the community involvement
too, because 41% of these jobs were given to the community members.

         Institutionalization. For an efficient solving of the community problems and ensuring the
sustainability of rehabilitated facilities, it is necessary to have a developed network of functional
organizations. MSIF has started with the creation of the community-based organizations. 454 Users
Associations were created in order to maintain the rehabilitated facilities, out of which 429 were created
in 415 villages and 25 for the activity in CSD centers. All the villages which implemented microprojects
have created Users Associations. 393 Associations have been registered as NGOs. These Associations
and NGOs can collaborate and exchange their experience through those 4 MSIF' s Beneficiaries
Network, covering over 300 villages as associated members. For activity's facilitation, these networks
have 17 Community Centers. MSIF has regularly issued a newspaper called "Alternative rurale", which
informs the communities about MSIF news, communities' best experience, provides information about
the new opportunities to apply to other donors and upcoming competitions.




                                                  - 35 -

      Motivation. MSIF has undertaken a series of activities in order to keep the interest of the
communities, which implemented microprojects with MSIF support. The main tool of motivation was
the organization of competitions based on performance criteria. The main performance criteria were the
assurance of the sustainability and the extension of the rehabilitated facility, activities toward increment
of partnership, development of civil society, cleanliness and development of community's territory etc.
As an award, MSIF has proposed to sign performance contracts with the most performing communities.
40 performance contracts were signed for a period of 2 years, which presumed equal financing both by
MSIF (USD 1000) and by community (1000 USD). All the funds of these contracts were designated for
communities' activities toward the improvement of quality of services provided by the rehabilitated
facility (new school programs, internships, trainings, study tours, etc). Another type of awards was
follow-on microprojects. The most performing communities had the opportunity to implement the second
microproject, which was a serious contribution to community's infrastructure development. 25
follow-on microprojects in infrastructure and 6 educational programs have been implemented on
competitive basis. Significant impact on communities' motivation had the competition for the
distribution of schools furniture and equipment. 7 conducted competitions have allowed more than 200
communities to receive a significant help with school furniture, sport equipment and literature, totaling
over USD 0.5 million. Villagers themselves have mentioned the major impact of such approach: even if
they don't win a prize, in the community remain the results of the activities done as conditions of the
competitions, i.e. developed areas, rehabilitated facilities and pipes, improved hygiene of shallow wells,
etc.

      A case study, reflecting the development of the communities through MSIF project is described in
Annex4.

Strengths.
-     Intensive training and TA provided to the communities' actors and practical application of
knowledge during the implementation of the microprojects, used tools (partnership, involvement,
institutionalization, motivation, etc.) have led to creation of real social capital and development of civil
society in MSIF communities.
-     Communities became enthusiastic with respect to MSIF training methods, competitions and
motivation methods.

Weaknesses.
-     Underdeveloped market of the companies providing consultancy in community development area
has led to significant obstacles in providing of high-quality training and TA. MSIF was enforced to
work with its own specialists and to work toward the development of such a market.

Component 4. Project Management Unit

         The MSIF Project Management Unit (PMU) was responsible for overall project management,
and particularly for: i) promotion of microprojects at the community level, training and technical
assistance to local communities, NGOs, and government; ii) microproject appraisal and supervision (i.e.
follow up) of microproject implementation; and iii) monitoring and evaluation of all the project and
program aspects. The monitoring and evaluation program will be supported in large part through the use
of the MIS.

      The total planned funds for PMU activity have amounted to USD 1.53 million, while the real spent
funds constituted USD 1.12 million, which is only 73% of the planned amount. Although the planned
amounts have not been fully used and constituted only 4.75% of the total project cost, the management

has been undertaken at the required level, all the results planned were reached and the objectives of the
project were achieved.

      Several main reasons of these results can be mentioned: a dedicated, responsible, professional and
well-trained staff worked in a collaborative and well coordinated manner; high level of dedication and
receptiveness on behalf of communities; high level of intellectual capital available in communities; good
enough communication between the PMU and MSIF National Board; highly computerized tools of
project monitoring and supervision, comprising an integrated management/financial information system.

      Strengths.
-     As a result of MSIF implementation, a well-trained and competent team has been formed. The
team can be useful for implementation of other projects and help other Moldova projects to achieve good
results.
-     MSIF became countrywide well-known, communities trust MSIF approaches and competence and
this can be used in order to improve further the work with communities. New, more advanced methods
can be used for further contribution to the development of the social capital, civil society and to poverty
alleviation.

      Weaknesses.
-     Although the percentage of operating cost is low for such type of projects, this was done not only
on the basis of high management skills and professionalism but because of excessive overloading of the
staff, as well. The staff worked up to twelve- sixteen hours a day, very often - including holidays
(without additions to the salary). This leads to a chronic tiredness and corresponding possible
consequences, which is warring in terms of sustainability and in long-term prospective.



III. Evaluation of Borrower and Bank performance

·     Bank

         The overall Bank performance in preparing and supervising the project was Highly Satisfactory.
The project's primary objectives were well defined from the beginning and the project's components fit
well with those objectives and responded to the needs of the country experiencing difficult transition
period. During the project's implementation, the Bank team was very professional and committed,
providing continuous assistance in all the issues related to the implementation, and worked very
efficiently in close contact with the MSIF team and with Government officials. The Bank team
contributed to obtain a significant amount of grants additionally to the IDA credit. Some delays with
disbursements in the first years of the project have been eliminated after negotiations with the Bank
disbursement unit.

·     Borrower

         The Borrower's performance is rated as Satisfactory. Strong Government commitment and
interest was continuously expressed for the MSIF. The valuable endorsement of it is the fact that the
Vice Prime Minister of Moldova is heading the MSIF National Board. The same happened with VAT
for contractors. During the first years contractors had significant problems with recovering the paid
VAT for materials. At the end of the project this problem has been solved. The other problem, which
could be addressed, is that the Government didn't ensure to the MSIF team the working conditions and
spaces, which were stipulated in the agreement.


                                                  - 37 -

        The MSIF Executive Office was the main coordinating unit for Project implementation, and
worked extremely diligently on all the aspects of the project's execution. Following strictly to the
provisions of the Operation Manual allowed the MSIF to avoid numerous (including political) pressures
and difficulties during the Project execution. The Operation Manual was created at the Project pilot
phase with the joint efforts of the Bank's team and MSIF staff. Several changes in the Operational
Manual reflecting the improvements in MSIF working procedures were done during the project
implementation. The MSIF team worked very enthusiastically on project implementation, was dedicated
to ensuring essential community participation in the project, and worked extremely well with the Bank
and with other donors and sponsors who also took part in the project.

IV. Lessons learnt

1.   Changes of national standards and people's attitude have led to significant economic effect.
MSIF project has discovered during its activity that the old heating systems are very inefficient. The
main causes were damaged thermal circuit of the buildings (which led to losses of heating energy during
wintertime) and inefficient national standards in this area (which forbade the placement of heating
stations nearer than 50 meters from the building). After significant efforts and proves the national
standards have been changed and now communities can build the heating station inside the buildings. In
the same time, the community managers realized the importance of the energy conservation measures.
These actions led to decrement of fuel costs per season (2-4 times) with a significant increase of
temperature in classrooms. Taking into account that there are much more public buildings in the
country, this experience should be replicated at the national level.

2.   Rational use of potable water and other natural resources can be achieved through thorough
metering. During the soviet period, the population without any accountability and in many cases ­
without payment used resources including potable water. This created an irresponsible attitude with
respect to such an important resource, like water. In MSIF water projects, one major requirement was to
use water meters for absolutely all households and organizations, which are connected to the water
pipeline. This was a painful requirement especially for poor groups, but the in same time it increased the
responsibility and changed the attitude in water consumption. This practice has been replicated by other
projects and by the Government. Thus, the Government has taken a decision obliging all the social and
public facilities to use meters in water consumptions.

3.   Promotion of alternative Social Care Services made changes in country's social service
policies, former based on residential institutions. As it is shown above, MSIF developed 30
programs/centers oriented in CSD development and de-institutionalization. Massive promotion of
deinstitutionalization and alternative SCS ideas has been undertaken, in partnership with other projects
and programs acting in this area. This led to changes in the legal framework ­ In 2003, the low
regarding the Social Care was approved, in which the alternative SCS have been recognized. Starting
with 2005, such centers are included in the state budget for financing. In the same time, this area needs
further piloting and investigations, which should be done in other projects.

4.   More emphasis on strategic planning and participatory monitoring & evaluation should be
done. MSIF has started to develop community capacities through implementation of one project in the
community. During the project implementation, MSIF team analyzed the experience of community
development and realized that by implementing a separate microproject is not possible to achieve a
sustainable community development. Thus, MSIF has changed its priorities and started to involve the
communities in the development of the strategic development plans in communities. 70 such strategic


                                                 - 38 -

plans have been developed, which led to new skills, holistic vision and developed partnership in the
communities. This experience has been widely spread through MSIF networks. In the same time, MSIF
implemented a new procedure "participatory evaluation of the microproject" which was done before
microproject's financing approval by the MSIF Executive Committee. During the evaluation, large
number of community members study the content of the project and decide on efficiency, effectiveness
and social equity of the microproject. The third aspect of this mechanism is the procedure "defense of
the microproject on behalf of the community" in which the communities' representatives justify the
effectiveness of the required investments and show their understanding of MSIF procedures. The lesson
learnt is that these three tools (strategic planning, participatory monitoring & evaluation and
microproject defense) are very efficient tools in efficient and effective investment utilization and in
capacity building. In next projects a more systematic approach should be applied to the utilization of
these tools. A larger number of strategic plans would highly improve the community capacities. This
should be linked with the communities' capacities to monitor, including participatory monitoring and
evaluation of implementation of strategic plans, lessons learning and adjustment of the plans. Further
development of communities' capacities in microproject analysis and justification of investments
utilization should be planned in the future projects.

5.    MSIF experience was not properly studied and replicated. MSIF has significant experience and
piloted models in the area of community development, savings due to energy conservation, Social Care
Services for vulnerable groups, especially in children social development area. This experience was not
studied and replicated satisfactory. On the other hand, no one another government agency is studying
these areas and a gap in the state policy decisions mechanism is made. Thus, MSIF experience should be
studied and replicated. This would highly contribute to the implementation of EGPRSP.

6.    Development of regional administration and central agencies. Although at the community level
the capacity building achieved good results, at the regional level and central level agencies this was not
done. Some development has been done for the judets (county) administration, but it was not used
because of change of the territorial administrative division of the country. Existing rayon administrations
are very new and inexperienced in community development and service providing. Such a situation leads
to lack of communication and understanding between the local communities and central government.
Thus the development of regional administration and central agencies should be covered by the next
projects.

7.    Transparency and involvement of communities increase the smoothness of the project
implementation and help in fighting and over passing the cases of bureaucracy and lack of transparency.
The main reason is that the "bureaucrats" realize that the community members are in the same time
electorate, and the entire village knows every single word told to the Implementing Agency. The
involvement of communities as partners helps significantly in changes at the central / regional levels.

8.    Other schemes of VAT payment should be assessed and used. During the implementation of
MSIF project, the VAT had to be paid by the government as a part of counterpart contribution. This
meant that in the cases, when the contractors bought materials with VAT applied, this VAT had to be
returned back to the contractors from the state budget. Due to the lack of budget funds available, the
VAT was not returned to the contractors, which caused significant problems to contractors and led some
contractors to bankruptcy. Although during the last year of the project the situation has changed, a more
sustainable mechanism should be used in order to secure the contractors.

9.    Only an absolutely exact, non-indulgent and diligent implementation of project design can lead
to expected results. Only no indulgence (although absolute correctness and transparency) in relation


                                                 - 39 -

with communities can lead to impressive results. During the project implementation, MSIF staff studied
the experience of other community development projects in the country and abroad, where the project
staff (with good intentions) was engaged in collection of community contribution or projects didn't
require community contribution. These cases show that this leads to underdeveloped communities, which
are not able to collect contribution, without sense of ownership, without responsibility and thus - not
able to solve community problems. This negatively contributes to the sustainability and the development
of the social capital. Only by delegating the full responsibility to communities with relevant TA leads to
the empowerment; and every case of decrement of responsibility destroys communities' capacities.

10. Necessity to coordinate actions of all donors and projects in community development. Related
with the previous lesson, this one consists in the necessity to eliminate negative consequences of
uncoordinated donors' actions in following directions: (a) community contribution- MSIF requires 15%
of community contribution, while other projects use much smaller or even no contribution, which
undermine the MSIF efforts in capacity building; (b) procurement procedures and costs ­ MSIF has a
policy to use credit and grant funds as efficiently as possible, while other projects neglecting
procurement rules and market prices lead to unjustified increasing of the contract costs. These rules
should be applied to the governmental agencies, as well.

11. A real development of communities and creation of social capital can be obtained through the
following complex of measures/tools: Training and TA (Formal workshops, round tables, informal,
hand-on trainings, study visits in other communities and exchange of experience), community
involvement (participation, partnership, take responsibility, obtaining result and assess the result with
conclusions and lessons learnt); motivation (competitions, even if communities are very poor, these
community can be separated in a priority class, but between them to have competition, at least one out
of 10-20 communities should be eliminated to keep the community motivated).

12. SIFs contain effective built-in tools of poverty alleviation. SIF approaches, including community
participation, demand driven approach, significant community contribution, etc. make an efficient and
effective tool for poverty alleviation, because the community is able to contribute properly only when
really the most stringent problem is targeted and the solution of the problem which has impact on the
highest number of beneficiaries. Involvement of community members in procurement procedures and
construction works monitoring leads to a high civil works quality and efficient use of funds.

13. The sustainability of microprojects can be achieved trough: training and TA, communities'
participation and partnership, institutionalization and motivation (see p. V below and component 3
"community capacity building").

14. Psychological help. One of the most significant impacts of MSIF was the psychological help to
rural population: increased trust in their future in a difficult period of depression, change of attitude of
the population on the ownership and maintenance of public facilities (change of soviet mentality),
increased responsibility and confidence in own forces, confidence in their capacities to solve other
community problems in partnership.

15. The quality of civil works was high. This was mentioned by the procurement and technical audits.
It is important to understand the causes of this success. Achievement of such a high level was possible
through correct utilization of competition procedures, extensive, diligent and non-indulgent monitoring
on behalf of MSIF staff and involvement of communities in microprojects implementation monitoring,
use of penalties for low quality of works and for delays. The further improvement of the quality can be
achieved through further development of the design companies market, improvement of skills of the


                                                  - 40 -

appraisal engineers and of the communities.

16. Problems with contractors' market. In the same time, the project felt a lack of construction
companies. Underdeveloped civil construction market was not able to provide enough number of
qualified companies. Skilled civil construction workers have left the country. Some tenders have been
repeated several times, up to 8-9 times. Some companies, which won tenders, were not able to finish the
microprojects with a satisfactory quality. Thus the number of penalties for delays was significant, which
leads to negative impact on contractors. In order to address this in the future, a better consultation of the
contractors when setting up contract duration should be done, and more responsibility to give to
communities in monitoring the implementation schedule.

17. Lack of civil construction workers should be recovered at the state level. As we mentioned
above, the most skilled civil construction workers has left the country, and the contractors are not able to
start immediately the implementation of the new microprojects, significant delays cause repeated
tenders. This is remarked not only in MSIF activity, but countrywide too. The agriculture has not
enough tractor operators, drivers, cattlemen, etc. The current tendency to receive a university degree is
very good; in the same time a significant number of young people has no further education such as trade
schools, vocational schools. The state should start an advertisement company of such professions; study
the possibility to open (or recover the former existing) such schools.

18. The restricted list of typologies narrowed the creative approach on behalf of communities. The
project team met many cases, when the communities proposed some obviously stringent and useful
microproject, which MSIF was not able to implement because the typology of the proposed microproject
was not included in the restricted list of typologies, which MSIF was allowed to finance. AT that period
of time, when the MSIF project was designed, it was a positive aspect of the project, because it defended
the MSIF staff against political pressures. In the same time it restricted the creativeness of communities
and narrowed the spectrum of the problems solved. In the next projects, it is advisable to enlarge the
typology list or use an open list (indicating only typologies, which the project can't support and finance).

19. Balance between the human factor and project performances should be revised. The project has
achieved significant results and impact, recognized by the government, audits, communities and
partners. In the same time it was done with a very low percentage of the operational costs. This was
done not only due to the high professionalism and management skills, but also due to overloading the
staff. In log-term prospective, such an approach is not sustainable and a more human factor oriented
balance should be found, without influencing the final result. The balance between the salary and efforts
should be revised, as well.



V.    Sustainability

         The sustainability of the rehabilitated facilities is high. All the rehabilitated facilities are
     functioning and maintained satisfactory. All the microprojects have Users Associations, which (this
     has been mentioned above) continued to extend the rehabilitated facilities ­ 59%, and other 950 new
     projects started without MSIF support, but based on the experience gained in the collaboration with
     MSIF. 22% of beneficiaries became members of these Users Associations and are constantly in
     contact with MSIF news, community events

         The sustainability of the rehabilitated facilities was ensured through workshops on sustainability
     methods, post-implementation monitoring, motivation through competitions, institutionalization of


                                                   - 41 -

    Users Associations, MSIF beneficiaries' networks development and further communication through
    networks, newspapers, TV/radio, etc. In each village there are enough capacities to solve other
    community problems. These capacities are maintained by MSIF staff, which monitors the
    microprojects at least 2 years after the final hand over. The competitions generate an impact even
    when the communities win nothing ­ the results of the competition conditions (such as developed
    territory, improved ecology, repaired classrooms) remain in the village.

         Already described above, the mechanism of institutionalization aimed to empower the
    communities' sustainability consisted in the creation of 454 Community Based Organizations, out of
    which about 300 villages are associated in 4 beneficiaries networks and having 17 community
    centers for information dissemination, replication and exchange of experience.

                             Annex 1: Case study ­ Rehabilitation of Mladinesti School.

         In order to have a broader impression regarding the impact of MSIF microprojects let's study a
typical example. 253 children attend the school located in Mladinesti village, Hancesti rayon. The status
in this school before the implementation of the microproject financed with MSIF resources used to be
the following. The roof was leaking, fact that caused rotten appearance on walls. The destroyed linoleum
has caused destruction of concrete on the floors. Thus, during breaks children used to raise unbearable
dust clouds. The schools used to spend huge quantities of fuel - an average amount of 200 tons of coal
per one heating season - due to the fact that the boilers had a low efficiency and were located far from
school and the windows and doors could not be properly sealed during winter. Although expenditures for
heating during winter were high the highest temperature in classes used to be up to 11 - 12 degrees C,
which required that children stay with their coats on during lessons. The administration of the school had
to size down the length of the lessons. Lately the boilers were not working at all, due to the electricity
supply cut off. In March, year 2000, an inspection indicated that 30% of children had illnesses caused
by the low temperature during winter.

(Note: Although the conditions were hard, the teachers kept working and didn't quit the school. In
Moldova cases when teachers leave to work abroad - in a legal or illegal way - are very frequent. There,
they take care of the elderly or children for a "miserable" salary, which is from 15 to 30 times bigger
than the salary they receive in their school.)

         The community has implemented with MSIF support a school renovation microproject, which
envisaged repair of the roof, energy conservation measures, efficient room use and the rehabilitation of
the heating system by replacement of the water pumping with electric pumps to use of the gravity
system. The total cost of the microproject constituted 350,000 lei (28,000 US dollars) out of which
40,000 lei went to the heating system and 14,000 lei to the energy conservation measures. The
community invested 18% of the total cost of the microproject. Encouraged by the MSIF assistance, the
community has additionally repaired with its own efforts and its own materials all classrooms that
remained uncovered by the MSIF investment. The additional community investment constituted
approximately 20,000 lei.

         As a result of rehabilitation of the school the coal consumption decreased from 200 tons to 60
tons per heating season, the cost difference being 100,000 lei and decrement is 3,3 times. One can see
that the costs to do conservation measures and conversion of heating system are returned during one half
of the winter. In order to indicate how important is this saving we will also indicate that the annual
salary of all school employees constitutes 80,000 lei here. Besides these savings the temperature in
classes raised to 18 - 19 degrees C, fact that for the first time since the school existence, made possible
that children take off their coats in wintertime.

         The impact of these changes has been immediately felt. The first (after rehabilitation) year only
one teacher out of 18 teachers could not attend lessons due to sickness, compared with 17 teachers who
were ill previous year (before the project). 5% children* hours were absent from school during the
after-project half year, compared to 12% during the same period of before-project year. Another
significant indicator is failure in school performances. Seven children had negative performance during
the after-project half of the year compared to 14 children during the similar period of before-project
year.

    Members of PTA state that the main impact of the microproject was the change of people's attitude


                                                 - 43 -

towards the solution of community's problems. Before the implementation of the microproject almost
100% of people in the village were skeptical with respect to reality of implementation of such a project.
At present the situation changed considerably. About 100% of village inhabitants are available to
contribute with additional efforts and to participate to the solution of problems. Although the Parents
and Teachers Association started its activity recently, so far they managed to collect 4,600 lei. They
invited parents to contribute with 3 lei per month on behalf of each family (not per child!) to set up a
fund of the association. Actually, this is an educational moment rather than a financial one. There were
cases when children contributed themselves with money gained during grape harvesting, because their
parents refused to contribute this money for different reasons.

                   Annex 2: SOMATO Center: An Idea Against the Institutionalization

    SOMATO center, situated in Balti city, is a day care and temporary placement center, which started
its activity in September 2000. The cost of the microproject funded by MSIF was about 56 thousand
USD, out of which the community contribution was 3% and with all the operational & maintenance
costs. Additional funds the center received from Soros Foundation. The objective of the center is
psychosocial rehabilitation, re-integration and re- socialization of children over 14 years with mental
problems. The services delivered are: occupational therapy (collage in plasticine and gypsum, theatre,
dancing), psycho-professional consulting, treatment and alimentation, temporal (up to 3 months)
placement. The capacity of the center is 25 persons for day care center and 13 for temporal placement.

    The registered results are: 109 children benefited from this center. During the period of 3 year the
center provided 1800 consultations. The number of clients and services provided are in continuous
increment.

The old idea is realized

         Those who arrive here learn continuously a lesson of the life. They learn to respect the hygiene,
to wash their clothes, to cook and to make the bed. These are elementary things, but they must make an
effort in order to learn it. Other activities, more attractive are the drawing, collage, and pantomime
theatre, dancing. Additionally, the girls learn to sew, and the boys ­ to make utile tools for the house.
The Day Center's beneficiaries are fed 4 times per day and the beneficiaries of the Centers for temporal
placement are fed 5 times per day. Another service, very useful, is the medical treatment free of charge,
which every beneficiary needs. This is very important, because the drugs they could not buy due to luck
of money made them to spend in the hospitals several months per year.

      The actual formula of the Centre is an old idea of Mrs. Jana Chihai, psychologist by profession. "I
was worrying that these people spend too much time in some hospitals which may not offer them a free
of charge treatment, except some maintenance courses, which did not improve the situation of the sick
person. In this way, they were degrading as personality. In the same time, these persons are not welcome
in their own families, becoming till the end a hard supported burden. As result, the sick people are
hospitalized into hospitals, where from they arrive to the hostel. In this way is produced the
institutionalization of this category of people."

      The danger of the institutionalization made Mrs. Jana Chihai and her team to submit to SOROS
Foundation a project to create the actual Center. And the Foundation proved to be receptive at their
request. Some time later, after a long while of activity, the "Somato" Center initiated a welcome
collaboration with the mayor's office from Balti municipality, which offered them the actual building for
a period of 15 years, without any payment for rent. By the way, the 50% of the operational costs of the
Center will be supported by the mayor's office.

      The building offered was one of the kindergarten's blocks, which did not work for 2 years. But the
building was in an emergency state and it could not be used then. At that stage, the administration of the
Center found reasonable to address MSIF a financial proposal in order to rehabilitate the building. In the
shortest possible time, this kindergarten' block was adjusted to the needs of a modern health Center.
Through this project, the building was repaired and new furniture was provided. Also, the Center's staff
was trained. As result of the project implemented in collaboration with MSIF, the capacity of the Day
Center will increase up to 40 persons.

      The most known event of the year

        The most known event of the year connected with "Somato", more famous even than the
opening itself of this institution, was the wedding party of 2 beneficiaries of the Centre, Sergiu and Olga,
who met each other here, liked each other and made their wedding party also here. It was a very
beautiful love story, they hold their hands all the day and helped each other. Their wedding party lasted
for 3 days, like the fiancé dreamed about. On Saturday the registration of the marriage was made at the
civilian registry office, an on Monday it was celebrated with the colleagues from "Somato" and with
many press reporters. In Balti it was the most known event of the year.

      Olga told that it was love from the first sight. When she saw Sergiu she asked somebody to
introduce them each other. "We met during 2 years, we walked near the lake, with the boat, and now we
are waiting with impatience a child. He would like a baby girl, as regards me ­ it does not matter. The
most important is that the child be healthy.

      Now, within a project supported by UNICEF, "The Children have equal rights" the beneficiaries of
the Center "Somato", together with the volunteers from here, go to the "Child's house" where they learn
to communicate with those who have the same problems as they do.

Exception may become a rule
Natalia Slusari
Principle of the school ­ kindergarten nr. 120, Chisinau city

         Calin was benefiting of the services of the most modern center for rehabilitation and
recuperation for children with severe locomotors deficiencies. A well equipped institution, trained
staff at long term international stages in well-known institutions, modern methods of recuperation,
and didactical personnel from different spheres in order to cover the special learning needs of the
children. But... the link between the boy and the external world remained limited, the effect of
de-socialization and dependence on the system, norms and rules of the respective institution was
going to become a threat for his further integration into community. And the child, once arrived at
that stage of recuperation, in order to go ahead, needed a new condition. His mother knew about it
and had the courage to satisfy his needs to be together with the children of the same age, who were
studying in the general school. Their choice stopped on our school, nr. 120 from Chisinau.

         The first school day was a real holiday for Calin and his family. He was coming to school
sitting on wheel chair and supported by social assistant. Here he discovered a new world, so familiar
to the persons of his age. Calin desired to learn to move like the other children, within the
accessibility limits. He wished it so much that he protested always to sit down in his wheel chair
counting more on the assistant's support. And he succeeded. In spite of the prognostics, even those
happier made by the doctors. The challenge of the school atmosphere where he came was decisive in
this sense. During the period of 4 school years Calin had many such wins. Calin's story is a happy
one. And we are proud we had the courage to open the school towards the inclusion, offering to the
child the chance to live this happiness.

     Social inclusion is a necessary requirement of the general education, but this did not become a rule
in our behavior. We are just at the stage of "building the way" and creation of the context in order to
include into the law the concept of inclusive school. The acceptance of the idea to promote the inclusive
education in our school was a progressive decision. We were confident we assumed a big responsibility
both for the children with special educational needs, their families and for children and families we were
working already. The changes which should be done affected the whole school. A qualitative inclusive
education supposes:

·     An adequate culture of the school;
·     An atmosphere of non-segregation and marginalization which should be at school level and not
      only in the inclusive class;
·     Conditions to produce changes and modifications of the physical space, adaptations which would
      satisfy the complex needs of the children with special educational needs;
·     Potential and professional skills of the didactic collective in association with the team spirit;
·     Assurance with services offered by specialized persons in professional approach to this category of
      children with disabilities with whom they work.

     At the moment, 8 children with locomotor cerebral infirmities are visiting our school in the
framework of inclusion program. These children have been integrated very well. Individual plans have
been developed for each of the children and we put the main attention not on the school results but rather
on the integration in the society.

                        Annex 4: Zorile Village: Community Capacity Development

which 580 women and 580 children. The public infrastructure consists of a school, kindergarten, mayor
office, health post with drugstore, postal office, police post, and telephone station. At the beginning of
MSIF activity in this village all of these facilities needed rehabilitation.

    The village started collaboration with MSIF in 2000 through the submission of an application to
rehabilitate the water pipeline, which was not functioning at that moment. The decision to rehabilitate
the water pipeline was taken by the villagers in the General Community meeting.

    After the submission of the microproject application, the village started receiving all package of
training at regional and local level.

    Training and TA. A wide range of topics have been provided to Zorile villagers:

-     How to organize a village for a microproject implementation,
-     How to organize a general community meeting;
-     Role of the Implementing Agencies and Local public administration in the implementation of a
microproject with MSIF support;

-     Community partnership;
-     Activity in MSIF beneficiaries' network;
-     Study visits, etc.

         The villagers reported a series of seminars conducted both by MSIF specialists and by MSIF
hired companies: 4 three-day workshops conducted by Contact Center, 5 one-day workshops in regional
center, a series of workshops were conducted in Chisinau where the mayor and other community
members were invited.

      The village was the study base for one regional workshop in sustainable community development,
in which 120 persons were involved (mayors, cadastre specialists, local NGOs) from the central zone of
the country.

      The mayor invited other NGOs providing training, such as ANTEM ONG (5-day workshop on the
development of small business, which have been attended by 20 villagers), USAID financed workshops
in community development, public hearings. Now the mayor intends to invite an NGO to elaborate a
strategic development plan of the community.

Over 100 community members attended workshops and trainings.

Results. The community with and without MSIF support achieved the following results.
